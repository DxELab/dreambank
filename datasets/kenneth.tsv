"0001"	"(01/04/1996)"	"Disease Room I am with my friend Kevin in a small room with a long rectangular table. There is a television in an upper corner of the room. It is on. My classmate Ned Stallone is a security guard. He walks by, stops, and enters. He has a mask over his mouth. I think there is a disease somewhere. It may be in our room, or somewhere else. There is a boy sitting at a table with us. He's eating a huge bowl of fruit and ice cream, which came in rectangular chunks. Ned tells us to meet at 8:30 in Major Hall Dormitory."
"0002"	"(01/04/1996)"	"Grade Preview I am with Larry Rollie and we're driving in Kevin's car to a cabin where my dad and Lisa are. We drive past a bar called the High Life. Nan Lawson and his friend are there with my dad and Lisa, and they're all swimming. We park the car. By the time it's parked, they're done swimming and are walking up towards the cabin. My dad says jokingly, with his characteristic laugh, that he's sorry I didn't do as well as I wanted. He thinks I've already found out my grades, but I haven't. Then I realize the school has sent my grades home and my dad knows what I got. I ask him. He tells me I got 12 points, meaning 4 B's, with 3.0 grade points for each. I go nuts. I fall on the ground and swear and hit the grass with my fists. I'm pissed off. My friend Esther Thurman's car is there. I'm on the ground next to it. Esther and my friend Marybeth Neumann come to console me. Part of my anger is acting. My old basketball teammate Carl Everson is there. I ask him if he can relate to my dilemma, because he did really well in high school. He says that college is harder."
"0003"	"(01/04/1996)"	"Lake By Terrace Green I am going fishing with my friend Tiny Combs at the lake by the Terrace Green supper club near Wilmerton. We drive over the bridge and one of us motions to the spot where we are going to meet later. I realize it's getting dark and that I don't have lights for my boat. Tiny says he has some lights. I tell him we need different colored lights: one red, one white, and one blue. He says he has something that will work. We put the boat in. Once it's in I'm having major trouble steering. I want to go backwards, but I can't control the motor. The boat keeps going in circles, and I get frustrated. The motor is still running, and I pick it up off the back of the boat. The prop is tilted so to propel the boat downwards. I go underwater. My clothes are heavy. I am wearing flippers, and still holding the motor. Something tells me to kick my feet and I will go the surface. I do, but I don't see the surface. I want to turn the motor to propel me up. I don't feel any panic. I may realize I'm dreaming, but nothing becomes of it."
"0004"	"(01/05/1996)"	"Green I am mixing white and black with green paint to give different shades and hues of the color green."
"0005"	"(01/05/1996)"	"Sunglasses I am in a room with some long tables covered with white tablecloths. The tables are set for some type of dinner. There is a man there with slick sunglasses. I have my two pairs of sunglasses. I leave them on the table. He looks at them and tries them on, but doesn't like them."
"0006"	"(01/05/1996)"	"Water Tower Stephen and I are at our college, Brimson, but it's different. There is a sloping hill and a Tom Thumb store. We are throwing or shooting firecrackers. We throw one at a kid. He tosses it inside a nearby building, through a little hole. It blows up, breaking down the wall of the building. Stephen and I go into a small door. The room we go into is large and bare. It's painted completely blue with rust patches all over. The room is then the top of a mushroom cloud water tower. Gino Teavor is there. There is a door on the other side of the room, straight across from the door we entered. I go to the far door and carefully peer out. It is a long way to the ground. I lay down and put my head out the doorway. There is another building with an old blue rusted top. I look out the other door. There is a police car below with its lights on. I look below my feet. There is a grate with rung steps going down the center of the water tower. Outside there is a rope going down the side of the tower. If I go outside the police might shoot me. So I take the grate off and start climbing down, going as fast as I can. I don't know if Stephen or Gino follow. When I get to the bottom of the tower, I fight with a fat police officer. I think the other officer is hurt. Stephen and Gino aren't there, or they are bystanders. I throw a hollow metal tube about 6 feet long at this officer. I miss. He throws it back, and I dodge it. He jumps up as I swing, and it goes under his feet."
"0007"	"(01/06/1996)"	"The Grease Pit I go to the Grease Pit to see my friend Matt and get some food. I walk up to the place from outside and say ""hey"" to Matt. He says ""hey"" back. I see a lady in a white shirt that I think is his supervisor. Then I'm inside the building. Matt and I talk and he asks me if I want any food. I don't know if he means free food, like usual, or not, since the lady is there. She is frying mushrooms in a fryer instead of French Fries. There is a line up of cars but neither of them are doing much. They take one order and I hand it to a guy through he drive up window after about five minutes. The man is angry and asks me a question. I answer honestly and he speeds around the building to ask the white-skirted lady the same question, only to get the same answer. Matt and I talk about trading subs for burgers, but I don't know what kind, or what size, sub I have. They are closing, and the woman is sweeping the floor in back. The cars are still lined up."
"0008"	"(01/06/1996)"	"Grandma's Apples I'm at grandma Redding's house, in the kitchen with both grandma and grandpa. Grandpa is slicing apples into a pie. They're brown and soggy, but crispy when you bite into them. I'm eating an apple. Grandpa says something about a chicken defecating on its chicks in some class he took. I identify with him, saying I took a class nearly the same, but nothing happened with chickens. I walk past the entrance of grandma and grandpa's room. The door is open and the bed is shaggily made: grandpa is getting older and doesn't bother to tuck in the edges. My mom walks out of the entrance hall into their room. She is wearing only a sweater. It goes down over her hips. It looks like she is wearing only that. She asks grandma and grandpa to borrow a pair of pants, because she's cold. I say she can borrow on of mine, that I'll have one that will fit. My mom is running in a race later that night."
"0009"	"(01/06/1996)"	"Pale Man There is a man coming towards my head, in space it seems. He is growing larger as he gets closer. He has dark hair and a brown suit on. He is pale."
"0010"	"(01/06/1996)"	"Run Stairs I decide I want to strengthen my knee muscles by running stairs in my dormitory, Franklin Hall. So I do. The stairs area all wooden and get narrower as you get towards the top. It's hard to even squeeze through some places because it's so narrow. I get to the top. The building is swaying side to side. I know I'm on the 4th floor and it's swaying the most here. It is not swaying as much on the 3rd floor. The wooden floor is like grandpa and grandma's old upstairs hallway. It's 2:00am, and there are people crashed on the floor because they're drunk. I step over them. There is a head master lady, who is an old Russian woman sitting at a desk. I think she's drunk. I enter a door after I pass the Russian lady. I am in grandma Redding's old plant room. There is a kid there who plays soccer; Kevin Nielson I think, and I think he's drunk too. He tells me he saw me score a goal. I tell him I don't play soccer. We are down by the exit door to the plant room, and we go outside. There is a pack or bunch of wolf-like dogs outside. They start chasing Kevin. I yell at the dogs. They turn toward me and I run. I am ready to kick the dog coming directly towards me when it jumps at me, but it doesn't jump. All the dogs come close and are snarling at me, ready to attack. I wake up, but am not really afraid."
"0011"	"(01/06/1996)"	"Hannah at BCU I'm in my talking to Hannah Reed on the telephone. We talk about her school, BCU. A coach of hers is quitting, but is going to help her cheat somehow. In a stern voice I say, ""Hannah"". I ask her if she has had sex. She is surprised and laughs a little, saying, ""What???!"", but then concedes that she has. She says something about giving all her male friends fellatio. I think to myself that she never gave me fellatio."
"0012"	"(01/07/1996)"	"Hilary's Mother I'm at my house in Oak Valley. The lights are off, and it's nearly dark outside. I'm on my uncle Vev Redding's bed. There is a CD in. It's Bob Mould's Black Sheets of Rain playing, but it's sort of a mix. On the CD there is the shape of the Hot Wheels logo, with words on it. I think it says Bob Mould, but I'm not sure. I'm going to masturbate lying on the bed. The phone rings. I go to pick it up. It's Hilary Nano's mother. My friend Simon Naver picks up the phone from the basement. He's either really drunk or stoned. I think he's hung over. I tell Simon that he's at my house, that this is Kenneth (speaking). He hangs up. Hilary's mother is worried and asks where she is. I tell her they left a while ago, and Hilary should be home in a couple hours. The other phone lines keep ringing. I hear them in the basement, and keep clicking over to answer the calls. It's my sister Heather or her friends. They're distracting me from talking to Hilary's mother. When I click back, Hilary's brother says hi. They are worried about her."
"0013"	"(01/07/1996)"	"Checkpoint I'm at the Uptown shopping mall and I buy a big brown short-sleeved shirt with some strips on it. I go out the JC Penny back doors. I ride in a car with a family. There is a lady driving with an infant on her lap. Two girls are in the back with me. A boy is in the front passenger side. We go by the liquor store. The baby kisses its mother, using its tongue. The mother kisses back, with tongue. At the corner of Main Street and Oak Avenue we are stopped. On the corner there where Nantucket's furniture store is there is a checkpoint. They are checking for a disease or a problem. I know I have been to this place before in a previous dream. They take my photograph while telling me to look at a small black plastic card with some numbers on it. I am sitting across from a woman who has blue hair. Her hair is short, and in a messy, dreadlock-type look, all bunched up in places, pinched together. She has fishhooks all over her head and in her ears. They are stuck in her hair. I think of telling her that once I pierce my ears with fishhooks, but I don't. The workers there want to turn on a television. The radio is already playing. They give me an identification card. It's black and white and fuzzy. The photo on the card isn't me. The name on the card isn't mine. There is a sort of code on the back, like a UPC code, I think that is where the cardholder information is."
"0014"	"(01/07/1996)"	"Orion I am biking on my old little red Huffy bike down 26th Ave in Wilmerton towards Scott Junior High. It's nearly pitch black and the stars are marvelous. I can't see the road at all and am worried that I'll hit a big pothole and flip over. But I'm not paying attention to the road anyways. I cross Roundabout Way and as I do Elise Rooks drives by in her blue car. I want to yell to her but I don't. I think about going out to my girlfriend Annie's house even though I know she's at school. I can see the constellation Orion really well."
"0015"	"(01/07/1996)"	"Underground Garden I'm with my brother Wally in my dad's car driving to my dad's house. It's a different house. It's dark and Wally is driving down the alley. There is snow and snow banks on the ground. Wally starts turning the car around in weird directions. I ask him what he's doing, but then he pulls into the driveway perfectly. We get out of the car. It's daytime and there is no snow on the ground: it's summer. I walk from the driveway onto the grass. Wally warns me to not walk there, but I do anyway. I fall through the grass, which is actually a thin covering for my dad and Lisa's underground greenhouse-type area. My dad and Wally also fall through. They yell and scream at me in their characteristic ways, saying they warned me and that it's my fault. This is true: I didn't heed the warning. The greenhouse is about four feet deep, and there are wooden 2x4's supporting the grass above in various places. The spot that we fell through is a portion of this area. There is an old dirty window with a lot of yellow jacket bees swarming and crawling on it. There are some broken boards from where we fell, and I try to fix them. We can't really stand up because we'd break the grass ""roof"" again. Lisa comes out of the house. I think she is mixing cookie dough. She is mad, but of course, doesn't really show her anger."
"0016"	"(01/08/1996)"	"Bike Ride into Perkins I ride a bike into a Perkins restaurant. I dodge a table and brush up against a lady on the end. I stop my bike in a corner of the restaurant. There are many people from my high school, a year younger than I, that are there. As I get off my bike they notice my short hair. We joke and engage in small talk. I say that I have to go talk to Annie. I walk down a little ramp and over to a booth where my girlfriend Annie, friends Nelson Eastman, Simon Naver, and others are. I shake Nelson and Simon's hand, asking how its' going. Then I slide into the booth, which is a semicircle, and sit next to Annie. I kiss her and she kisses me. I feel awkward kissing her in front of everyone. She starts kissing and licking on my left ear. It feels good. I kiss her neck and mouth. We pause; I think I should order food. The waitress hands us menus. Everyone orders, I am last. I can't decide what to get, and then think that I want the Blockbuster. I turn to the menu page on the menu where it is, but see that when you order it you get a hamburger, not pancakes, eggs, and hash browns. I see that and don't want it. I think I may have ordered the breakfast blockbuster, but I don't know."
"0017"	"(01/08/1996)"	"Night Fishing I am fishing in my boat. It is nighttime, maybe very early morning. The stars and moon are brilliant, and the horizon is a pink glow from the rising sun. I don't have any lights on my boat. I know I've been to the lake before, but I can't put a name on it. The shape of the lake was odd. The lake was calm. I am trolling backwards to my fishing destination. My hands dangle off the back of the boat, and I am holding a tube of Clearasil. I drop it, but it floats. I turn the boat around to pick it up. A big bass jumps ahead of me and to the right. I see it. It was floating near the surface of the water, looking almost dead. Its head was near the surface and its tail submerged. I trolled over it. It was a monster largemouth bass, at least 10 pounds, absolutely huge! I was going to reach in and grab it by the mouth, but I didn't and it swam away. I am then in a stream with clear shallow water, and it is daytime. I'm trying to hit the fish with an oar to kill it, but it quickly swims away."
"0018"	"(01/08/1996)"	"Stab a Moving Squirrel There is a squirrel on a flat surface. It is moving in a small semicircle-like path, less than a couple feet in diameter. There is a point on the back of the squirrel's neck that I am trying to stag with a needle-like rod. The squirrel moves, and then stops, and then moves again. I stab it when it stops."
"0019"	"(01/09/1996)"	"Wally's New Minivan (My recollection of this dream was prompted when I saw a minivan today on the road.) I am in the Crossroads Shopping Mall parking lot with my mom. We are leaving in the car. My brother Wally is there, and is driving a minivan. I ask my mom where Wally got the minivan. She says that he bought it. I ask how he can afford it, and my mom says that she doesn't know. We drive out of the parking lot."
"0020"	"(01/09/1996)"	"Blossom Home for Lunch I dreamed about the characters from the television show ""Blossom"". Blossom's father is in the kitchen with a woman. It's around lunchtime. They are going to have sex. Blossom and her boyfriend come home over the lunch hour, but not to eat. The father says to the woman something like, ""How are people going to know we love each other if we don't prove it?"" He is implying that they prove it by having sex. Meanwhile, in the living room, Blossom is hearing the same words from her boyfriend. He is a physically small, unsure, afraid kid. Blossom is in her pajamas. I see the potential trouble: the father and woman friend are going to walk through the living room to get to the bedroom. Blossom and her boyfriend will be there, and will get into trouble."
"0021"	"(01/09/1996)"	"Cards on New Year's Eve I'm with a group of people, including Nat Miller and Yvonne Zellers. We're sitting in someone's living room in a big circle, playing cards. I'm dealing a poker game. I put the jokers on the bottom of the deck. I'm going to cheat and deal them to me. We must be playing Baseball because 3's and 9's are wild. I have this horrible tasting stuff in my mouth; it might be vinegar. We talk about the money used in Britain, pounds. Someone says that the exchange rate is 20 pounds for one US dollar. I have a quarter, so that's five pounds. The cards are dealt. I have a good hand, but we are all just joking around, not playing serious poker. People go to the door to leave. My mom is there, she says goodbye to them. I show them my hand before they go. I have ten 10's, consisting of five natural 10's, two of which are the 10 of spades, three 9's and two 3's. The deck is a mix of all different cards, like I used for playing Canasta as a kid. As they leave, I realize it's New Year's Eve."
"0022"	"(01/10/1996)"	"Catching a German Shepard I'm ice fishing with my friends Stephen Ramos and Rachel Steiner in my other friend Kevin Simpson's ice fishing house. We call it the ""beer house"". The house is sitting in the middle of the intersection of highway 50 and 6th Avenue in Oak Valley, near Gino Teavor's house. There are four ice-fishing holes in the house, whereas normally there are two. Stephen's rod is a normal size fishing rod, and is sitting outside the house, propped up, like in carp fishing. He gets a bite. His rod tip bends as the slack line peels out. I quickly grab his rod and yell to Stephen that I think there is a big carp on his line. The ice is then gone, and we are in a swampy, marshy area with a little bit of open water. The carp makes a strong run, and I run after it, while letting line out so it doesn't snap, as well as taking line in to keep the line tight. I walk down by the viaduct. Stephen yells that there is a big dog on the end of the line! It is a German Shepard, and it's mad! I slip and fall into the swamp up to my waist. The dog makes a run directly at me. It steps up on a little bed of weeds and growls at me while I squirm in the muck to get into a defensive position."
"0023"	"(01/10/1996)"	"Chevy Truck Commercial A white truck is driving on a snowy, slushy, partially frozen road. This is a Chevy truck commercial. A man says, ""What are you gonna do when your herd of cattle run across a snow bank?"" He's implying that a Chevy can drive across it. I have a picture of the cattle in my mind. I thought the truck would cross over onto a different area using a passage, but it doesn't. It keeps going, and is then on a 2-lane road, which changes to a 4-lane road. Two semi trucks move into he fast lane and the white truck passes these on the right. There is a gunfight. The back window of the truck is shot out. The Joker is sitting in a chair in a room. Madonna is there. She has control. The Joker may be injured. Madonna isn't wearing any underwear. She comes over to him and crawls over a desk in front of him, turning around so her ass is closest to him. Her skirt is pushed up and her ass is visible. She is going to sit on his lap. I think they have sex. I want to have sex with her. I'm with my sisters Heather and Ramona. We're in a room and there is a television on. I'm having sex with Ramona. She is lying on her stomach and I'm on top of her. I thrust until I feel like I will come. I realize I can't get my sister pregnant and I'm not wearing a condom so I pull my penis out and tell her to perform fellatio. She doesn't know what to do, and I can tell she has never done that before. Football is on television."
"0024"	"(01/10/1996)"	"Little Girls Delivering Morning Paper I'm at my mom's house in Oak Valley. It is winter, and is early in the morning. Two minivans pull up in front of the house. I walk out to the vans with no shirt on. A girl gets out of the first van. I walk over to the second van. The girl's parents say that she isn't going to deliver the paper this morning because something is wrong with her; she's sick. I ask the parents if they know the route so I can call them if I have trouble delivering the papers. I go back inside and eat turkey and bread. I say that this shouldn't happen to my mom, who is their piano teacher."
"0025"	"(01/10/1996)"	"Mr. Smith's Good Catch A man gets back from ice fishing. He is older but quite competent, and reminds me of Mr. Smith who lives on 8th Avenue and 1st Street in Oak Valley. He has five clear plastic bags filled with frozen fish. I guess that he has 47 fish there. Then I think that there must be more. He's putting them into the freezer. I help him do this, and I comment that these are some big fish, particularly the pinfish. He also has northern pike and Walleye in his catch. I ask him how he does so well, and he says that he hooks the worms through the back of the neck."
"0026"	"(01/11/1996)"	"Nelson Eastman's Father's Heart Attack I'm sitting in my basement, which is larger and more open than it actually is. My friends Nelson Eastman, Simon Naver, Tony Kramer and Lyle Zeffman are there. We're talking. My friend Edith Sherman is coming home soon and is coming over to my house. Linus Doman calls. The guys and I all talk about what divorce is like. Nelson talks about his father's heart attack. He says the symptoms and the heart attach appeared all in one day, with no prior warning."
"0027"	"(01/11/1996)"	"Bike Ride in the Dirt to Armstrong I'm washing really dirty dishes that appear to have had lasagna served on them. My friend Esther Thurman is at my house and is looking for a key she thinks she may have left there. I go into my mom's room where there are five different sets of keys. We fumble through them. One set is Esther's. I am riding my bike from home to Armstrong High School. Nat Miller and three other people are with me, also riding on my bike. There is road construction. The dirt is soft and hard to pedal in. I swear, because it is tough to pedal in the dirt. We go towards Armstrong on Home Avenue. My friend Yvette Ullman is in the group. I think we can take a shortcut by cutting across the Parts Company lot. The land there is hard and we can bike fast. I turn too soon, near the Roadside building, and have to go down a ways further. There are employees outside. When I get over by the Large Company, I find I'm in Golden Acres riding my old red Huffy bike with crooked handlebars. The neck of the bike is loose again. There are some soccer players kicking a ball around in their yard."
"0028"	"(01/11/1996)"	"Greasy Hair I'm trying to comb my hair. It's really greasy. It is dark brown in color. I want to make it look semi-okay, so I'm not a total dirtball."
"0029"	"(01/13/1996)"	"Team Photograph at My House I'm at my home in Oak Valley sitting on the floor near the four bay windows. The Brimson College Basketball team comes through the front door for a team photograph. They move the furniture out of the window area. I talk to Yar Glenn, the coach, and help him move a coffee table. I check the refrigerator."
"0030"	"(01/13/1996)"	"USA vs. Mexico on a Dirt Court I'm on a basketball court. It is similar to the field house at Brimson. I'm warming up with my team. I can't dunk the basketball. There is one kid, I think from Rival High School, who dunks easily. I should be able to also, but when I go up to dunk I just don't get high enough, and end up laying it in, or even missing the lay-up and going for the put-back. I'm on an outside court, which is hard packed dirt. Someone has a long metal rod and they jab the dirt in one spot making it not-so-smooth. There are a number of groups of people there. Bud Slick, Donald Dilson, Daryl Yeller, and Simon Naver, people I know from high school, are each in a group. Donald Dilson's group is tracing the outline of a body on the dirt, which is then the Armstrong High School gym surface, using white chalk. There is a black man there with a cane, which is like a metal rod. He is hiding it down the leg of his pants. The national anthem is played. The game is USA versus Mexico. Mexico is a shorter and smaller team. I feel like the team I am playing for, the USA, will easily defeat Mexico."
"0031"	"(01/14/1996)"	"31 Miles to Dalz I'm up north in Franklin country, driving in a car to Hillston. It is around 10:00 am on a bright sunny morning. I look up and see the moon in the sky next to the sun. They are about one thumb's width apart, I judge. There appears to be a ""bite"" taken out of each of them. I think this is weird because they are never that close to each other. There is an alien face to the left of the sun. It is black with white eyes and a white mouth. I wonder where this is coming from, and then I turn around and see that the sun is reflecting off the windshield and bumper of the car behind me back into the sky. Ahead of me and to my right is what looks like my friend Nate Nelling's car. I pass it. Then I am in the car, and am passing a semi-truck. I am nervous about being in such a little car. I make a turn on the road when going almost 60mph. I feel the car kind of shake. The sun is really bright as we round the curve. I drive into a small town. The speed limit sign says 49mph. The town is just like Oak Valley when you drive in on highway 23. There is a baseball field and an AAA store on the right. There is a Food-n-Fuel and a bar on the left. But the town has a newer, cleaner, smaller atmosphere to it. A lot of things are colored bright blue. I look for a sign that will point me in the direction of Hillston, because I think I've gotten a little off track. There is a road sign saying Dalz, which is the name of a town, is 31 miles, with an arrow pointing to the left. I turn left, but stop to check the road map in my back pocket."
"0032"	"(01/15/1996)"	"A Talk with the Sisters I'm in a store in Forkville with my mom and my two sisters, Heather and Ramona. We're at a sort of foosball table that is made like a pinball machine with a little spring shooter made from wood that one pulls back. I'm talking to Heather about being responsible. My mom says she's going to take a walk. I say I'll meet her at Applebee's in 10 minutes. It is in the same plaza that we're in now. She says meet in one minute, not 10. She then goes out to the parking lot, which has a light layer of snow, and starts dancing around. I'm talking to Heather, telling her she has got to make good choices in life. I tell her she has to respect our mom and not be rude to her. I basically scold her for being a dumbass and tell her to shape up. Then I look at Ramona, but I don't say much to her."
"0033"	"(01/16/1996)"	"Room to Move I am in my old bedroom. I am wearing really baggy pants and a t-shirt. I just feel like it, I guess."
"0034"	"(01/17/1996)"	"Jens can't do Laundry I ask my roommate Jens Nils to do his laundry. I get the usual crap-filled feeble excuse. Then he admits that he doesn't know how. He asks me to do it for him. I scream at him, ""No, fuck no!"". I tell him I'll show him how. He has a pair of yellow pants, a pair of white pants, and his sheets. We borrow laundry tokens from Stephen. I find a 1954-penny when Stephen gives us the laundry tokens. The yellow bleeds onto the white pants. My friend Jimmy Youngman is then Jens, and he's not picky that the yellow pants bled onto his sheets too."
"0035"	"(01/17/1996)"	"Girl with Nipple Ring I'm sleeping in a single bed in a dorm room. A girl crawls under the sheets at the foot of the bed and pops her head out the top of the sheets near my chest. She is rubbing my penis with her hands, outside of the bluish-purple sweatpants I am wearing. I want her to give me fellatio. She is not wearing a shirt. There is another person in the room who is aware of us. I kiss the girl on the mouth once. She wants me to drink alcohol to get rid of my morning breath. There is a bottle of vodka there but I don't want it. It's 10:30 in the morning. I kiss her face, ear, and neck, and suck her breasts. She has a nipple ring in her left nipple. There are red marks like hicci's all over her breast. I ask her if she has any kids. She says no. I say I have three, and then tell her I'm kidding. I want to give her cunnilingus, but she won't let me because she wants to kiss me, and won't do so if I perform cunnilingus. I try to anyways. Her vagina doesn't smell too good. She covers her vagina with her hand and pushes me away."
"0036"	"(01/17/1996)"	"I hit Robbins Garage I'm driving my truck down Home Avenue in Oak Valley, going south. I just started it, and it's running rough. It stalls by Roman's house and I coast down to 1st Street, turn left, and restart it. I turn left on Next Avenue and go north. I turn into Robbins' driveway. There are two parts to a dock there. I go up to the garage, but lose my footing on the clutch and brake and hit it. Then I say that I'm going to do that over, and I do, stopping before I hit the garage. There are other people there. One person is eating an orange. Something about recycling is going on. Kent Robbins is in the garage. I am Fred Flintstone. Something happens with a bicycle."
"0037"	"(01/18/1996)"	"Card Playing is Illegal I'm with a group of people, consisting of one guy and three girls, sitting on or near the side of a road. I recognize my friend Yvette Ullman. She is topless, and has very large breasts. We are going to play cards. Yvette doesn't seem to be conscious of her nakedness, or if she is she doesn't care. I try not to look directly at her chest, but it is hard not to. She stands up and puts a big bra on. We are now by the railroad tracks in Oak Valley, near 3rd Avenue, outside by a road playing cards. The police all and say they've been getting calls about gambling and card playing. Everyone starts to put the stuff away. I tell them to hold on, and I run across the tracks to a green house where the Teavor family lives. They have a phone on the outside of their garage near the door. I pick it up and call the police. An officer picks up the phone. I yell and sweat at the person. He yells back. I tell them it's my right guaranteed by the constitution to play cards if I want to. The officer brings up my past, asking if I've ever been stopped for speeding. It turns out that recently I had been going 26mph in a 25mph zone and the roads were icy. My car spun around. A cop stopped and questioned me. I hadn't been drinking. The cop kicked my car. The blackmails me into not pursuing the card playing issue because I was going over the speed limit and could have been given a ticket. I yell at the cop over the phone that this is blackmail! I was being harassed! I hang up the phone knowing the police are on their way. I tell everyone to leave their stuff and run. We do. My gradeschool classmate Sonya Nittles is there. She is running in the same direction as I. I go forwards to Carter School. She starts to follow me, then doesn't. That is good because it is easier for me to travel alone. I run towards the bowling alley. I'm wearing a life preserver (life jacket). I jump a fence and scrape my wrists a little bit. The cops are looking for me. I go into Billie's daycare to rest. I peer out onto Holy Avenue. Two police cars go through the intersection of Holy and 2nd Street. One of them turns and drives down Holy, towards where I am. I run inside and go into the women's bathroom. I take the garbage bag out of the trash can and throw the life jacket in, putting the bag back in place. The cop car is rolling slowly down Holy. I think I can elude it."
"0038"	"(01/18/1996)"	"Long Lucid Scene Change I'm at a dance club that has the atmosphere of Big Dance Club. I see Amy Kunkel. She talks to me and tells me this has become her hang out. Prince either owns the club or is there. I go out of the club and see some neatly trimmed bushes. They have a reddish-purple veil covering them. One of the bushes looks like a big Afro. I pull this veil off the bushes and scrunch it up into a little ball about the size of a cantaloupe and put it to my nose, inhaling deeply. It smells a little bit like raspberries. It is the color of raspberry. It is Prince's veil. I walk up a ramp to leave the club. Whitney Houston comes down with her entourage. She is playing the part from the movie ""Waiting to Exhale"", and I remember a radio announcer saying in the movie that she couldn't get a date, and indirectly pointing out it's quite a bit different in real life. I am with three women. Two of them are black, and one is white. I may be the white woman. We are walking down a long cement ramp like the one at the Montana Zoo in the tropical garden section. We are all wearing nice dresses and holding umbrellas. About halfway down the ramp one of them women turns and goes into a building. The other two continue to the bottom of the ramp, where there are doors and a shopping mall. I am carrying my umbrella off my shoulder. The other woman and I go through the doors at the end of the ramp. I am now with my friends Bubba Hacker and Kevin Simpson in the mall scene. Bubba tries to get into this JC Penny store. The door to the store won't open. I pull a latch on a sliding door next to the one Bubba tried, and we all open it. We walk in, and see that it is a storage area, maybe for overstock items. The room is large and mostly empty. There are a few pallets of dog food in big green bags, and Bubba says that what we have to do is load those on a truck. There is a forklift there. I think that since I have a little experience with a forklift I'll drive it. I get in the seat and realize that I'm sitting backwards, so I turn around. The forklift moves. I must have hit something inadvertently when I sat down. It rolls and falls off the loading dock, 5 or 6 feet down. We have no way of moving it, so I walk over to the power jack. I can't work the power jack because the buttons are different than what I'm used to. The jack goes in different directions that I intend. Then I get it to work adequately, and run the jack into a pallet so I can stack the other pallets on top of that one. There is no longer dog food on top of them. Bubba is down on the loading ramp. I realize I'm dreaming and say to Bubba, ""Bubba, I'm dreaming! This is your dream and I realize I'm dreaming in it!"" I decide not to change the dream, just to go with it. Outside the loading dock is Grandpa Redding's farmyard. Kevin is running or driving something around. My truck is parked in the driveway, and there are people in it, lying in the back. Among them are my friends Carol Derth, Mya Rousing, and Nat Miller, and my cousin Anna Strange. They are cold, and I give them blankets. I tell them to take their clothes off and get next to each other to stay warm. One of the girls does. Grandpa asks me if the latches on the truck work okay. I say the tailgate is working fine. I think there is a bicycle or two in the back as well. There is a bunch of cane sighing poles in the back of a bluish-gray truck or van. They were from the group of people in my truck, who had gone fishing at Keeper Lake off the dock earlier in the day. The people in the back of my truck are saying that they're going to be cold on the ride home. I walk over to my mom's car. I think we are all driving home in it. Grandpa points out that the back tires are low. We're not all going to fit. Inside the porch, where the guns used to be kept, are two pairs of my basketball shoes: My new basketball shoes and my old white pair with the sides ripped out."

I am with a sort of ""family, which includes my friend Kristy Puffy. We have a big recreational vehicle. Kristy asks me if I have a knife. Of course, I say, I always have a knife in my pocket, and pull it out. I shove a set of my classmate Fred Slick's oars into the back of the RV, and they break the windshield. I have the feeling of Harry and the Hendersons. There is an old man there and we are both chasing and eluding this ""Harry"" creature."
"0040"	"(01/19/1996)"	"Strip Club Questionnaires I am with my friend Nat Miller and another person. We go into a place that reminds me of a nursing home, but it is for a strip club. We intend to go to a strip club. We go to the desk and fill out a questionnaire. After that, I think it's okay that we go."
"0041"	"(01/20/1996)"	"Jens is Washing Sheets! I am in my room with my roommate Jens Nils. I ask him about washing his sheets (i.e., if he has, or if he is going to). He points to them and says, ""Yeah, look, I'm going to do it..."""

My friend Nat Miller, and a man named Jesse, they guy that was hunting us in the Assassin game, are getting out of their car. Niles and I have already been killed. I say to the two that if they shoot me I'm going to beat the crap out of them. Nat shoots me with his water gun, and I chase him, tackle him, and punch him repeatedly. I feel bad, because I know Nat is my friend and I don't want to hurt him."

My friend Stephen Ramos and classmate Becky Happs are there. I fill up with beer a brown wine bottle that had been filled with my rhubarb wine. I am reaching for something and bump my lucky lottery candle, breaking it. The candle is huge: about 2 feet high and 1 foot in diameter. It's a clean break. We have a meal with wild rice, among other things. A man that looks like my neighbor Addison walks in. I say, ""Hi Addison."" He is stern looking, and says his name isn't Addison; it's James. I apologize, and say, ""Hi James."" He walks into the corner of the room without speaking. He moves slowly and surely. He chases me out of the room, taking me hostage. He has an 8mm pistol. The Hall Administrator (HA) is there, but doesn't help my. I knock the gun out of James' hand, and punch him. We wrestle. I tell for the HA to grab the gun but he doesn't. Finally I reach the gun myself and shoot James three times in the head. The HA didn't do anything!"
"0045"	"(01/20/1996)"	"I'm Kicked Out I open the medicine cabinet over the sink in my Franklin Hall dorm room and see the personal items of my roommate's girlfriend, Natasha Lens, where mine usually are.

"0046"	"(01/20/1996)"	"Minotaur Smashes my Motorcycle I'm driving back from a long trip. I get into the Metropolis, and realize I missed my exit. I was daydreaming about a trip with my girlfriend, Annie Thomas. Than I'm driving my truck backwards on the freeway and there is a semi-truck driving backwards too. I pull over to the side of the freeway to turn around and go straight. I do, and when traffic is clear enough for me to go, I see a buffalo grazing near the side of the freeway. I am on a motorcycle. As I get closer to the buffalo it turns into a minotaur. I stop. I'm scared. The minotaur crushes the front of my motorcycle. I get off and run to the side of the road. It picks up the motorcycle and throws it a long way."

Will Dunks is there, meeting his parents. I'm at a Kings Boat Cafe. The restaurant is a boat. My brother Wally and his friend Brian Rappaport are there, as well as my friends Tiny Combs and Hilary Nano. We are eating, or have to eat, a hot dish. In it is the main dish, dessert: everything, all in one. My schoolmates Holly and Megan Tanks are there. I talk to Holly about the University of Montana. She asks me about college. I think she thinks I go to the University of Montana Dillville. I'm going down the Dirty River on a tube. There is a water park connected to the river. I just make it, grabbing on to a railing and pulling myself up onto a flume-like ride on my tube. If I would have missed the ride, I would have been hurt or killed, because the river gets rough ahead. I'm riding the bus back from the water park. The Tank twins are next to me. They show my holes in their arms from donating plasma, and say they're finishing up their donations next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Darwin Chaimberlin, Jimmy Youngman, and I are walking back from a basketball game. Darwin stays I should go teach Hebrew school. I say I don't know anything about that. He says I can go to a meeting that night and learn."

They take me into a room to sign a release. They have been monitoring me. They tell me a bunch of symptoms I wasn't aware of for a particular disease that they think I have, but I don't think I do. There are boxes of fake ID's on the floor."
"0051"	"(01/22/1996)"	"Eating Ice Cream by the Spoonful I'm in a Target Store. My friend Nicole Peterson is working there, stocking deodorant. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. He says he didn't wear deodorant when he was younger. I say that I did; I have a good mom. I walk away with a tube of deodorant. I go to the freezer section with two spoons. I'm going to eat ice cream. There are a bunch of containers opened and spilled. A container of chocolate is liquid: one could drink it. There is a man with a dog in the aisle. I don't want to eat with him there, so I go around the corner. There is a man stealing and eating donuts there. I walk out of the Target, into a mall. I see classmates Jerome Michaels and Pete Lutz, and we talk. Jerome tells me that he is in his 10th day of basic training and it's being held at Wilmerton University. They are learning how to build rope bridges, and attend classes. He asks me if I know why we yell when running towards the enemy. I say because it will alarm or startle them. My buddy Matt Yams is there with me."

I am beaten, and am bleeding severely. I get up and stumble out the door, running. The people at the party see me and are shocked, saying to the host, ""What did you do to him?"" The people come after me. I'm running through neighborhoods trying to escape. There are secret agents helping me. They have clues. I get to agent # 307. He is standing in 1.5 feet of snow. A car goes by and he signals to it that this is the spot. I may be in the car, or it may be the bad guys. I punch a hole in the snow and reach down and grab an apple, which is the clue. The agent reads it. There is a car there with my classmates Robyn Masters and Dolly Storms in it. They have guns, some of which are real and some are water guns. I knock the real guns out of their hands and get in the drivers seat. I hit the accelerator, and the wheels spin. I move slowly at first, afraid of being shot. My friend Tim Zelling grabs on to the rear passenger side door, and is dragging along as I drive. I am called the Dream Weaver. I'm driving through a hospital-like area. There is a black man standing there and he says, ""That's the dream weaver."" I steer the car, weaving, to try to shake Tim off the car. There is a red light ahead. I have to shake him off before it."

"0054"	"(01/24/1996)"	"Deer Hunting I'm deer hunting in a party of four. I'm the party leader. We are in farm country in southern Montana. My classmate Emilio Kluck had shot a big deer at one spot where we are, so I align a pair of antlers to point at that spot like they are a gun. There are a lot of metal stakes in the farmland that I might have to pull out. I might want to cover the land up with a tarp. There is a crack there. It looks like an area near Farmington, where my grandparents live."
"0055"	"(01/24/1996)"	"Dunk while Amy is Reffing I'm playing a basketball game in which Amy Leopard is the referee. I get a fast break, one-on-zero. I dribble and run funny, because I want to dunk. I get close to the hoop and jump. The rim is already bent down. I jump and dunk it lightly. The other team complains that I was hanging on the rim. I disregard their complaints."
"0056"	"(01/24/1996)"	"Eating Frozen Yogurt I go into The Country's Best Yogurt with my dad and three siblings. We have $20. That's four dollars each, I figure. What I want costs between six and seven dollars. I give my brother Wally three dollars. The lady asks me what I want in it (i.e. in my yogurt). I say I don't know. She asks if I like ice cream. I say yes. Then she adds a catalyst to the yogurt to make it ice cream. There is an awful lot to eat; too much for me."
"0057"	"(01/23/1996)"	"Stephen Has Babies I'm with my friends Stephen Ramos, Amy Leopard, and Virginia Hamms. We're getting into a car by the train bridge in Wilmerton. Stephen has babies. It is not clear to me if he physically gives birth, or if he is the father of babies. I sit in the back seat behind the driver. Amy is next to me. I'm leaning on her. She tells me not to lean on her shoulder, but to lean on her chest. We drive past the train bridge and I ask Amy if she has every jumped off. She says no, and I tell her that she should sometime and that it's a rush. She laughs. Amy and Virginia are being really nice to me. We drive to a park at the Main River. The water is really cold. Amy and Virginia eat a bratwurst with sauerkraut. They want some seasoning, and go get a packet of onion soup mix and pour it on. They share the bratwurst."

They are about to play Bible College, who is not very good. Chris Rodriguez is in. He is quick, but he misses all his shots. Two girls are in the game for Armstrong too. All the bleachers in the gym are not pulled out. It seems like the basketball program at Armstrong is falling apart."

The steps up to the front sidewalk are in a different place: right in the middle of the stone wall. The old steps are there too. We talk about the planet Venus, though it isn't visible. Nate has a gift for me. We walk in and I say hi to my brother Wally. He tells me that I've been pinching a pimple on my back too hard. Wally's friends Brian Rappaport and Mryle Madden are there. One of them is on the phone. The three of them are going out. Then there is a hot tub with two couples in it. The couples are from the television show ""Friends"". Two other girls join them in the tub, and the girls are forced out of the tub."
"0060"	"(01/29/1996)"	"Sunken Treasure I am in a quarry-like structure. It is filled with water that is cold and deep. There are rocks on all sides. I'm at the surface of the water. There is a treasure or something valuable or spectacular way down deep. One needs to scuba-dive to get to it. I'm not ready to go down. The rocks are slippery. If I let go I will sink quickly in the water. I need to get something before I go down."

"0064"	"(01/31/1996)"	"Driving Over Roots I'm with my dad and we're leaving to go somewhere. I start to tell him about a dream. He says I'm already really knowledgeable about them; that I know all about them. I'm riding a bike with my dad on the back. We're riding by Nantucket's Furniture or The Grease Pit. I see Olie Kecker, Patrick Bergman, and Bud Slick, all people I know from high school. I say hi. I'm riding over roots from trees that are sticking out of the ground."
"0065"	"(01/31/1996)"	"Forks in the Mail I'm checking my mail at Brimson but my mailbox is way at one end of the post office, which is different. I can't get into my mailbox. The door won't open. There is only a little space to reach my fingers in. In my box are some little name cards that people put in graduation announcements. There are also a bunch of forks in it. The names on the cards are from people from my high school that I graduated with. I'm in a bathroom masturbating when my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson walk in. I push the door closed. Stephen is laughing at me."

There are red lines that we are trying to kill as they kill us. There are blue dots that we can shoot to give us extra energy and ammunition. Amy and Virginia say that they're not going to stop, they are bleeding blue blood. They say they can fight. I say no, I'm going (to do something, since I'm not bleeding). The lines move around a lot and are hard to hit. I start using bombs instead of guns."
"0068"	"(01/31/1996)"	"Witch Controls Conflagration There is a big building with a fire spreading through it. I am a firefighter, or I feel like one for a bit. The floor may fall out. I'm afraid of that. There is a woman that seems to be the key to the fire; may be able to control it. She may be a witch. The firemen eventually bomb the building, and the witch dies, even though she isn't in the building. I am flung away from the building on a rope-like thing and pulled back, all in the air, like a yo-yo. I'm in a graveyard climbing back over a fence to the building. After the building explodes and the witch dies, I take her body and show it to the people. It's in a body bag. I tell people she is from Gerald (University) and let them see her rotting face.

I'm using a screwdriver to turn in a screw, which goes almost all the way in. There is a window in the door and I see a man walk down the stairs in the bank. He is the bank manager. He comes out and catches me changing the lock. I have four things: a screwdriver, a hammer, a deck of cards, and a vinyl envelope. He takes the hammer and the envelope. I tell him to give me the hammer. He say no, because I was using it to break in. I said I wasn't, but he doesn't believe me. The bank is a hardware store. I tell the man it doesn't matter if he believes me or not because I wasn't using it. He gives it back to me. I tell him he's going to have a good dream because he gave it back to me, and then I sprint away."
"0070"	"(02/01/1996)"	"Dunking Vodka I'm in my high school at a gathering after a basketball game in the lunchroom. One of the basketball coaches named Vern Peck is there. I tell everyone to play basketball, and start running around simulating a game. There are too many people. The ball is a bottle of vodka. I do a give-n-go and dunk the bottle in a toilet. At first I try and the toilet lid is down, so I lift the lid and then dunk it. The bottle breaks. Vern Peck is mad at me for breaking it, and says I'm going to pay. Con Carson, my old high school basketball coach, tries to intervene but I tell him to stay out of it. I go to get my bag in the locker room but it's blocked and I realize I didn't really play in the game. I get a ride home from Nate Nelling. We walk out of the school, saying hi to Mr. Zates. There is a bunch of Armstrong Students there. I get eight points for my costume."

We're driving a boy to his home from the farm. I want to talk with Annie about why it hurts her, but the boy is there. When we drop him off, it feels like the town Redson. Then we drive and talk. She tells me that it hurts her when I give her cunnilingus, but she likes it and wants me to continue. I think that is kind of fucked up. We are at my friend Kevin Simpson's house, which is different than I know it. We walk up stairs and into his living room. He got two or three new couches, and a big television. I flop down on a big, bed-like couch. I want to have sex with Annie. Kevin's mother will be home soon but I don't care. I just want to have sex."
"0072"	"(02/03/1996)"	"Autofellatio 1 I'm in my old bedroom, which is now my sister Ramona's bedroom, upstairs, at home. There are a few people downstairs. I open the door to the little attic in her room, and turn the light on. I sit down and start giving myself fellatio. I scrunch up in a ball and my penis reaches my mouth. It doesn't feel nearly as good as when someone else has done this for me. I can't ejaculate; I can barely even maintain an erection."
"0073"	"(02/04/1996)"	"Lucid Lamp on Fire I go to turn my lamp on. There is a bunch of stuff cluttered around it. I turn the knob, and the power strip that is on my desk crackles. I turn the knob again and the strip bursts into flames. I run out the door, but I can't move fast. I want to get the fir extinguisher. I realize, somewhat, that I am dreaming."
"0074"	"(02/05/1996)"	"Shooter Needs Sleep I'm by Carter church with my friend Tiny Combs. My truck has been parked in a no-parking zone. I have a parking ticket. On the ticket it says that this is my first ticket for parking in a no-parking zone. I feel like I'm at Brimson. I move my truck by pushing it from the driver's side door. I scrape Tiny's car and another car as I move it. I back it up without starting the engine, and then push it forward to start the engine while it's moving. I am on my bike, holding onto the handlebars. My feet are dangling off the back of the bike with my belly on the seat. I struggle and finally do pull myself up and sit on the seat. I see Jackson Shooter, my high school basketball coach, in his truck at the corner of Holy Ave and 1st St. I follow him on my bike. His truck turns into a little green buggy. He is speeding. I catch up to him on my bike. He is stopped on 2nd St. near Jeffereson School and I skid to a stop next to him. He is on a bike too. He says he's addicted to winning. His team beat Rival High School last night, he says. I pluck two big blood-sucking mosquitoes off my leg. Jackson says that he needs sleep."

I end up in the garage. I want to escape. I man sees me and won't open the door all the way; of if he does I can't leave. He says I'm breaking the law and he'll let me go if I pay him cash or from my conjugate credit card. I tell him, ""Suck my conjugate cock"" and speed off on my bike. He chases me, but I get away."

But, I haven't taken any Biology at Brimson. The last time I took Biology was in 10th grade at Armstrong. I am struggling to remember where I took this class, and what exactly it was. All I know is that I got a B in it, which is low grade for me."
"0077"	"(02/06/1996)"	"Squirrel-Catching Dogs I'm in woods where there is a person that is showing me their dogs who catch squirrels. The dogs climb trees and jump from branch to branch and more. There are also some rope-devices that were pulleys that could pick people up and carry them to the top of trees."
"0078"	"(02/08/1996)"	"Armstrong Graduation Relived I'm going to attend some kind of Armstrong graduation. I forgot to call Mimi Escher to let her know I was coming. My friend Tina Totts calls me to get my roommate Jens Nils' phone number. I can't find the number. Then I remember that his number is my number too: 696-7420. It's raining outside and I run to my neighbor, Alvin Broud's house for a Kleenex."
"0079"	"(02/09/1996)"	"Beating a Man With a Hammer I'm at home with my girlfriend Annie Thomas. It seems to be my house, but it may also be hers. We're alone. We hear something around the corner. I'm going to punch it, and Annie grabs a hammer. A shirtless man appears. Annie knows him. I don't. He has been living in her room. I take the hammer from her. He is trespassing. I break the television and beat the man with the hammer, putting holes in the walls in the process. The man is dazed. I follow him around and hit him. He retreats. Annie's father and sisters come home. I feel bad when they see the damage to their house."
"0080"	"(02/09/1996)"	"Saving Molly From Drowning I'm at Grandpa Redding's house, or a place that has the feeling of that house. I'm in a swimming pool with a bunch of other people. My classmate Molly Villareal is there. We are sort of playing a game in which one person goes under the water for a while. Molly goes under. People forget about her. I am swimming underwater, and I see her. She looks dead. I drag her to the surface. I yell for help. I say, ""I killed Molly."" Molly starts breathing after she gets CPR. This is the second person's life I've saved today. Two of my friends died. Two babies were born. I can name one of the newborns. It's Molly's child."
"0081"	"(02/09/1996)"	"Snake Fishing in River I see a party at a doctor's house. Then the doctor is taking his two kids, one boy and one girl, fishing. They go to the Main River. The kids like to see their father catch little northern pike (""snakes""). He hooks a snake to his line and casts it out. It runs and he reels it in, showing it to his kids. I grab it and take the hook out. Then I take the little kiddie rod and put a daredevil on it and start casting into the river. On the 3rd cast or so I get a hit. But I am in the 2nd story of a house and the line is going out the window. Someone tells me on the end of the line is a little boy having anal sex with a little girl."
"0082"	"(02/10/1996)"	"4 on 4 on 4 Basketball I'm in a stadium playing a 4 on 4 on 4 basketball game. Each team takes turns going up and down the court. One of the teams gets a technical found and gets disqualified right away. One of my team members is somehow out. So it is my friends Hank Anderson, Norman Noman, and I against the other 4 guys. We play hard. I dominate almost every aspect of the game: rebounding, shooting, passing, and dribbling. I am stronger than the others and use my strength and toughness to beat others. Then I'm at an Armstrong girls Basketball game. My high school basketball teammates Olie Kecker, Nate Nelling, Simon Naver, and Binky Ahmed are there. My friend Robyn Masters is playing, and she ties up a player with the ball and should get a jump ball call, but the referee calls a foul somewhere else. The whole gym is quiet. I bellow out, ""Come on; look at the ball!"" The referee gives me a mean look."
"0083"	"(02/11/1996)"	"Annie Starts Her Period I'm with My girlfriend Annie at a truck-stop-like exit off the freeway. There is lady and her son there too. Annie tells me that she was sitting in her room last night and she started menstruating. I think that she always menstruates when we spend time together after a long time apart. We are talking about doing something that night."
"0084"	"(02/11/1996)"	"Frog Catching I'm driving my mom's station wagon with Ramona. It's dark out, and I'm out of control: swerving and going on the shoulder of the road. I unbuckle my seat belt and sit kneeling on my legs. I steer by pressing keys on a piano. Both my hands are in C-position. If I press the G's I go to the right. If I press the C's I go to the left. I can't find home position and have to keep looking down at the keyboard, taking my eyes off the road. Ramona knows I'm out of control. We're driving to the Metropolis to meet my dad. It's dark out and there are frogs on the road. They hop across as I drive. I stop the car and start catching frogs. We put them in the small green Duck Tales tackle box. I get five frogs and say to Ramona only five more then we'll go. It is morning then and I've pulled into a driveway. The sun is shining and we try to catch these huge frogs. We're really late going to the Metropolis."
"0085"	"(02/12/1996)"	"Diaphragm in My Butt I am at a doctor's office. I have a diaphragm (the kind used as a type of contraceptive) shoved up my butt. The doctor tells me to touch it with my finger. I say hell no! Eventually, I do touch it, and realize that it is really far up my butt."
"0086"	"(02/12/1996)"	"House Burning Down I am in my house and it is burning. I try to stop it from burning by spraying it with a squirt bottle. It isn't working. I change the spray from a stream to a mist, and it still doesn't help put out the fire. The fire seems to get worse."
"0087"	"(02/12/1996)"	"Swimming at Prancy I'm in a swimming pool at a college; I think Prancy College, which is an all women-school that my girlfriend goes to. There are a bunch of women there. They are swimming laps. One woman tries to touch another, but the aggressor sinks to the bottom of the pool."
"0088"	"(02/13/1996)"	"Hank Anderson Wets the Bed I'm in a bed at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's house. My friend Hank Anderson is there and he sits on the bed and starts urinating. He's like a little kid. I quickly get up and usher him to the bathroom. I'm in the kitchen with my friend Nat Miller. A van turns into the driveway. It's threatening. We go over near the washer and dryer to look out the window above them. I say something about the van breaking the quiescence. I go onto the porch and grab a crowbar to hit the strangers if they come in."
"0089"	"(02/14/1996)"	"Bad Hair Talk Show There is a talk show with a bunch of women on the stage. There is one woman with really bad, big, poofy hair, criticizing the other women. There is a woman with a ferret growing out of her head. She is petting it. It was an erection, but it was a ferret."
"0090"	"(02/14/1996)"	"Camping for 10 I'm going on a camping trip which is going to last 10 days. There will be 10 people on the trip. It is the night before we leave and I am up late (10:00pm) and haven't packed. Matt Yams, Gino Teavor, Rita, and Kari Otis, who are all grade school classmates, are going on the trip. I wonder if it will be cold. I get a pair of hiking boots and sweat pants, and a sleeping bag. I eat a lot of food before leaving, including noodles and fish."
"0091"	"(02/20/1996)"	"Autofellatio 2 I'm at home in my old bedroom. I'm trying to ejaculate my flexing my penis. Eventually I ejaculate on a blue towel. The tip of my penis is covered with semen, and is close to my head. I give myself fellatio. The semen tastes weird. I don't do this for very long. It doesn't feel particularly good."
"0092"	"(02/20/1996)"	"Black Sheep I am at a moving theatre watching the movie Black Sheep. Niles and Tim Zelling are there, and we seem to be in some sort of a track meeting. We are going to play basketball after the movie. My mom, my brother Wally, and sister Ramona are there. They might leave, but decide not to. There is a woman with very large breasts there. Wally doesn't like her. There are lots of strange men around, who look ""cool"". I know a few of them. One is a really tall man. Everyone is smoking marijuana. This movie theatre is really weird. I go out to buy food and tickets. I put a laundry token in a water faucet to get water smelling like marijuana. I put the water in my backpack, and then use a glass that is in my pack to scoop out some of the water, which smells like marijuana. The faucet won't shut off. I turn a soap-like knob, which doesn't work. Finally I get the water off. A fat man with a Local Casino t-shirt gives me a bunch of free movie tickets. He says the other night he won the most he's ever won there. I go back and the theatre is a television. The seats are couches. Kristy Puffy, Kevin Simpson, and Hannah Reed, who are friends from high school, are there. I got my marijuana (water?) but don't know how to smoke it, and can't find a place to sit and spend a lot of time getting it set up. The movie is dumb."
"0093"	"(02/22/1996)"	"Moving to Cheyenne I'm at home. My parents, and my siblings are there. We are packing to move to Cheyenne, South Dakota. The town has about 2,500 people. It's a six-hour drive. I do not want to go. I put a fishing rod in the car. There are two station wagons. One of them is the old yellow station wagon that the family used when I was a child. My dad may have a beard, like when he was younger. We are moving because my dad got a new job. He starts tomorrow. The ride is going to be hell, I know, with all of us riding in the same car. I am really mad! I want to yell and scream and protest. Why The Fuck Are We Moving???!!!"
"0094"	"(02/23/1996)"	"$10,000 on Q-Bert I'm at a gas station filling up my truck with gas. I don't have any money to pay, so I go home and get some, riding my old red Huffy bike back to the gas station. I pay for the gas and get a scratch lottery ticket with the extra dollar. It doesn't win. I get five more. None are winners. I get another, and it's a Q-Bert scratch ticket. I get five white Q-Berts with black glasses on and win $10,000. I wonder if that is my big winning. I think not, I am going to win more sometime. When I get out of the gas station, my truck is gone. The trailer part of the truck is by Curtis' house in Oak Valley. I have a man go get it, driving the cab of a semi."
"0095"	"(02/25/1996)"	"Confirmation Sponsor I'm going into Carter School. I've got a key. I put it into a box outside the school. There is a light switch and I turn on the lights inside. I know I was always a little scared walking in dark school hallways. I'm a sponsor for someone getting confirmed. My friend Niles Zelling is there. A girl I recognize to be Carrie Jones, from high school, is there."
"0096"	"(02/27/1996)"	"Free Money I am next to a building that I later recognize to be Mason, the Brimson college cafeteria. There is a kid there on rollerblades. I go over by a car. I find a ten-dollar bill. It is counterfeit. One side of the bill isn't printed. Then I find more bills, including 20's, 5's, and 1's, and I check the bottom sides to make sure they're real. The guys around me start scrambling to pick up the other bills. I shove a bunch in my pocket. One of the guys takes a $20 bill out of my pocket. I catch him and take it back. There are a few little kids trying to take photographs of me as I leave, as if I have done something wrong. I go into Carter School and a kid follows me in. I am careful not to let him get a photograph of my face. I go up the south stairs in the school. Teachers are there, some of whom I recognize. Finally I let the kid take my photograph, but I make him/her promise something before taking it."
"0097"	"(03/02/1996)"	"High School Sports Reunion I'm at a gathering in a gymnasium. High school sports are being played. Basketball is played presently. My friend Gino Teavor is there, and is as intense as usual. I wonder if, and kind of wish, that I could beat everyone at basketball. Football is next. It is disorganized. There are some guys there from high school, including Simon Naver. We talk about college. I am making my way out of the gymnasium. Melanie McDyss, a friend from college, comes up and kisses me! I say, ""Melanie, what are you doing?!"" Then I realize that she's been drinking. She giggles and wanders off with a friend. I am being dragged, and am also dragging a person, towards the exit. I see my mom. I'm embarrassed to be seen playing with two girls, but I go up to her and tell her that I'm leaving. It is icy outside. My sister Ramona just got her drivers permit, and I might let her drive, but there is something wrong with the car: it's locked. I unlock it. It's running. We need to back it out but it is too icy, so I have one of Ramona's friends push. Her friend is then in the driver's seat pushing back on the seat. I am in the back seat at the steering wheel. We start backing out. I yell at her to stop pushing. She doesn't, and I yell again. We are going to hit a car. I yell and finally she hears me. The car slides sideway and bumps a little red car, leaving a dent. There is a new blue truck there too, and I probably dented it, but I'm not taking responsibility for that; just for the red car. I find a police officer and tell him that I hit a car. He asks me if I admit it was my fault. I say yes. He tells me my insurance or I have to pay full damages. We are parked in a parking ramp, and I send someone to up to get my mom. People are eating this horrible-looking green pizza form Pizza Hut. There is a girl there that looks a lot like Nellie Hammer, and woman that sat in front of me in a geography class at Brimson. She is drunk and she hits on me. I get away from her: she is ugly. I am really mad about this whole situation. I'm walking up stairs to the gym to get my mom, and I wonder: Is this real? Am I really here? Is this happening? I awaken."
"0098"	"(03/02/1996)"	"Spreading Eggs There are four bicycles outside of Mason Cafeteria on a trailer-type apparatus. They need to be moved. I keep walking to Franklin Hall, my dormitory. My friend Stephen Ramos and three other guys get the bikes. Tony Ramada takes one. He rides it and then does a ghost-rider, letting it crash into a semi-truck. The semi drives over it and it remains unscathed. I'm with Yvette Ullman. There is a bunch of us in a suburban-like vehicle. We're driving on Highway Q in Wilmerton, going south by the Holiday Inn. In the field on our right there is a truck of some sort driving over rough, snowy terrain. I say wow; it would be great to own one of those vehicles! Then I could drive it all over! I write the name of that truck out of the dust on the rear side window of the suburban. Yvette has a bunch of eggs. At first I think they are caviar, but then I think they are human eggs! We are going to spread the eggs over some land. A person can eat the eggs, but one has to cook them 20 minutes. We go to a house, which is like Major Hall, another college dormitory. I am carrying Yvette's bike up the stairs on the 3rd floor. We get to the third floor. Kari Otis, a friend from grade school and high school, has a room there. I say hi to her. I steal a red jellybean from her. I guess it is Easter time. I am going down the stairs, sliding on my stomach on a pillow. The stairs descend, then turn 180°, then descend, then turn, etc. At the first level down I find a Penthouse magazine. I want to take it. I'm about to shove it down my pants, when a girl looks up the stairs and sees me. I toss it aside, saying that I'm just joking. I go down another flight of stairs. Again there is a Penthouse. I want to take it, but there are people around. I go down a third flight, and find a third Penthouse. I don't get to take the Magazine. Brownie Bruny, a person I know from grade school that was a year older than I, is there at the bottom of the stairs. I have never liked her. There is a room there with a party atmosphere. People are dressed up. Brownie is wearing a wig and is as snobby as ever. My friend Simon Naver is lying on the floor. I can tell it's him by his pants. They are all leather and look like the leather jacket he has. I go over to him, he gets up, and we shake hands. We're happy to see each other. We shake hands again. I almost hug him but feel that would be inappropriate."
"0099"	"(03/03/1996)"	"Greeting Knife Family I am going east on 1st St. to Carter school to open gym to see when I work. There are two breaks in the curb, where bicycles ride up and down. (In real life, there is only one break.) I go in the door, and see that Bronwen Knife and family have the gym. She says, ""Hey, athlete!"" I am surprised, since our interactions have never been particularly friendly, but say hi. I tell her I just have to see when I work. We walk in the lunchroom. Mr. Knife is there. He is speaking at a conference in the near future at Brimson. He pulls out a piece of paper with my name on it and the words ""Honor Society"". I recognize it from when I was the Honor Society President in high school. He's going to use it in his presentation. I tell them I'm just gong to call Mrs. Bevner to see when I work. Then I see Mrs. Bevner and ask her. She is socially cold, as usual. Mrs. Minikel, my third grade teacher, is there. I had a crush on her when I was younger. Mrs. Bevner sends her niece with me up to her office to see when I work. Her office is very neat. There is a huge catalog; a directory, on her desk, of all the topics that she needs to deal with. He niece pulls out a slip of paper and shows it to me. I don't work at all, but I already knew this. I have known it all along. It is as if finding out my work schedule was an excuse to be back at the school. We walk down the stairs. Someone farts. It sounds like it was me, but I know it wasn't."
"0100"	"(03/03/1996)"	"Killing a Horse I have a machine gun. The sights on the gun are uneven, so that if I try to aim the way one usually does, I shoot high. I have to point the gun somewhat downward to shoot straight. I am shooting different object, including cars. Then I drop then gun down and shoot from the hip. I shoot a horse, many times, blowing it away. A girl is with me. (See sketches in notebook)"
"0101"	"(03/04/1996)"	"Charles Chasing Police There is a young man in the military. He is a specialist who does something with cows. He gets fined $130 a month for something he did. Two officers with nightsticks chase him. They beat him. Later, he is chased again. This time he is chased down Hill Avenue towards 3rd Street in Oak Valley, which is one street over from where my home is. The man is then Charles from my Geography class. He gets the cop's nightsticks somehow. He is chasing them. One officer lags behind, and Charles goes after the officer in the lead. He chases the officer into the garage of my neighbor, Alvin Broud. There is white powder all around. If the powder gets sucked/vacuumed up, that will be detrimental to Charles, so he breaks all the lights above his head. While breaking them, most of the powder gets sucked up. The officer gets away. Charles walks into the Broud's house like nothing happened: cool and collected."

"0104"	"(03/06/1996)"	"My Dad Gets Stopped I'm with my dad in a car he is driving. We turn from Friends Avenue in Wilmerton onto Main Street going west. There is a police car across from us. My dad went through a red light. The police car lights come on. My dad pulls over, then drives farther, and finally pulls over by Farm Store. The police officer is female. She asks my dad for license and registration. I open the glove compartment. It is cluttered with five or six ice scrapers, lots of little notebooks, and a bag of small oval insurance cars, less than a couple inches long. The cards are gold colored and have names written on them. The officer is riding in the back of our car. We are near my home in Oak Valley. We pull over. I get out and start looking at all the little insurance cards. I tell my dad he is not taking any of this seriously; his attitude is ""Oh, well..."" My friend Nate Nelling pulls up in front of my dad's car. He and his girlfriend Emily Zates were going to stop by about 8:30 that night. My friend Stephen Ramos is at my house, but I have to ride with the officer and my dad back to Farm Store so she can get her car. We start off down Home Avenue, where there is a stop sign halfway down the big hill. My dad goes through it, without stopping, slowing only a little bit. I scold him, telling him his easygoing attitude and laid-back ways get him into trouble."
"0105"	"(03/07/1996)"	"Annie Meows I'm with my girlfriend Annie Thomas in a room with other people. I'm kissing her, touching her, and putting my fingers in her vagina. She is moaning, but I can't tell if it's pleasure or pain, so I ask her. She says its pleasure. Then she starts to meow. Her vagina is really tight. There are people around, but I am not really conscious of them. We continue to kiss, and I suckle her breasts. Someone asks her what time it is. We were going to have sex or I was going to give her cunnilingus, I'm not sure which one: she was either going to sit on my penis or on my mouth. She tells them the time and grabs a blanket to cover us. We lay down, smiling at each other, knowing other people know what we are doing, but it's not a big deal."
"0106"	"(03/07/1996)"	"Circle of Fighters There are a bunch of warrior-type fighters in a circle. A ""chief"" or leader-type person is directing the fights. There is a young fighter who is really tough, who knows his stuff. The chief puts him up against a big, tough, thug-like opponent right away. There is also a scrawny guy who is sore all over. I think he may have bad knees. He goes up against the young tough guy too. The chief has a long stick with a clear gem attached to the end. It looks like a diamond, but I think it is too big to be a diamond. The fighters have smaller sticks with gems. One fighter uses bubbles to protect himself from the blows of his opponent's stick. There are also dice-like elevator structures that fling opponents really high and make them drop really fast."
"0107"	"(03/07/1996)"	"Dream Discussion with My Dad I am talking with my dad about my dream in which he and I are by Farm Store, which I had recently. We talk about my sister Heather, her dreams, and her knowledge of her dreams and herself. My dad is trying to point out to me the good in Heather, so that I may recognize and appreciate it."
"0108"	"(03/07/1996)"	"Snowballs Over Grand The Brimson College tradition of a snowball fight over High Avenue is ensuing. My roommate Jens Nils is there, as is Nellie Hammer, from my economics class. I toss a crusty snowball and it lands in the road, harmless. I feel dumb because I missed the actual game. There is a line of people by Billings Hall, one of the dormitories. They are going to run towards High Avenue and fling snow. They do. There is a car accident or two, with some damage. Everyone runs. I run to the Franklin Hall door, my dormitory. I feel guilty."
"0109"	"(03/08/1996)"	"Body Shop Bar I'm at the Body Shop gymnasium. They have some bench press benches with bent bars, with a couple of right angles in the bar. There is almost no room for one's head between the bar and the bench. I squeeze under a bar and do a few repetitions of bench press. It is really hard. (See notebook for sketches.)"
"0110"	"(03/08/1996)"	"Ice Fishing At Mud Lake I am going ice fishing at Mud Lake. It is springtime. My friend and I don't know how thick the ice is. We have a long thin metal pole to test it out.

My sunglasses are on a shelf in the manager's office. I'm cleaning the break room. There is a woman who may be my friend Persia Miko's roommate, Amie. Another girl comes in, angry that her cheese and crackers aren't there. She asks if I know where they are. I say no. I'm wiping tables. A kid comes up and wants me to work for him while he goes on break. I already am. Another kid tells me to ""get to work"". I stand on a chair and get my sunglasses off the top shelf. The Manager and assistant manager come in as I am going out. They look busy. I don't have a hat or mittens. The cart room is empty. I am pushing in a load of carts to the old entrance to Red Owl when I see my dad. He walks with me for a while, and tells me there is a $1,000 maximum damage deposit. A man asks me about a movie. I tell him to go ask the video department. Jim Burnett (the name, but Jim Burett, the person I know) asks me, ""Is there a g'new wall here (i.e., as in Gary G'news from Sesame Street?"" I tell him there's not. Dana Schliecher rides by on his bike as I am turning a load of carts in. They are very hard to turn. I go over to the JC Penny lot to get carts. My dad goes too. I shouldn't go this far for carts because it is busy and there are no carts in the room. The JC Penny is across from the old Red Owl, not Grocery Getto."
"0113"	"(03/14/1996)"	"Pie Shoppe I'm going on a trip with my dad and my siblings. We're going to a pie shoppe in a small town in west central Montana. We get there, and there is a weight room in the rear of this shoppe. I want to do the bench press. I ask a girl if I can join her doing the bench press because no benches are free. She reluctantly says okay. I put on a 45-pound plate on each side. There already is a 5 and 2.5 pound weight on each side. The plates have lavender writing on them. I bench press this weight twice, stopping to rest my arms both times. It's hard to lift. It shouldn't be hard; I can lift this weight 15 or 20 times. My basketball teammate Shawn Salzburg is there and I ask him if he's going to lift hard. There is a guy there who lifts hard and has big muscles but doesn't say much. I like, and respect him."
"0114"	"(03/14/1996)"	"Yolanda Ginsburg I'm sitting really close to Yolanda Ginsburg, a woman I went to college with and also the roommate of a woman I dated. Our bodies are touching. She says, ""I guess I will get going."" I say okay."

She is hard-core about sex, and wants me to have hard sexual intercourse with her for a long time. I have trouble getting an erection. I grab her and push her on her back, lifting her legs up. I give her cunnilingus. Immediately she says, ""Whoa!"" This is because I licked her clitoris right away without stimulating her anywhere else first. She wants to have sex but I tell her, ""I don't even have a condom."" She gets a plastic bag for me to put over my penis. She is hard-core! She's wearing black negligee. We are in the hallway upstairs at home, but the hallway is bigger. I see into my sister Heather's room, but that room is my sister Ramona's. Ramona is having some people sleep over. I look through the crack in the door and see Ramona and her friends going to bed. Ramona is naked. She sees me and so I do a funny wave at her. I give the woman I am with cunnilingus. Her clitoris is big and purple."

We rollerblade through the mall, going past a concession stand, and out another door. Tom tells us about an attractive girl. We're outside in a long and narrow parking lot which seems to be the one alongside the mall in Cancun. Cars are sparsely parked in it. I look for the car I drove, which is a small brownish-silver car. I can't find it. Then I realize I drove my mom's car, which is there. I turn the radio on. Def Leopard is playing. We are tossing Frisbees around and one of the speakers in the car gets blown out. One of the Frisbees has the Happy Chef logo on it. This Frisbee is my dad's: his name, ""Elliot"", is also written on it."
"0119"	"(03/15/1996)"	"Meeting Tina Totts I am at the Asian restaurant down town Wilmerton. It is huge. They have huge bar stools with backs made of leather. I'm waiting for Tina Totts, a friend from high school, who is meeting me. She is coming back from Big City, where she goes to school. My sister Ramona and her friend Peggy Flowers come in. They are going to a movie across the street. They ask me about getting a ride home. My classmate Kelsey Bobber, the three Peppercorn sisters from Brimson, and my friend Gino Teavor walk by me. Gino is drunk, talking about driving in cold weather. At first I wondered if they would let me sit at the bar. Maybe my facial hair would make me look older."
"0120"	"(03/16/1996)"	"Beating Evil Baby I'm with my girlfriend Annie Thomas, and friends Emily Zates, and Nate Nelling in my living room. I'm on the loveseat with Annie while Emily and Nate are on the floor. I'm sucking Annie's breasts and she's moaning loudly. She wants me to take off her pants, and she unbuttons them and pulls them down a little bit. I point to Emily and Nate and say to Annie, ""What about them?"" I don't really want to give Annie cunnilingus in front of them. I point upstairs and mouth the word ""upstairs"". We go up into my old room. Annie sits on a bed, which is up against the slanted wall. There is a ladder there. She asks me if I still want to see her when we go away. I tell her, ""I don't not want to see you."" She starts crying. I try to explain to her my thoughts about our different lives at college. There is music playing in the room. It is cheesy music from a pirate ship or a pirate ship movie. There is a looking glass in the floor, like those that would be on the bottom of a ship so one can look through the bottom. I walk around the ladder as I try to explain my feelings to Annie. I lean on it, and kind of hide behind it, but want to maintain eye contact with her. There is a rope-like electrical cord going across the floor. Annie asks me to play some good music because the music we're listening to is crappy. I say I will, and apologize for not doing it sooner. I walk into my sister Ramona's bedroom and get a tape. There is a baby playing there that is a year or two old. It is all alone, and I think it's strange that no one is there to take care of it. I'm pretty sure it's not a child of one of my sister's or my mom. I grab a tape and start to walk out. I stop and look at the child, who has a cord or rope in both hands, like a ribbon. It makes an evil face at me, and I realize it's not a real baby. It is a sort of evil-something. I can see the evil in its eyes. I grab it by the arm and smash it against the wall repeatedly. I yell for Annie. She comes in, and upon seeing the child says, ""Oh, my God."""
"0121"	"(03/16/1996)"	"Orange Teeth I'm brushing my teeth with an orange highlighter pen and baking soda. There are orange streaks left on my front teeth."
"0122"	"(03/18/1996)"	"Elk Hunting with Stephen I'm with Stephen Ramos and a few other people. We have big guns, and are hunting Elk or big deer. We see one run. We're in a building. Everyone takes a few shots at it. Stephen has a muzzleloader and can't reload quickly. Someone corners the deer and kills it. Robyn Masters, Dolly Storms, and another woman are there in swimsuits. They are tan after getting back from Cancun. We pass them going up stairs. There is man who is a killer. We are going after him before he kills more."
"0123"	"(03/18/1996)"	"Funky Thrusting I'm with my girlfriend Annie Thomas. We're having sex. I do some funky type of thrusting with my pelvis. She must like it, because she is moaning and shuddering."
"0124"	"(03/18/1996)"	"Roof of Franklin with Annie I'm with my girlfriend Annie and we're going up to the roof of Franklin Hall dormitory, above the 5th floor. We are in high school. We're going to make out and have fun. We get up to the 5th floor. Down the hall I see the guy from Franklin's fourth floor that gambles a lot. He is talking to someone. We quickly go into the room where the door to the roof is. Annie is working on Physical Geoglophy (spelled this way). She is doing page SAAA in her book. There is a map of the USA in it. I get onto the bunk bed and look at the place where I have to go up. We have to remove a panel in the ceiling to get to the small ladder and door to the roof. We stand on a chair and climb up. There is no lock on the door. I push the door open and stick my head up. To my surprise, there are kids all around. It is their recess time. They are listening to a man talk. The man can't see my head because there is an enclosure around me open only on one side. The kids shift their attention from the man to me. I flee: down the ladder, out the door, and down the stairs. There are plastic eggs on each level as I go down. I pick up a few as I go. Whitey Tub, the vice-principle at my high school who once suspended me, is chasing me. He catches up with me or meets me near the ground. He accuses me of going on the roof, and I deny it. I tell him I was just walking down the stairs. I'm holding the eggs. Annie is with me."
"0125"	"(03/18/1996)"	"Shopping with Stephen Ramos I'm with my friend Estban Ramos. We're grocery shopping. We're trying to decide what to buy. I tell him to get a couple blocks of cheese, but I'm not sure he'll get it right. We are also buying meat: sausage. I think I may put the bacon back, and maybe the sausage too. I think I'll have to get a gallon of milk. The store is like Hornbackers in Big City where I went shopping with my friend Nate Nelling. We meet man and a younger woman. They start talking with us, throwing in bits of German in the conversation. I know a few words. I know to hop-hupfen."
"0126"	"(03/18/1996)"	"Standard Deviation I'm with Niles Zelling. We're playing a game that is like Stratego. My classmate Dolly Storms calls to ask me a question about homework. I remember I have calculus to do, which is due tomorrow. I tell her I have to go. There are a few problems I need to do about standard deviation and stuff. I don't do them."
"0127"	"(03/19/1996)"	"Donuts at Mason I'm at the Mason Cafeteria eating lunch. My friends Bubba Hacker, Stephen Ramos, and Kevin Simpson are there and I'm waiting for them to finish eating. I drop my tray off on the south side of the cafeteria. There is a bag for plastic forks, but I drop a metal fork into it. In the east dining room there is a dessert area. A lady is giving people a choice of 4 dessert donuts. I want more than one and am having a tough time deciding what to get. I grab a bunch and walk off with my hands full. Back at the table they are goofing around. I do a fake fight with Kevin, and kick him in the groin. He farts on me. We all laugh. There is a guy there with a sack over his shoulder."
"0128"	"(03/19/1996)"	"Tornado Forming I can see how air moves from high pressure to low pressure. I see how a tornado forms. Air falls, rises, and swirls. I see the funnel clouds."
"0129"	"(03/20/1996)"	"Blue Van Wearing My Milton Hat I'm at a party in Buckingham and I think there may be a few people with me. On the porch I see a kid form Middleton College named Joe that I met on case day. He is sitting with another guy. There are some people in the house, but they are leaving pretty soon. The party clears out, and I see a guy with a brown and yellow Milton hat on. I want to go get my hat, which is exactly the same. Or, is this my hat? They guy gets in a blue van. Down the road, I see the van is wearing my hat! I want my hat back!"
"0130"	"(03/20/1996)"	"Rocks with Bombs By Fox I'm in woods. There is a fox there that has a bow and arrow. He shoots his arrows into trees. He shoots the arrows where the tree forks into branches. He'll fire three or four arrows and then the tree will crack and fall, splitting where the arrows were lodged. I wonder how he can do this. Then the fox shows me. Actually, he has rocks with bombs inside. He has strings tied onto the rocks. He'll throw the rocks and they'll hit or get lodged in a tree, and then the bomb will explode, splitting the tree apart."
"0131"	"(03/20/1996)"	"Breaking Windows of a Chinese Restaurant I am by the Chinese Restaurant where the McDonalds used to be in Oak Valley. I'm behind the restaurant with another person, near the driveway of the light green house with the dogs that I used to deliver papers to. I have a rope with a big rock tied to the end. I am throwing the rock at windows that are high up on the restaurant. I break some windows, but can't get the rock up to the big window I want to. The string gets wrapped around the middle pane in a window. I pull it and it unwraps. We've been there a while, and I'm worried we might get caught. A man, his wife, and their daughter come around the building. They are the owners. I run, going through the back yard of the house with the dogs. I'm about to go over the fence, but the little girl catches me and I stay. I could run, since the girl is only about 3 years old, but I don't. The wife comes and throws a fit of anger, screaming and jumping up and down. I think she is going to kick me. I could beat her and run, but I stay. I yell at her, asking how much she wants me to pay for the windows. I think I have enough. I ask her, ""How many Yen?"" She doesn't answer. Her husband comes. I try to get out of trouble by paying them for the damage. I don't think it works."
"0132"	"(03/20/1996)"	"Stephen and I Win $28,000 I'm in a room with Stephen Ramos. We're playing a slot machine and it's on a television, like a Nintendo is hooked up or something. We win a little bit, and Jake goes out of the room. I spin again. All the spaces are filled up with red and blue X's. The machine starts making payout noises. I win a lot of coins. The total is $28,000. We also have the $1,000 that Stephen and I won earlier. Stephen comes back, and so does another woman. I tell them nonchalantly that we won $28,000. It's no big deal for me."
"0133"	"(03/20/1996)"	"Giving Away My Nickels I get the feeling that I'm at the intersection where the Sinclair Gas Station is, exiting the Uptown Mall in Oak Grove. I'm waiting at the stoplights, going out of the lot. I'm in a car with some people I don't know. We're going to the casino. We get there. My friend Stephen Ramos is playing on a slot machine. One kid gets a full screen of Red and a few symbols. He wins 400 quarters. Another lady wins some nickels. I have a bucket of nickels and some cash. I give the people I'm with my nickels, and don't spend any cash."
"0134"	"(03/20/1996)"	"Couple Contest I'm with a bunch of people at a place that seems like the Veterans Administration building in Wilmerton. Among the people are my friends from high school Nate Nelling, Emily Zates, Wynette Black, Jerome Michaels, and Sam Kingsley. There is some sort of a contest or game going on. It involves couples. There is a movie theatre-like board on which couples' names are posted. Two couples play against each other at a time. I think I'm with my girlfriend Annie. It's getting down to the end: there are only 6 couples left. When the names are put up on the screen, the couples go around the side of the theatre into a shower-like area. I'm sitting at a table with a bunch of people. Jerome is talking technology. Sam is talking about something similar to that. The names of people that are in the contest are nicknames; comical. They might be dancing or singing/performing in the contest."
"0135"	"(03/20/1996)"	"Ramona is Bundled Up I'm outside at the Uptown Mall. My sister Ramona is there. She is all bundled up in snow pants, a huge jacket, mittens, etc. They are all too big for her. She is wearing my Milton hat. I think to myself: ""Didn't I give that to Nicole Peterson?"" ( I actually did in real life.) My friend Marge Drummond is there and she comments on Ramona's big, warm clothes."
"0136"	"(03/21/1996)"	"I'm Fake Crying I'm with my girlfriend Annie Thomas on the top bunk of a set of bunk beds. We're wearing very little clothing. She hugs me, and I hug her. She starts to cry. For some reason, I start to cry too. But I am faking the crying. I'm not really sad. I slip off the bunk bed in my fake despair and go out the door, and down the hall."
"0137"	"(03/21/1996)"	"A Drink With Tamara Thomas I'm in a big house with my girlfriend's mother, Tamara Thomas, and another woman who is older. I'm taking a table and small rug downstairs. I get the feeling that someone has just died. I know that dead person isn't on the side of the family that Tamara, I, and the old woman are there for. Tamara asks us if we want to have a drink of pop or juice or something, to talk. I want to and say yes. I bring the table and rug downstairs and put them away. I try to open the door, but it is the wrong one. Tamara tells me, ""The one straight ahead."" I had tried to open the door on the right. She stopped and corrected me. I put the stuff down. ON the walls there are clues. The clues are on small white cards. There are a few words on each card describing something. One can win a dead turkey, an alive dog, or 70 chicken strips as some of the prizes. One of my sister's friends from grade school Jaime, is doing well getting the clues. I am not."
"0138"	"(03/22/1996)"	"War Games in a Building I'm in a light blue van with a few other guys and we're heading into an underground parking ramp. Two men try to get us to stop. We slow, but don't stop, turning and going down to a lower level. When the men are out of sight we jump out of the van , leaving it and run to the stairs. We try to loose the men following us by going up stairs, then over, then up, then over, etc. I think we lose the men. I'm in a very big building, looking for someone or something to start me off. I go outside, nothing is there that I need or want. I go back in, and on the way in I see a girl who tells me that her friend Jaime likes me. I remember Jaime from last year. I have no clue what to do next. I go in and am in a stairwell. My roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens are there. I try to see up on this ""secret shelf"" on the stairway. I don't think anything is there. I am with some other people who are lost. WE find a map. Walking up to it, I see a man on the telephone giving mouth-to-mouth to another man. I quickly look away, thinking that one must have killed the other. It is pointed out to me that I am in the Delaware or Syracuse section of the building on the map. I am in a game, then. I have two straightened clothes hanger-like objects and a small ball, like a superb all. These are my weapons. We're upstairs in the building. Natasha and her friend are on my team for now; we can work together. There are enemies down the hall that go by. They are trooper-like and are wearing bright orange and black, and have rollerblades on. We need to get the keys. Some men are following us. A soldier that looks like Natasha runs towards us. I fun out, push her aside, and twist her head, breaking her neck. Then I yell for Natasha and her friend to come on. I run down the hall, grabbing an orange squirt gun on the way, and we clear an area. The area is like a library. We find both halves to a blue key, and they we are going to proceed upstairs."
"0139"	"(03/23/1996)"	"Van Trip To Iowa I'm with a group of people in a large van-like vehicle. We're going to somewhere in Iowa, and there is confusion about directions. My friends Emily Zates, Esther Thurman, and Tina Totts are there. They tell me I messed Valentines Day, which was March 17th. I laugh and say, ""Oh, well."" A lot of people decide to do some sit-ups. I do crunches. My junior high classmates Erin Jacobs and Kari Johnson are there. They talk about how they don't really talk to each other anymore. My friend Tom Napper's pull-up bar is there."

He is working out his triceps. I'm doing preacher curls in a funny way, changing repetitions and weight, doing one arm curls. My friend from high school Tina Totts is there and she has a baby. Another high school Classmate Adam Clinger"
"0141"	"(03/24/1996)"	"Homeroom In College I go into a classroom. It reminds me of my 5th grade classroom at Carter School. My desk is in the front left corner of the room. There is an old turkey sandwich wrapped in napkins in it. It is like homeroom in high school, but it is college. My friend from college Yvette Ullman is there sitting next to me, and we talk."
"0142"	"(03/25/1996)"	"The Lead-Follow Dream I'm in a group of people, including Blinky Ahmed, Gino Teavor, Mike Brimms, Melissa Cod, and Sarah Person, all of whom I know from high school. The older people are getting the younger ones to sign up for some sort of recycling drive. We are in or around Carter School. There are Asian, black, and white people. We're sitting in a circle or a triangle. It is organized, a group effort. A deep voice, which may be my neighbor Mr. Dinks , is singing. The words include, ""You've got to...beg...follow...through the night."""
"0143"	"(03/25/1996)"	"Three Watches I find my old pocket watch on my girlfriend Annie's necklace. I have my new watch, the old one, and part of a broken one. I find the lost watch in a pocket of my green jacket."

My friend Kevin is the lead man. If you don't follow directions, you can't fight. A kid says hi to me. His name is Nate, and I know him as a basketball player from another team. I go into the bathroom. The college basketball coach at Brimson, Yar Glenn, is urinating. Another kid is defecating."
"0145"	"(03/26/1996)"	"Supernova Apocalypse I'm in the kitchen at home with my mom, and my sisters Heather and Ramona. We are going to buy a hot tub. I'm scrubbing the floor, which is covered with mud. I'm wiping it up with a washcloth, and ask Heather to rinse the washcloth out. My mom is trying to figure out the finances for the hot tub. She has to make a $300 down payment, and later she is getting a $700 payment for something she is selling. Heather is really mad and ornery. My sisters and I go to pick up the hot tub. Before we leave, my mom tells my brother Wally and I to look after Heather. She writes us notes and puts them on the table. I go outside to the car parked in front of the house, and we look for the comet. I see a shooting star, and think that it is the comet. There are a lot of comet-like objects. Heather says she knows, and points it out. I remember what my Astronomy professor Rada said about it being between the big dipper and the little dipper. I look, and can't find it: there are too many stars, so I get into the car. We drive down Home Avenue to 3rd Street. The car is breaking down: the brakes don't work. We turn onto 3rd Street. I tell Heather to coast and pull over to the side of the road. I drag my feet to slow us down. We finally stop by the local convenience store. The car is now a bicycle, and I'm with my sisters and a family friend Amber Sherman. It has been light out for a long time, and it's now 7:00pm. The sun is very high in the sky for this time of day, I notice. I tell the girls that it can't be the sun; it must be a supernova. We stop. Amber's motorcycle is broken. The object in the sky in pulsating. It is small, but it grows. It is a supernova. I can see the outer layers of fire it is ejecting. The ejected blasts come closer and overtake the earth, engulfing it. I see fire and debris rushing and crashing over the horizon. I tell my sisters to hide under the back of the station wagon, which is down. I see fire shoot over our heads. It is certain doom. I wonder if people near water will live. The car we are hiding under is sure to explode. I think I want to be a survivor of this. People who are near lakes or oceans might be survivors."
"0146"	"(03/30/1996)"	"Injury Prone Run I'm in a forest where a marathon is taking place. There is a wide path with deep ruts in the muddy ground. The area is very wet. I'm going down a large, steep hill. A lot of the runners are injured. They have sprained ankles, pulled muscles, etc. Some have splint-like structures on their legs. The splints look like real human legs, so it looks like 2 legs on top of each other. I am to help the ailing runners, but first I need tot put a pencil in the small refrigerator at the bottom of the hill. I do, opening the door and tossing it in, and then go and help a man. He has a sprained ankle. My mom and I help him up. I ask him which leg is hurt. He says his left. When we stand up, he puts his weight on his left foot. I wonder if he is faking the injury. We help him to the top where there is a small tent. People can drive their cars up to it. Family friends Louise Manilla and Lois Schmelzer are there, helping the runners. Also, a man who may be Dick Zates is getting people's vehicles or helping people to their vehicles."
"0147"	"(03/30/1996)"	"Marge's Deceptive Visit I'm in a dorm with some people. Shawn Salzburg is lying on the bottom bunk. In a closet are my clothes. There are a few things I haven't worn since I came to college. I show people two basketball t-shirts with funny logos on them. One shirt says Above the Rim and the other something with the word Pole. I'm sitting down. My friends Marge Drummond, Nate Nelling, and George German come in. I greet them warmly. Marge says she's going to the bathroom. I didn't hear how her date with my friend Stephen went, so I follow her out to ask her. She walks down the hall, locking everyone's doors. The locks are on the outside of the doors. She does this to all the rooms on the left side of the hall. At the end of the hall are the bathrooms and a room for ballplayers to take batting practice. There are three guys that stayed in the women's bathroom overnight the previous night. They are with Marge. One of them tries to kiss Marge. I think they are seeing each other. But Marge turns away because I am there, and she knows I will tell Stephen."
"0148"	"(03/30/1996)"	"Kids Soliciting Milk I'm outside a large building on a college campus, like Middleton College or Washington University. There is a tour going on and some young black kids selling candy. One has a crate full of stuff that I look at. In it are some quarts of milk with two plastic cups on them, and some candy, jellybeans I think. There is a bin of plastic eggs nearby. People toss the eggs here after removing their candy contents. There is some candy on the ground: three pieces. I eat it."
"0149"	"(03/31/1996)"	"Green Carpeted Ramp I'm with a woman who may be my college economics teacher, in her car. She needs to find a cash machine. We find one at a school, and she gets out to get cash. Then I am driving with my mom. I'm telling her about my medicine that I take twice a day. It's getting dark. We drive by a huge company building. There are four or five huge garbage cans around the side of the building, built into the walls. There is a huge parking ramp in which our car is parked. My mom and I walk to the top level. It's late, most people have gone home, and the rest are leaving. Our car is parked right at the edge of the ramp, for which there are no walls, only metal cord going around the edge. I'm afraid we'll drive off the edge. The top of the ramp is covered with green plastic-like carpeting. My mom drives well, and we maneuver around a car and exit safely. I'm in back of a house that feels like Sjogren's house, which I used to deliver papers to in Oak Valley. There is a rabbit wrapped up in a cocoon-like structure, like a white web. It comes out. At first, I think it's a deer; it's brown. Then I see it's a huge gray rabbit! It talks to me like it's a baby. It helps me put big chunks of split wood in a baler. It has a Christmas ball tied to its tail. It has a long nose and can stand on two feet. It balances a chunk of wood on its head. The rabbit is slow: I could follow it as it hops around lethargically."
"0150"	"(03/31/1996)"	"Water Polo and a Pool Creature I'm at Armstrong High School to play a water Polo game. I think there is a winter storm outside. We hop in the pool and start fooling around. Among the people there are my friends Thad Templeton, Stephen Ramos, Sam Kingsley, Annette Gollum, Melanie McDyss and my girlfriend Annie Thomas. A basketball teammate from high school, John Kulik, may also be there. A group of kids and their leader arrive. We are restricted to the deep end of the pool, then. Before we start up, we all gather around the side of the pool. There are bunk beds there. The kid whose bed I am sitting on is on vacation. My friend Tom Napper talks about how he has urinated while on a cordless phone. I laugh and say I've done that too. A man named Hal and his mother are there and they laugh at that comment. Instead of real goals, there are two small rags on each side of the pool. IT looks like they are poked into cracks in the pool. I put a bunch of silver change in my pocket; dimes I think. I have the balls. Instead of real water polo balls, we are using three small yellow Velcro discs about the size of a penny. I have all three, and grip them in my left hand. I dive over the people in the pool and race towards the goal. I think I can catch them off guard and score. I make it to the other end. People are grabbing me and pushing me, trying to stop me from scoring. The goal is different now: it is an indentation in the side of the pool. One of the discs has to be put in it to score. I punch or thrust my arm and head into the opening with a maximum effort. People are on me. I think I score. Then we are down by the other team's goal. One of the yellow discs has burst, and en eye came out of it. I give the disc and eye to Thad. I yell for Annette. I large woman and her clan of kids comes over. Her name is Annette too. I tell her no, that I meant Annette Gollum. A security guard then walks around the edge of the pool. He jumps in feet first, in full uniform. He surfaces a little later with a glass jar of pink grapefruit juice and something else. The lady Annette and the guard tell us of something that is in the pool, that has been lurking around. A person names Winston is in the pool, underwater. He is clothed, and upside down. He has blown out all his air. Kyle Rappaport is on the bottom of the pool, in the fetal position. Someone says something about this creature that is in the pool. I look down at Winston and Kyle and see that they are being held down by a black tentacle-like ribbon of flesh. The tentacles are coming out of a grate on the bottom of the pool. I realize Winston has been there for an hour and is dead, and that Kyle has been there 10 or 15 minutes and is probably dead too. Then the tentacles loosen. Their bodies begin to float up. I yell and run away. I know these people are dead. I stop and get some change from the bunk bed before I leave the area."
"0151"	"(04/01/1996)"	"Crossing Orange Juice Pool I'm moving into the second floor of the Billings Hall dorm. My new roommate is named Eric, who is a soccer player at Brimson with the brown bushy hair. We are going on a weekend trip in a van. I go up to the door and his stuff is outside the door in a blue duffle bag. I walk in the room, and he goes out for a minute. All of his stuff is settled in. It's like I moved in late. I go to the bathroom. I'm carrying a yellow tub of popcorn. There are some objects in the popcorn; snack pack pudding containers or clams. I go down a set of stairs to get to the bathroom. The stairs are wide. I see my friend's father Dilbert Simpson. He laughs at a story of me, something that happened a while back involving fish. We joke about the people serving fish one night at this weekend gathering we are going to. Dilbert says he wishes he could be in my group; be my group leader. I keep going to the bathroom. I cough up some phlegm. I go in the women's bathroom by mistake, and then go out. I have a bucket of scrambled eggs. I am trying to cross a swimming pool-like body of orange juice using a rope that is taut about 6 feet above the level of the surface. I spill some eggs, and end up gripping what's left of them in a baseball glove-like manner. My dad and my step mom Lisa are there. I think Lisa is saying something about not mixing the orange juice right: it being bad. I am trying not to touch the juice. I get close to the other side, but don't quite make it. The rope is cut and I fall into the juice. I am still hanging on to the rope trying to get out of the pool. The rope is then cut on the other side of the pool, and goes slack."

When we get inside, it is a Greasepit burger joint with a Rax Restaurant shape. My mom pays for everyone, even the employees. My friend Matt Yams is there working, along with another kid and a woman. They order a lot of food: two burgers each, fries, soda, and pies. It costs a lot. My friend Kevin Simpson works there. He gives me a bad glass of Pepsi. I think I asked for a Mountain Dew and a Dr. Pepper. The Pepsi is either too sweet or not sweet enough. The kid is punching up the till to find our order. The till breaks down. I tell him to add it up by hand. He can't do it, and gets mad."

I have a small tube the side of a toilet paper tube, with which I am shooting paintballs which don't go very fast. The van and the action go away. An ambulance goes by. A woman says to go to 50th or 51st Street. She speeds off and we try to follow her. I am having a lot of trouble with the car I am driving, which may be my mom's car. I have a drunken friend in the passenger seat. I am by my home in Oak Valley. My friend Matt Yams and I are on bikes. We turn from 1st Street onto Home Avenue going north. There is heavy traffic. I get behind a vehicle with a boat. It slows and pulls over to the right, without brake lights. I realize the person driving is my dad. I think to go past him on the left, looking in the boat as I do to see if he got any fish. Matt rides off to the alley of the block between Home and Next Avenues. He's going north. I stop my dad, pulling him over to the right. I am on the sidewalk on the right side of the car. I tell my dad that Matt is around the corner and we're going to pick him up and go fishing. My dad says okay."

We're in an old gym with fully tile-like floors playing basketball. I remember looking down at the court from balcony. We aren't making very m any shots. My arms feel rubbery. There is a pole vault contraption built into the floor. It pops up when you step or bounce a ball on it. We walk out the north side of the gym. My friend Nate Nelling is with us. We are going to visit our friend Tony Kramer who goes to Washington, because I know Nate will want to. Stephen is there and I know he doesn't want to go but we are going anyways, because Nate wants to go. We start walking. There is a monastery on our right and people are sitting; we can see though a window. A man and a woman walk across the path. They are older, and neither is wearing shirts. The woman is fat, and looks like a man. I can't distinguish her breasts. We are near a river with some debris in it, including wood pallets, a suitcase, and frogs. A lot of frogs are in and around the river. We can see them well even though they are down a steep rocky bank about 50 feet away. I'm in a shelter with no walls, like at Mud Lake. There is a stream flowing out of it. I'm sitting at the edge of the stream and grab two frogs. They urinate a lot, much more than they weigh! I think I throw a frog at my friend Ivory Alshire, and want to give the other to my brother Wally, who is getting his photograph taken with a girl. Someone criticizes me for this."

We talk about towels: if they are meant to warm a person. I open the doors to the porch. There are no handles so I just push them open gently. As soon as I walk out to the porch Tamara reprimands me. The porch is off-limits because that is where Mr. Peterson died. I move to close the door and leave everything in order. The house tilts, like it is on a ledge. I tell everyone to get to the other side of the house so George German and I can straighten the porch up and keep the weight balanced at the same time. They do, but there is still too much weight on our half so I tell George to go over to the other side too. I go back on the porch. There are boxes of breakfast cereal and empty beer bottles on my left. On my right are three or four pairs of shoes. There is a white table cloth-like rug that needs to be put down. While I scramble to put the bottles in their case, the house is tilting down on my side. It tilts all the way, even though I'm the only one on that side. I get the stuff in order, and straighten the shoes: one tall black pair of boots, my Nike hiking boots, and my Vans. There is a clear pair of glass or gel boots that are missing. Someone is wearing them. I put the rug down and close the doors. I think the house is tilted back to normal now. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. I'm in the kitchen, having come from the porch. Melanie comes up to me and looks like she is going to hug me, so I am going to hug her back. But she pulls my head and cheek down with her left hand and kisses me on the lips. I'm surprised! I try to hug her, and she thinks I'm going to try to kiss her again, and that isn't what she wants, so she holds me back. I indicate to her I didn't want to kiss her, just hug, so we do. Then we joke about me being clean and brushing my teeth."
"0157"	"(04/02/1996)"	"Temperature Gauge Doesn't Fool Me I'm in a machine room. There are some temperature gauges. There is a man with me. When the man looks at the gauges they show a low temperature. When he looks away, they swing back up to high temperatures. They are always high, except when he looks. There is a swimming pool outside. There are some little boys in it. I dive in. It is shallow, and I smack my head, cutting it on the top rear portion. There are some women and their children around. I am holding a little boy and we are walking out to the center of this pool. I have blood covering my face, the boy tells me, and I feel it. I want to go under the water, but all the blood would taint the water and there are women with kids in the pool. So I start backing out to the shallow part. I get out of the pool and go to wash off. The ladies with kids look at me, all bloody, in horror. A male police officer comes. He is cocky. I tell him I know: I wash going to wash the blood off..."

There is a hand, actually a thumb, in the picture, over her underwear, like there is some sexual element about it. There is a photograph of me last summer with long hair that is slicked back. In the picture I am tan. There is also a photograph of me with a kid that I baby-sat down at the local park catching frogs. In the photograph, I am 18 or 19 years old. But, the pond at that park was filled in several years before I turned 18."

We are on the east side of Wilmerton, and I ask people around if there used to be and outdoor movie theatre around here. They point in out on the left. The fat kid who said ""don't be a dick"", that I know from a college game of Assassin, and a girl, are there. We talk about the theatre. We are headed out to a ski jump by Blinky Ahmed's house. A car and a rope are pulling me, going really fast. I jump a curb by Carter school and let go of the rope, skidding to a stop in the adjacent rectory driveway. I have only one ski on. There were three of us. I take my ski off."

A neighbor kid, Andy Jones, is there. He is really drunk and is shouting racial slurs. My classmate Lance Drift, who is black (while the rest of us are white), tells him to keep quiet. There are a group of ""gangsters"" that are going to shoot Andy for making the slurs. Lance tries to stop them. Jimmy is drinking straight Vodka and chasing it with beer. He vomits."

I hold onto two objects, on in each hand. My arms are spread out like I'm flying. We keep dropping. I think I am the reason we are dropping, so I try to pull up on the chairs using my arms. It doesn't work. We're at 20,000 feet. I jump out of the plane with a parachute. No one will probably ever see me again. I think we are over an ocean."

I try to give her instructions. We finally get turned. I toss out the anchor, and tell her to stop the motor. We keep going. The anchor rope goes taut. The boat capsizes. Nate and Emily are somehow in another vessel. I am struggling to lift the boat upward and flip it over like a canoe. I finally do.

His older brother or brother-in-law comes in and sits down in a chair. He is angry with Mark for faking death. He and I exchange words. I ask him to leave, and he does. Mark was in Chicago for a long time. He did fake his death. Outside the deck doors are little children with dark skin, a rabbit or two, and a dog that are dancing to some sort of beat. Their ankles are shackled together. Mark's father and mother are there. She is nursing a little boy. His sister comes in and says to me, ""Thanks for telling us (that Mark is alive).""

She gives me a t-shirt. It's for my sister, because tomorrow is her birthday. Nicole is very forward, while Persia is shyer. Persia comes over to the side of the bed and sits down behind Nicole.

It consists of a plastic cylinder with a sliding plastic cylinder inside it. We walk out right past the guys. I might have the sword. One of them says, ""You need it."" Then there is a chase. We go behind Mason Cafeteria and cross Brighton Avenue, using bombs that are M&M's to stop traffic. We elude the men, and go to a school that is for science and math ""nerds"". Everyone at the school works very hard. My friend Nate Nelling is there. We have a ghost guide as we enter. It is like a house.

I grab his friend by the neck and slam him down on the floor. It is the kid from my Astronomy class with blond hair. I recognize him, but Nat says that this is his friend Jaime.

I get a gun from them. We load our guns. I get a big black revolver. I want a lot of bullets, but I only get three. The bullets are oval, and have two holes in them. (See notebook for sketch).

I put the crack in my razor case. I run. I want to get rid of it. I can't give it to Bubba, because he is in the Military Police branch of the National Guard. There is a locker full of stolen money. I put two 20-dollar bills in a nearby locker in case I need them. I can't remember the combination or I can't get the locker open. My sister Heather has a remote sensing device. She uses it to sense feelings. She is on the roof of our house, and I am on the main floor. She knows where I am, and is after me. I take my mom's car and escape."

She and Virginia Hamms have just taken all my socks and underwear and hid them in the attic above to my old room, but the attic is instead above the hallway. The small square cut out in the ceiling in my room is in the hall, so I grab a chair to reach it. Amy is real close, and I am vulnerable if she would knock the chair out form under me or do anything else. I poke my head and torso up through the hole. To my left are my socks and underwear, and to my right some boxes and a bike. The attic is larger than in real life. My friend Tom Napper is there. He has a camera, and I'm going to take a photograph of the clothes. I look through the lens on the fancy camera, trying to get it all in focus. I take a photograph by accident with the camera pointed in the wrong direction. Tom somehow squeezes through the hole at the same time I'm in it, and takes the camera to take a photograph."

My dad is putting on long white socks with red stripes and red and white hi-top shoes. The game is in a small racquetball-like room. There is some stuff in the room we'll have to move. My dad talks and jokes with me about the last time we all had a big basketball game. I guess there is a big 6'8"" guy and I beat him last time.

Hilary gets a bite and reels in a black bear cub! She lifts it up by the line. I'm going to cut the line. The bear starts eating its way up the line, so I cut it halfway up the pole. The bear falls to the ground when I cut it. It looks like it's in pain. I'm afraid the mother bear will come to help it, so I run away. I cross Home Avenue, as if I were at home, and as I do I look up. On an invisible plane above my house is the mother bear, pacing. I run in the alley of the block between Home and Next Avenues. There are dogs in cages that lunge towards me as I run by. They are all around me. There is a dragon. It is evil: the devil. It is flying out from an eerie orangish-colored full moon. I am running back up the alley of my block, towards home. I can run and jump 20 or 30 feet in the air, touching branches high over the alley. The dragon is the devil, and it comes swirling out of the moon. I send all my powers to combat it. Some asked me if it was evil. I lied and said no."
"0198"	"(04/23/1996)"	"Zelling's are in Rome I'm in the Zelling's house. My friends the Zelling twins and their parents are in Rome. There is a little girl there. It could be their sister. My girlfriend Annie comes over in a truck. It's getting late, dark out. They left their dog in the house. I am there 12 hours: from noon to midnight. There is a $6,000 grand piano, an Uno deck, and the dog to keep me occupied. I play with the dog. The little girl is secluded. I don't talk to her. When Annie arrives, she feeds the dog and talks to the girl. Annie was eating a granola bar. I am eating a banana."

I try to stop these snowmobiles. The offenders (the snowmobilers ?) are chased. The head policewoman is hard-core. There may be a movie being filmed. There are dogsleds there. There are two dogs, one of which is swimming. I go out on the ice and call it to me. It comes up and licks my face."
"0200"	"(04/28/1996)"	"Cutting The Congressional Record I'm in my yard at home near the tree where the old tire swing used to hang. There is a drunk entertaining man there. People seem to like him, but I don't. I am flipping some branches around with another branch. My friend Melanie McDyss, her friend, and my classmate Krista Coulson are there. There is a large wood-like block that I have. It is the congressional record. I am using a wood saw to cut it into three pieces, and then am placing them in my duffel bag. I tell people I am cutting the congressional record."
"0201"	"(04/30/1996)"	"Brian Herder's Construction I'm watching an opera, but it's outside and there are two younger children performing in it. It finishes quickly and people leave. I am at the local convenience store. It has three levels. On the top floor there is a bar. Some teenagers go there and buy soft drinks. The main level is the one with the cash register, and the lower level goes to al back door from which you must jump down three feet to get to the ground. My mom is there. We parked her station wagon in a driveway-like space on the west side of the store. There is another station wagon exactly alike ours parked in front of ours. My mom has some bags of food. I'm going to put them in the car so we can leave. I need the keys. The bags are heavy and the plastic handles rip when I pick the bags up. I get the keys and carry the bags in my arms. A girl is with me, helping. There is a long line to get into the store. I check in a notepad for something. I'm with my mom and we're in the yard of a house that is under construction. New siding is being put on the house. The yard is a mess. A man named Brian Herder is doing the construction. His employee says that a job like this would go for $2,000 on an Indian reservation, but here only two. I ask him, ""Two what?"" He doesn't reply. My mom knows Brian through her brother/my uncle Rusty Redding. Brian and her hug each other. Brian is kind of dumb: mentally slow. He talks about the construction project that went on a church, and how it wasn't organized and run well. We drive in a car. The Hispanic man with a moustache from Mason Cafeteria is driving, but I get the feeling that he is Brian Herder. We're headed for home. We are then crawling through the yards of two houses across the street from our home. I explain to my mom and Brian the difference between a symbol and a sign, and how the difference lies in the relationship to the referent. There is snow on the ground. It is yellow from dog urine."
"0202"	"(05/01/1996)"	"Attending A Play I'm at a play in a small theatre. I'm sitting behind a rich couple. I annoy them. I want to leave early, at the intermission, and I do. It is really bad acting. Later, I am at home explaining to my sister Heather how a dream I had relates to her life. She understands what it means. In the dream there are four black men who come to see her. I am sleeping on the living room floor. One guy says that he and Heather had sex. There are blue chips, like for poker, involved. I say the dream was about promises, and that it showed two sides of Heather's personality. I know this contradicts the Gestalt theory of dreaming."
"0203"	"(05/02/1996)"	"Two Men Marry Same Woman There are tulips scattered in the country. There are some on blocks near my house. A man and a woman are courting each other. I want to marry the woman. The man also wants to marry the woman. There is a large crane down by my neighbor Jim Beam's parent's house. It will stretch across town."

They are Girbaud shorts that I cut off in the 10th grade. They are huge: very baggy. I have a belt. They look black on me, though they are really blue. I don't wear them. My favorite pair of shorts isn't there."

All four of us are going to stay in the same bed. There is a folding card table there. My friend Sam Kingsley may be in place of Melvin now, in the bed. I don't get into the bed because I feel uncomfortable. I sleep somewhere else. Later a wake up and the girl is sleeping on another bed. The door to the room is swinging open. I get up to close it. Before I do, I look out to see if anyone is in the hall. No one is there. Some of the other doors are swinging open. I flick the lights in our room on and off to help me see if any intruders are there. I see a figure standing by the window. It is the resident assistant for the floor of my dorm, Jeanette. She has a gun. She turns away from the window and walks towards the bed where the girl is sleeping, pointing the gun at the girl. I pull a gun out of my coat pocket. She is threatening to kill the girl. I point my gun at her, and may have to kill her because she is a threat."
"0206"	"(05/05/1996)"	"Wolites and Dreaming True I'm in a classroom, which may be an old psychology building at Brimson. I think I'm in my professor Jerry Rice's class. He tells us about a few things. The first is that after a person starts recording their dreams, in about a month they usually being ""dreaming true"". I recognize the term immediately. He describes it as a different kind of dreaming, distinct from normal dreaming. I can't remember his exact words. The second thing he talks about is something called a ""wolite"". A wolite is when you get a song stuck in your head and hear it over and over. A man says that his dream journal and life journal/diary are in the same notebook. This is the same as me!"
"0207"	"(05/05/1996)"	"Kevin Capsizes Boat I'm at Mud Lake with my friend Kevin. His boss John is there, as well as John's kids. The family is on the fishing pier. Kevin and I are going fishing. Our boat in heading out from shore by the pier. Kevin and John are talking about wages. Kevin is using his characteristic cautiousness. John says something about the wage of $6.00/hour. John isn't looking at me, because he knows $6.00/hour is a poor wage and I will tell him so. I say that if I'm able to get a better paying job working less hours I'm going to have to take it. Kevin says something jokingly about getting paid $12.00/hour. We head out fishing. There are two boats: Kevin in one and I in the other. But we are not in the boats, or, at least, Kevin is not in a boat. John tells Kevin to roll the boat, for some reason having to do with what will happen to the contents of it. I am impatient to start fishing, and am annoyed with Kevin pondering whether to roll the boat and risk losing our fishing gear. I ask Kevin if there is a battery in the boat. He says yes. I say then lets go! Kevin flips the boat over. I think the contents will sink, but they float back up. They are a snowboard and another flat object. I sit on them in the water, keeping them submerged, to show that whatever Kevin and John were doing wouldn't work, though in fact it did. I stand up and throw the objects, admitting they were right. I am over by the swimming area with a diving mask on. I'm in the water but I run up on shore for a little bit. There are dog feces all over the shore. I run back into the water. It stays very shallow. There are dog feces all over the lake bottom. I can see them in the water, which is 4-6 feet deep. I try to five with my mask. There is a skeleton of a small animal, a snake I think, and a turtle claw print in the sand. There is a live snake there. It is too shallow for diving. I want to get out to the boat."
"0208"	"(05/05/1996)"	"Uncomfortable With Elise I'm at Armstrong with either my friend Kevin or Stephen. We are walking down the main hallway towards the office. We get to the last set of doors, which we can see through because they are made of glass. My friends Elise Rooks and Esther Thurman are walking towards us on the other side of the glass doors. I run up to them and say hi. There are a bunch of groups of two, three, and four people outside the office socializing, all of my Armstrong graduating class. I am with Elise and Esther. I am uncomfortable with Elise because we recently kissed and fondled each other at a party (in real life). There is a disturbance on the south side of the building. A bunch of people goes to check it out. Kevin is among them. I walk down the hall past the guidance office. My friend Niles Zelling is there. I guess that he and his brother Tim came up to Wilmerton. I'm in the back seat of a car. Tim is driving. Niles and his friend are on the side of the road. We're about to go across the Main River on a bridge."

I know this, but I ask her if she has that class anyways. I feel uncomfortable in the area because I am older than all the students. I feel like I am an intruder. I try to act appropriate. A woman who is a year younger than I in school, Analisa Paulsen, is there."

We're in a big bed, and have been up all night. It's 6:50 am, and I've gotten no sleep. She is wearing her flower underwear. We playfully push and shove each other. I wonder if I should kiss her. I turn the television on, and adjust the volume, then turn it off. I hear people outside the house, a tapping sound. It is my classmate Molly Villareal and others from Brimson. I go outside to kick their ass. I get to the bottom of the stairs and Annie grabs the back of my shirt, holding me. I am mad. What is she doing, I think? My siblings come out. They are having a surprise second anniversary party for Annie and I. I am surprised! I punch Annie in the chest, fairly hard. I also punch my brother Wally. I am in an awkward position. There are four candles, two for Annie and two for myself. There are in a small plastic cup of 7-Up."

My brother Wally, Pat Keiser from my economics class, and I go. You have to dress up. My truck is in my neighbor Gary Stein's yard. My dad tries to start it up, but it doesn't work. I try, but it is already running. My dad must have gotten it started. I pull it out to drive away. A man gives me a ticket for a traffic or parking violation. It is bogus. I go into the kitchen and yell at this man angrily for being subjective. His ticket observation was subjective. My dad is driving. We're going to Redson to the show. My sister Ramona sticks her head out the bathroom window and asks when we'll be home. We are leaving at 10:00 am. It takes an hour and a half each way, plus the time spent there. I tell her we'll be home late. She is worried."

The bed is turned so the top bunk has one end resting on Jens' desk. Here is a space between the bed and the wall. Jens leaves in the morning. His uncle is on trial in Wilmerton. I'm responsible for getting him there. Two others and I go out to a car in a ramp full of old beat up cars. The one we are driving is a station wagon. There is broken glass in the back seat. I brush it off. I say the quickest way to Wilmerton is Superhighway 100. A guy disputes it and suggests an alternative route. We back out, smashing into cars on the way. We break through the entrance/exit door and smash into a car in which there are two men trying to shoot us. We crush their car and keep pressing the gas pedal to smash it further. Then we speed off. The two guys are after us. I'm with Eddie Murphy in a long drag racing-like car. He is in front. They are shooting at us in a small forest and field, while we speed around in the car. I wonder why we just don't drive away to safety. I want to. Bullets are not hitting us, but they very easily could be. I am playing cards. I get 5-of-a-kind in the form of two 10's and three 6's, which are wild."

He loses very badly. I watch."

It is on the opposite side of the hallway than where it actually is. The dorm bathroom is in their room. I say to Rachel it must be weird having the bathroom in their room. Then I decide they must get used to it. I'm going to take a shower. The shower is really small, and I have to kneel. I can see over the shower curtain. I use a dandruff shampoo. Rachel walks towards the shower. I can see from her shoulders up, over the shower curtain. I can tell she isn't wearing a shirt. We talk. There is a little door-like space that she opens in the curtain. I can see her breasts, which are very nice. She can see me naked, kneeling and washing myself with a bar of soap. I cover up my genitals. She stands there and we talk. After a short while I stop covering my genitals, moving my hands. It is an uncomfortable feeling. I man comes in and helps Rachel move stuff around the room. Her roommate Laura is sleeping in a bed. I didn't notice this before."

It is built into the seat in front of us. We are skydiving, but not by choice. We have to throw one parachute out and then jump after it. We don't know how to skydive. We jump and try to grab the parachute. I am then observing the dream. I see two bodies and one parachute in the distance. One body falls; I know it is Annie's. I must have grabbed the parachute. Our goal was to cling to each other so we both could make it safely to the ground. I either wake up, or realize I am dreaming and rewind the dream, until the two bodies are together in the air again."

The back door is unlocked. My sister Ramona is sleeping on the loveseat. I say to her, ""Who broke in?"" She tells me that a man was here earlier, when my sister Heather was home, but he was here to do something. Ramona runs upstairs, and I follow. She checks my green covered clay pot in the small closet where my belongings are stored. My money in the pot is gone! I am angry! I have been saving the money to deposit it. I am mad: damn!"

She puts her hand down my pants. I laugh and put her town, saying that it's tough to carry her when she has her hand down my pants. We kiss, and end up on the ground. Annie wants to have sex. Emily and Nate are right around the corner. We move out of sight and have sex. I wake up, and have overslept: it's 3:00 pm. I am wearing condom. I slept through two hours of Gilligan's Island. I was going to call Nate to go fishing. My friends Nat Miller and Tom Napper are there. My mom is there too. She is teaching and having meetings, and isn't home much. (This was a false awakening. I dreamed the awakening.)"

It is a tall male with side burns. It is my friend Stephen. Next to him in another spirit, who is a shorter female spirit with long dark hair. It is my classmate Lexi Mondragon. There is a spirit lying on the floor that might be sleeping. I don't know more about it. The fourth spirit is small and is hovering in the air. I try to talk to the spirits; to communicate. They don't respond. I speak directly at the Stephen and the Lexi spirit, saying their name and my characteristic noise: ""Grrrrrr!"" I throw a pillow at them. It goes through the Stephen spirit. His physical apparition then disappears and the clothes that he was wearing then stand empty. His body reappears in five seconds. I ask the holy light of god to surround and protect me. I try to stand up and walk. I am very shaky and my vision is blurred. I sit down. I awaken in the dream, and am nearly lucid. The figures fade momentarily, and then return as I drift back into a lucid state. I can feel myself speaking, trying to get the attention of the spirits. I am in a pre-lucid state. I awaken, and think I should have asked the spirits who they were and what their purpose was."

In back there are a bunch of fire-escape-like ladders. A man in green is up on one of the ladders. We can't go up the ladders because there is a dispute occurring on a hill nearby. A group of men are arguing or harassing some people. A black man shoots a woman. I scramble for cover, but make sure I can see to tell police what I saw. I run and hide. My roommate Jens Nils and his friend hide too. They are riding bicycles. Jens tells me of something that just happened. I tell him of this shooting, of the racist aspect of it. I'm with my friends Tom Napper, Nat Miller, Niles Zelling, and Tim Zelling. We are robbing a bank. We go in through the roof and rafters, and jump down onto some wooden blocks. The door of the bank is open. There are two girls there. On of them is the daughter of the bank owner. There are pots, sculptures, and some stocking hats on wood pedestals, like a museum.

The pit boss comes and shoves the chips at the Indian man. My teammates Tony Kramer and others from Armstrong High School basketball are there. We are standing around. I am sitting. A few guys from Rival High School walk by, including Al Tall, who is a guy I often played against. We say hi. There is a big sign up explaining the rules to this special kind of Black Jack. The player gets incentives: if he gets dealt blackjack with a jack of clubs or a green queen it is something special. I am going to sit down with the Indian man and play. The dealer looks at me weird, and may be trying to tell me that I wouldn't or couldn't win."

Something happens in my sister Ramon's room. I urinate with lots of people next to me. Someone is wearing a sturdy brown construction belt. A girl talks to me about another man, whom I later learn to be my old basketball teammate Ron Lind, ""He kissed me and sucked my tits."" She says it in a way that makes it sound like she was harassed. I say to her, ""Did you suck him off?"" We get in a fight."
"0240"	"(06/07/1996)"	"Fighting Ron Lind I get in a fight with my high school basketball teammate Ron Lind. He is big and strong and powerful. I beat him up. I block his blows. I crush him. He looks dead. I don't want to hurt him, but I will do whatever it takes for him to leave me alone. He keeps coming at me. He is hanging by a rope upside down, his flesh torn away. He uses his eyes, which are still good, to repair himself. He should be dead."
"0241"	"(06/07/1996)"	"Lucid Shooting Olympic Men I'm near train tracks. Metal posts or beams run along the tracks. I am moving along the tracks. The beams seem to shift in and out. I need to get through their fence-like structure, but I'm afraid to get hit by one when I jump through. I avoid the jump and go down some subway-like stairs to the left of the tracks. There is a mirror in the room at the bottom of the stairs. I go back up another staircase, and see men sitting on cement blocks. It is the Olympics, I think. I realize I'm dreaming. I am going to shoot the people. I reach the top of the stairs and am going to shoot them but have no gun. I run and leap off the castle wall-like structure the men were sitting on. I fly. Looking down, it's thousands of feet to the ground. I'm really high up. The wind is strong. It gives me a bad feeling to fly over places like England, Japan, and Springfield. It is windy there. Some places are okay."
"0242"	"(06/09/1996)"	"Meeting James At the Thomas' I'm at my girlfriend Annie's house in a room that is not normally there. I am talking to Annie's sister Tina. Annie's sister Jessica and her boyfriend James are sitting on the couch. Later, I think the boy is the Thomas' cousin. Annie comes into the room. She has just gotten up from sleep. She asks me softly how long I've been here. She is angry that I was at her house and she didn't know it. She is on the cough, and I am on the floor next to the couch. We wrestle jokingly."
"0243"	"(06/10/1996)"	"Wooden Rodeo I'm at a rodeo. We're all in a small barn-like structure. The rodeo itself is probably only 20 feet squared. I see one guy ride. He gets bucked off the steer right away. Another guy then tries. He is bigger and stronger. He rides well, and gets a good time. He is a beast, just like the bull. The arena is small and made of wood. I am leery of it being able to hold the bull, so I seek higher ground. My friend Stephen is there, as is the short fat bouncer from my high school. Stephen drags me on the dirt floor, jokingly. The bouncer gets us all to come and look at a wooden box-like structure that holds a couple of jugs of soda pop, one on each end of the inside of the box. One is ginger ale. The other may be 7-Up. In the middle is a glass where the two are mixed and the bouncer wants us to use this as a television ad. I say that it is dumb, and it won't work."
"0244"	"(06/10/1996)"	"Eating Donuts With Ellie I'm sitting by a heater vent like the ones in my home. A woman comes and sits across from me in a chair. I say, ""Hi, I'm Kenneth."" Her name is Ellie. She isn't from here; she is the guest of a friend. I look over in a corner, and see my friend Binky Ahmed talking to a woman. My classmate Elise Rooks is there at some sort of a stand. She and my girlfriend Annie come over to chat with me. We have a box of donuts. My history teacher from high school comes over and changes the heater vent that I'm sitting by. I smile. He is a good guy. Then we're outside on a street with the box of donuts, eating them. Elise has a long anteater-like nose that she sticks in the box. I eat a lot of donuts. I run to the local college liquor store in Woodland, I think to empty the box. There is no liquor there. I know that all I have is a driver's license. I run back. I am wearing winter boots, running through puddles. I pass a man and woman and tell them that it's the same for all couples; that everyone goes through the same stuff. I have to call Annie, then Elise to buy at the liquor store. Then I call Ellie because she is the one I want. I run up to Home Ave and 2nd St, as if I were in Oak Valley."
"0245"	"(06/10/1996)"	"Served With My DL I am at a restaurant with Annie and I use my driver's license as identification to buy alcohol. I'm surprised and happy that it works, since I'm not 21. We leave the restaurant because the other guys we are with couldn't get served. Among them is my high school friend Lyle Zeffman. I am disappointed. Annie and I had already ordered out food. We walk out. I leave a $3.00 tip for the waiter."
"0246"	"(06/14/1996)"	"Melvin Redding Eating Sweets I'm trying to solve a mystery. I am trying to find a killer. There is a small snake that turns into a huge snake, which is many times the size of a person. There is a boar. The boar and the snake fight. I think the boar wins. There is a ghost, which is nearly invisible, to my left. I catch a glimpse of it, and turn my attention to it. I'm in the basement. Between old bed mattresses I find a little boy. It is my cousin Melvin Redding. Melvin talks about eating a piece of pie and another sweet thing off a tray full of sweets."
"0247"	"(06/14/1996)"	"Clubbing Men With Frying Pan I'm outside in a dark place. It is night. I'm in a group of people. There is a large satellite dish there that is changing the direction it is pointed. It points into the ground and digs into the dirt sometimes. People that are there are moving their arms in different directions like they are tuning into something. I think they are trying to contact other beings. There is place in the sky where the clouds are cleared away and brilliant stars show through. I have a black cast iron frying pan. There is a spotlight that is looking for people. It might be cast my aliens. My friend Stephen and I evade the light; the aliens don't see us. The aliens might be taken over. Stephen and I stab and beat two men. We hit them with large rocks in our hands and club the men with the frying pan. We try to injure or kill them. The men are resistant. They adapt to the beatings. The blows don't hurt the men anymore, and the men turn on us."
"0248"	"(06/14/1996)"	"Carrying Willow Naked I am on a snow-covered slope. I meet my aunt Willow Redding, and she introduces me to a friend of hers. We are going up this snowy slope. I'm wearing a plastic body suit with a Velcro mitten on it. I also have gloves. We are on a mission, but I get side tracked. Willow slips on the slope. I help her up because I have shoes with good soles. Later, Willow is naked. She gets on my back and I carry her easily up some stairs."
"0249"	"(06/16/1996)"	"Bag At High School I'm at a high school in the inner part of a big city. It's the last day of school. I'm going to lift weights, but I can't for some reason. I leave but forget my cap and bag. I go back to get them. The track team is practicing outside. I interrupt the practice when I walk through. I hump over a fence to get my stuff. My friend Stephen is there."
"0250"	"(06/16/1996)"	"Killer Then Families Killed I'm by an ocean with my family. I'm watching a television show. I don't realize it is television until later. It goes like this: A courtroom is full as a judge walks in. The defending lawyer is late. The defendant is a balding round middle age man. He is sitting on the defendant's side of the courtroom, wearing sunglasses. The judge asks him to explain, so he does, from his seat. He says a few words. The he falls to the floor, and is dead. He was poisoned, but a capsule fell from his fingers a moment before he died. The dead defendant slides on his stomach, head first, out the courtroom. It is like the floor is slanted. There is a feud between the friends and family of the defendant and the friends and family of the plaintiff. Each of these people dies, alternating from defendant supporter to plaintiff supporter. One of the men who dies is wheeling his wheelchair across train tracks going over a river. A train comes while the man is on the tracks above the river. Before he can get off the tracks he is hit by the train and dies. This is what I see on television. My three siblings and I watch this on television. My sister Heather is flirting with me. I don't say anything and don't flirt back. I know what she doesn't know. She doesn't know I am her brother, until some family friends, the Kissengers, walk by and say, ""Hi Hanson kids!"" Then she realizes who I am."
"0251"	"(06/17/1996)"	"In Outer Space I'm in outer space. A shuttle blasts off. The people I am with clap and cheer. Annie is on the shuttle. People are floating in the air. We lose sight of the shuttle because of a rotating planet. It might come back later. My old teammate Ron Lind is there. He has a sweater. The sleeves of the sweater are different shades of yellow. We are floating. I move around, trying to rid myself of something."
"0252"	"(06/18/1996)"	"Back On Franklin Second I'm in Franklin Hall's second floor as a sophomore but in my first-year dorm room. I have the feeling both of moving in and of moving out. I must be moving in because I'm in the wrong room. I move some of my stuff down the hall to a suite. It is big and has four beds. It looks like one person has already moved in. I think we'll get along okay with the other two people. There is a bathroom in the corner and stairs leading up away from the room. Back in my old room, my friend Melanie McDyss comes in. I am happy to see her. She has longer hair than she used to. She is really hungry. She asks me for food. All I have is Country Time lemonade mix. My high school classmate Sal Watson chases my college friend Ivory Alshire into my room. They are flirting. Ivory says to me, ""Nice thighs."" I am wearing no pants. My high school friends Kevin Simpson and Edith Sherman show up. Edith has not left for Chicago yet. Kevin lives on the fourth floor. I tell him to carry something of mine up to the third floor where I live. I am moving out."
"0253"	"(06/18/1996)"	"Twin Men @ Annie's I'm at Annie's house. There is a huge empty room on one of the upper floors on the north side of the house. There is a computer in it and her mother has just been fiddling with it to get it to work. There is a large screen and a mouse. The Thomas' have cleaned the room and two other rooms for guests. In this room are staying twin young men whose families are known to Annie from Prancy College. The young men are heavier, and are in town for a sports tournament. They start to get settle din. Annie leaves. She has to go somewhere. I feel neglected, like I have recently in our relationship. I get ready to go. I tie my cross-trainers too tight. I have a duffle bag and blankets with me. I pack up. The guys thought I was staying there. I say no, I got to go smuggle pigs. I say, ""It's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it..."" That is my excuse to get out of the company of people that are aiding in the destruction of my relationship with Annie. I am jealous. Annie's sister Tina leaves in running attire."
"0254"	"(06/19/1996)"	"Shooter's Reception Relived I'm at my high school basketball coach's wedding reception. I'm with my friend Stephen. It is a different place than where it actually took place. Stephen tries to get served alcohol from a lady. It doesn't work. Later, he gets a pitcher of beer and we are sitting right next to the tap. A homosexual man comes up to me and says, ""My friend will lick your ass if you ask him."" He thinks I am homosexual. I am startled. I avoid looking at him. People are passing around a microphone. My friends from high school Tiny Combs and George German are there. Tiny gets on the microphone and says , ""Sluuu, Shhaaap"", which are two words that I use frequently, and have become a nickname for me. We all laugh. Then someone tells me to say, ""A man named Nate up an ass Named Kenneth."" I say it, stuttering."
"0255"	"(06/20/1996)"	"Armstrong Relived I'm at Armstrong High School. It's the end of the '95-'96 school year. I feel out of place and unaccepted; ignored. I'm with my friend Nate Nelling. We're walking down the main hallway. We see Mr. Olson, Mr. Kluball, and Mr. Hacker, all teachers. We near the office. There are ten photographs on the wall. There is some kind of contest to put names with the faces in the photographs. People I know from high school are there, including Chris Pattison, Dave Butcher, and my basketball teammate Shawn Salzburg. My friend Kevin is there doing his usual attention-getting routine; something to do with a cake. I walk by the lunchroom area. I have a limp. I can't walk. It's like my ankle is rolled over, or one leg is longer than the other. I try to walk normal. I know that I'm older than everyone else, and am self-conscious of this. I don't really fit in. As I walk, I lick my fingers. There is something sweet and sticky on them. I get down towards the lockers. A classmate named Mike Smith is there. He is talking about a football scholarship."

"0257"	"(06/21/1996)"	"The Fucking Temp Service I'm at the big bakery in town that I recently worked at, but it is different. It is still a bakery. My aunt Willow Redding works there. I am stacking frosted sugar cookies on a small plate. They still need to be baked. I see someone using a larger plate, so I switch to a larger one too, which is good because the plate I was using was too small. A man tells me that the cookies go in the freezer. I think they must be no-bake cookies or something. I bring donuts and beer to the freezer. It is crowded. I set some stuff down and have to arrange the freezer so it all fits. One of the can s of beer is open. I put it in anyway. The man asks me if I have been stealing. I say no, and am lying. I have eaten frosting and other little food items when I was by the cookie-making area. I say to the man, ""I'm from the fucking temp service."" I tell him I've been here a week and that I do good work, and he can ask my supervisor if he doesn't believe me. I surprise myself for swearing. He is surprised that I swore at him. He says he has no choice but to fire me. I say okay, and walk out. I get in my truck and hurry away. I start to drive in third gear, and then I realize I'm in third, and shift to second since I'm already moving."
"0258"	"(06/21/1996)"	"My dad Gives Me White Shoes I wake up in bed at home and someone is walking by my door. It is my dad. He goes into my sister Ramona's room. He comes back into my room. I pretend I'm asleep, lying with my head at the foot of my bed. He wakes me up. He has just returned from a trip to Washington D.C.. He has brought me a pair of brand new clean, white canvas-type shoes. My dad, his wife Lisa and I are driving East on 3rd Street towards the Uptown Movie Theatre. My dad tells me that his sister Ellie Halvin is pregnant. There is some complication with keeping the baby warm. We are near the bank behind the theatre, and there are a lot of donut racks like the ones at the bakery that I worked at. The racks are slanted and the donuts slide and fall off. The donuts keep the baby warm, and since there aren't enough on the racks, there is a problem. A man is there and he says he has the tool to make the racks level but he left it at home and he isn't going back to get it. I think: that is stupid; go get the damn tool!"

I see the management from a grocery store I used to work at, going into the whirlpool. Among them are Mike Johnson, Larry Paulson, and Dan Drummond. They are wearing only shorts. I walk by. It is crowded going from the whirlpool to the pool. My childhood friend Tim Robbins and his mother Mary are sitting in the whirlpool. I have to step carefully to get through the crowd. I say excuse me. The pool is relatively empty when we get to it."
"0262"	"(06/23/1996)"	"Greeting Stephen With Returning Bubba I'm with my friends Kevin Simpson and Bubba Hacker at the local Hill Park. Bubba just got back form boot camp. We see our friend Stephen Ramos. He is mowing lawns. He doesn't recognize Bubba at first. When we get closer, he sees it is Bubba. Stephen says hi, but doesn't express a lot of emotion, which surprises and disappoints me."
"0263"	"(06/23/1996)"	"Hurricane Measuring Instrument I'm at a party at my friend Binky Ahmed's house. His house is not where it actually is, but rather is in the south. A hurricane is moving through. I'm outside the house with my dad. He has an instrument to see and mark storms. He sees one and gives me the instrument. I look, and see some clouds, some of which are funnel-like. My dad tells me to find the storm and mark it, or measure it, or do something with the instrument to identify or track it. I don't know how. The instrument changes and becomes big and bulky. I don't know how to use it. The storm blows over, without a hurricane in it."
"0264"	"(06/23/1996)"	"Candyland I'm floating in an ocean, on a surface. The surface is like a foam pad about two inches thick, covering all the water. I'm not getting wet. I'm in a group of people. I see a meteor. Another person points it out too. It goes across the sky, which is a mixture of green and black. The sky becomes mostly green with a black shadow-like image of dangling spider-like legs. The black streaks contract. As they do the surface of the ocean breaks. I don't want to fall in. Other people do want to fall in. People want to go to Candyland, as it seems, which is a fun place, or so I hear. I don't want to go because I'll have to swim back. I fall into the water, which is very warm. It is sweet and thick, like chocolate. In this place everyone is playing a game. The goal of the game is to accumulate something, or some things, in a certain proportion. To begin, I run and climb up a series of air-filled plastic tube mountains. The area is wet, like a water park. I think I will do well. I beat the crowd up the structure and grab money and other items, including a checkbook and passport. The things I accumulate are money, power, and wealth. These clues are later no good. I clutch my hand full of paper bills and other wealth. My friend Bubba Hacker is chasing me. I run and jump off a tube structure, diving into the pool of water below. I over rotate in the dive and land on my back. Bubba follows me. There are other ways to play the game; other things to do. I have a small plastic object that looks like a clear remote control. I'm trying to accumulate red or light purple dots on it. I do this by coming into contact with people who have red or light purple dots in their possession, since more than one person can share some clues. I succeed in getting some red dots. I get ""ambushed"" by people, including my brother Wally. We wrestle in the water for what I have in my hand. I think it is my checkbook. Normally in water, I am afraid of being pushed under. I really want the checkbook though, and go under the water and grab onto it with both hands. A man reads off the scores of the game for the first round. I didn't do well. My high school classmate George German did well. My family's friend Erika Hedgcock did well too. As the man reads, I see Annie. We are walking by each other. I put my arm around her as we walk. She puts her arm around me. We walk up stairs, and she jokingly says to me that I better not flirt with the lady that is walking in front of us. I say yeah. The second round starts. Immediately I pick up a bunch of different clues, including dice, figurines, a match stick-like structure, and small plastic animals that are size of a quarter. They act like keys, I think, and enable one to go further into a particular area. I think maybe I should have just gotten one or two clues in some area. I go into a place of lodging. It is fake; made up for the game. It's a sort of primitive house. I am going to make porridge. I'm alone, and don't really know what to do. My high school classmate Nathan Plumber and my junior high social studies teacher Gary Lashing are there. Another kid starts to make a fire. He needs a clue. I have it; it is the matchstick. It is cracked, but I try it anyway. I light the match and try to light a bigger object using it."

Daryl has lost a lot at the casino, while Gino has won a lot. My friends Kathy Branch, Ivory Alshire, and Cheryl Wrightson are there. Kathy is mad about something. My friend Binky Ahmed and I converse about Dennis Rodman, who said something with 1:30 left in the 3rd quarter of the game."

I am really horny, and want to have sex. I go upstairs to my room and sit on my bed, leaving the lights off. She walks upstairs and goes into my sister Ramona's room, where her mother Tamara and her sister Tina are. I see that my house is on fire! I see it through the two small windows in the upper corner of my room. I grab the cordless phone and call 911. I press the wrong button and can't dial at first. Finally, I get through. I tell them half of my house is on fire! It is the southwest half. They say they are sending help. I call them back and they get my phone number. I can see the flames outside. I try to close the little window, but I end up just shutting the doors to the window. I have to decide what I want to take and what I should leave in the burning house. I know that I can't take everything. I take sandals, thinking that it is summertime. I realize my feet might get cold. I leave the house, going out the back door. It is snowing. My brother Wally and his friends Mryle Madden and Mel, and my schoolmate Aaron Hadley are in the back yard. Mel is in the back seat of a convertible holding dog. I tell them our house is on fire! They say no, it was just the spark plug. I look around and at the roof. It is snowing, and there is snow on the roof. There are few, if any burn marks."

The woman next to me is going to the 7th floor below ground. It is a parking ramp. I am going home, back to the dark, dirty city. I'm in a place where there are six or seven ghosts of famous people. I am beating up the ghosts. I fight them. I kick, punch, bite, and shoot them. Even after I kill them they come back ""alive"". I beat them several times over before they ""die"" and disappear. I'm with another person, but I do most of the fighting. I kill the ghost of Carl Gustav Jung, and then the other ghosts. A truck is buried in golf balls. The hood of the truck is open. There is a big round circle of metal in the center where the engine would be. Golf balls, each one coming from or actually being a famous dead person, like the ghosts, roll towards the hole in the metal. Even if they don't go exactly in the hole, if they get close that is good enough, and they have made it."

Matt gets a hit; a big one; a really big one! While he is fighting it I get a hit; another big one. We fight the fish. They pull so hard we have to jump into the water! We back reel and try to tread water while keeping the fish on. Finally, we get back to the boat. Matt climbs up the ladder and I give him my rod while I climb up. We both land fish over 20 lbs! I was using a spinner bait. We may get served alcohol at a bar."
"0270"	"(06/27/1996)"	"Behind The Stage At Carter I'm at Carter School with other people. We go up on top of the stage, by the catwalk. There are mice there. My high school classmate Ron Lind and the football team are up on top of the stage too. There is another level, higher up: the third floor. I think that is where they are. I am outside the school by the basketball hoops and trees. There is soup there, with some kind of little balls in it. I eat it. A family friend, Doug Zirbes, is there. He is an actor (but not in real life). There is a man there who blew the 9:00 curfew whistle that I heard when I was a kid. He is on a 1986 Topps-like baseball card. Holly and Megan Tanks are there. I fight some people. They are unsuspecting of my aggression, and do not retaliate."

The goal is to get the ball in the elevator. It's three-on-one. I'm on the team of three. The game goes between floors as the elevator moves up and down. The game has now changed. I grab the ball and run down the hall to get away from people who are looking for me. My friend Ivory Alshire runs and tells me to go this way, pointing. I say to her, ""Fuck you."" I am trying to find stairs to go down. I am over by the river adjacent the school. There is something going on to do with camp. I am hiding from people. I don't want them to see me."

Some of the guys are shooting clay pigeons. Somehow, a clay pigeon flies towards me, and I'm afraid I'll get shot. I wince. The catchers yell to me, ""Smother it!"", or ""Kick it!"" They want me to go right up to it and shoot. There is a huge bull there. Ironman, one of the catchers, comes up to me. I think he is going to tell me how to shoot. I protest, saying I'm a catcher and that I don't shoot guns. But he says, ""Look, Kenneth..."" and continues to give me instructions on how to catch chickens. I'm in a room and the catchers submarine me, especially Joel. I retaliate. I beat up two or three guys and one girl. I might have had sex with another girl."

One is long sleep and striped; very nice looking. The pants are green corduroy and cost $11.00. Jeans cost too much. The chicken catching van is by the Uptown Mall. Norm from the television show Cheers is there with his wife. They almost rear-end us in the van. I'm at a loan place. The secretary calls me. She is physically attractive.

It is a weird feeling that I rarely get. I cough up thick chunks of food onto a newspaper. I vomit up two whole hamburgers! A man in a funny looking car drives by.

"0278"	"(07/02/1996)"	"Fish Net Fetish I'm in a desert. I am in a rectangular area that is fenced in with chain. There is a television in the area. I have a chair and I use it as a blockade along with the fence to keep dogs out. I am being sabotaged. The video from the band Oasis is on television, but it seems like the band Smashing Pumpkins. There is a blanket. I might have a fish net fetish. This involves real fishing net, not a fish net stocking. I am in a rood. I barricade the door and I overeat."
"0279"	"(07/02/1996)"	"Dinner On Kneelers At the Thomas' I'm eating dinner at my friend Annie Thomas' house. We kneel on small kneelers. I say that my dad used to make something like these, (which he did). Annie kisses me several different times before and around dinnertime. I realize we are not together when she is doing this. Her father, Dr. Bill Thomas, comes in. He asks me if that is my truck parked outside their house. I take a look. I say no, it's not mine: mine is newer and has less rust. He has socks on his arms, like I use to catch chickens. We all leave for a play. We're running a little late. I forget my shoes. Annie's sister Jessica comes and unlocks the door for me. The door is the front door on my house. I was standing on the porch when I realized I forgot them. I have a key, but Jessica got her key out quicker."
"0280"	"(07/02/1996)"	"Hump-A-Thon I'm with Annie in my neighbor Gary Stein's front yard. We are having sex in an indentation in the lawn by the hill that goes down in front of their house. We have a blanket that is underneath us. It might be the quilt that Grandma Ramona gave my brother Wally. We have sex for a long time. I change positions a few times. A car pulls up to the side of the road. We quickly leave. We go up to the porch of Stein's house. Then go inside and upstairs. A lady is there. We as her, ""Can we hump here?"" She says yes. We go in a room. Annie leaves the room for a moment. She says she might lose her erection. I am kind of confused, but figure it might be something to do with her arousal. We have sex some more. She is wearing the red sundress with the red and white flowers that she has. The lady comes back. We hear her and get dressed. The landlord barges into the room, but we are dressed. One of us says, ""See; they're not humping."" The lady went to get the landlord. Annie and I walk out of the room. There is a baby in a crib. I touch its cheek, and say how cute it is. It is taking me a long time to ejaculate. We go over by the gray house next to my other neighbor Alvin Broud's house. The lights are on. I want to have sex where it is dark. We have the blanket. I am wearing my maroon colored corduroy pants. Annie's vagina is very wet and very loose. We try a lot of different positions."
"0281"	"(07/03/1996)"	"Lue Yang Has Lived Here A person I know from high school, Lue Yang, has lived in our home for 9 years. I am in high school, and it is my sister Heather's birthday. My friend Edith Sherman is picking me up for school. In the car with Edith are my friends Tiny Combs and Annie Thomas. I need a hat, my gloves, and some cassette tapes. I go in the bathroom and fix my hair. Edith is waiting in the car, parked in the alley. I go outside. The ground is wet. I am wearing white socks. I realize I don't have shoes on, and so I stop, point to my feet, and go back in. Edith laughs at me. I am wearing the old black and pink jacket I wore in childhood."
"0282"	"(07/04/1996)"	"Thin Wire Annie I'm with my family at a zoo. I go under a tree in which there are many huge bats (or monkeys?). My family goes to the Lincoln Monument, which I recognize only by the statue of Lincoln. My friend Annie is at my house. She is wearing perfume, lipstick, and tight black pants. I lick her neck and she moans. She starts to give me fellatio. She sucks my toe also. We are on the floor of the dining room. I try to crawl away while she is sucking my toe. We are in my room. I pull off her tight black pants, over her shoes. She is a thin wire metal frame. There are springs and swivels around the groin area of the frame. I take them off. The wire is black, and is about 1/8"" thick. I want to give her cunnilingus before she can give me fellatio."
"0283"	"(07/04/1996)"	"A Hotel With Harmony I'm at a hotel. I see my friend Marge Drummond there with a few other women. My high school crush, Harmony Allure, sleeps in my room. There are three beds there. She goes to bed early and her feet stick out at about the knee from the end of her bed. I have to sleep in the same bed as my sister Heather. I pull out six or seven water bottles with spray tops from under the blanket on my bed. There is a monster or some creature being created from dead leaves that collect in a swimming pool. The creature may be back from the dead. He/it is picking up a slice of watermelon that is lying on the ground next to a manhole cover on a busy city street. There is another man like him with him."
"0284"	"(07/06/1996)"	"Fran Susse and In Dream Lucidity I'm in the basement in a bed with my friend Fran Susse. I am lying on my stomach, and she is lying on top of me, with her stomach against my back. I feel some tension/electricity between us. I am cautious about moving, about how we touch. I roll over on my back. Fran is straddling me, like we are having sex. We are fully clothed. She reacts quickly and loudly, with a scream. I think she is in a dream; a nightmare. She yells. I try to calm her. My dad and my brother Wally are in the basement. We are standing where my dad's workbench used to be. The overhead light is on, and things appear as they were before the basement was remodeled. They are talking about fishing. My dad is saying how many fish he caught. I tell him my friend Kevin Simpson and I got 10 northern pike! I'm in a dark house with no furnishings. There is a woman with me. It may be my friend Annie. She has a flashlight. There are some people in the house. They may be spirits or monsters. I take the light from her, and then she is one of the other people. I know this isn't real. I say out loud, ""I'm dreaming. I am having a lucid dream. This isn't real."" I recognize that in the dream, all the while I am still dreaming. I go around the house saying loudly that I know I'm dreaming."
"0285"	"(07/06/1996)"	"Three Nights Christened I am in a church at a funeral with two other men, one of whom may be my friend Simon Naver. The funeral is for my mom's cousin. Three bodies on stretchers are carried up to the altar. The bodies are of old men. One man has duct tape over his mouth. I think this is to keep the odor to a minimum, because he is dead. I see that the other two men on stretchers aren't dead. The men are made knights at the altar, with swords and red cloaks. An usher comes up to us and says we are sitting in the seats where the next three men will be chosen form to be carried up to the altar. These men will be dead. I don't want to do this. I want to change seats. The usher will escort us to the bathroom for one Franc, thereby getting us out of this situation. But we just go and sit in a different pew. The pews are form Sacred Heart Church in Farmington. I sit on a piano or organ bench that is facing the back of church. The two guys I am with don't sit with me. A talkative man sits in front of me. My mom sits in front of this man. The front half of the church is empty: people sit in the back half."
"0286"	"(07/06/1996)"	"Kissing An Older Lady I'm with an older lady in her car. She is about 40 years old. She is dropping me off at home. We get to my house, and we kiss in the car. She withdraws from this kiss, saying that I have bad breath. I am going to give her cunnilingus."
"0287"	"(07/06/1996)"	"Tired Old Dad I am talking with my friend Nate Nelling about our dads. We talk about how old and sore and tired they have become."
"0288"	"(07/08/1996)"	"Geography At Carter School I'm at Carter School. I'm in the 5th or 6th grade classroom playing a game with dice. My friend Queen Billman is there. She is supposed to kiss me as part of the game, but she is embarrassed to. I kiss her on the cheek in a friendly manner. Two 2's are rolled on the dice. People have to connect the dots on the blackboard and find the perimeter of the parallelogram it makes. The sides are 20 and 36 units long. I think the perimeter is 56. I'm wrong. Its' 2.1, or about 1%. I am in a geography class. My geography professor at Brimson, Meg Shine, is the teacher. I get a paper back, on which I did really well. I forgot about the ""intermittent zones"" in the paper. I have only one pen in my desk. I leave school. I say goodbye to Meg. I am wearing my old black and pink winter jacket. I walk down the hall with my friend Tiny Combs. The school secretary's daughter and two other people look at us as we leave. The steps are wet because they've just been mopped. Tiny and I think a man we lifted weights with, Troy Swanson, might be teaching first grade, but he is not. Some karate guy is teaching first grade, and is playing Mettalica. I go back to my truck in the parking lot. A classmate named Cory Pineman looks like he wants a ride. My friend Brian Candle walks by. We chat. My friends Tim and Niles Zelling, Nat Miller, and Hilary Nano show up. I greet them. Nat looks like he is mentally retarded. He is really tired from the plane ride. We go to my house."
"0289"	"(07/10/1996)"	"Heather's Friends Harass Me I'm at the Drive up window of the Oak Valley Bank. I deposit $20, but wait to get $10 back. While I am waiting, my sister Heather and two young black men come and harass me. They knock and pound on the windows of my mom's station wagon, which I am driving. I am then in the back seat, behind the driver's seat. One of the men is in the car sitting next to me. He jokes and teases me saying he is going to vomit in my car. I say, ""No, please, don't vomit."" We're about 15 feet from the drive up window. I say the lady won't let me get my money unless I pull up to the window. I pull the car up to the teller, but the tube with the money and transaction statement in it is covered with mail. The two guys push my car backwards. I run and stop it, stepping on the brake. I don't sit down in the car because the man vomited on the driver's seat. The vomit looks like the donut sprinkles. I swear! Heather drives away in a gray car. I pick up and stack big bags of potatoes and something else. I think that it's tough to love Heather when she does stuff like this. I curse her name. I think of the Butter-Cream movie in which the philosophy is always to be kind and respect others no matter how they treat you."
"0290"	"(07/11/1996)"	"Two O'clock With Shelly I'm in an office building. I have a 2:00pm appointment with my grade school classmate Eric Stoner's mother, Shelly Stoner.

My high school basketball teammate Aaron Hadley is there. I am alone is a house. My parent's friends stop by. I escort them out. I look the doors and take care of the house. A discussion ensures about whether oral sex is sex."
"0291"	"(07/11/1996)"	"Sexual Hitting I'm with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona. I hit my sisters a number of times. The hitting is somehow sexual. My hand gets caught near Heather's crotch. I pull it out in horror. Ramona gives me fellatio, cleaning off my erection. I don't want to ejaculate then, because it is too little of an orgasm. I go to my room and want to masturbate, but people are around. My mom tells me she is disappointed in me."
"0292"	"(07/11/1996)"	"Marybeth Neumann has Chin Hair I'm at open gym. My old coaches Jackson Shooter and Joe Ace are there. My friend Stephen Ramos is there, stacking up crates to jump off and dunk near one of the side basketball hoops. I attempt a dunk, but can't get my footing down. I have bad footing. Before I try to dunk, I stretch. I am really flexible. Stephen jumps on my back, jokingly. I am with my friend Marybeth Neumann and another girl on a picnic table in my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard. We talk about our classmate Carol Stilten. Marybeth tells me Carol's plan to se other men while she is married to someone who may be a classmate of ours named Shane. It is a severed ill-conceived plan. The girl we are with is a Cosmopolitan girl. We talk about a younger guy in our school named Kent. I say he is big and strong. I eat six big sandwiches. The girl is younger than I, but of a higher social class. I want to impress her. Marybeth has a lot of hairs on her chin. Marybeth and the girl talk about taking up their dresses, to make them shorter."

He holds a press conference in a hotel and part of it involved him saying something about how he has been able to pass on his fortune rather sneakily. He was able to pass it on quickly to his heirs without dying, I think. I go into the hotel. I find and pick up a trail of money. I puck up bills of the denominations: $1, 5, 10, 20, 45, and $90. There are also traveler's checks. They are in square sheets of four and need to be separated to use. Each check is worth $45. The area is mall-like, circular, with two floors. There are two other guys around when I pick up money. One of them is helping my by telling me when I can pick up money and when I can't because a security guard is watching me. The other guy is also picking up money. I tell my competitor that we'll alternate piles: I get one, he gets one, I get one, etc. Then there are no more piles of money. I find two king-size Snickers bars. I play cards. We start out with two people. The guy I'm playing with wants to play Kings in the Corner. Then a lady comes. We have three people, and are going to play three-way war. Two more people come. We play hearts, and I teach them how. Two of the people are old ladies."

We use many positions. We lick, rub, suck, touch, grind, and bite each other. At the convention, from 9:45 am to 9:45 pm I can get endless fellatio for $5. I have sex with a woman from behind. This feels the best for me, because sex in this position rubs the top of my erection."
"0295"	"(07/13/1996)"	"Too Cold To Swim I'm with a group of people and we're going to play softball or swim. There is a conflict over which we should do. A kid on my dorm floor in the group is eating. There is an advisor there, and something happens with an appointment. The group walked through a home of college-aged people. A black man is playing loud music. We decide to play ball because it is too cold to swim."

When I get home, there is a note from my friend Hannah Reed to call her. I know it's her because she spells her name with an ""H"". My mom is just leaving when I get home. My sister Heather is still in the hospital. My friend Nete Nelling just called. He actually spells his name Nate, but I know that now it is Nete. He has strep throat and cant' go to the baseball game or the Olympic Volleyball with me like we had planned. Nate and I sit in a bar on the floor and talk. He had a tough trip with his girlfriend Emily. He drinks a Killian's Red. I swing on a gymnastics bar and try to touch my feet on a piece of light green paper on the floor. I have a beer. Nate tells me about Emily's father Dick, and how Dick never used to let Nate drink beer. Now Dick lets Nate drink beer; ""Just as long as I don't want one,"" Nate says."

Tim, the chicken catching supervisor, is handing out the watermelons. He hands me too many, and I drop them. The melons are slippery with spaghetti on them. My high school classmates Jared Nupe and Donald Dilson are there. There are also some girls there. My friend Tiny Combs and I cook macaroni cheese. There are three different kinds of macaroni: white cheddar, regular spiral, and plain macaroni that one has to add real cheese to. Jared and Donald cook macaroni after we do. They want to beat us to it. I get into a fight with them, and beat them up. Donald throws a pot of boiling water. Some guys need a small metal clip for something. They are rude. Tiny has the clip. I get it from Tiny and give it to them. I try to find a pan for us to use to cook macaroni. I am at my house. My sister Ramona and brother Wally are there with me. There is a white car out in front of our house that turns around. It looks like my friend's sister Jessica Thomas' car. A man is driving it, and it looks like my friend Annie Thomas in the passenger seat. I think it is Annie's boyfriend, but it isn't."
"0298"	"(07/15/1996)"	"Milk In Small Containers I'm with my friends Stephen Ramos and Emerald Reinhold. They are selling red t-shirts that say, ""I scored a goal"" on the back. I ask them if I can have a shirt. They say okay. I'm in an apartment. Three men are moving in: one now, and two later. It's a surprise. I'm cleaning out the cupboards, throwing away old and bad food. Matt and Troy, whom I know from working at Grocery Ghetto, are there. They are leaving. I find a couple full gallons of milk on the bottom shelf of the cupboard. I yell to Troy and tell him to buy milk in smaller containers so it won't spoil. There is some spoiled hair dye and some applesauce in plastic jars like the ones that Planters peanuts come in. The applesauce is still good."
"0299"	"(07/15/1996)"	"No Handlebars On My Bike I'm in a parking lot with a group of teenagers. My grade school classmate Eric Stoner is there and wants to buy some hallucinogenic mushrooms. I tell him we'll talk later. Someone vandalizes a nearby house and we take off running. I'm in a skyscraper, up on a high floor. I bike and roller blade down a hallway. I stand crooked, leaning to the left as if I have weak ankles. The bike has no handlebars. I grab onto the neck of the bike in an attempt to steer it. There are more people biking and roller blading. People are walking towards me, moving out of the way. I kick a door open and walk across furniture in a room. A family friend, Lila Marcher, is having lunch there. I walk to a window, and think about suicide. The ground is near the window, though. There is a hill next to the building. I jump out the window onto the hill and the building falls on me right where I jumped out."

She runs out to her car and comes back in. She has a wedding ring, and is getting married. I am with Annie Thomas. She says to me, ""I think about what we had."" She expresses her feelings of loss regarding the end of our relationship. I hug her. We are on the north side of the garage by my neighbors, the Stalk's, apartment. When we hug I want to have my back up against the side of the house so I can lean on it. I go inside and clean up. I pick up cups with cigarette butts in them. Annie and I are by the back door. I have her eat a raspberry, which she has never eaten. I think she likes it. I'm with some people in my neighbor, the Trammell's driveway adjacent the alley. I see a UFO, a flying saucer. It's dark and the UFO isn't very well lit, but one can still see it. I try to point it out to the others. They don't seem to see it at first. Three more UFO's fly overhead. We all see them."

The third prisoner, who is a woman, pulls out a gun. She shoots at me. People are slow to help me. The gunshots miss. Ping-pong balls with cotton inside soak up blood form a killing."
"0302"	"(07/18/1996)"	"Slide Down Steps In Chinatown I'm in Chinatown. It is an area of large pyramid-like structures with stairs on them. I ride a disc sled down one side of these structures.

A high school classmate of mine, Brent Jumper, has the beanbag in a toilet."

The opening to the building is a small rectangular box. Wally gets in first. I follow. Other people are coming soon after us. To get in, there are ants that turn to their left. When their path changes, we gain access. We don't have much time. The building is like a pyramid with mazes, with many chambers. Adjacent to some chambers are secret passageways. I need ammunition for my gun. We are using water guns. I find out flag. It is a wood pole with a black cloth tied to one end. I need to re-hide it because others are coming soon and may shoot me. I want to come back with a good gun and reinforcements. I find a secret passage. It's a way out. I had previously thought that there was only one way out, and that I'd have to go back. The passage is a small window. I get outside, and it is snowy. I get Andrew, and tell him the plan to load up and go in. A player must be hit in the legs to be out. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper and my cousin Henry King are on my team. My high school classmate Ned Stallone and my college friend Amy Leopard are on the other team."

On the second floor, as I go down, is a middle-aged white haired lady who says hi to me. I greet people as I go down. I feel like people know and respect me. They are warm and friendly people. As I am descending the stairs, the lady in red comes and asks me if I will go with her to a gathering of some sort at 4:00. The building is nicely carpeted and furnished on the top two floors, but on the bottom floor it isn't so nice. On the bottom floor is a video game. I try to play the video game; there was a credit left on the machine. Two ladies tell me the game is out of order. I feel like I've been reprimanded. The button on the game is a small one that protrudes from a rising half-sphere. There is no joystick. I feel like I'm in college. I have things going on; I feel involved. I'm in another stairwell, similar to the one at Middle Mall in Wilmerton. I am sitting on the stairs in a semi-lucid state. I realize that what is happening isn't real. I dream I am masturbating, and people are going by. Then I awaken and walk away. I'm dressed in overalls without a shirt. I leave the building, which is the same as the one I was originally in at Brimson. I'm going to my apartment. Many of the doors are locked from the inside. Children getting their faces painted block the other doors. I slip through one of these doorways. I later learn that the young woman in red has an identical twin. I see them both."

There is a demonstration on how to use it done by a girl on Hilary. Hilary's legs are spread open. The toy looks like a curved or U-shaped two-headed dildo. The short end of the dildo goes in her vagina, and the long end goes in her rectum. I am having sex with Annette. I'm on my back, and she is on her back, on top of me. We're having sex and I'm touching her clitoris at the same time. She gets a little bit aroused and then loses interest. She leaves before I ejaculate."
"0308"	"(07/22/1996)"	"Mountain Men In the mountains there are two hardy ""mountain men"". There are in a cabin-like structure that is on a pulley system, high above ground. The men are arguing.

He is tossing up baseball-like balls and hitting them with a bat. The balls are reddish-pink. One of the balls is a hard-hit grounder that I skip out of the way of as it races behind me. I give him a warning glance. There are a bunch of guys playing ball. I don't like them, especially one of them. I tell him he better watch it. I am belligerent. The guys are younger than I, maybe 16 or 17, and they are cocky. I get in a fight with one kid. He gets his friend, Cory Bark, who I know from grade school. We fight, those two against me. I beat them up. They are holding fishing poles. The rods cover their faces, so I have to punch around the rods. I go into a nearby house. I beat up six or eight black guys, one by one, as I walk around the house. I make it all the way around the house, back to wear I started. There are two Richard Priors there. I beat them up so I can get out a window. I have to go 400 miles away. The window is locked so I have to go and hit them again to give me enough time to get it open. I walk around the front of the house, which is my house. The window I was trying to get open is the one nearest the telephone in the dining room of my house. There is a black woman coming up the steps. She is the mother of one of the kids I beat up. I get the mail. We go inside. I try to use the phone to call 911 for the hurt guys, even though I don't want to. I do this because the black lady and a family friend, Anna Gates, are there. The phone won't work. I can't shut if off or dial. Finally, it works. I don't want to call because I am the one who did all the damage."
"0310"	"(07/23/1996)"	"Two-Headed Turtle I'm at Lake Jefferson with my friends Matt Yams and Lyle Zeffman. We rent bikes like most people rent paddleboats to go on the lake. We asked the man who gives us the bikes what would happen if we went on the water. He answers that it is not allowed but there is no way he could really stop us one we're our riding. We are riding bicycles around the lake, which isn't actually a lake but mostly land, a lot of mud, and two small ponds. I get my bike stuck in the mud. I get off my bike. I see what I think is a giant frog getting out of the mud. It is actually a giant two-headed snapping turtle. It is huge! It starts to get away. I throw a card table on it and I think I kill it, but it isn't dead. It comes after us. We swim over to the edge of the lake and get out in time. I help Lyle out of the lake. We are in a house. It is nighttime. My teammate Olie Kecker is there, and others. Someone is on the phone making harassing phone calls to a woman. I think it is dumb to do that and they should stop. I look for and find a sledgehammer to kill the turtle. I want to get two sledgehammers."

When I drive by and go in, I hear a girl, who I know is my sister Heather's friend, arguing with a man. My friends Nicole Peterson and Tammy Jostens are in the same building, and are also leaving.

I go out of the bathroom. Heather goes into the bathroom, saying she has to vomit. She is staying in my aunt Raquel's old bedroom. My brother Wally is staying in my uncle Danny Redding's room. I never get a chance to urinate."
"0313"	"(07/25/1996)"	"Alvin Broud has Cataract Surgery My neighbor Alvin Broud, is a burglar and is a part of a ring of people who sell diamonds. He has a lot of parking tickets to pay. He comes out of a movie theatre-like place with a woman and the police are here his car to arrest him. His car is on the west side of Home Ave in Oak Valley, just down the street from my home. Alvin takes off on a bicycle and rides down Next Avenue towards the Robbins' house, with a police care following him. The car goes past the alley that Alvin has turned into to evade the police. He turns and goes through the driveway of Mrs. Shelly's house, coming back towards Home Ave, as the police circle the block. He goes through our yard to the north side of his house. He hesitates before going down the steep hill in his front yard, because the police car is going north on Hill Avenue, right in front of his house, looking for him. More police have been called. He evades the police, somehow using the department of motor vehicles to do so, for many years, all the while living at home. He has acted smart. He comes into his porch area and into his home. He has just returned from cataract surgery at 3:00 am. A high school classmate of mine, Analisa Paulsen, is there. She has been living with him."
"0314"	"(07/25/1996)"	"Funny Looking Drill Sergeant I'm working at a table. There is a superior to me eating dinner nearby. It may be my brother Wally. I sneak away and go up some stairs where a lot of guys are working sending coolers down a chute. I join in, after ""Little Man"", who is a fellow chicken catcher. I am supposed to slide my cooler or move the conveyer belt faster so there isn't much room between his cooler and mine. The coolers are short, fat jugs with small caps, filled with liquid, maybe frozen. I am in an army-like situation. My friends Nate Nelling and Tony Kramer are there too. We have an okay group leader; he is not too tough. We are all sitting at a long table and a drill sergeant and his sidekick come in. The sidekick is short and scrawny. The sidekick barks orders at me. I have to hold my hand and arm straight up. He pushes me and I tip, but my body and arm stay rigid. I flip over and over as he pushes me over tables and benches. I tough it out. I think Nate and Tony probably feel bad for me. On the last flip I end up standing upright on the desk next to our telephone. The sidekick sergeant is on the floor in front of a china cupboard. I decide not to conform to all the army stuff. I jump down and land a blow on him. I beat the shit out of him. The real drill sergeant, a biff-like crew but stocky fellow, comes over. He's wearing gray, and has a few missing teeth. I can't hurt him. I punch him, but he is like a rock. He can do some serious damage to me."
"0315"	"(07/25/1996)"	"Urinate On The Sidewalk I'm out in front of my home on the sidewalk with some guys. I am really drunk. I urinate on the sidewalk. A police officer sees me and pulls up to the house. I act like I'm playing football with the other guys I am with. The officer doesn't buy my story. A guy I am with, Andy Jones, tells the cop I urinated on the sidewalk. M friend Kevin Simpson tells the officer there are 16 to 18 other people in my house. I didn't know there was anyone else inside. The officer goes to my mom's bedroom and looks in. My friend Bubba Hacker is inside. He is trying to make things seem okay. I am in deep trouble, and I know it."
"0316"	"(07/26/1996)"	"Olie Kecker Sells His Car I'm in a house full of people, upstairs. There is a conflict between my sister Heather and her friends, and another group of people. Heather urges me to stand up for her. I acknowledge to everyone that I am siding with Heather's group, because it is the right thing to do: their group was being wronged. Heather wants me to hold hands with the group and make a demonstration, but I won't. Later, I get angry with Heather for being stupid and irrational. I leave. Eventually she comes out too. I am putting my shoes on on the steps. I am with my friends Niles and Tim Zelling and Hilary Nano. We're in the Washington D.C. area at an office building. It is nighttime. I urinate outside. I get sidetracked dealing with my sister Heather, and the others leave without me. I have my truck. Heather and I are going to have to drive back to Montana. I am driving my truck, just to get to a place to stay for the night, so we can leave in the morning. The engine makes a peculiar noise. I hope we make it back okay. I see my basketball teammate Olie Kecker. It is daytime. He is driving away in my truck. I jump in the bed of the truck and go up towards the passenger side window of the truck. I ask Olie, ""What happened to your car?"" He says that he sold it. He is driving in the middle of the street. Olie and I are then in a motel. Our room is completely furnished, like a house, with food, accessories, etc. I tell Olie we're leaving 5:00 or 6:00 am, and that he'd better be ready for the drive home."

We are wrestling and jokingly fighting, in a power struggle. I am on top of him, and then he flips me down on the floor. We are on a college campus, but the driver takes a wrong turn, and we go the wrong way down a one-way road. We turn around and go through an area we're not supposed to go through, and get out. I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson, his father Dilbert, and his grandma, who is in a scooter most of the time because she has trouble walking. We are down by a river. I'm in the water with a wooden spear trying to spear a carp-like fish. The fish is then a huge bright orange gold-like-fish with huge eyes. I spear it through a gill and through the mouth. When I pick it up, it's a small toy airplane. It is like a bug, because it has many huge wings. Later, I fend off Jerome and end up with two glasses and one can of beer."
"0318"	"(07/28/1996)"	"Sweatshirt Shopping I'm shopping with my friend Sam Kingsley. We see some hooded sweatshirts for sale. They are solid blue or solid gray in color. They are pretty nice. Somehow we get a discount. Maybe it is Sam's discount. I think the sweatshirts must be expensive. We look at the tag, and see that they are only $15.49. That is cheap, I think, but I don't need a sweatshirt. I am wearing my blue hooded sweatshirt."
"0319"	"(07/29/1996)"	"Paying $29 For Gas I'm in a Food-n-Fuel gas station. I get $12 in gas and buy a bag of cheddar cheese chips. The bag is small and flat, and costs 99 cents. At the counter the cashier rings up my total of $29! I am furious! All I got was gas, chips, and a bottle of water. It should be no more than $15. The cashier says that someone has to pay for it. Reluctantly, I pay for it, and I tell the cashier that I want to see the manager. This person says that the manager won't be in until tomorrow at 11:30 am. I am thoroughly disgusted. I go outside. There are two or three of my friends with me. We sit. A black police officer comes and talks to us. He empathizes with us. [Note: I needed to get gas today. Today is the 29th of July] ."
"0320"	"(07/29/1996)"	"Young Black Women At Robbins I am going by my neighbor the Robbins' house, either walking or on a bicycle. I look in the bay window at the front of their house and see four or five young black women sitting in the living room watching a movie or television. They have moved in, I think. Maybe they're going to school."
"0321"	"(07/29/1996)"	"Hilary, Annette, and a 14 Year Old I'm with my friends Hilary Nano and Annette Gollum, and a 14 year old girl I don't know. I have sex with each one of them separately in a very short time span, but I don't ejaculate in any of the encounters. I'm with Hilary in a room. She doesn't believe that I didn't ejaculate. I tell her to give me fellatio, and if I don't ejaculate for a long time, she knows that I did before. On the other hand, if I ejaculate quickly upon receiving fellatio, she knows I was aroused previously, but did not ejaculate."
"0322"	"(07/29/1996)"	"Three Tenors I'm going to a Three Tenors concert. I am with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling, Nat Miller, and Tom Napper. We drive to the concert in a big, fancy red car, which is kind of like a Cadillac, but isn't. We leave it parked where people give their cars to valets, but we don't give the valet the keys. I go back later, when there are two valet employees, and give one of them the keys, which are on my Brimson key chain. The car is to be parked in a subway garage. I have a new suit for the occasion. I wear a t-shirt under it: no shirt or tie. I have nice new black shoes too. I don't wear a shirt, only the pants and shoes. My roommate's girlfriend Natasha talks to me as we watch part of the show. The Three Tenors are women with violins. The concert turns into a lecture, and one woman puts up an overhead projection and draws complex note patterns on it. All the people leave because it is boring. The Bough parents are the last two people there. My classmates Sonya Nittles and Fariba Touse are there and talk to me. As I leave, I wave at Sonya, who went out before me. We are going back to the car. There is a Santa Claus cake with hard frosting on it. We smash the cake on the sidewalk."

My brother Wally, his friend Mryle Madden, Monalisa Miller, who is Mryle's girlfriend, and another girl who is Wally's girlfriend get back from picking mushrooms. The mushrooms are huge, and are hard; they can't be eaten because they're too hard. The couples kiss and the females leave. In the house, my mom is talking about my classmate Ryan Pitz. I say that I know him. He is then standing in front of the sink, while I am looking into the adjacent refrigerator. I say, ""Hey, Ryan."" He is wearing red underwear. He is staying at our house. When he goes into the dining room he has pajama bottoms on. My mom is talking about a kid whose name she thinks is Loess. I realize she is talking about a person I know from working at Grocery Getto, whose last name was Loesch. I say that kid is a dork."

I yell at him, saying that I am the patient, and that he should do what I request! I also say that I have a wire that is poking out of a gash in my finger. This is what I want fixed.

I have hauled my stuff down to school in my truck. I arrived really late, about 10:00 pm the day that classes began. I meet a few new people, including women who aren't that attractive. My friend from high school Tiny Combs is there for a big party to kick off the school year."
"0326"	"(07/31/1996)"	"Zeffman Dies I'm on the bridge that goes over the Main River near downtown Wilmerton with my friend Binky Ahmed. We are on the sidewalk. There are two policemen on the bridge. Binky tells them that our friend Lyle Zeffman got put in jail for a month for drinking. I am surprised. Then our friend Lyle is on the bridge near the policemen. He is drunk. He falls off the bridge, and drowns. The policemen don't do anything about this. Binky and I leave. We are riding on phone booth-like machines. The booths are tipped on their sides and have blades or wheels on the bottom. As soon as we are away from the police, I start to run. Binky falls behind. I run through yards and jump over fences. On some fences I jump, I feel I'm in slow motion, suspended in the air. I try to find the Burns County Fair, but I am disoriented. I am with my friend Elise Rooks. We are sitting on the ground on the east side of Wilmerton. We flirt. I really want to make out with her. I act silly, like I am a little drunk, in hopes that her flirtatiousness will get carried away. We are then at Elise's house. There is a phone call for me. At first I think it might be my ex-girlfriend Annie, but I can't tell from the voice. Then I realize it is my friend Nicole Peterson, who is at a camp in Connecticut. I'm surprised she calls me. She sounds like she needs a friend. My brother Wally is there and he listens on another phone. We put Nicole on speakerphone for a bit."
"0327"	"(08/01/1996)"	"Autofellatio Three I am giving myself fellatio. It doesn't feel that good; not like someone else is giving me fellatio. I can't do it like another can, it doesn't work."
"0328"	"(08/03/1996)"	"Police Search For Mushrooms My mom is gone. I have a party at our house. We are in the garage, and the big old garage door must still be in place because my friends and I walk out of the garage and into the front of my neighbors, the Stein's, yard. Others and I drink beer and smoke marijuana. My sister Heather is there and she is watching me to see if I do anything so bad that she can tell my mom about. I go in the house through the garage door and Heather goes out and ask my friends if I have drank beer or smoked marijuana. She finds out that I did. My friends Stephen Ramos and Emerald Reinhold are there, with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, and schoolmates John Gregor and Kevin Salt. We are on the sidewalk in front of our house having foot races. We race a boy against a girl. I think I may race Annie. I keep track of the names on a small board: who raced and who won. My writing is very messy, like I am in kindergarten. John's mother picks him up in a truck. She pulls into the front driveway. The police are at my house, and we are in the garage. They ask me questions about my truck. They ask about the accident I was in, and the insurance and repairs. I tell them that I bought the bumper from my neighbor for $10 and paid some guy $40 to weld it on. The police go after this lead I gave them. The police are in my kitchen. I ask them if they have a search warrant, and they show one to me. They are searching for hallucinogenic mushrooms. I have gotten rid of nearly everything. They search my room. They'll find the aquarium and plexiglass and spray bottle. I think I'll be okay: they won't be able to pin any crime on me. I don't have any mushrooms. I need to warn my friend Tiny. My mom was the one who called the police. She tells me as the police are searching. I call Tiny. His younger brother Matt answers, and says Tiny is gone. I tell Matt what Tiny and I have been doing, where Tiny's aquarium is, and to find the seven bags of mushrooms and get rid of them, because the police are coming!"

I am holding the gun up. People see it as they drive by so I put it in my pants pocket. I am wearing my brown corduroy pants. A guy I know from grade school, Cory Bark, and some of his friends, drive by in a car. I try to hide behind the garage. The car tries to follow me, driving around the block. The Thomas family (Annie, Jessica, and Tina) pulls up in a car. Their dog may be with them. Tina runs up and gives me a hug. I bounce off her and fall over and roll on the ground, jokingly. Annie says something about three days with no mountain or three days of no clouds with mountains. She also says something about no dreams for three days. She says this, I think, because of something I wrote on a postcard to her. But she misinterpreted the dream portion of this: It was supposed to be one day of no dreams. My friend Kevin Simpson is there with Annie and my third grade teacher Liza Minikel"

Then he hugs me, in his grief. He is wearing a big fluffy winter jacket. I ask Gino if he wants to go and visit the Longs sometime over break, since we have a 12 or 14-day break for Christmas. He says no, he can't handle it. I go down in the basement of the church because someone, Gino I think, needs to tell me something there. We go into an old dirty bathroom where a man is hurting. He has just gotten in a fight. There are three or four fights scheduled. This was the first one, and it was small. I have a cut lip. There is a funeral procession to a place. My friend Kevin Simpson and I are there already. The ending point of the funeral is a parking lot in which there are many poles sticking up to mark off the lanes for traffic. We see a monster truck with huge tires. The tires have weird tread, like a saw blade. Then we see the hearse pull into the lot. It is like a battering ram, tough and square looking. Kevin says he'd like to have a hearse names after him. In a building, we're in an empty room. Kevin and Mark are there with a woman from my neighborhood. They talk about suicide. They all have scars. Mark talks about cutting the veins on the inside of his leg near his groin. They are back from the dead for one year, but only if their spouse had approved. Mark talks more about cutting himself: how and where. The neighbor woman is topless. She has a scar from shoulder to shoulder across her chest, and two scars down each upper pectoral muscle. I don't want to look at the scars. Kevin and Mark and I are in the corner of the room. There are blinds near us, almost wrapping around us. I reach my arms around both of them at the same time and grab the blinds. I hold them very tightly, and tell them what I think of suicide. I tell them that I think it's a cop out. That it is the easy way out and it is inconsiderate: the people that love you will really be hurt. Then I walk away. I talk to my dad. Looking over in the corner, I see that there are two straight bodies laying separately on the cement floor. I go to say goodbye to Mark. The two are standing. I don't' know what to say to Mark. We hug and cry. It's hard to keep my balance. We hug for a long time. There is violin music playing in the background. The hug is very therapeutic. It was a release, a letting go after a long time, which was overdue."

Everyone must take at least a half a bite of an ice cream bar. Today's flavor is mint ice cream. For healthier people there are other things to eat. My brother Wally, sister Ramona, and I are there. I talk to a woman who is a bouncer. She says the new principal wants to be promoted to superintendent so he is cracking down on students. I think the rules are insane. Outside the doors I see some girls who play softball and other girls trying to leave school early. They are chased inside by a police car battering ram. It is then 3:00 and we can go. Carefully, the three of us go out. There are men with huge fire hoses spraying water on everything in the parking lot to wash blood off the vehicles and walls, etc. There are two boys that are playing football in the wet grass. One boy pushes the other. There is another kid, who goes out for a pass and flips over a fence and breaks his arm. It looks like a good catch, but he doesn't actually catch the ball. I say, ""That's my kind of catch."""

We keep walking. There is a folk group practicing with all different instruments. I am with my brother Wally, sister Ramona, and classmate Holly Tanks. My mom is picking us up. We're at the Middle Mall. Nellie Hammer, from my economics class, walks by. I go into a building. There are fish on the wall. They are either mounted or drawn. These show fish size for different species; maybe the record size. It shows the biggest muskie was caught in Connecticut. I'm in the basement of this building. Reggie and Joel, two guys I catch chickens with, are there. There is a skunk in the basement. We run up the stairs to get away from it. We're about to catch a barn of chickens. I'm with my friend Tiny, who is also a chicken catcher. I don't have my chicken-catching shoes, and neither does Tiny. He catches without socks on his arms, and with some funky wrestling-like shoes. I catch in my Sketcher shoes. All the socks I have are hand socks with holes cut in them. I wear two or three pairs. Then I find my bag of chicken-catching clothes. I go into the barn. There are cows in an adjacent barn. The pallets to put the chickens in are in an odd fashion: several short rows with an end cap-like pallet, too. It confuses me. The catchers are annoyed with me for not working hard. I try to get away slacking off: not working hard."

We go to a park to play with my brother Wally and his friend Perry Glyde. It is snowing outside, but all the snow is melting. We all get dressed for the weather. Hank doesn't have any shoes, and he is outside. I am in an apartment-like area with a group of guys who are my friends. My friend Kevin's sister Melissa's car is getting towed away by two police officers. I ask them why they are towing it, and they show me a spring that fell out of my pocket and say there is something wrong with the car. They are just being mean to us, and are abusing their power as police officers. I trade insults with one of them, who is a short, fat, officer. He kicks me. I insult him and threaten him. He confronts me. I beat him up. I punch him up to five times in the face."

Another employee, Bill, is in the office, which is in the mall now, instead of being a back room. I talk to him. He says I'm in luck: our boss Andy isn't here. I tell him why I have closed the mall early. He says they still like to have someone at the mall until 10:00 pm. Another employee, Dale, has some photographs of different sizes. They have a pornographic feeling to them. Some of the photographs are of good-looking men; others are of giant cartoon characters."

I crouch down so they don't see me as I pass by the windows. I call 911, and go over to the corner of the house by the front entry, because it offers the most protection. The 911 operator answers. I tell her my house is being vandalized and tell her my address. She knows my name and tells me to calm down. Then the lights inside the house are on. One of the vandals has come in and is offering me money not to get the police involved. It looks like a $20 bill, two $5 bills, and some $1 bills. I say to the vandal, ""No way! You are paying for this (damage)."" Then all of the vandals are in my living room. They have admitted guilt. Among them are two people I know from high school, Dimitri Klein and John Stoner. John's last name is actually Stromer, but now I know it is Stoner. I am the goody-two-shoes, and fell bad about getting these guys in trouble, but I want to so I stick with it. One kid mocks me for being good. This will go on their records, I know. All at once the kids walk out of the house. There is only one police officer there, and he can't stop all of them. They are going to get their friends for a big last-day-of-school party. They will all come back to my house and totally rip it apart: vandalize it. One kid that I think is with them comes in the back door. He has blond hair. I punch him. He grabs two knives and goes out to try to stop the other kids.

An officer tells me to help by cutting off the leg of a rabbit-deer that is partially frozen into the ground but it still alive. I get a saw from someone nearby. I cut a leg off. It is still alive and it squirms. There is a man frozen into the ground that someone tries to rescue by kicking the ice around his head. This seems like a direct but dangerous way to go about rescuing him. I am in a bedroom with a man and a woman. The woman kills the man."

We find a large sturdy church-like building at Brimson College and go into the bottom floor. It is safer than other nearby buildings with people in. The tornadoes go through. Afterwards, we are all okay. We look around. Paramedics are there. Some people are hurt. I go into a building where my friend Stephen was supposed to be. We would be on the bottom floor. The top floor, where I am, has a floor made of a web-like net. I carefully crawl across it. I call out for Stephen. He got out, and is okay. I go down a floor, where people are waiting to get out. I'm going to break a window. A girl says, ""No!"", not to break the window. A broken window will cost $60. I say to her, ""Isn't getting all these people out worth more than $60?"" Then we see the window slides open. I open it. The girl then sees the whole window slides open, so there is a larger opening. We can get out. I see a replay of what happened. Three tornadoes moved the whole Brimson campus. The campus slid a long ways across the ground."

Among them is my friend Persia Miko. We are going to pull something off, to do something. It may be a prank involving taking things. We may give all the stuff back after it is over. We all meet in a room, which feels like the old lunchroom at Carter School. We talk about our plan. My grade school principal, Candy Bevner, is in the room and hears us. I know this but we still talk about it. Everyone leaves. I'm the last one to walk out the door. As I do, Candy Bevner says, ""Kenneth Hanson and Fred Slick, I want to talk with you!"" Fred isn't there. I walk back. I'm not supposed to be taking part in this plan: it is against the rules. I say to Candy Bevner that we do it every year, or that it happens every year. She makes me come to school two hours early the next day, for detention at 5:30 am. I'm at grandpa and grandma Redding's farm. I am in the living room. There are kids playing in the back yard. I have to get a ride home that night with my brother Wally so that I'll be back the next morning. I'm back in school. I enter a room with the things I had taken in white bags. The students are in the room. I feel like a goody-two-shoes bringing all the stuff back. A math teacher I had in high school, Mr. Crump, is there, and praises me for bringing the stuff back.

Hank wants to sit next to her, so I move seats."
"0344"	"(08/17/1996)"	"Breathing Carbon Monoxide I'm on a bus. I get the feeling of the movie Tommy Boy. My friend Marybeth Neumann is there. There is a hose coming into the bus. Carbon monoxide is coming out of the hose. People on the bus are breathing the air that comes out of the hose. The people are dumb."
"0345"	"(08/17/1996)"	"Kevin sells Terry Mushrooms I'm talking with my friend Kevin Simpson. He just sold my friend Terry Foss an eighth ounce of hallucinogenic mushrooms for $40. I wouldn't have done that. Terry is my friend. I would have given her a discount. Kevin says his going on the trip to the Big Resort Area is questionable."
"0346"	"(08/18/1996)"	"I Killed My Brother I'm at the Middle Mall. I may be Bruce Willis. A car is being driven with Bruce Willis and Rose, from the movie The Color Of Night. She reminds me of my ex-girlfriend Annie: attractive and deceitful. The car is driving to his parent's house. The cripple man from the movie The Usual Suspects is with. Bruce and Rose are in the back seat of a station wagon. There is a sexual overtone, like she is going to give him fellatio. They go in the house. The father and mother are scared of intruders. I am now in the dream, not Bruce Willis. The group goes into the basement, to assure themselves that there are no intruders. They have a dog, which starts barking. We see that there is an intruder with a gun. It is a man by the bathroom. The person approaches us. We see it is an older woman that has problems: she is not emotionally well. She comes forward, and I wrestle the gun from her. It goes off one into the floor, and I turn it on her and fire a second time. Two people that I catch chickens with get shot, one is Randy, and the other is the guy who always sits at the front of the van. The man who rides in front is shot twice and is still living, so I shoot him in the head, which kills him. I am terribly sad. I cry and cry, saying, ""I killed my brother!"" I am beside myself with grief."
"0347"	"(08/18/1996)"	"My Dad Walks In On Me I'm with a girl in my bedroom. We're naked. I'm lying on my back. She is sitting on me, leaning back. I try to get penetration to have sex with her. My dad comes in the room! She quickly rolls off me. He walks by me. I'm naked. I say, ""Excuse Me!"" sarcastically, and put on a pair of boxer shorts. I'm not that embarrassed, which surprises me in the dream, and in real life."
"0348"	"(08/18/1996)"	"Chasing Wild Turkeys I'm at Carter Church. There is some kind of a banquet or reception about to take place. I'm early. One banquet just got over. People are still preparing for the second one. I'm underdressed, but it doesn't rally bother me. I have on a white shirt and no tie. Most other people are wearing ties. Someone tells me there are some gold headed bald eagles right near there. I go out to see. There are three wild turkeys. I am in the alley between Old and Bauer Avenues in Oak Valley, waking northward from 1st Street. There is a lot of snow on the ground. One of the turkeys is old, I could get it easily, but I don't want it. I find that I have it in my hand, but I let it go. There is one male and one female turkey. One has a bright array of feathers. I want that one. I stalk it. It hides behind bushes. I crouch low and sneak up on it. I run and spring, diving at the one I want. It narrowly escapes. Both turkeys fly away. As I walk back to the church, I think that I will have to tell my friend Kevin Simpson what an adventure this has been."
"0349"	"(08/19/1996)"	"Driving With Tom and Virginia I'm driving a car with my friend Virginia Green's house. With me are Virginia and my classmate Tom Dement. I talk to Tom about college, saying he must be leaving pretty soon. He says he leaves tomorrow. I ask him if he is packed yet. He says no. We are going down the street near my dad's old little house, parallel to the railroad tracks. We are going east, towards Friends Avenue. Near the trucking barns, there is a reddish or pink car. It looks like it was assembled by hand using parts from different cars. It is made of steel. I turn right onto a road and go down towards Virginia's house. I park the vehicle, which is a red Volkswagen Bus, on the sidewalk in front of her house. We get out. It is cold and raining. Virginia's father is standing out in the yard. He is clean-shaven and his short, dark hair is combed. Her sister is in the hot tub in the back yard. I think of how I got sick from being in a hot tub in the back yard. I walk from the front of the house to the side door, going by the bushes and shrubs. I think of asking Virginia when her birthday is. Then I remember it is during the school year, in the spring. Now, it is summer. I walk into the side door of the house and go through the kitchen. In the living room are my friend Emily Zates and her younger sister Audrey. Emily hopefully asks me if I brought any board games. I didn't. There is another girl with them. She has five beers. I find a rubber gun that shoots ping-pong balls. The girl I don't know and I shoot balls at each other, flirtingly. I say to her that five beers are enough for her because she is so small. There is a party at Virginia's house. There are mostly guys there: jocks from high school. My friend Lyle Zeffman is there. Another kid is there who looks younger. He weighs a lot. Lyle has taken this kid's shirt and is teasing him. The kid is embarrassed. He has a diaper-like white cloth or bag tucked into the side/rear of his pants, which are pulled up really high. The kid has butt-white skin; pale. There is a phone call. It is my friend Jimmy Youngman in Colorado calling. I talk to him a little bit. I talk like he is my friend Jack Miller, and I recall the time when Jack caught a big rainbow trout when we were fishing. I tell him that my friend Kevin Simpson and I went out this year a few times fishing for trout and didn't catch any. I finally say, ""Jimmy, I don't know what to say."" Virginia is upset because her party isn't turning out well. So far, it is a bunch of jocks making fun of each other. I go out to the porch. The porch gives me the feeling that I am in Clarence Bahe's house, which is where I used to deliver papers. There are people in the back yard. My friend Kathy Branch is on the porch with me. She is smoking a cigarette. I say to her, ""Looks like you picked up a nasty habit at school."" She says that she doesn't like the taste of it. Her cigarette is huge. When the outside of it burns away, there is an inside ""core"" to it. My friend Stephen Ramos and his work friend Izzy drive by in Stephen's brown car. I run out onto the street yelling and jumping up and down. They turn around and come back. A turquoise station wagon pulls up. In it are my friends Kevin Simpson, Stephen, and Sam Kingsley. I greet them with some funky hand slapping, like on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. There is a guy there with long dark hair dressed in clothes from the 1970's. Kevin has a big wooden cross, which is a horse or a boat to him. He also has an oar. He is pretending to be an adventurer and he puts on a show, jumping over a car and speaking lines from movies with a Scottish accent. My friend Persia Miko is outside with other people and they watch. I laugh. It's good to be with the guys again."
"0350"	"(08/19/1996)"	"Pornography At A Gas Station I'm at some sort of a gas station. There are other people with me. We're waiting to be picked up. There is a magazine rack with pornography on the bottom shelf. I pick up a magazine with a black background and two scantily clothed women on the cover. It has a huge centerfold that is many pages long. I am sexually aroused. The bathroom there is old and creaky and covered in dust and cobwebs. I do into the bathroom to masturbate, but it is not a private bathroom. There is a hallway going into the bathroom. I walk out. Bill from Bill's Country Farm Stand is there. Our van comes to pick us up. It is a van for the chicken catchers. We are all going to a recreational spot: a lake cabin or something. We get there. The place has two floors. On the bottom floor there are some attractive young women at a desk, like at the Middle Mall Fitness Center which I go by often. I am naked. I have my green towel to cover me. I have underwear and shorts in my hand but no place to change into them. My high school basketball teammate Olie Kecker is there. He is growing a good beard. My friend Mya Rousing is there. There are many others there."
"0351"	"(08/20/1996)"	"Selling Christmas Trees I'm selling Christmas trees in what seems to be the St. Mary's Church parking lot. A man comes and wants to buy two trees, but he only has enough money for one tree. I am selling them for $8.00 each. There are people in trucks that are stealing all the trees. There is a fight. People are wounded. I kill the dying people. My basketball teammate from high school Chad Owens is there. The owner of the tree lot comes and turns on the lights and the music. A nice black man comes, and I tell him that this is not a good time."
"0352"	"(08/20/1996)"	"Tennis At The Olympics I'm in the Olympics playing tennis. It is me against a star player. I don't use a racquet, and I do okay. Then I have to jump over the net to get to a shot, and I don't make it. I start using half of a racquet, broken off at the handle. I don't do well at all like this. I can't serve the ball. We are playing over water. I push some metal doors forward to get more room to serve. I don't score a point in the final match. I get beaten very badly. My dad is in the crowd. My last serve nearly hits my grade school principal, Candy Bevner, who is near or in the water. I lose horribly, but he crowd cheers for me, to be nice. My dad says I got smoked ""royally"", which somehow a joke on a royal flush hand, in poker. I have never completely failed at anything in life, until now."
"0353"	"(08/20/1996)"	"A Class On Dreams I am with some people in a room. A woman says she has heard of my interest in dreams. She says there is a class of five people that are going to start working with dreams and offers me a place in the class. I'm overjoyed and tell her I'd love to be in the class!"
"0354"	"(08/21/1996)"	"Igloo Dragons There is an empty brick enclosure with no top. Inside it is a fierce fire-breathing dragon. It kills everything. It is total destruction. There is a window or opening in the walls. There is one man outside the enclosure with a radio, monitoring the dragon. Then the dragon goes over to the wall where the window is and smashes the wall with his tail. The walls all start to crumble. As they do, the falling bricks from the collapsing walls form an igloo. The man outside is now a little dragon, and he escapes through the igloo."
"0355"	"(08/22/1996)"	"Weed At Grocery Getto I'm at Grocery Getto. I'm a cart pusher. The weather is pretty bad. There are a few of us cart pushers. We are working hard to build the wall of carts. Inside the cart room there are two little rubber markers on the floor that need to be turned at the proper angles so the carts are straight. My boss Jack Krane is in the cart room with us. I align the markers correctly while he watches. I am working on a Friday, 4-10pm. Jack and I walk into the store eating bananas. He motions for me to hide my banana, because we shouldn't be eating in the store. Another manager, Darma Mantle, is there. She walks by me as I am up near the front of the store getting hot chocolate and marshmallows. She asks me what I'm working. I tell her 4-10pm. Another employee, Sandra Cauly, who looks and sounds like the woman on the movie White Men Can't Jump, is on the intercom paging the courtesy employees out to the cart room to get rid of some weed. She pages twice, and the word ""weed"" rings out. It seems strange that she would use that word."
"0356"	"(08/23/1996)"	"Black Captives in Dungeon There is a ""Superboy"" character. I may be him. I am a captive of a bad army-like group. They take me to their fortress. I pick up change on the way. The bad leader kicks me because he's annoyed that I'm picking up change. The fortress is all locked up. A dumb guard escorts another man and me. We fool him and escape. I swing on staircases and jump down to a lower level. I go down to a basement area where I find a number of captives in a room. They can come and go in secret because they have a key to the door outside their cell. One of the leaders of these captives is black. I think of oppressed black people. It is like the movie Hogan's Heros. The prisoners are undermining the captors."
"0357"	"(08/23/1996)"	"Jasper Yams Driving Cadillac I am in a snow-covered yard talking with my friend Ivory Alshire. There are sexual overtones. I walk away with a small leaf-less branch poking in the snow. I go to my neighbors, the Stein's, front yard. I approach three people to talk, one of whom is a college classmate Brad Chloe. Parked on the street is a white Cadillac, with two carpeted armchairs as seats in the front. It is my friend's mother, Patty Yams' car. I find this out be asking my friend Matt Yams, who is there. Matt's brother Jasper is driving. Jasper is walking down the street in a short-sleeved white shirt and tie, in the winter! It is slippery and slushy, with lots of snow on the ground. The car is parked on the west side of Home Ave, facing north. As a result, when Jasper pulls awake, he has to cross a lane of oncoming traffic to get to the right lane. I am in the car. We move slowly. It is slippery. It is dangerous because a car may appear suddenly over the hill in front of us and not be able to stop in time. We are all in a van, like a chicken catching van. I talk to Jasper about having sex. He says he doesn't have sex."
"0358"	"(08/23/1996)"	"Defecating With Stephen I'm in my friend Kevin Simpson's bedroom, but is seems like my friend Bubba Hacker's house. There are two men and three women there. One of the women is for me. She wants to have sex. She puts my hand on her crotch. I am drinking a Pepsi. I want to take a shower before we have sex, because I stink. After I finish the Pepsi, I get up to go shower. I go upstairs. The house is being remodeled. I look for a bathroom with a lock on the door. There are no closed in bathrooms. I find two stalls. My friend's father Philip Hacker and another man urinate in them. Then my friend Stephen Ramos and I go in. I go in the one that Philip used. I wipe urine off the rim of the toilet seat with toilet paper. I think there is no more toilet paper, and I need more. Then I see another role. Stephen and I both defecate. His toilet is a couple of feet higher than mine. I can see him. There is a party going on around us. It is a very modern house."
"0359"	"(08/26/1996)"	"Mirror Naked My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is standing naked near the long mirror that used to be in the dining room at home. I go stand next to her. I am also naked. We rub, lick, and kiss each other on the floor. She says to me that I don't ever do ____ (I don't recall what this is). I agree. I give her cunnilingus. She has a small, flat clitoris. Her vagina is very wet, and it has no hair. We hear her father's voice, but it doesn't bother us."
"0360"	"(08/26/1996)"	"Catching A Duck I'm fishing with another person. There are bystanders there. I use a spinner bait. It may be a Mepps. It goes on the surface during the retrieval, and then I use it in combination with a bobber. I get a hit. The fish pulls me in! It fights awesome! The line doesn't break. I have hooked a white duck! It comes after me. I kill it by breaking its neck. I also kill other ducks."

We are in a basement area, a small shop. I feel like I should buy something. I get a grilled cheese. I ask a stranger if he can buy beer for me, and for my friend Nate Nelling. He agrees. I give him $15. He says it won't be enough. I think beer will cost about $2 a bottle. I tell him to get a 6-pack of Killian's Red and a 6-pack of another beer. He leaves, and brings back Killian's and Coors. I thank him. The place closes. People line up to get out. I pick up a bag for the beer. It has a hole in the bottom. I get another bag. We walk by the church downtown, and by the post office. Then we walk to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas' house. I am with my friends Stephen and Marge Drummond. We are hauling wood in sleds, and there is snow on the ground. I say to Marge, ""Memories from the Thomas household."""
"0362"	"(08/27/1996)"	"Crying Dream There is a group of people. Some of there died. They were soldiers. There is a funeral. I am talking with my dad. I am dreaming (in the dream) that I talk with my dad about the interpretation of a dream. I cry in that dream. I cry in the dream of the dream. It is a release. I think it may have something to do with a past relationship with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas."

I am mad! I don't want to live with three people. Stephen doesn't seem to mind. I raise hell! It is raining outside. A new first year student comes to move in. I help him. He has floatation devices blown up."

It is an exciting time, of anticipation. I go through Carter School. The closets are like those at Brimson College. A leader with a gun kills some aliens."
"0366"	"(08/30/1996)"	"Fight at Bill's I'm fishing with my dad and my brother Wally. I tell them the lake is half full of weeds. I reiterate what I said when they see it. My dad is then in his canoe. I go into Bill's Country Farm Stand and give them by cash box with $50 inside. I look for something. The store is closing. It is the end of the season. The store is bare. I watch television with Wally in the lounge there. A high school classmate, Sherri McDonald, and others are cleaning the inside of Bill's store. One guy yells at me, telling me to help clean. I tell him I only work outside the store, and that selling season is over. I walk out. He runs after me, and jumps on my back. He pinches or squeezes my testicles, or does something painful. I fall down on my back, smashing him against the parking lot. I thrust my elbow into his face. I put my thumb on his throat like I can kill him, and tell him to leave me alone."
"0367"	"(08/30/1996)"	"Sexual Cult I'm at home. There is a pounding noise on the garage door. I go out the back to see who it is. It is a lady with big hair. There are intruders in my house. A woman is there. A man has climbed in the house through the window above the sink. Another man is also there. One man wants money and valuables. I am eating a peach. The woman likes the peach. The man wants my money for college. I say I earned $200 per week for one month. I say that is $100, and I have to pay insurance, so there is no money. Then something turns erotic. I touch the woman's crotch with my hand, outside her clothes. I rub her clitoris, and she has an orgasm. There is a naked man who wants me to sexually arouse him. I am appalled at this overture. He keeps pinching my butt. I grab his hand to stop him, but there are more hands. It is like a cult. This was a robbing, but now it is sexual."

The area under the road is entirely metal. There are several rooms with mechanical items operating in them. One room is a boiler room. My sisters Heather and Ramona and brother Wally and brother's friend Carl Rock are there. Wally and Carl argue about a location on a map. People are swimming in muddy water. There are masks for swimming. Some of these cover one's nose and eyes, while others cover just the eyes. I leave my Brimson identification card in a metal boiler room. I go to the basement of Carter Church, which is the cafeteria of the college. I think they'll let me in even though I don't have my identification. I talk to the manager. They won't let me in even if I tell them my identification number: I need to physically have the card. I go out the back door of the basement to the manhole and go down. A semi truck drives by. The rooms are all metal, and all mechanical."

The corn is husked and cooked, and you pick out the ears you want to buy from a big pot. The kid is my age. I say I don't want to pick through them all because I know what it's like to be selling to picky customers, but I do want good corn. My mom and my sister Ramona come over too. We are having steak and corn for dinner. My brother Wally is also there, it may be his birthday. He is having four steaks. I try to calculate how much corn we will need. My mom says she'll eat two ears and Ramona says she'll eat four. There are eight ears in the pot so I decide to buy all of them. Then the kid selling the produce drives away."

Other people from Brimson are also there. I recognize faces but don't know their names. One girl is insulted that I don't remember people's names. Her name is Holly. She has dyed blond hair. My high school classmate, Karen Baton, and her brother Ryan have also parachuted in. There is a jazz ensemble at Lake Jefferson. Some is playing pool. This may be me. I am near the railroad tracks by Carter School. My friends from high school, Lyle Zeffman and Nelson Eastman, are there, with my grade school principal Candy Bevner. There is a television crew there interviewing elderly people. I walk by a reporter. It is sunny day. Usually people follow and crowd around me. Today they don't. I walk towards Holy Avenue. The grass is long and green. I am kind of surprised that no people follow, as if I need to have my followers, but I continue. At my friend Gino Teavor's house is a huge display of Kirby Puckett memorabilia. Gino is having a party, but doesn't want to make it obvious. I walk down his block to the corner of 1st Street and Holy Avenue, then go around to the alley behind his house. My sisters Heather and Ramona both drink alcohol. Ramona waits for me to get home. There is a box of different kinds of alcohol. One is a bottle of 30-proof gooseberry liqueur. One can buy this at a grocery store. I want to try it."

My lawyer, who is black, and reminds me of Robert from my music class, does not question anyone. So, it is the prosecution's turn. I am sworn in. The judge talks to me. Between the first witness and myself there is a recess. Kids play baseball with a blow-up bat and ball. Everyone scrambles to regain composure as the judge is about to re-enter the courtroom. I scramble too, and my feet fly off the floor at one point. I am being charged with Assault 200. The maximum penalty for that is 9 years in prison. I was driving a boat while drunk, and I hit a car that was towing a boat. There were no injuries. I hit the car on the passenger side. A diagram is used in the courtroom to replay the events as they were said to have occurred. I tell the judge and the jury my story when I'm on the witness stand. When I do this, I am in my back yard at home, and the jury is on the roof of my house! I tell them I don't remember much because I was drunk. I tell them I was in downtown Wilmerton in the large parking lot across from the Perkins and the movie theatre. I was driving drunk and I knew authorities were near. At this point I am swinging on a tire swing in my back yard drinking a beer. I say that what I am on trial for was a dream. I say to the jury: ""I don't know if you all believe in dreams, but I do. I've been journaling them for four or five years."" I say it is concrete evidence. Then I think to myself, ""A dream as concrete evidence?"" A dream is not concrete evidence to these people."

Two old ladies are working at the concession stand. We get big tubs of popcorn. Kevin gets a spray bottle of melted butter. The theatre seats slide around as the movie plays. People brace themselves by putting one leg in front of the seat and one in back of it. I sit normal, with both my legs in front of the seat. There is a problem with the movie screen. People are supposed to try to climb the curtain around the screen using the knuckles of their index and pinky fingers. I try it. The curtain and screen break and fall down. We can see outside, because the curtain isn't there. We wait for the people to fix the curtain. The Allure family is there. I am sitting down next to the screen. Harmony Allure comes and sits by me. I say to her sarcastically that she must be pretty desperate to sit by me. She sarcastically replies, ""Yeah."" The movie starts again. We all leave because we don't want to watch it. We go outside. Tom Allure yells at a man driving a truck because the man is scratching the sides of the truck. The sky is black with clouds. There are brilliant light cracks in the clouds that are golden-silver in color. We go to the side of a building where there is a big chalkboard. People paint on it. I talk with Harmony about school. She tells me about how bad her football and German classes were. I tell her I would drop a bad class."

I am upstairs looking through folders trying to find my class schedule. Time is running out, and I need the schedule. People are handing me applications. I see my friend Gino Teavor.

I pull Edith's legs and pelvis up onto the mattress, while her torso is on the floor. Her vagina tastes bad: salty. He clitoris only responds to certain types of stimulation. It becomes long and stringy, like a bean sprout or a piece of hair. There are four different kinds of soup. One is rice soup. Another is pea soup. I don't know what the other two soups are."
"0379"	"(09/10/1996)"	"Four Bags There are four bags of something. The first bag weighs 202.50. The third bag weighs 202.56. (I forget the bulk of this dream)."
"0380"	"(09/11/1996)"	"Rusty Basketball I'm playing basketball in the gymnasium at Brimson College with a bunch of guys. I sit out while my friends Jimmy Youngman and Sam Crimson and the varsity basketball players have a game of four-on-four. Another guy arrives, so we start playing five-on-five. I play well at first. I haven't played in a long time. I jump a couple heads higher than everyone else while rebounding. People are dressed in blue and in green. Then the first year players come in. I start making bad decisions when playing; make some bad plays. I have a blue bandana and a hat on. I take these off."
"0381"	"(09/11/1996)"	"Throwing Stick Towards Melvin I am canoeing. I have a little bit of food left and I am tired. I have a camera. My hands are black from the gloves I was wearing. I am down by Hill Park, still in the canoe. My uncle Rusty Redding and his son/my cousin Melvin Redding are there. I throw a stick up at the park shelter. It goes over the lily pad-covered water between the shelter and I and lands on the roof of the building. Melvin is surprised. The stick hit something that nearly landed on him. I go clean up the garbage on the park lawn, which is then my front lawn."
"0382"	"(09/11/1996)"	"River Fishing Scandal I'm going fishing with my mom, an old lady, and a young man. We are going to fish on the Main River. It is evening. I pull the boat into the water, rather than backing it in. I'm not sure which vehicle I'm driving. There is a tree in the way, so I decide to back the boat in. When we put the boat in, the landing is filled with huge rocks. My mom wants to be back by 6:00 am so I figure we have a good two hours to fish. I go and park the trailer. I drive down the road a ways and find a driveway I can turn around in. I think that the mosquitoes probably won't be bad because of something, but it is evening so they'll be worse than usual. We lift the boat in, scraping it on the rocks. The anchor is hanging out. There is a dammed up stream leading out to the river that we travel in before getting to bay on the river. It is like we are portaging. There are broken oars all along the river and in the dam. I step on the dam-made of intertwined sticks and leaves and oars-to pull the boat through. There are many boats out in the bay. It is packed. There is good smallmouth bass fishing. We travel out of the stream. There is a man driving a nice boat with a trolling motor on it, going the opposite way. . There is an office in the bay. I am in it with three other men. They are doing something corrupt. Two of the men leave. I talk with the third man. A truck pulls up. I am not in the office now. A woman in the truck has her boy get out and run something important into the office. I hide and try to watch the boy. I'm in my mom's bedroom at home looking out the window to where I think the boy will be. I am going to climb out and intercept the boy. I have my leather jacket on. As I am about to climb out, the lady that I thought was in the truck runs back to the truck. I grab her. Then the boy comes along. Another boy, who may be me, shoots this boy."
"0383"	"(09/12/1996)"	"Taco and Burrito Bowl There is some kind of party going on. It's happening at a house that is being remodeled by the Dirty River Park in Oak Valley. It might be out house. My dad is in charge. Our neighbors, Mary and Kent Robbins come. My dad brings home two huge bowls of tacos and burritos. They are on top of a refrigerator, which is by the big tree near the alley adjacent the compost pile. After I see these, I ask my dad if there is any food around. He tells me there is a big bowl of tacos and burritos to eat. He is eating some now. It looks like they are filled with something white and creamy."
"0384"	"(09/12/1996)"	"Swimming With Melanie I'm swimming in a pool in my back yard with my friend Melanie McDyss. We are diving underwater looking at things. We have one diving mask. I use it first but then give it to her. We continue to dive and we see some little black fish in the pool. We are both underwater, wearing very little clothing. We surface near each other, and are touching. I kiss her neck. A man at the party we are having asks me for a box. I find one but it has my uncle Rusty Redding's camp stove in it. I find another box and give it to him. Grandma Redding is there and I hug her. It is really good to see her."
"0385"	"(09/12/1996)"	"Two Fat Ladies I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We are walking down the alley behind my house to SuperAmerica. I start to kiss her, so we slow our walk and kiss. I lead her over to the space between my neighbor Greg Olson's house and the house adjacent his. We lie down and kiss and touch each other. She tells me to stop, pulling my hand away. I think I am moving too fast. She pulls out a piece of toilet paper from her underwear and says she might be having her period. She runs back to my house. I can see that my mom is out in the garden. I continue walking to SuperAmerica. It is dark out. I run down the alley. Near the Knife's house I run through two fat ladies, who may be Hispanic. Further on, there is a nice lawn that is decorated for a party. Most of the guests have left but a few are there. I run through the lawn. The host is demonstrating something about how much two fat ladies have eaten. It is not very much. There are some tomatoes and other foods that have been set out to ripen on one side."
"0386"	"(09/13/1996)"	"Docking Truck I'm driving my truck with my friend Kevin Simpson. We get off Superhighway 100 and look at a map to see where we are. We are headed for a campground. We decide which direction to go. I back the truck up to turn. I'm on a dock: a cement pier-like structure. I back the truck off the dock halfway into the water. Kevin gets out the driver's side. He has the key to unlock the passenger side door. I am with my friend Melanie McDyss. I drive the truck up on the dock. There are young girls swimming. Melanie and I swim too. We are going out on the lake, later. The truck then seems to be a lawn chair, and I handle it easily. I pick it up and jump into the water off the dock."
"0387"	"(09/15/1996)"	"Long Distance Cunnilingus A mother and daughter are driving down a road. The road is dirt, and the surface uneven. They have to stop and go back, even though the end is in sight: their truck won't handle the road. They walk back. There are blueberries there. There is a strong theme of being trapped. Walnuts fall from a tree. I am in the dream. We have a ladder. There is a statue of the virgin Mary across a lake. I know it is a blessing from Mary or God that we got the walnuts. A woman is trapped in a place with three men. They are going to rape her. The woman is on the phone with someone to help her. Somehow she gets cunnilingus given to her. It is as if her body is in a different place, or in two places at once. I see her. She is sexually aroused while on the phone. The goal of the people talking to her is to make her give them the address of where she is so they can come and get her. They are going to give her cunnilingus until she tells them. Eventually it is going to get painful, and that will make her tell them. (This is a confusing dream.)"
"0388"	"(09/15/1996)"	"Trip for Rusty and Melvin My uncle Rusty Redding and his son/my cousin Melvin Redding stop by our house. They are leaving on a trip."

"0390"	"(09/15/1996)"	"An M&M Sub I'm at a caramel corn shop in Hillston. I'm with my mom, my brother Wally, and sisters Ramona and Heather. We get a box for the popcorn. We eat a lot, then fill the box. Then we eat part of it, and fill it up. We only pay for the box, so really we're stealing. Down near the restaurant there is a huge flat heated metal surface. A shovel is used to scoop up popcorn. Then we're at Subway, in the same mall area. My mom orders a 20-inch ham and cheese sub, a six-inch M&M sub, and a six-inch steak and cheese sub. The ham and cheese sub and the M&M sub are kids meals. Frog meat may be included with the order. The total bill is $7.14. I think we didn't order enough food. I have a glass of water with root beer near the surface. It has a lid and a straw. I drink a lot of pink lemonade because there are free refills. There are a bunch of small containers with trinkets in them on the walls."
"0391"	"(09/16/1996)"	"Apricots I'm in a grocery store with my friend Tiny Combs. We go to the frozen foods section. There are packages of frozen chewing tobacco. A lady wants to get some for her husband. We go to the cash register. There is a line. We move to a register where there is one lady in front of us. We have huge peaches, which are long and cylindrical shaped, like a two-liter bottle. We have a bunch of apricots. Tiny gets a single banana, which go mixed up with the groceries of the lady in front of us. The cashier put the banana back with our food. The cashier rings up the apricots one by one. She takes each and tears the skin off a little bit, and then scans it. I say, ""Wait! You can't do that! I'm not going to buy apricots if they're all torn up. They'll go bad!"" I tell her I want new apricots. I talk to the manager. I do something out in the parking lot, which is where the old Simon's Grocery Store is in Oak Valley. A different, more powerful manager, gives me a bag to get more apricots. I walk through people's yards, and get the apricots. There are three men beating each other, fighting. They seem crazy. One of them yells at me to come over and fight with them. I am scared. I walk away slowly so as not to agitate them, then I run. I pick up beer cans and put them on top of the apricots. There is a leaky can, making the bag soggy. I drop the bag; the bottom may fall out of the bag. I run back to the store. Tiny and I and my mom are going to drive down to Brimson from Wilmerton. Tiny climbs up on my mom's bed. He is eager to go. He huddles beside my mom. I talk about who will drive. I say Tiny can drive, but I want to. I want to drive."
"0392"	"(09/17/1996)"	"Two Jacks of Spades I'm eating at a fancy restaurant with my aunt Willow Redding and my sister Heather and others. I have linguini. There are a few strands of hair in my pasta. Heather gives me some of her food, which has hair in it too. I am in what I think is my front yard. Grandpa and Grandma Redding are there. My cousin Steve Redding and his wife Loretta are there. I talk to Steve. After he expresses an interest in talking with relatives, I tell him that he probably doesn't want to talk to Heather. Then Steve is on the phone with Heather. She has called, and he answered the telephone. I have a deck of cards on a box-like footstool. I say there are two jacks of clubs. I am mistaken. There are two jacks of spades."
"0393"	"(09/17/1996)"	"Selling Girl Scout Cookies I'm selling girl scout cookies with my friend Tiny Combs. There is a house near some road construction with a long driveway that we go up to. We have four boxes of cookies left. A person buys three boxes, and I give them the fourth box because I don't want to have just one box left. It starts to rain really hard. I am in a car in the driveway with Tiny. The windows are foggy. My friend Simon Naver is there in his car."
"0394"	"(09/17/1996)"	"Bunk Bed Sex There is a three-level bunk bed in what is now my sister Ramona's room. The bunks are about eight inches apart, so one really has to squeeze in between them. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and I are on the bottom bunk. My friends Nate Nelling and Emily Zates are on middle bunk. A third couple is on the top bunk. At first, it seems like a man is with me. I take some tennis shoes and use them to try to prop the bunks apart so there is more room between them. Annie and I get very sexual. I give her cunnilingus. She gives me fellatio. We have sex. I touch her. I kiss her when she has a lot of sperm in her mouth. It doesn't taste too good. It is erotic. Grandpa Redding walks upstairs. I go to the door to meet him, naked with an erection. I don't want him to come in and see Annie and I having sex. Annie and I go downstairs to have sex. I start walking down the stairs, and ask Annie to ""hit the light"". She goes to turn the light off and the others wake up. Downstairs there are other people. My brother Wally is in the bathroom. My fingers smell like a vagina. It is 3:00 am."
"0395"	"(09/17/1996)"	"Urinating On Myself I'm walking down the street by my dad's old house. My friends Mya Rousing, Virginia Green, Marybeth Neumann, and a co-worker from college, Megan Hughes, are there. We cross the intersection on Friends Avenue, near the railroad tracks. A woman I know from college named Jenna is there. She hands me part of a roll of toilet paper. Bart Simpson is being tortured for playing a trick on his siblings. His chin is cut with a sharp knife. His fingertips are cut off. I am in that place. I grab the knives and kill the torturers and their accomplices, slicing them and beating them. There are 10 or 15 of them. I walk by my dad's house with the group. I see Julie, who is a first year student at Brimson that I met. I say hi. We ask how each other are doing. She tells me that she had a dream. I sit by her and listen as she tells me the dream. It is a short dream about shoes. She says that ever since she had the dream she has felt bad. While I listen to the dream, I'm sitting on the back of a boat, which is on the ground. Other fishing equipment is also on the ground. We go inside to do a quick dream interview. It starts to rain, downpour, as we do. I tell the other people I am with to go on without me. I get a pen and piece of paper. We turn the lights on. She asks me to let her know if I see a box of laundry detergent. I go to the bathroom. There are all kinds of detergents sitting in a big group on the floor. I urinate. I have on gray sweatpants. The toilet is very small, six to eight inches in diameter. I urinate all over the sweatpants, dripping. I want to make the spots on the sweatpants look like rainwater instead of urine. I use a towel to dry the pants. The sink is where the shower used to be. The crotch of my sweatpants nearly goes down to my ankles, even when I have them pulled up! That is why I urinate on my pants."
"0396"	"(09/18/1996)"	"German Money I'm in Germany. Something about or with an inheritance happens. A man trades me 23 American dollars for German ""dollars"". Later, I think I could have been ripped off. I ride in transportation in the snow. I say to the German man I am with, ""Ich brauche eine Jacke."" We speak a little bit of German together."
"0397"	"(09/18/1996)"	"Tiny's Relatives I am at my friend Tiny Combs' house. I arrive and his father says that he is on his way home. I wait for him. All of Tiny's relatives start arriving at the house. They are rednecks/hicks. I think they are coming from a wedding because they are dressed up."
"0398"	"(09/18/1996)"	"A Kiss For Ivory I'm in a bed with my friend Ivory Alshire. I'm lying on my back. She is on top of me, on her stomach. She says that I am a lot younger than her. I say yes, that is true. She asks me for a kiss, and I am a little bit surprised. I look at her. She is smiling, and I see her crooked teeth."
"0399"	"(09/18/1996)"	"Skipping Work I go home to Wilmerton, forgetting that I have to work at my job at Brimson College in Woodland. I think I should call someone to let the two people on my shift know that I won't be there for work."
"0400"	"(09/21/1996)"	"Avery and Archie I'm at a cabin. My cousins Avery King and Archie Weber arrive in a little car. I feel out of contact with them: they have always had a more intimate relationship than I have with them. I'm drunk, and I fell dumb. They have a few rabbits in the trunk of their car that they let go."
"0401"	"(09/23/1996)"	"Cheryl and Ivory Strip I'm at a strip club with a couple other guys. My friends Ivory Alshire and Cheryl Wrightson are there, with another woman. Another guy and I pay for the three women to go up on stage and strip. They do. Ivory and Cheryl have full-cut underwear on, and bras. They have bright, thick stripes on them. Ivory takes off her bra. She has saggy breasts, like an old woman."
"0402"	"(09/23/1996)"	"Muskrat Shell I'm with my friends Tom Napper, Nat Miller, Niles Zelling, and Tom's father Dick. I'm walking towards my house in Oak Valley, down 2nd Street. They go way ahead of me. I am wearing white shoes, white pants, and a white shirt. I get a bloody nose and drip blood on my pants. I run back. I go behind my neighbors the Trammell's house. There is a big fallen tree where a muskrat lives. The muskrat has a shell on it. Part of the shell has been removed, and the muskrat won't live long because of it. I'm a little bit afraid of the muskrat: I think it might be crazy and attack. It swims in water into the bottom of this fallen hollow tree."
"0403"	"(09/23/1996)"	"Dirty Underwear I have some white underwear. I take them and rub my legs with them. The dirt comes off from behind my knees and colors the underwear yellow and brown."
"0404"	"(09/24/1996)"	"My Dad's Horrible Act My dad has left the kids, or has done something really bad in the eyes of society. It was in the newspaper. I'm in a house, which isn't mine. It seems to belong to someone who has more money than we do. My brother Wally, and maybe my sisters Heather and Ramona and my mom, have come to get me. The place seems like my aunt and uncle Elaine and Marvin Grains' house. We are all in the garage. We have some boxes of stuff to carry. It could be my stuff, since they've come to get me. All of them know of this bad act except me. I am very angry and upset. I ask them to tell me the full story of what has happened. Wally says he'll tell me later. I say no! I want to know now!!!"
"0405"	"(09/24/1996)"	"Bad Driving I am in a car. My sister Ramona is driving. She is going the wrong way down the shoulder of a busy highway, at a speed of 50 or 60 miles per hour. I am going nuts!! I am very nervous and scared. We go to park the car. We're on a hill. The car is a stick shift. Ramona has trouble parking the car. The house we are at is that of people who have more money than we do. They have two vehicles, and a third tiny truck smashed in the garage. My brother Wally says he'll lock the door, because it's important to do that right. My truck is there. It is green. My dad is there and is going to drive it but he can't figure out how to do so. Ramona or my sister Heather is in the truck as well. There is another vehicle driving home. We have traveled to home earlier in the day."
"0406"	"(09/24/1996)"	"Stephen Plays Piano I walk into a piano recital late with another person. My friend Stephen Ramos is playing the recital. We walk up the side stairway and sit there until he is done playing. I think my mom is there, and she plays something too. I am wearing my fuzzy winter jacket. I sit in a loft-like section with my jacket half zipped and my hands deep in my pockets."
"0407"	"(09/25/1996)"	"Toast on Fire I'm giving my dad a paper I have written, which is pinned on the bulletin board above the phone at home. It is Valentine's Day. I hug my dad and tell him I love him. As I do, I break down and start to cry. There is a toaster nest to us. My toast starts on fire! I pull it out and put the fire out. They jelly I put on the toast doesn't spread very well. My sisters Ramona and Heather, and my friend Brittany Johnson from Brimson are eating cereal with candy fruit in it. The candy fruit is like the orange jelly slices or jujy fruit candies, but is in different colors and shapes, and is bigger. It is winter. My aunt Willow Redding is there. I have to go wake up my friend Darlene Miller from Brimson so she can meet Willow before Willow leaves."
"0408"	"(09/25/1996)"	"Jiggle Sticks I'm at the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. There is a man at a stand selling jiggle sticks. My brother Wally and I walk by. The man has a jiggle stick for 59 cents, and one with a reel for $20.00. He is showing them to another man. Wally goes on to an animal or bird restaurant. The other man buys the rod for 59 cents. I ask the seller if he has any more of those rods. He says no, it is too early in the season. I have been holding a jiggle-stick. It has become tangled up. I try to straighten it, untangle it. My grade school classmate Brownie Bruny is there with her father. She looks at me at doesn't recognize me at first. She remembers me as a big dork. I go to get Wally. My mom is there, with my sisters Heather and Ramona."
"0409"	"(09/26/1996)"	"Hat At Country Store I'm at the Country Store outside of Oak Valley. I am with someone. There are big brown hats there that are reduced in price. The original price was $20.00. Some are priced as low as $1.49. I want to buy one."

He thinks he has a snag. I pull up a huge catfish! Heather nets it. They throw it back right away. I wanted to hold it. There is a huge wooden pirate-type ship. I am on it."
"0411"	"(09/26/1996)"	"Mason Alarm I am in Mason Cafeteria at Brimson. My friend Brittany Johnson is sitting at a table trying to raise money for someone's grandma named Karla, who has died. I am picking up change on the floor (pennies, dimes, nickels, and quarters) and putting them in my pocket. A person I work with at the Brimson Library, name Don, is there. I say that it too bad about grandma Karla. I am upstairs in the cafeteria now. There are escalators instead of stairs. I am at the top of the escalator. There is a long line to get food. The big football player who looks like my supervisor from Grocery Getto, Loren Voigt, says something to me about going to the back of the line. I say shit, I don't want to wait! I put my hand on the railing of the escalator and hit an alarm. A buzzing bell goes off. The food server man goes to the panel in the wall with four handles on it. She shuts the alarm off, and then turns on a control alarm. Then he shuts the control alarm off. He turns to the people in line and asks who hit the alarm button. I say it was I: I hit it accidentally, and I'm sorry. He tells me that I'll have to wash the dishes in the cafeteria on the weekend. I tell him I don't even work in Mason! He doesn't care. He gets mad and squirts me with some Palmolive dishwashing soap. I go down the escalator. At the bottom are two Brimson security guards. They are talking. One is holding deodorant. I tell them I have been verbally harassed and assaulted. I ask them what my options are, concerning what to do now. The director of Mason Cafeteria is talking with the guards. I see someone above me run towards where the incident took place. The person running is a black leader. My friend Queen Billman is there. She was with when the alarm went off. She whispers to me that we should just leave. I don't respond to her. I want to be vindicated. It is concluded that the man who squirted me will do the dishes. I explain that he threatened us by telling us we would have to wash dishes. This person is there. He looks different: he has long dark hair, and is not wearing a bandana. He is wearing an apron and his shirt is wet. Queen was also squirted. We leave. I think I'll eat somewhere else tonight. Queen runs and grabs some fruit snacks in a purple package that are on the table of a booth. She hops on a skateboard and skates to her room. I wonder if she is coming back. It seems like it. I walk back to the dorms."
"0412"	"(09/29/1996)"	"Cheryl's House I'm in a van with my friend Cheryl Wrightson, her father, and my friend Ivory Alshire. Mr. Wrightson is driving. We're on the east coast of the United States. We're on a two-lane highway. Drivers are following the cars in front of them too closely: a few feet behind the car in front of them, while going 50 or 60 miles per hour. We pass some cars. There is an oncoming vehicle coming towards us when are in the passing lane. Cheryl's father honks at the car next to us to get them to slow down so we can move over into the right lane. The car we are about to collide with slows down and pulls onto the shoulder of the road. The driver of the car honks at us angrily. We pull off the road onto a side road. We're going to the Wrightson's new house. We drive through trees. I think they are oak trees. Cheryl says they are elm trees."

"0414"	"(09/29/1996)"	"Dumb Computer Girl I go into a computer lab at Brimson and sit down at a good Power Mac computer. I am working. The person who was previously there didn't log out of the network, so I do so for her. She comes back. She didn't save her paper, and needs to get at it. She fools around with the computer, clicking on different things. She can't call up the paper. There are all kinds of advertisements on the screen in tiny squares. I try to find the icon that is the 2MB Mac Format, which is my disk. Eventually I do. She ejects a tiny tape-like piece of microfilm from the monitor and thinks she can use it to help her. There are some printed papers there, one of which is a cover to the work of a person I know named Eric. She thinks she is onto something when she finds this paper. She is dumb! She doesn't know what she is doing; she is incompetent! Next to the computers is a class of introductory level German students. There is a male and a female teacher. The male teacher is dominant. The students are reciting German and using sign language also."
"0415"	"(09/29/1996)"	"Gwynn Vs Thomas for MVP There is a man being pursued. He'll be beaten if he is caught. It is medieval times. The persecutors have horses. The man flees and he can evade the people chasing him. He climbs a tree. I am now the man being chased. They are climbing after me. I think to myself: Who will win the major league baseball Most Valuable Player Award: Frank Thomas or Tony Gwynn? Gwynn is batting .390, but Thomas is batting .340 with 110 runs 140 runs batted in, and 40 home runs. Thomas' stats are conceivably Triple Crown numbers. So, I decide Thomas, hands down. I am not really worried about the guards that are chasing me. I jump off a branch and run away."
"0416"	"(09/30/1996)"	"Milk Story I'm in a camp or a group with a bunch of German people. One or several of them seem to be my mom's cousins. There is a fire started and the end of a log is burning. I break off the burning end by stomping on it. There is a basketball court made of dirt, and a poorly constructed basketball hoop. One lady tells a story about milk in Germany. She talks about how a German family left for a vacation and left the milk sitting out. They were gone for a weekend. The heater was shut off for the weekend and turned back on upon their return. The milk was somehow still good when they got back, and they drank it. The rest of the things in their house were spoiled, and had to be thrown out. I meet my sister Ramona, and her friend, who people are saying I am supposed to like. Her friend is the same age as Ramona, and may be German. I shake both of their hands. There are people in the kitchen making something with cottage cheese. The cottage cheese is bad: it has spoiled. There is more cottage cheese in the refrigerator, which is our refrigerator at home. My mom is there."
"0417"	"(09/30/1996)"	"Roller Derby Rink I'm driving a semi truck. I pull up at the Roller Derby Rink, outside of Wilmerton, behind four semi trucks. It is like being at a skating party for Carter School. My friend Stephen Ramos and I walk in. We walk by our classmate Ryan Pug, from Brimson. The building is all wooden and rustic. We go into the roller skate rental area. There are little kids there. Stephen gets a pair of skates. They are small: size three, I think. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. I look at him with contempt for who he is and what he does. My high school friend Nate Nelling is there, and has a goatee. I have a bag with some cheeseburgers in it. I give a lady $2.00. I think I'll have to pay her about $5 more for skating. I sit in a booth with no shirt on. I am wearing sunglasses and a hat."

There are four moose in a lake that we see in the distance. I have been waiting to see moose; I want to get a photograph. We hurry down to the lake in some kind of vehicle. Jerry throws me my camera. When we get there, the moose are gone."
"0419"	"(09/30/1996)"	"Diving Boards I am on a diving board. There are others there. I am going to jump, but I don't want to hit another diving board that is sticking out. I go down to a lower diving board. I want to run out on it and bounce and dive in."
"0420"	"(10/01/1996)"	"Brown Wrestling Club There is a ""Brown"" wrestling club. There is a big white kid that reminds me of the freshman at Brimson that looks like a person I played basketball against in high school, named Wade. This kid is kind of fat; his skin is flabby. I wrestle him. There are referees. I smash my fingernail. There is a judge of ideas there. I have a change of thought."
"0421"	"(10/01/1996)"	"Holly's Flaming Eye I'm watching television. There is an unsolved mysteries episode advertised with a man and a woman on it. The topic of the show I'm watching is ""something left undone"". I'm laying on the back half of the couch. I'm holding a couch cushion over my head so a dog that is in the house won't bite me. There are two kids around. They might be in the television show. My friend Terry Foss is there. She asks me if she can lay on the cough with me. I say okay. She does. I turn towards the back of the cough and try to sleep. Then I turn and watch television. I put my arm around Terry. We joke and wrestle. I throw her around easily. Terry is then my friend Holly Lapson. Holly has one eye instead of two. We flirt. I am lying on top of her. I try to kiss her, and then I pull back. She is laughing a crazy witch-like laugh. Her eye is red and almost flaming! Her hair is flying about: is messy and in her face. The door in the room slams shut. It then opens. I choke Holly. She has her hands around my neck in self-defense. A man comes through the door. He has light brown hair and a moustache. He is about 5'6"" and thin. He is a hick; a redneck. He has a reptile skin hat of some sort. He wants me to leave, to be gone."
"0422"	"(10/02/1996)"	"Red Dresses I am about to go to school. I am talking with my mom. A car pulls into the driveway. In it is my sister Heather and my aunts Sherry and Nisa Redding are there. They walk in, and I hug them. Sherry looks just like my mom, and so does Nisa! They are both wearing red dresses. My mom is also wearing a red dress."
"0423"	"(10/05/1996)"	"Shaving at Bill's Barber Shop I'm at Bill's Barber Shop in Oak Valley. Before he cleans me up, he asks me why I don't shave. I say okay, that I'll shave, but to use an electric razor. I shave half my face. My classmate Yolanda Ginsburg is there, with others. They can't tell which half of my face I have shaved."
"0424"	"(10/05/1996)"	"Blue Corduroys I'm at JC Penney's. There are some people with me. I am looking at corduroy pants. There is a nice thick blue pair of corduroys for $5. I think I will get them. There are other color corduroys too."
"0425"	"(10/05/1996)"	"Funny Shaped Pornography I'm in a house, which isn't mine. ""My"" room is in the basement. There is another room that is attached to mine. This room has a television and VCR in it. There is a pornography movie there. I put it in. There television is off. I'm going to have to come back later. The movie is funny shaped; it is missing a corner. I come back to the room later, and a girl is sleeping in the bed, so I can't watch the movie. I take it and hide it under my bed."
"0426"	"(10/06/1996)"	"Plane and Tower There is a group of people experimenting with an aircraft. One of them is a young man. One of my grade school teachers, Liza Minikel, is there. The young man flies the plane really low, and then turns sharply to avoid a big cement tower that is there."
"0427"	"(10/07/1996)"	"Camping With Melanie I'm camping with my friends Kevin Simpson, Melanie McDyss, and three little girls. We have three tents. Kevin and I are in one, which is my brother Wally's tent. Melanie and one of the small girls are in another small tent. The other two girls are in a third small tent. I say to Melanie that the tents can be moved so the sun will dry them out better in the morning."
"0428"	"(10/07/1996)"	"White Wolf It is the night before a trip. I'm at home sleeping. There are two small kids there. My sister Ramona is sleeping in her room. My cousin Melvin Redding comes into my room. It is very early in the morning. He is about two years old. I am awake. One of the kids has wet their bed. I am downstairs. It feels like I am taking care of something, maybe the wet bed. My brother Wally asks me if Ramona is okay. He says she has seen a white wolf. I run upstairs to check on her. When I turn to go up the stairs I look out a window. In the back yard where we set the garbage is a snow fort, like an igloo. A light is being shined upon this structure. I run upstairs, into Ramona's room. My old roommate Jens Nils is sleeping in Ramona's bed. He was what she was scared of. His girlfriend Natasha Lens is sleeping in the bed too. I leave. They laugh at me for thinking it was a wolf that scared Ramona. I take a plastic bag, but bring it back because it has Jens' stuff in it. I have no respect for Jens. The family is now up. They are packing for this trip at 5:30 or 6:00 am. I think it is too early: we should go back to bed. There are apple muffins made that aren't good."
"0429"	"(10/08/1996)"	"Flintstones Dial the Vax Barney Rubble's wife Betty from the Flintstones goes to visit Wilma Flintstone at her house. The house looks like a real house. The characters are large, and are dressed up in costumes, like puppet characters. Wilma goes to the door but can't talk loud so she dials the vax, which is a local internet connection, to talk louder."
"0430"	"(10/08/1996)"	"Dishwasher Meat There is a meat commercial advertising a steak. The commercial says that one can even put the steak in the dishwasher. It then shows a dishwasher being opened up with a steak in it. Putting the steak in the dishwasher is not recommended, though. A person, who may be me, tries to trim the fat off of the lukewarm half-cooked steak. The steak is tough. Something happens with boils (the sores) or fat pockets."
"0431"	"(10/08/1996)"	"Riding in Partridge's Yard I'm riding a bike that's kind of small for me. I leave my house and bike down 2nd Street towards Jefferson School. My mom is yelling instructions or reminders to me as I go. I don't want to leave outright, but I ride slow and listen to her. I think she goes to the corner of 2nd and Home Avenue to call out final instructions. I want to raise the seat of the bike up so I can fully extend my legs when I pedal. I have to stop and adjust the seat several times. I ride into the Partridge's yard on the corner of 2nd and Old Avenue. I ride around the outside of their house, and am going to ride down the hill in front of their house and onto the street. I go past a window. The Partridge family sees me. I think they might throw something out the window at me. When I get to the front of the house I dodge the shrubs. There is a wire fence, and I stop. There are random pieces of wood that the kids have used to play. I pick up the bike and walk over the wood and step over the fence to get out of the yard."
"0432"	"(10/08/1996)"	"Matt Yams' Grandparents It is winter. My friend Matt Yams' mother, grandpa, and grandma pull up in a recreation vehicle in my alley at home in Oak Valley. They unload a bunch of stuff. There is a toilet among the things they unload. We carry the things in. I take the toilet. Matt's mother criticizes me, saying, ""Aren't you going to clean it before putting it back in the bathroom."" Matt's grandparents are strict."
"0433"	"(10/08/1996)"	"Chimpanzee Chinese Girl I'm riding a small bicycle with a gear shifter on the right hand grip of the handlebars. I am going down Oak Avenue in Oak Valley. The road is not in good repair: it is cracked and torn up. I ride near Dan Hellman's house and cross over the railroad tracks there. I may walk across the path, because it is not paved. I am riding up the road towards Bill's Barber Shop. I shift into an easier gear. I am at a house where construction is occurring. I have a front-end-loader on my arms. There is a pile of sand there. A man says they are done with work for today, and to leave the front-end-loader; we'll do more tomorrow. There is a screened in area with a chimpanzee in it. It wants to smoke a cigarette. I light it, but it burns too short. The chimpanzee is going to burn itself, so I slap the cigarette out of its hand and stomp on it. The chimpanzee needs to be locked up. I close the two doors on the porch, and lock the outside door. The inside door needs to be locked too. There is a hole and a latch for the inside door. I encourage the chimpanzee as it tries to lock the door. Then there are two loops that a latch must be inserted through horizontally. Then the two loops are two much larger circles, and the latch is a key, which the chimpanzee puts through the circles. When it tries to latch the smaller loops, the chimpanzee is a Chinese girl. There is a pumpkin nearby. I'm at home. The boat is in the back yard covered with a tarp. My sister Heather and her friend Joanne have dumped out some of my beer by the boat. I think it was Miller Genuine Draft. My cousins Melvin and Rich Redding are there. We tip the boat up and Rich takes the trolling motor off the boat. I hold the boat, and tell him to be careful. The trolling motor has no steering head. I ask Melvin and Rich if I have used the boat since it has been wrapped up for the winter. I can't remember if I have. There is a canoe in our yard. It separates into two layers. I carry one layer towards the garage. Melvin carries the other."
"0434"	"(10/09/1996)"	"Larry And Heather's Confirmation I'm outside my house on a skateboard. Some guys from Brimson go by in a car. A man pulls up in a car that looks like my friend Tiny Combs' old car. He gets out and looks at the boulevard. I'm waiting for a flight to Germany. We're leaving the house at 7:00. It is 6:30. My mom leaves. She is buying me some new underwear. My teammate Larry Rollie comes to my house to go to Confirmation class with my sister Heather, if they have it. He walks into the kitchen as I am putting on my white briefs underwear over my pants. I am then wearing overall that have bell-bottoms and bleached spots on them. We eat tortilla chips. There is a newspaper there. In it, I am getting some sort of an award, and there is a plane crash. On the sports page, there is photograph of a small, round battery: the kind that is the size of a button. I wait for a flight ticket. My friend Hilary Nano called 15 minutes ago. I know either my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas or my friend Nicole Peterson has contacted me with a negative response. I kind of want her to call."

Our classmate Yolana Ginsburg comes up and says hi. I say, ""Hi, Yolanda."" No one else says hi. The others are ignoring her. There is a man there who is in charge of the event."
"0437"	"(10/09/1996)"	"Fighting Craig Jard It is winter. I am at home out on the front sidewalk shoveling really wet, heavy snow. High school has been delayed. It is really early in the morning. My high school classmate Craig Jard and some other guys are there. They are jerks: I don't like them. We fake fight, and I use my shovel. It is clear I could beat them up. I go to the back door from the kitchen. The outside door and the screen door are both open. I close the screen door and then show my classmate Acelyn how to close the outside door to the porch. She has trouble closing it. I show her how. It is mostly just pulling the door really hard. There is a girl in the garage that is having trouble closing the door there. The door to the garage from the kitchen is open. The garage light is on. I see a young woman with a long pole in the garage. She is pointing the pole at the door that goes from the garage to the driveway."
"0438"	"(10/09/1996)"	"I Shot The Blue Goose I am shooting squirrels and a few birds with a pellet-type gun. I shoot a lot but don't hit very much. I hit a big blue goose. I think I killed it, and I feel bad. My roommate Stephen Ramos is hunting too."
"0439"	"(10/09/1996)"	"Running In A Corn Field I'm in cornfield running with the Brimson men's basketball team. I, or we, are looking for a person on the team. It may be Jordan Mallstrom, or it may be a shorter, fatter guy. The coach Yar Glenn is then giving the team a speech, telling them to not listen to the new woman who is helping coach the team. He says to listen to him. I am playing basketball with my friends Jimmy Youngman and Sam Crimson on a big mat, the kind used for the high jump. I pretend to play well. I think that four players out of some five players must be on the New York Knicks team."
"0440"	"(10/10/1996)"	"House on Fire There is a house on fire. It seems to be where my neighbors the Shipp's house is. I help a fireman get the top off a fire hydrant, which is laying flat against the ground. We turn the top of the hydrant until the number 10 comes up. The spray of water out of the hose is weak. There are a man and a woman still in the house. I go to the door of the house and tell them to go out of the house. They have spilled alcohol on the rug. I get another hose, and go around the west side of the house, which, when I get inside, is the Drummond Bakery. I drag the hose along, knocking over baked goods. The spray out of the hose is a mist. There is no fire in this part of the building."
"0441"	"(10/10/1996)"	"Rodman and Madonna I'm on a couch at home with Madonna and my friend Niles Zelling watching television. My feet and legs are resting on Madonna, and my head is resting on Niles. I am grabbing Ben's breast, which is larger, like a woman's breast. Dennis Rodman is on television. He is naked. His penis is more than a foot long, and it is limp. Madonna talks about Dennis Rodman's penis. Niles leaves. Madonna and I start to get it on. She is masturbating. I give her cunnilingus, and rub her clitoris with my finger. We kiss. We are clothed, and then are naked. She is going to perform fellatio on me, but I give her cunnilingus again instead. My sister Ramona, who was gone with my mom, comes into the room. She has a sheet of paper with a lot of caricatures on it. There are some sketches of her and of I. Madonna and I leave to get privacy. I say to Madonna that we can go to my room, and that she can stay the night. We are on the stairway. She says we can go to her house, which is 30 minutes away. We decide to go. I grab my jacket and my dream journal. My family knows I am going to Madonna's house for the night. It's winter outside. I go out the door. There is a limousine. I am headed for the back seat, when the driver gets out and tells me to drive. I say okay, and get in. I am sitting on a seat, and there is a bucket seat between the steering wheel and I. The limo driver gives me directions. I turn around near the Roman's house on Home Avenue, and go north on Home Avenue, past my house. My mom is on the side of the road. I slow down, but when I hear her saying that she doesn't think it's a good idea that I go, I speed away. My sister Ramona is venturing out in the street in front of me waving her arms. She doesn't think it's a good idea for me to go, either. I speed up and she has to dodge the limousine to avoid being hit. At Madonna's house, I am playing a large game of golf and some other mystery game. There are two other guys with me. I go to hole number two. I have to climb down a rocky cliff-like formation. The hole is 581 yards long. There is an island where one has to chip the ball up onto a ridge. There is a huge fossil of a fish, about 20 or 30 feet long, at the beginning of this hole in the rock formation. I am looking at another area: how to play that hole. It is rock, but then it turns into a building. I realize that Madonna isn't real: she is fake. It was all a set up to lure people somewhere (here?). There are strong machine-like men there. They have some power. I try to hurt them, but I can't. They hurt me. There is a group of people there, including my friend Beth Mock. We keep the men from coming in through the doorways. There is a cage-like structure with electric chairs in it. A lady tells a story. The people in the cage are set free. I go in. There is an attractive woman in the cage. We introduce ourselves. Her name is Steph. She gets nervous and wants to get out of the cage. We discover there is a fake serum. The serum allows us to beat the men. A kid fakes craziness, and is able to kill one of the men by stabbing him in the throat. I get into the room where they make the serum, though I don't find any of it."
"0442"	"(10/11/1996)"	"Colorful Tent I'm carrying a colorful tent uphill, following my friend Jack Thigpen. It is winter. There is a clamp for a battery lying on the ground. It has broken off something. I pick it up. We go into a big, spacious room with a high ceiling. It is a dreamy room. There is big bed in the room. My sister Heather is in the bed. Upon seeing us she reacts in her characteristic negative way to something about us arriving. I hug her. She reacts negatively again."
"0443"	"(10/11/1996)"	"University of Kentucky I am transferring from Brimson College to the University of Kentucky. It is a dark, rainy night. My friends Ivory Alshire, Cheryl Wrightson, and Kari Kosslyn are with me. Kari has a compass. My friends Beth Mock and Darlene Miller are also there. We run down a hill on a road. We are in a place where there is limestone. I need to get three different types of limestone. There is a grocery cart there, and a long pole. I think I am sitting in the cart. One of my language arts teachers from high school, Dale Zimmer, is there. He says we should have parked in the Quaint Books parking lot, which is nearby."
"0444"	"(10/12/1996)"	"Sex With Queen I'm in a room with my friend from Brimson Queen Billman. I'm sitting on a chair. Queen straddles me. I think her roommate Fran Susse is in the room. Queen and I get close together. I kiss her mouth and her neck. I run my hand up and down her leg and her butt. We are both fully clothed. I kiss her neck more, and then bite her breast. She says, ""Ouch!"" We start to rub our bodies together. She says to me, ""That's the wrong spot"". My hands were not touching her. She lies back on the bed and starts to experience an orgasm. I am not touching her, and she is not touching herself. He pants are unzipped, but are still on. I put two of my fingers in her vagina as she has an orgasm. Her vagina is warm and wet. I feel the inside of her vagina adjust to the contours of my fingers."
"0445"	"(10/13/1996)"	"Two Brothers I am driving a small white car to the cabin, as if we own a cabin. I leave around 7:00 or 7:30 pm. While I drive there, it is dark outside. I spin out in the car, while on the road, for fun. I go to a driveway of a huge building with only two lights on. It is a dark road there. It seems like the building has something to do with my friend Nicole Peterson. I am in the driveway, which seems not to go to the building. I must have gone past the building, I think, and am going through woods at night. I am on a gravel road, and there are trees around me. There is a radio-controlled car 100 feet ahead of me in the road. I am steering it, but I'm in my car. I have a difficult time controlling it. I hit some buttons. The lights on the radio-controlled car go on and off. I turn them on. I have to turn the steering wheel of the car many times to get the radio-controlled car to turn. I get to the cabin, which is my house. I pull into the driveway going fast, and put the car in park because I am driving out of control and don't want to hit the house. The car doesn't jolt as much as I expected it to. I look at the clock. It is 11:38 pm. I get out of the car. It is light out. I walk to the back door. I think no one is home. I wonder if the key is by the door, since I remember using it earlier in the day, and I think I may have left it in the house. The screen door is open, and the key holder, which is about a foot long, is on the sidewalk by the steps. I go inside. The old wooden door from the back porch of the Oak Valley home is there, instead of the new door. The door is open. Inside the living room are my two brothers, Wally and another man his age. They are both wearing leather work boots and cornflower colored pants with no shirt. Another man is just coming in the front door. Wally asks me for my key. I say I put back earlier. He says that is right, because he used it earlier. It must be missing now."
"0446"	"(10/13/1996)"	"Hero, Villain, and Prized Object I am out to eat with my friend Melanie McDyss. She is tutoring another little boy besides the one we both tutor now, whose name is Nick. I want to ask Melanie for her phone number, and I do. My sister Ramona and I are taking care of two kids. One is two or three years old, and the other is an infant. We are near a hay field and a cornfield. I play with the infant in the cornfield after crawling through the hay field. We play peek-a-boo. I have a small snake. It slides around my finger and on the ground. There is a gravel road there. Ramona, I, and the infant are sitting on the road. A truck comes down the road. I move. Ramona doesn't. I yell at her for not moving. The truck goes by. There is a mouse and a dragon. The mouse slides down the dragon's back, cutting into its back with a knife. There is a villain and a hero. The villain has a prized object. The hero takes or gets the object form the villain. They are in a dungeon-like sewer. I am there, too. There is a drain, which is a slide that empties into a pool of thick, goopy, yucky slime. There is a foreign girl there. I think she is attractive, and talk to her. There is another girl there too. The two girls don't like me. I force them to unzip their pants and I touch their genitals. The foreign girl has no underwear on. The pope has called the hero about the prized object. The girls later say that I assaulted them and tried to rape them. I am embarrassed."
"0447"	"(10/13/1996)"	"Two Gangs There are two gangs. A sign is flashed and one gang takes off for its territory. The other gang has figured out the sign, which occurred on either a license plate or a billboard. The second gang (that figured the sign out) is going to try to beat the first gang to their territory. The territory is a rooftop. I am climbing floors in a building, going to the roof. My family is with me. The walls of the top floor are tent-like. There are people on the roof who say, ""Hey, that sounds like the Hansons."" It is two of our cousins and their spouses. The come in from the roof. I recognize them vaguely."
"0448"	"(10/14/1996)"	"Jeopardy A game of Jeopardy is being played. A man, a woman, and another person are playing. I am overlooking the show from a balcony. When the camera is on one person, stage people are taking gum from one of the other contestants. I am in the show, then. I type in the answer ""tennis' late. There is a sports category in the game."
"0449"	"(10/15/1996)"	"Boy Scout Building I'm driving a motorcycle. My sister Heather is on back of the motorcycle. We pass another man on a motorcycle. We are in Oak Valley, and it is nighttime. I turn in to the Railroad Company lot where my old Boy Scout building used to be. The other guy turns into the lot too. I can see his headlights behind me. I park the motorcycle. The man pulls up next to me. It's my friend Bubba Hacker. He needs to get something from the building: a clip or a scarf or another small item. He knocks on the door. I am about to just walk inside when he tells me there are people inside. A woman opens the door. I tell her what we're doing. She lets us in and goes to try to find the item, which Bubba left a long time ago. There are people in the building. They are building crafts: tops, pictures, and paintings. Natural settings are used. The items are like those that one might find in a gift shop in the north woods."
"0450"	"(10/15/1996)"	"Interactive Email I am in a class. The class is over. We had beverages. Someone spiked the beverage I was drinking; maybe spiked all of them. What I am drinking is a Vodka Sour. One of the people there may be my high school friend Elise Rooks. I go somewhere, and take my drink and a soda with me. Two girls come with me. I have another class at 9:00pm. It is now 8:40pm. I have 20 minutes to spend. I go to a computer lab to use email. I use a very old computer, like the ones in the basement of Billings Hall at Brimson. It is difficult to access the email. When I get into the network, I have five new messages, which surprises me because I checked my email earlier in the day. I don't recognize who they messages are from, on the directory. The first message is from my friend from high school Simon Naver. The message has weird graphics, including circles and spirals, and color. There is a place on the screen that says, ""touch screen here"", surrounded by colorful spirals. I touch the screen on that spot. The screen becomes full of action. It displays two people playing racquetball from the point of view of the top of the front wall of a racquetball court. It is in computer graphics. I think this is a neat new kind of email that Simon used. One of the girls I was with walks by. I show her the neat email message. She says that is neat. I am then in a message that I wrote to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I am sort of acting the message out. There is a cliff of rocks and some waterfalls with green algae-like weeks in the water. I am in the water. Annie is up on top of the cliff. I say something to her about not putting her head under the water anymore. I beg her to comply. I say, ""Do me a favor"" twice while speaking to her. I climb up the rocks with running water on top of them. I get cut up and am bleeding. I get to the top of the rocks, all cut up. Annie is then my old roommate's girlfriend Natasha Lens. We hug each other very firmly. I cry very hard. It is sad, and I feel hurt. I kiss her, and we kiss. Our interactions start to become sexual. She is rubbing her body up against mine. She goes down to give me fellatio. I pull off her pants and roll over. We are in position ""69"", where I am on top of her with my head between her legs. She says something about who will orgasm first, and also says something about me squishing her kidneys. I am then giving her cunnilingus. Below her pubic hair her vagina is very smooth. I use one finger to penetrate her vagina. She has an orgasm. After she climaxes, I lick her vagina all over. She is then my friend Norman Noman, from Brimson."
"0451"	"(10/16/1996)"	"Walnut Throwing I'm in the kitchen at home in Oak Valley with my mom, my brother Wally, and my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I say to my mom I need to take a walk. I go out and walk down the hill in the alley. Annie is following me. She then passes me. I see that it is not her, but rather a softball player that I recognize from Brimson. I run down the hill on 2nd Street to get a ball that went down the hill of the yellow house on the corner of 2nd Street and Hill Avenue. Annie is on the other side of the yard. She thinks I am following her. I am back on 2nd Street. Annie and our friend Elise Rooks and my sister Ramona are standing near the intersection of the alley and 2nd Street. I get really mad at them. I throw a walnut at them. The walnut still has its cover over the shell. It hits Ramona in the nose! I feel guilty, and go over to see if she is okay. Annie and Elise are laughing. I am furiously mad at them! I say angrily and seriously, ""I really don't deserve to be treated this way. I really don't!"" I go back to the house. My mom and Wally and one other person are playing a hand of the card game Cut Throat. I get a really bad bloody nose. Someone is leaving on a plane early in the morning."

I say this is the type of stream carp are in. There is a carp below the mud and leaves. We can see the carp dart about when we get close to it. Hilary gets stuck in some deep mud. I help her out. We slip and get all muddy. I say that we should just have sex here. She says okay. We are in a dirty, rocky place. Then we are in the dining room at home in Oak Valley on the floor. We are about to have sex. Her vagina is a weird shaped hand-sized object. She has to pry open her vaginal lips so I can get my penis in. It is very tight, when I do get my penis in her vagina. I try to get it in with firm and constant pressure. I have a red condom on. I get up to close the front door of the house. My mom's bedroom light is on, I can see the light from under her door. Hilary and I quickly move upstairs. I am wearing my mom's robe. We take some of my mom's toiletries with us, including deodorant."

Bratwursts are being sold for 75 cents each. We buy a few. I want two bowls of Lucky Charms. The cost for these is $3.50. I talk to a woman there, who may be my neighbor Mary Robbins. She thinks I am pre-med. A family friend, Dennis Prosecky, is there. He talks to someone about splitting two tickets, and selling them to different people to make money. My mom had given the girls about $103 to buy bratwursts. My mom and I ask them where the leftover $100 is. They make excuses for not having the money. I get mad. Then they tell us that they crashed the car when they were practicing driving on the freeway. The $100 went to pay for damage to the car. They were practicing parallel parking, for which they had to back up, on the freeway! People listen to our conversation, which is loud. We are then at our neighbor's house, the Stein's. Sandra and Nisa's mother, Darlene Redding, is yelling at them. I yell at them too. I say they are immature. They think guys will be attracted to them for parking on the freeway. I tell them to grow up."
"0454"	"(10/17/1996)"	"Fighting Sam Crimson I'm in a car after seeing a movie. A family friend, Izzy Brock, has gotten new shoes for his wife, Leslie. The shoes may have been free. My friend Beth Mock is there. She has crackers. Someone is asking questions. My friend from grade school Matt Yams is there. He is talking about his case of Horse Hoof beer, in bottles. We are near Armstrong high school. My friend Kevin Simpson is with Beth and I by Armstrong. There is a small river or swampy area there. I find some fossils. One fossil is a huge tooth the size of a fist. The other fossil is a cast of a cat's head. The next day we're in the same place, which is then wooded. We're going to move out of the area; we must have camped there during the night. There are two guys there who are leading a group of male campers. The campers are in a line seven miles long. There are two more guys there. I call one of each of the groups of two guys cute. They are belligerent. One of these guys is my friend Sam Crimson from Brimson. He throws a punch at me. I dodge the punch. They think I'm gay and am hitting on them. I say, ""I can't believe you just did that."" We fight. I kick his ass. He lands one good punch on me. I land a lot of punches on him: 10 or 11. There is a card table there that I smash his head into repeatedly. Then he is the ""multi-gender"" guy from my Educational Psychology class (this is my nickname for him). He is mad! He grabs two knives, one of which is a huge butcher knife. I use the card table to beat him away. A police officer comes up behind him and hits him on the back of his head with a gun. He falls down."
"0455"	"(10/17/1996)"	"Rescue Squad Security Guard I'm in the Oak Valley Library with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling, Hank Anderson, Leon Mack, and my mom. We're going to celebrate my friend Nat Miller's birthday. There is a kid there that I know from my Personality class, who also works in the Humanities Learning Center at Brimson. He is playing a familiar song on the guitar and singing. His voice is high pitched. Tim, Niles, and my mom all join in on their own instruments. My mom is playing the violin. She is not very good at it. There is another girl who plays the violin well. I go over to the Oak Valley Rescue Squad Building to see if my brother Wally will buy us some alcohol. Wally is on the porch with some people, one of whom is a security guard. The guard is drinking a beer. I ask Wally if he can buy us some alcohol. The security guard hears me, but doesn't understand what I am asking at first. Then he does understand, and spits beer in my eye. I say to him, ""Do you want to get charges pressed against you?"" I walk away."
"0456"	"(10/17/1996)"	"Beth's Sam Adams I'm in a restaurant with my friend from Brimson Beth Mock. There is a police officer or a security guard there. Someone we know works at the restaurant. Beth has a glass of water. I get a glass of soda. There is talk about something, which we don't want. We leave. Beth's mother is there, and gives Beth a nearly empty bottle of Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"0457"	"(10/18/1996)"	"Sitting at Mason I'm at Mason Cafeteria at Brimson with my roommate Stephen Ramos. There are two women standing on a table talking loudly to get everyone's attention. People leave. Stephen and I leave too. Everyone rushes to put his or her trays away where the deli used to be located. The people working at the cafeteria make everyone go back and site down. Everyone does. Stephen and I sit in a little booth for two people. We then return out trays and leave. I grab a handful of cookies on the way out. We walk out. It is dark out, and is early morning. It has snowed a little bit. The night is nearly over."
"0458"	"(10/18/1996)"	"Old Prostitute and Mummy There is a young female prostitute with a group of men. There is also an old female prostitute. She is really old. The old prostitute gets on a mummy, like an object. It is a dead person wrapped in cloth. She crawls up on the body and is horrified when she realizes it's a dead person. The old prostitute screams. She is terrified. The young prostitute then comforts the old one. The old prostitute is not very good at what she does. She does it, but doesn't really know how to approach a person."
"0459"	"(10/18/1996)"	"Booth With Jackie and Susan I'm in a large room. There are a bunch of tables set up, with two or three people working at each table. I'm with my friend Stephen Ramos. At the first table are Jackie Hunter and Susan Flound, who are two women at Brimson that I find very attractive. There is a third woman there. I sit down with Stephen. The third woman asks me a question. I have my mouth full of beef! The two women I like, Jackie and Susan, don't say much. Stephen and I talk about our friend Kevin Simpson and drinking alcohol."
"0460"	"(10/20/1996)"	"Fish in the Big Resort Area I'm in the Big Resort Area with two people, one of whom is my friend Stephen Ramos. We are canoeing. My classmate Scott Botwright is there canoeing with someone. We are not really sure where we are going. We dock out canoe at a big rock, which is where Scott is. He says we're on Number Three, in response to our question of where we are. We have six or seven maps. We've been looking at map number four, but are actually on map number three. I thought Scott was talking about finger lake number three, since the lakes we are around are shaped like hands. We take out the number three map, which is big and long. The printing on the map is light red, and isn't very clear. I am then with a larger group of people. My dad is there teaching younger kids how to fish. He is doing his crazy casting with a bobber. The water is really deep. I want to jump in, but I don't want to be wet later. My friend's father, Dilbert Simpson, is there. My dad hooks a fish. He has super strong line on his reel, and the line will not break. It is a northern pike. At first I think it is a Walleye. I net the fish right before it spits out the lure, which is a Red Eye Wiggler. My dad wants to keep the fish to eat for dinner. The fish are all over in the water; pike are everywhere. We can see them in the water. I really want to fish! My high school friend Daryl Yeller and his brother go by, like they are on a river. I say hi."
"0461"	"(10/22/1996)"	"Darryl Strawberry's Homer I'm at a New York Mets baseball game. Darryl Strawberry is up to bat. It is the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs. He hits a two-run home run, his second home run of the game! I'm in the right field bleachers. The ball from the home run comes towards me, and bounces. I wrestle a man for it. I almost have it; we are both reaching for it. There are people wearing blue and orange striped shirts. I am wearing one of these shirts. We have to throw the ball 45 feet. We throw the ball the wrong way."
"0462"	"(10/22/1996)"	"Fake Breasts I have two plastic breasts. I play with them. I'm in my mom's room at home in Oak Valley. I'm near the closet. I tell my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, who is with me, to close the door. I want her to close the door so we can have sex."
"0463"	"(10/22/1996)"	"Muddy Shoes I'm running down a hill with my Earth Shoes on. At the bottom of the hill is a ditch, and then a road. I jump over a stream in the bottom of the ditch. My shoes get muddy. Later on, my shoes are cleaned off as I walk in grass: the mud is wiped off."
"0464"	"(10/22/1996)"	"Server Crashed A kid that I know from my economics class and from the computer lab at Brimson, whom I don't like and think is a gimp, comes into my Educational Psychology class and says he lost his article for class when the server crashed. (Note: I was typing an article review for Educational Psychology today when the computer crashed and shut down.)"
"0465"	"(10/25/1996)"	"Heather's Druggies I'm at home with my sisters Heather and Ramona and my mom. I'm out in the front yard, near the front door. Two black men come to the door, which is open. One of them has braces on his teeth. I have a bad feeling about them, like they are up to no good. They are rude, forceful, and blunt. They are going to walk in the house. They drove a black car here, which is a demolition derby car. They say they have to talk to Heather. Heather comes out of the house. All of us are then standing in the front yard. Heather has given the two men drugs, and they need change for two $100 bills. I don't have change for a $100 bill, and I don't want to aid a drug deal. I have $60. One of the men takes my $60. I want my money back, but I am scared of when they might do to me if I try to take it. My mom takes my money from the man, and gives it to me. Their car, with a trailer, is parked in the middle of Home Avenue. I think this is pretentious of them: to park in the middle of the street. I am very surprised that my mom hasn't done anything to stop the drug deal! The drug deal has to stop! One of the men has a knife strapped to the middle of his back. Both men come up on the lawn with knives and attack me. I am pushed up against a tree, and am cut. I am hurt. I get one knife away from a man, who may be Asian, and cut his head off while he is on the ground. The other man is the black man with braces. I fight him. He throws big knives at me. I dodge the flying knives, and pick one up. I have two knives then, and he has one. I give a knife to my mom and tell her she must be wild with it so we can kill the man. We swing our knives and surround him. There is another person there, with us, making three of us against the man."
"0466"	"(10/25/1996)"	"Tossing Balls In A Barrel I'm in the Uptown Mall parking lot near Main Street in Oak Valley. I have driven my mom's car here. There is a hill going up to Main Street. On the hills are balls. Most of the balls are ping-pong balls, but some are golf balls. There are 15 balls, originally. There are more balls, then, and the goal is to throw the balls into a cup, which is then a barrel. Some other guys and a woman are there. We all try to throw balls in the big barrel. Two of the guys like the singer Tom Chochrane, and they sing his songs. One man throws a ball and nearly hits a Juicy Poultry Corporation station wagon that is on Main Street. We all run away. I can't find the car. Two men are talking about a stock or fund investment worth 6.7 million dollars, and what to do with it. I see a kid I know from Brimson named Josh, and his father. My mom flags me down; she needs the car."
"0467"	"(10/27/1996)"	"Partying With Jill I'm with my friend from Brimson Jill Banks, at a party at our friend Scott Botwright's house. I buy cup for beer. Jill buys two cups. The man gives me $2.00 in change after I give him $2.00. He thinks I gave him a bigger bill. The keg of beer is in the kitchen. The beer is really pale, like water. I spill some beer. I fill Jill's class. No one else is in line for beer."
"0468"	"(10/27/1996)"	"Plane In A Lake I'm in a plane with a lot of other people. The plane lifts off very slowly, like there is trouble with the take off. The pilots try to roll the plane, and it crashes into a lake. We are floating in a lake. The pilot hands out life preservers. I get one, and so does the person next to me. The lake is at the end of the runway. The pilot's calculations were correct; he made no error. I tell him I think he is still a good pilot. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is in the back of the plane. I tell her to get a life preserver and help because she can swim well. The pilot's mother comes aboard the plane. She says the plane is one foot off the bottom of the lake. She flies the plane out of the lake."
"0469"	"(10/27/1996)"	"Guitar at Washington University I'm playing guitar while sitting on a chair that swivels around. I feel like I am at Washington University. My high school English teacher, Mike Mohs, and a professor I had at Brimson, Jerry Rice, are there. I go to the student union building, where my friend Melanie McDyss is. I think I have left my keys somewhere, so I won't be able to get back in the building I was in."
"0470"	"(10/27/1996)"	"Grading Rocks I'm at my high school, Armstrong High School, taking one of my college classes, Historical Geology. The teacher is my college professor, Greg Welters. We are looking at the grades. We are lined up going into a room. There is a box of small, rounded cylinder pebbles that are painted different colors and that have designs on them. The colors and designs denote different grades. My friend from high school, Marybeth Neumann, is in front of me in line. She looks at my grade, and then says out loud that I got a C+, and that Nancy Meyer, who is a classmate of ours, is getting an A+. I don't mind that she looked at my grade, but I don't like that she said it out loud. In class, Professor Welters talks to me about something. I miss out on a sheet that he told everyone to hand in because we were talking. My high school classmate Lyle Zeffman is there. He tells me of a lake in Canada, near Los Angeles, to go fishing. It is in Quebec. There is a boy that is riding a bicycle on a freeway ramp. I am then on a small bicycle riding up an exit ramp of a freeway. It is difficult to pedal, but I do. People are watching me. I fall into water, and make it out of the water. I ride the bicycle over an overpass. I ride on the freeway, and then on the side. I may be Asian. I go down a hill, which is like a narrow cement boulevard along the freeway. The bicycle goes very fast! At the bottom of the hill there are roots and rocks like on a portage in the Big Resort Area. There is an Asian boy at the bottom of the hill. This boy is talking about religion. He says he can see it."
"0471"	"(10/27/1996)"	"Pheasant Hunting I am going pheasant hunting. I go out of a barn. My cat, which is for hunting, is waiting. I throw the cat up on a small wall and grab my gun. I see two pheasants."
"0472"	"(10/27/1996)"	"Gang Related Bumper Sticker I'm at the public library. I leave the library and see I have a parking ticket for $69 for having a gang-related bumper sticker on the car. The sticker covered up a Pizza Pub bumper sticker I had on. I was in the library for only a short time. The meter was paid for 20 minutes too. I know that the bumper sticker wasn't on the bumper earlier, because I looked. Someone must have put the sticker on when I was in the library. I am going to fight the ticket; I should not have to pay. I had nothing to do with the offensive or illegal sticker on my bumper."
"0473"	"(10/30/1996)"	"Blue Gem I'm going to a mall with others. We are taking a station wagon and a van. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, and a German woman I know from Brimson, Kate Francis, are among the people going. We walk out to the two vehicles from my house. Annie grabs my hand and pulls me into the station wagon. The cute woman I see at Mason Cafeteria with long brown hair and acne scars is there too. I sit in the middle seat with Annie. In the back seat is a bunch of stuff. It seems like the Brock family's stuff. Kate is in the front seat, and we talk. We wait at a restaurant at the mall. Kate is sitting on my right. My mom approaches us from my left side. She criticizes Kate, without knowing she is on the other side of me. I defend Kate, and verbally attack my mom. There are two guys there who are leaders, and my friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, who just ordered a pizza because they couldn't wait any longer for real food. My mom talks to Kate, and tells her that she (Kate) has to leave. I think this is crazy! I leader calls me to the Blue Gem in the mall. I go and walk over to the Blue Gem, which is a fountain-like attraction that looks neat. I find the leader. It turns out the leader, who is a woman, wanted my brother Wally instead of me. My friend Holly Lapson is there. I walk by a shoe store, where today, one brand of shoes is selling for $20 more than the other."
"0474"	"(10/30/1996)"	"Kevin's Paper is Longer I'm printing out a paper I have written, and one my friend Kevin Simpson has written. The papers come out connected by the printer, so I take them apart. Kevin's paper is longer than mine. I want to do better; to have a longer paper than he."
"0475"	"(10/31/1996)"	"Magic Mushroom Land I'm with my friend Nat Miller, and our classmate Victoria Line. We are in a sort of Candyland. It has a small stream flowing through it, and there are some really big mushrooms that are the size of a football or a basketball. The place is very colorful. There are some colorful little gumdrop-like structures or boxes around. We decide to eat a mushroom. We pick it. It is huge! It is soft and squishy, like a marshmallow. I fell sick and bloated. Nothing happens to us immediately after eating it. We are in a bed in my basement, which is by the stairs. I am in the bed. Victoria and Nat have their feet up on the edge of the bed to my right. We slowly get silly from the mushroom. I run Victoria's feet, and then Nat's feet. I rub Nat's feet because I don't want it to seem like I am going after Victoria. I rub her legs. I am getting sexually aroused, but I don't know if she is. She rubs my feet too. A guy from my geology class and another guy stick their heads down the stairway. They have just arrived home and want to go to bed. They may be drunk or stoned. We were being loud, and apologize to them. I was tickling Victoria's foot, and she was laughing and screaming."
"0476"	"(10/31/1996)"	"Sex With Blind Woman I'm in a hotel elevator going to my friend Emerald Reinhold's room to visit. I mistakenly walk into the room of a blind woman. I didn't know it was a room: I thought it was a hallway. The woman says she recognizes my footsteps. She is a friend of my mom's. She is in a red bathrobe and has some weird glasses on. Her robe is partially open, and I can see some of her breasts. I kiss her and we start to have sex. I ask her how she knows my mom. I am then in my sister Ramona's room, which is my old bedroom. I am masturbating. I have a towel to clean up the semen. I am done masturbating, and my sister Ramona comes in and asks if she can sleep in my bed. I reluctantly say she can."
"0477"	"(10/31/1996)"	"Crystal Project At Alvin's I'm at my neighbor Alvin Broud's house, in his front yard. I am doing a project with my friend Stephen Ramos, in which I measure the temperature of two kinds of crystals. There is a woman there that gives us some pointers. I urinate in Alvin's back yard, near the alley. I don't think anyone can see me. My neighbor Luke Stalk is doing something outside. He may be pulling the tarp-top onto my other neighbor Gary Stein's yellow car. I see Alvin's dog in a sprinkler in my back yard, across the alley. The sprinkler is weak. The dog trots over when I call him. I am worried about being bitten. The dog seems aloof, like he doesn't recognize me. The temperature in Alvin's house is warm. Stephen says something about turning the heat up to 70 degrees and staying in the house, if we need. I am having sex with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. It is kind of imaginary, but kind of real. We have sex hard."
"0478"	"(11/03/1996)"	"Voting and Hands I'm voting in an election. My friend Queen Billman is there. We are in the church across the street from Brimson, where we vote. The man at the voting place has a form I need to complete before I can vote. I don't understand part of it, he says. The task is for me to explain two phrases or gestures involving both hands. I have to explain what each hand is doing. In one example one hand is on top of the other, but also below it. I don't grasp the concept fully."
"0479"	"(11/03/1996)"	"My mom In Jail I'm on the Carter School playground in Oak Valley. It is snowing. My mom is in jail. A man talks about how great my mom is. I can't see him. I hear a voice, like that of a radio announcer. There is a huge fallen tree, with its branches cut off, covered in packed down snow. I am climbing the tree, shimmying up its trunk, which is elevated at one end. I am then at the intersection of 2nd Street and Next Avenue. I see my high school classmate Janelle West and another woman. I walk north down Next Avenue towards Touse's house. The two women call out to me, and ask me if that tree is a Redwood. I reply that I don't know. There are a few huge trunks of fallen trees lying close together. I walk on them, going down the hill. I think the tree is a Redwood: its base is huge and spread out. I get to the bottom of the hill. Touse's don't live there anymore. There is the frame of a house, but no actual house. There is a lake with big rocks there. It is a very ""Montana"" feeling. I am back at Carter School on the playground. I am at the top of the snowy tree trunk that I've climbed. The end of the trunk is at the top of a snow bank near the side of Holy Avenue. I see my co-worker Leon Mack and someone else. I don't want them to see me. I flip off the end of the trunk and fall onto a snow bank at the side of Holy Avenue. I walk down the service road along the railroad tracks by my friend Gino Teavor's house. Gino and three other people are there. I am wearing purple sweatpants and a purple jacket. I meet a person I know from Brimson, Will Dunks. My first impulse is to punch him, and I make a fist. He is drunk and asks me where the party is. It is early in the afternoon. I walk on, going through yards. There is a man with a snowmobile. I close the gate to the yard he is in. I am in a house. My friend Fran Susse, a guy from my German class named Jon, and another woman are outside the back door looking in. I go to the door, and they quickly run away. I open the door, and they stop running. I am enraged: furious! I yell at them with all my strength. I scold and chastise them! They are then in the house. After I am finished yelling at them, I tell them to get out! Fran doesn't go out. I pick her up as if she is light as a feather, and march her outside. The others go out. I am driving a vehicle over some train tracks to get someone or something. It is dark outside. After this is done, I am talking with my friend Tiny Combs, and others, trying to justify my actions using my knowledge about train schedules. I may have been drinking alcohol, and was probably unsafe in my driving."

I rip up my observation form in front of the teacher. She says to me, ""Don't you want your six points?"" I don't like doing the English observations. I'm not good in English. I do want the points, but I'm not going to do something I don't like and that I'm not good at. She gives me the six points on a white ripped up piece of paper, like those I have been using to mark the pages of the books that are sources for my associationism paper."

I try to compliment a black friend of mine who is there, buy my comment sounds racist. I'm in the cafeteria then. I'm going to take a calculus 2 class. The inside of the cafeteria is like a mall. The atmosphere at Brimson is friendlier and livelier than the one here. I sit in a booth by myself. My friend Jill Banks is across the cafeteria in a booth by herself. She returns her tray and walks past me. I call out to her. My friend Virginia Hamms is there. Two guys in a booth behind me show us around the school. I think the men are homosexual.

They buy me some little vases. In one is written, ""Krusty Kenneth"", in glitter. It costs $50 for a shot glass, which is too much. The man selling the glass lowers his price to $10, and Mya buys it for me. She then drinks two shots of whiskey, not quite finishing the second shot. There is a video camera recording this. There are thick slices of orange on a tray at the counter. My uncle Rusty Redding is there. My mom is there, and is wearing her green sweater. I tell her that we're going to be in the video. I jump and wave at the camera. My mom goes up and puts her eye by the camera lens. I tell her not to."

"0492"	"(11/11/1996)"	"Facing Wilma Two girls go up to my neighbor's house and ring the door bell, and then run away. I see them do this. My neighbor Wilma Stein comes over to our house to inquire about this act. I make the girls own up to what they have done in front of Wilma."
"0493"	"(11/12/1996)"	"Ten Man Football I'm playing ten-man tackle football in my neighbor Wilma and Gary Stein's yard. My roommate Stephen Ramos and his mother watch the game from a balcony across Home Avenue. My team kicks off. A man from my Educational Psychology class, Jason, receives the ball. I eventually tackle him. On the next play I tackle him for no yards gained. On the third play I intercept a pass and run it back a ways. Then my team kicks a field goal. We get two kicks, worth three points each. We have to kick the ball over a telephone line. The ball gets lodged in a nearby house on one kick."
"0494"	"(11/12/1996)"	"Nut Collar Jacket I'm riding a bicycle on what feels like the road in front of Bob's Sports Arena in Wilmerton. My relatives are around the area, also riding bicycles. There are some rich people driving nice cars. Some people play a game of soccer on their bicycles. I have work to do. I twist a nut on the collar of my jacket, and the connection falls apart. I stop and pick up the pieces, and try to repair the jacket. I have a huge blue tattoo on my right hand, wrist, and arm. The tattoo looks like flames. People go past me on their bicycles. I have a Blind Melon or Pearl Jam song in my head. I think to myself: did Blind Melon steal this song from Pearl Jam?"
"0495"	"(11/12/1996)"	"I scored I'm in a room with my friends Niles Zelling, Matt Yams, Queen Billman, and another woman. I say to the girl that I'd have sex with her than the pillow. She comes over to me, and we go in a little closet to have a sexual encounter. I stand behind her and massage her clitoris. We go out of the closet. Niles says I need to learn how to touch a woman: that her clitoris is down lower. The woman says that the way that I touched her was good. She takes out a book and in it is a little caption saying something about how ""I scored"". Matt has a plate of pancakes. He wants some sausage. I'll get him some sausages without any problem."
"0496"	"(11/15/1996)"	"A Room With Melanie I'm with my friend Matt Yams. He is telling me about something that happened at his place of employment, The Greasepit. The cash register broke and the lights went out. Money was stolen. People came back at 3:00 am to get the money. Matt had waited for them, but had not waited long enough. Matt and I are near the American Legion building in Oak Valley. He puts some videos from Hollywood Video, and I put some strips of my stratographic column from Historical Geology, into a manhole cover. I am in a bedroom with my friend Melanie McDyss. We are each in a single bed on opposite sides of the room. My stratographic column is in a shoebox with a slit cut in the top of the box. I need to get the column out and cut it up according to each formation, leaving two inches between each section. I take them out of the box and start cutting. There are two windows by my bed, which is in a corner of the room. One window is at the head of the bed, and I pull that shade down. The other window is left side of the bed, and it has no shade. There is another bed in the room. In the bed are my dad, sister Heather, and another person, who may be my brother Wally. They have sex. My dad is behind someone having anal intercourse with them. Someone defecates. When they do, I have the feces in a light brown, brimmed, safari-type hat. The hat is upside down and the feces are in the bowl portion of the hat. I run to the bathroom and take the feces out of the hat and put them in the toilet. The water in the toilet is tainted yellow from urine. I rinse the feces off my fingers in the toilet. Then I rinse my fingers in some water that is left in the bottom of a shower stall. I realize that some feces came out of my penis when I was masturbating. I hope Melanie didn't see this. When I am in the bathroom, I notice my skin is really dry, and has white patches on it. I put water on my skin and the white patches go away. I go back to bed. It is 11:10 on one clock, and 11:11 on the other. I see a man from my bed. The scene seems to be at home in Oak Valley. I see him sitting at the kitchen table as I look down the stairs. I see that he is the man from my Astronomy class that always drinks Arizona Tea. His name may be Damien. He is arriving home. It is as if he is my brother Wally. He goes to the basement. I am in my sister Ramona's room. Melanie gets up and goes to the storage closet in the room to urinate. I am awake, and I see her. She doesn't see me. She has a big bag packed for her trip to Chicago. She curses the big bag. It is on her back as she moves, making her clumsy. In the bedroom is a van that I put on the floor by my bed. There is a room with many nice glasses in it. All of these except one or two get broken."
"0497"	"(11/15/1996)"	"Ba Ba Billy I steal my dad's old gray car and start driving to Super America in Oak Valley. I drive south down our alley, turn right onto 1st Street, and then turn left, going south, on Slope Avenue. There is road construction. I have a suicide knob on the steering wheel. I am sitting partially in the passenger seat. I pull into Super America. There is a semi-truck driver there. He is unloading what looks like legs to some tables. He is also buying some guns from another man there. The man selling the guns is huge! He bosses the truck driver around. I am on a motorcycle. I can't find the kickstand to the motorcycle. When I do find it I can't get the motorcycle to stand up. I am trying to park the motorcycle by a row of trees that run along the west side of the alley. I lay the motorcycle down and walk towards Super America. I realize I don't have my wallet, so I can't redeem my lottery ticket. I walk back. There are two men shaving their hair off with big knives. My motorcycle is then the orange lawn chair that my mom has. I want to leave. The two men are hostile. They talk about someone from Hillston, or the area around Hillston. They don't like the person they are talking about. I sit down in the orange lawn chair. It is breaking. I want to leave. The men may think or act like I am the person they don't like. Either they or I say or sing a song with the words to a song, ""Ba Ba Billy, we look to you for guidance."" I remember the melody to the song after awakening."

I get close to it at times, and then slow down. There are people on the bicycle with me. The bicycle in front of me goes off the road. There are two bicycle jumps on the road: one smooth and one rigid. I want to go on the smooth route. A pool of water will be under the jump to land in."

Among them are my friend Norman Noman and the toothless, Nazi-like guy I see on campus. I am with the man who has visions from the television show Millennium, and two women. We are in a car. The four bad guys come and get one of the women, who is young. They have already taken this woman once. They pull her out of the back drivers-side seat of the car. The Millennium man gets out of the car. He has a sledgehammer and a log. Norman has a log, and he throws it at our car. The Millennium man beats up the four bad guys: he kicks their asses!"

Another of my classmates named Mike talks about hunting, and how no one can show him how to hunt. I am one of the people who can show Mike how to hunt. It is black powder muzzleloader hunting for geese."
"0502"	"(11/21/1996)"	"Graham Cracker Schnapps I'm in a car which may be my mom's station wagon. I see some blaze orange clothes in a parking lot. I drive in to get them, and see that the clothes are in a van. I drive into a store, which is the Fuller Family Store in Wilmerton. I drive around the store and back out. Then I walk in the store. I get some liquor. My parents, who are there, buy two bottles of graham cracker schnapps. It is pink and appears milky. There are a lot of valentine cards for sale. Some of the cards are blue and purple. My dad asks me about a dent in the car by the radio, and other dents. I tell him I don't know anything about them. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. She is wearing tight pants. I say hi and introduce her to my parents. There is a huge valentine book on dreams, which is about three feet tall and one-and-a-half feet wide. Melanie suggests getting it, but it is not for me. I want to get some valentines."

Heather says we should go to Helen's family restaurant. I say no, lets go to the Grease Pit, because it is cheaper and we're already in the parking lot. My dad is over by the pink building to the west of the Grease Pit. He is walking towards us. I am going to pay some or the entire bill. I think of ordering five bigger burger combos."
"0504"	"(11/21/1996)"	"Big Resort Talk I'm with my friends Kevin Simpson, Bubba Hacker, and Bubba's father Phillip Hacker at the Hacker's house. Phillip gets out a frozen fish. It might be Bubba's fish or Kevin's from the Big Resort Area. We all talk about the Big Resort Area, and how heavy the canoe was. Phillip talks about bruised shoulders, from carrying the canoe, and we agree with him. I say I could only carry it 55 rods with breaks, while Kevin carried it the entire length of Trout Portage with one break. There is a fishing scene. Something white is being used for bait."
"0505"	"(11/22/1996)"	"Flaming Man I'm at the top of a hill which is where Stevens' house would be in Oak Valley. There is a little shack there. I go there for bait. I am driving a really nice truck, towing my boat behind it. It is early in the morning. I go around back of the shack and climb up on the roof. My dad goes by on the road between the hill and the old Simon's Grocery Store. He is driving his red Ford LTD Crown Victoria, and pulling a boat. I see him. He doesn't see me. He knew I was going fishing, but I didn't know he was. He sees my boat and the truck. He thinks this is odd because I usually leave the trailer at home. I go back to the truck and check the electrical connection between the truck and trailer. The connection is as big as a fist. The boat lights don't work. I drive down the hill, though I have no brake lights. I go into Simon's Grocery Store parking lot. I drive between two cement pillars in the parking lot. It seems like I am not in a truck, but on a bicycle. There is a lady in the parking lot taking down cornstalks from the previous day's festivities. The lady says I'll be insured, I just have to tell the insurance company. I drive away. I see a car driving down a road. The hood of the car is open a few inches. Black smoke and flames are pouring out from the windows and under the hood. There are two people in the car. I think the car is going to crash into two cars that are stopped at a red light. I think that seeing this is the kind of crazy, funny story to tell my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson. The car stops, and a man gets out. He is on fire! He is calm. I see nothing that indicates that the flames affect him. The man is wearing sunglasses, and kind of old and dirty denim clothes. He has short curly brown hair. I stop and get off the bicycle that I am then on. He crosses the road and comes up to my home in Oak Valley, slowly and calmly, while on fire. He goes to the front door and enters without knocking. I realize what he is going to do: he is going to hurt my mom or my sister Ramona. I race across the road from the parking lot to the house. I go in the garage, where the big old garage door was. There are a bunch of knives near the door; they are like the kitchen knives we have at home, but are two or three feet long. I grab a knife. I rush into the dining room. I don't see the man right away. I don't see the man at all."
"0506"	"(11/22/1996)"	"Anna Kisses Me My friend Anna Woods and I are in my room. There is a big beanbag chair there. I am going to leave. I kiss her goodbye on the cheek. She kisses me on the mouth, and with her tongue! I am taken back; surprised. There is a pause in our actions. Then I start talking like nothing just happened: pretending. She tasted salty."
"0507"	"(11/23/1996)"	"Leave, Wally I'm in a place which may be Goldenshire Golf Course in Oak Valley. I'm with a group of friends and my brother Wally. I think my friend Queen Billman is there. My friends say to Wally that either he has to leave or they are going to leave. I say that is pretty mean of them. I leave and go home. I get into the house and see that the parking lights on my truck are on. I have to go out and jiggle the light switch in the truck to shut them off. My jacket and shorts with my wallet in them are in the bathroom, and they fall into the bathtub and get wet while water is draining out of the tub. I carry them and a bunch of other items up to my room. My room is very clean. The light on the ceiling of my room doesn't work: the bulbs must be burned out. I use my little lamp on my bed. Wally has devised some system or score to demonstrate that he wasn't being mean, when people told him to leave."
"0508"	"(11/25/1996)"	"Quad At Washington University I'm at Washington University. I see my friend Binky Ahmed from Armstrong high school, who goes to Washington.

"0510"	"(11/25/1996)"	"Marvin Jasper is Dead I'm near a body of water. A large boat is anchored a ways off shore, and a small boat is tied up near the shore. There is a windy, rainy storm coming. I think my friend Kevin Simpson is with me. I have to untie the little boat so that Kevin can take it out and get the large boat. There is a cinder block tied to the rope, which is looped through a loop around a pole to hold the small boat in place. I unloop the block, but as I do I fall in the water. The water is warm. I try to bring the block to the surface: it is heavy. I hear someone talk about swimming without using one's arms. It is my high school classmate Persia Miko's voice. There are some bleachers near the surface of the water. The water is clear and turquoise colored. I have my eyes open under the water, and see. I wrap my feet around the bottom side of one seat of the bleachers and have my body submerged. There are tropical fish around. A person can touch them. There is a fish that says, ""Marvin's Hope"" on it. I think, pause, and start to cry. I am in a basement with my friend Nate Nelling, Persia Miko, Dave from my Educational Psychology class, and another woman. It is the basement where Marvin Jasper was killed, Dave says. Marvin Jasper is a boy who was abducted from a community near my home. There is warm tropical water and people swimming. Yesterday was observed as a day when Marvin was killed."
"0511"	"(11/27/1996)"	"The Shabbat I'm going to a Shabbat. I walk into the place and see that it is huge and lined with tables. People are eating right away. I see my friend Stephen Ramos at a table that seems pretty full. As I enter the place, my high school basketball teammate John Kulik walks out. I say hi. There is a lot of food on the tables: salads and other dishes. I sit with some men who are unfamiliar to me. They are in their early 30's, and seem like dorks. One of them is like Tom Ziegler, but rounder. One of them says he put an Ice House beer in the punch bowl to get the punch cold. I see the beer. I think my friend Nate Nelling may be there. I eat quickly, and drink lemonade. I say that I'm very hungry, but then I stop eating. I see two guys who I think are my cousins, Henry and Avery King. Then I realize that these are my friends Niles and Tim Zelling. There are some young women there who are part of the Jewish community. They dance down the long rows of tables. Everyone claps as the girls pass. Some people give a standing ovation. People sit on the floor behind their chairs as the girls dance. The girls dance between the person and the chair. They do this to me, and I move out into the aisle a little bit. I'm one of the only people sitting on my side of the table. There is a very long row of tables. One side of the tables is filled with people, and one side is sparsely populated. My friend Yvette Ullman is one of the dancers in the next aisle. I stare at her to make eye contact. She looks and sees me while she is dancing, but doesn't give me her characteristic smile. My dad is there, and he is now leaving. I walk with him to the back of the building, which is now a church. We talk about when we'll see each other next. He is coming through town next weekend. I tell him I have a lot of work to do, so Friday between noon and 2 p.m. would be good. Otherwise, we'll have to just get together really quick, because I need the other time to work. As my dad exits the church, my classmate Robyn Masters enters, and I hold the door for her. I feel dumb saying to my dad that I don't have a lot of time to visit, while Robyn is there. I go back inside the church. I start to walk up to the front of the church and I hear a voice that says, ""Kenneth, there's a service going on here!"" I quickly turn around and walk out, apologizing. The woman who spoke is sitting on the end of a pew, dressed in blue with brown hair. She kind of reminds me of my ex-girlfriend's mother, Tamara Thomas, but also of all the other ""respectable"" women that haven't liked me and have reprimanded and embarrassed me. I walk out of the building with a classmate named Keith and another guy. We go to Keith's car. On the way to the car, we climb up a very steep bank covered in thick grass, to get to the parking lot. I am then crawling on the hood of the car, gripping where the hood meets the windshield. Keith is in the back seat, and then he opens the driver's door. I say that I'll drive, but as Keith gets into the driver's seat, I say that I'd better not drive, because I might crash his father's nice car. There is a box of Marlboro cigarettes under the radio. We start to drive. I'm in the front seat. Keith takes out a package of vitamin C drops and opens it. They are yellow and orange, and are the consistency of Pepto Bismol. The two guys I am with say these drops put them to sleep after a big meal. The Shabbat was in the church basement. It is dark and snow is on the ground. A man on a bike with two small children on the bike is riding towards us. Keith isn't looking. I yell at him to swerve. The man swerves to his left, while we swerve to our right. We are pulling a boat or a trailer. I don't think we hit the man, but the car behind us did. The man and the kids fly ahead of us. We stop. I run out ahead of the others. I go to the man. He is a person I know from Brimson names James Vegas. He says, ""Just give me the bill now!"" He is hurt and angry. I tell him not to move. ""The more you move now, the more pain you will be in later"", I tell him. I yell to a lady at a nearby house to dial 911. I take off my jacket and put it on James. I tell the others to do the same. They do. We put their jackets on the children, who are babies. One is an infant with a cone-shaped top of its head. The infant has some red scrapes on its head."
"0512"	"(11/29/1996)"	"Huge Pike at Many Fish I'm at Many Fish Lake. I'm walking on the south end of the lake. I am on a sort of a fence or a wall. The land abruptly ends there, and appears to be five or six feet deep where the wall is. I crawl along the wall. I see a huge northern pike. I see lots of big northern pike. I see at least four fish that are over 10 pounds, probably over 20 or 25 pounds! As I near them on the wall they scatter into the weeds below. One of my friends is there. It may be Kevin Simpson. I yell for him to cast his fishing rod over towards where I point. He does. He has a sucker minnow on his line for bait. As the minnow sinks, I yell at him to twitch the rod to give the bait action. I can see the fish around the minnow. One fish grabs it. The fish jumps out of the water. It is huge! It is a dolphin, I think. Kevin's line breaks. We didn't have strong enough line."
"0513"	"(11/29/1996)"	"Kiss My Ass I'm working at Grocery Getto, on a 5-11 shift stocking shelves. There is a yellow noted by my time card that has a lost of things for me to do. I am working here temporarily, and am on a break from school. My first task is to set up a display of some sort of fruit in the front wall of sale items. I am slow and not sure what to do. There is an open space but it is really a poor space for a display. A man asks me about something for a cat, maybe for tanning a cat hide. I don't really understand him. I point to an aisle where the liquid smoke is. My bosses Larry Paulson and Jack Krane are having their photograph taken by the wall of groceries. Jack asks me about a drug test. He says something about yellow urine with white drops in it. I ask what they are testing for. My friend Tim Zelling says they're testing for butt sex. Jack tells me that the test turns out positive. I say to Jack and Larry, ""I've never done drugs in my life, never had butt sex, and don't have AIDS, and if you think I do you can kiss my ass."" Then I walk away. I'm on roller skates. I go out to the parcel pick up area of the store, which has been remodeled. One of the fat women who works there comes out and tells me not to shut the door. I laugh, and say I wasn't going to. I just went to this area to avoid Jack and Larry. I skate out past the cash registers. My third grade teacher Liza Minikel is working there. I think she must work in the evenings. I fall, and get back up. I skate to the back room. I cannot stop well on skates. I go through the meat display area. I grab onto stationary objects to slow me down. My coworker Jim Rammer asks me, ""Did you really tell Larry and Jack to kiss your ass?"" I tell Jim what I said to them. Jim tells me I am dead for saying that: will get into trouble. He and a lady and I sit in the back room talking about pets. I'm sitting where I could be crushed, in a strong machine in between two pieces of metal, like a bailer or a plow."
"0514"	"(12/03/1996)"	"Holly Frying Bacon I am at my friend Holly Lapson's house. There are others there, and we are drinking. I drink six or seven beers, and am buzzing. I act kind of silly. Holly doesn't want to drive anywhere with me in the car. She thinks we'll get caught. Her friend Shelly Mac is there, and has a can of the soda Squirt. I have a can of orange juice. Shelly has a glass that I pour some of my orange juice in because she doesn't want Squirt Light. I spill a bit. Holly is mad that I spilled the juice. The room is pretty dark, and Holly is wiping up the few spilled drops of juice off the carpet between my outstretched legs. We decide to leave. People go out to my mom's station wagon. Holly is frying bacon and has something baking in the oven on low heat. Two men come in the back door at my home. They are Holly's uncles. Holly has left her food cooking and is in the car. I think I'll leave the food, and the two uncles will take care of it if need be. I go out to the car. There are a lot of people in it. I sit in the front seat with my friend Stephen Ramos. Holly drives."
"0515"	"(12/03/1996)"	"Blue and White Cat I'm hunting ducks with my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson at the Holiday Inn in Oak Valley. We don't shoot any ducks. It is getting too dark to shoot or to see. My friend Terry Foss is there. There area is a sandy beach. There are some photographs there. It is hard to tell what is happening in each one. I decide that if I have a gun in the photographs that I am hunting, and if I don't I am at the beach. I have a shotgun with a scope on it. Stephen finds a cat. He snuggles up to it, and tells me he wants to shoot it. It is blue and white in color, with patchy black on its face. Its teeth are old and worn: broken. In an appalled manner I tell Stephen I'm not going to shoot it."

It's not totally light out, and is early in the morning. We get down near the Jones' house on 3rd Street, and are walking. The Jones family is awake. Some of them are sitting inside and some are sitting outside. They are smoking. Don Jones is inside at a desk doing cocaine. I am smoking too. I am only exhaling. I put my cigarette out on a snow bank on the porch. As we are walking, we see a man light up a cigarette as he jogs. I think that he is really dumb. I job a little with a lit cigarette as I approach the Jones'. We are inside their house. My uncle Miles Redding is there. We are going to play two-handed Cut Throat. The family members that are with me are there too. We play the game with photographs: my photographs of summer fishing and some hunting photographs. There are different sizes of photographs: some 4x6, some 3x5. There is confusion about the rules. Twos, threes, and nine through Ace are used. We are then using real playing cards, not photographs. My childhood neighbor Terry Mink is there with his little brother. Everyone is up early to smoke."

He may have been shot. I help the boy escape and get away from the boss. I'm over by Oak Valley Bank. There is a warehouse with a stack of wooden pallets and a power jack there. I am working for Pepsi. A head honcho for Pepsi whose name is Shapiro comes by. He sees that I'm not doing much work but that's okay with him. My friend Kevin Simpson operates a forklift. There are two Asian boys there. One of them is named John, and I know him from working at the Brimson Library. I chase the boys, and fight them. I stab one of them in the bottom of the foot through the shoe with my Swiss Army knife. I say, ""I don't want to kill no one! That's fucked up!"" I have cut the boy and he is bleeding, and blood is everywhere. I am in the alley at home next to the old vacant lot several doors down. I am with my friend Kevin Simpson and the two bloody boys. I say that dreams aren't worth the trouble. A car is coming down the alley. I tell Kevin to move the two kids on the power jack so they're behind the old tool shed that stands on the corner between the vacant lot and Trammell's lot. I go behind the shed so people don't see me."

Her baby is in my mom's room. My mom has gone downtown to get something for Heather. Heather is like my 8th grade classmate, Karen Schmitz, in that she has a child at a young age. She is also ratty, nasty, and grouchy: a yak. She wants me to do something, so I go into my mom's room to change the baby's diaper. I don't see the baby at first, and then I do. It is wrapped up, sleeping. It looks like it is in a car seat. I attempt to pick the baby up. It is a big baby: about a year old, long and lanky. It is a boy. It awakens and starts to cry. It's late at night. I eat a huge piece of pink and white cake. I hold it in my hand and it crumbles, pieces fall to the floor. Andrew is mad that I spilled. I am at my friend Matt Yams house.

"0521"	"(12/05/1996)"	"Stephen Being Loud My friend Stephen Ramos and I are fighting. It is early in the morning. He tells me to point a gun at something. I am angry, and I'm tired. I want to sleep. I punch him a lot. He puts on loud music. I tell him to shut it off and be quiet, or leave. He spits on a pipe that is on the sidewalk. I wipe his saliva up with a sock. I tell him he is being annoying like our friend Norman Noman was in recent incident in which there was an argument over some cookies."
"0522"	"(12/05/1996)"	"Puckett Fights Godzilla Two people are strapped in a metal rowboat that is a lifeboat on a huge metal ship. There is a man in the water somehow connected to the boat that is fishing with a huge funny looking rod. The man hooks a fish. The boat moves forward so the fisherman's line won't break as the fish runs. Godzilla, Kirby Puckett, and Wilhelm Wundt are enormous monster-like creatures. Wundt is left at the bottom of the lake, which is then dry after the large metal boat crashes into the shore. Debris covers the lake bottom, and Wundt is at one end. Kirby Puckett and Godzilla fight. Puckett throws Godzilla into a dam, and the dam starts to leak. Godzilla is embedded in the concrete of the dam. There are dead things on the lake bottom."
"0523"	"(12/05/1996)"	"A Carrot Chew I'm with my psychology professor Marianne Stash and two women at a fast food restaurant. The women may be my friends Nicole Peterson and Mya Rousing. I say that Marianne grades really hard. I have a bunch of carrots in my lip, like a pinch of chewing tobacco. I spit it out, and joke with the women."
"0524"	"(12/06/1996)"	"Capturing Wizard of Oz Characters I'm in a church, where there is a huge granite structure, cut and polished. It is a fountain. There is some confusion about whether it should be inverted/reversed or not. It is a depression now. There is a bathroom there, and in the ceiling of the bathroom is a small hole about six inches in diameter. I climb into the hole feet first: I am upside down. People lift me up. I try to climb in again, and as I am lifted I spin like I am on a spit. One of my arms is outstretched and my hand is planted. One of my legs is flexed and my toes pointed, touching the other wall. I spin around very fast several times and fall to the ground. I hurt my right hip. People call for help. A police officer gets there. I am okay when he arrives. There are two airplanes. One of them is an old green single propeller plane. A man flies the plane, steering it and shooting a gun at the same time. He tries to capture the Wizard of Oz characters that are in the pine needles. He has to spray them by shooting the gun in his plane. He can only shoot when flying level or descending. I think I am the pilot. I fly the plane in a city or a town. I fly low: close to houses. There is a clump of pine needles, like a cloud or tree. That is where the characters are that I need to capture."
"0525"	"(12/07/1996)"	"Rearranged I go into my friends dorm room in Billings Hall at Brimson. All the furniture is moved around. The couch is gold in color and is on top of a row of chairs. The beds and closets are also rearranged."
"0526"	"(12/07/1996)"	"Robbing With Loud Music I go into a house to rob it. There is an automatic teller machine. I use my card with the Discover logo on the back. My PIN number is 3134. I put the card in the machine rather than sliding it in and out. I end up getting a file-like packet about a woman. It contains all kinds of facts and figures. At the end of this huge file is email. There are some other guys there and they might be looting the home. I am worried that the owners might come home. A big dog comes in the living room. It is a nice dog, but I am still afraid of it. I go out the side door. I have a pillow with me. The people in the house have a stereo on so loud that I hear it loudly a few houses away. I run. I have trouble moving at some places. I jump over a fence and run through yards. I feel like I'm headed towards my friend Kevin Simpson's house in Wilmerton. Later, I go the house that we robbed and ask to borrow a cup of sugar, to see the damage. There is a young couple there. They are light hearted and optimistic. They don't seem to be taking any of the losses too seriously. They question me about the sugar. I say it's for frosting. When I realize granulated sugar isn't for frosting, I say I sprinkle it on top of cookies. The woman there is doing laundry."
"0527"	"(12/08/1996)"	"Cold Particles I'm with my sisters Ramona and Heather. There is a little door above the dryer in my basement. There is a race between us and a group of people to get to the door. I want to beat these people there. I tell Heather and Ramona to hurry. We get there after going through the tunnel-like structure we were in. We get to the dryer. I get on top of the dryer. I unscrew two screws from the dryer with my fingers. The first screw falls on the dryer, but doesn't fall to the floor. I open the little hatch door. Cold air and particles blow in my face. There is a policeman. I hold a hostage. I have a razor-knife, and so do other people. I cut a bit of skin on the hostage's throat. Then there is peace, after all. People, others, go back to Hawaii."
"0528"	"(12/08/1996)"	"Photo With Mother Theresa A bridge is being constructed by Main Street in Wilmerton. There are some cement blocks being laid. There are a few parts of the bridge in various stages of construction. I lay some cement blocks. I have some pixie sticks and a small magazine, which may have pornography in it. A man comes and explains the structure of the bridge to me. There is an outside path: a strolling lane. It's a love strolling lane. The man describes the plans for this. A class is going on a trip to the love lane. It is a rambunctious class. Mother Theresa and a man are there. We're all by the White House. The President may be there. The class and I are taking photographs of Mother Theresa and the man. No one goes up to her. I move closer to her, and then go up to her. She asks me where I see God. I tell her I see it in the sun, warm and loving. Then the whole class comes over and sits with us. There are some women fast-pitch softball players batting. They are batting from the area where the short stop fields. One girl hits the ball to the outfield fence on one hop. I say that would have been a home run. My friend Nat Miller and I watch. Our classmate Pauline Davies may be playing."
"0529"	"(12/10/1996)"	"Freud A Darwinian I am doing a group project, working on a paper. In my group is a first-year woman I think is cute, Jackie Hunter. I am then either downtown Wilmerton or downtown Woodland. My friend Gino Teavor is jogging on a bridge over a river area, where I am. I think about asking Jackie out for coffee. Either she or my other friends are there. The bridge I am on is not a car bridge. There is a dam below and behind me. I might jump. I think I might land on the dam. I ask the person I am with, ""Do you think Freud was a Darwinian?"" I got the name (Freud) from a purple book."
"0530"	"(12/10/1996)"	"Paint Splattering Couches I enter a building like the Big Electric Company building in Wilmerton. One needs access to the large metal door, and I get in. Inside there are some couches, paints, and things that I think will need to be separated or grouped. My friend Sherman Andrews is there. He runs and jumps up on a couch, putting his feet up on the back of the couch where one would lean back. He leaves footprints of splattered paint on the couch. Another person splatters paint footprints on the couch. A person I know from Brimson, Alec Johnson, is there. He and I cover a couch up with a blanket. First, he leads this and places the blanket the narrow way, exposing the ends of the couch. I say that we should turn the blanket. When we do, it covers more of the couch."
"0531"	"(12/10/1996)"	"Ham Sticks I'm in a house. It is early morning. I drink a can of Pepsi, and then start to sip a Pepsi out of a blue Brimson glass. I eat what I think are cylindrical ham sticks, about _ inch in diameter and 1.5 inches long. These ham sticks are actually frog. Not frog legs, however, but rather whole frogs, which are the size of my pinky fingernail. I can't sleep. My friends Gino Teavor, Esther Thurman, my dad, sister Ramona, Ramona's friend, and another lady are there. Esther is up at 6:00 am to drive our friend Tina Totts to Big City. Tina got into trouble last night with her parents and has to go back to school. Everyone starts to get up. I do, and decide to go with Esther to Big City to keep her company. My dad is still trying to sleep. Gino starts a red car to go home. I go out in the road to start Esther's car. I scrape the image of a dream into the frost on the passenger side window so I remember to write it down. I go to the driver's side door. There is a locking device that should be on the door but isn't. The device is on the hood near the windshield wiper. The driver side door opens into the car. I can't get it open like a normal door. I am in a bad neighborhood. Other people are outside starting their cars. It is cold and dark outside. There is crusty and icy snow on the ground. A man jumps in the passenger side of the car. He is going to steal it! I put the car in park and pull out the key. There are a couple of car thieves there. I turn and start to run. One guy stays there. He has blond hair. He looks like he is going to pull out a gun. I look over my shoulder as I run back into the house."
"0532"	"(12/10/1996)"	"Mexican Potato Dinner I'm eating a Mexican dinner with a group of people. The red-haired woman with the injured back who likes Rudolf Steiner, from my Educational Psychology class is there. Also there is the woman with the reversible purse from the class, whom I think is a sick old hag. There are potatoes being eaten, among other things."
"0533"	"(12/11/1996)"	"Raping Holly I'm at a concert with my friend Holly Lapson, sister Ramona, my dad, and other family. We ride home in my truck. My dad drives. Holly and I sit in back, in the bed of the truck. We have sex. I anally rape her. She does not respond: is unemotional. I have a Bruce Springstein song in my head as I rape her. The words go something like, ""I gotta come, come, come..."" We get to where Holly is going. She gets out of the back of the truck and doesn't say anything. She looks at me harshly and walks away."
"0534"	"(12/11/1996)"	"Captured by Natives I'm with my dad. We're driving, and then walking, along a wide path that seems like it would be near the Main River. I tell him how faults can be lubricated to prevent earthquakes. We climb a rock cliff that is not too high. There are a few holes for footing and grasping. There is a videotape that we have and I'm careful to keep it safe. Dad boosts me up onto the top of the rocks. Natives with spears soon surround me and take us captive. We are marched down into the Native Indian's residence. There are busts and heads mounted on platters and slabs. A movie is being filmed. I'm a co-star. I think my dad is the star. I have priority over another actor even though I lack some things."
"0535"	"(12/11/1996)"	"Mason Rearranged I am at Mason Cafeteria at Brimson, which is rearranged. I yell harshly at an older woman. She is a guest, and has gone through the line without a card. The lines for eating at the cafeteria are different. It is almost like a fast food line. I cut pizza with my wallet. The man I know from Brimson who thinks he knows how to bale cardboard yells at me for doing this. The orange juice is constantly running, and I watch the container go empty. I get ice in a glass, and then water. There is something special going on at the cafeteria. It may be a convention or a show at dinner. I sit with my friend Anne Gooner. I feel guilty for yelling at the woman."
"0536"	"(12/11/1996)"	"Bloody Sneeze I'm in a room with my friend Edith Sherman. I'm in bed, and she is on the floor. I crawl onto her. We get in position 69. I give her cunnilingus. She says that when I stimulate her with my finger after giving her cunnilingus it makes her fall asleep. I sneeze. There is blood everywhere from my sneeze. I have a bloody nose. My sister Ramona is talking in her sleep in the next room. It is early in the morning. My cousin Rich Redding may be in the next room with my sister."
"0537"	"(12/11/1996)"	"Drunken Movie I'm with my friends Kevin Simpson, Stephen Ramos, and Gino Teavor. We're going to a movie. We have been drinking alcohol."
"0538"	"(12/11/1996)"	"Racing Two Cars Two cars are racing. Both cars give off smoke at the start of the race. The track is long and straight. One of the cars is on fire. One car explodes. A crewmember goes and looks at the car that exploded, but doesn't pay any attention to the driver, who is passed out inside the car."
"0539"	"(12/11/1996)"	"Wait Till Watson I pull my mom's station wagon into the alley of the block across the street from home. I pull the car up to my neighbor the Wilson's driveway in back of their house. I am here to pick up my friend Tim Robbins and his younger brother from school. The younger brother says I'll have to, ""Wait till Watson"", at 8:00 to leave for school. It is 7:50 now, and I'm 10 minutes early. (Note: there is no younger brother in real life)"
"0540"	"(12/15/1996)"	"Old Coin Cave I'm with my friends Hank Anderson, Ivory Alshire, Fran Susse, and Anita Flank. We are camping in an area like the Big Resort Area. I'm in a small round two-person dome tent. I do something with the sides and door flaps in an attempt to make the tent roomier. I set up things in the tent for Ivory and I. I have tissues and other items because I think we are going to, and want to, have sex. The tent is crowded. There is a rain fly on the tent. Two sleeping bags are on the floor. Ivory doesn't sleep there. She sleeps in my mom's bedroom. We are on an island/mountain area. I go and explore. I find a crack in the side of a rock that leads to a cave. There is a lake or river right near the cave. The cave is on the edge of an island, like on Jap Lake. There is a white dock and a white airplane across from the island on the shore. The plane might be taking off. The dock seems to break in half, and form a ""v"". There are coins in and around the crack and cave. There are a lot of old pennies from the 1900's. I find a 1920D penny. There are others that are very old, and that I think are valuable. I go back to the others. Ivory is wearing a black bra and underwear in my mom's room. I jokingly say to her that I ""wanted to rape you"", but you weren't sleeping in the tent. There is a set of keys that are Ivory's. I put them on my key chain lock so we don't lose them. I go back to the cave with Hank, Fran, Anita, and Ivory. Our group has two flashlights. It is dark. We go through my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard. The cave is near the bushes in the front of his yard, next to the gray house that is just to the west of his yard. Alvin is in the basement doing laundry. There may be another man there. I have trouble finding the site at first, because I look too far west of where it actually is. I move along the rocky cliff and find the crack and the cave. Everyone is excited. Next to the cave is a man-made hollow cavern with wooden walls. It is a shop, a cover-up for something. Something is going on in this location. A bridge is needed to access that place. There are bad guys coming with a bridge. I start walking towards Main Street on Hill Avenue. I whisper for my friend Jill Banks to come to, and she does. We evade the bad guys. We walk on the sidewalk up to my neighbor Greg Olson's steps. We then go up his steps and sidewalk to his front door, and then jump off the steps at his door to the right and run around the house. We run in back of the house and go back towards Alvin Broud's house. There are four men on Hill Avenue smashing a car. They seem to be yuppies. We are then back at Alvin's yard with the others. As we try to enter a house or cavern, an alarm is tripped and sounds. The four men run over to us. We try to run, but the men are among us. We fight them. We have wrenches as weapons. A person I have met before, David Brice, is among the bad men. I hit him in the face with a wrench. There is an older man there, who is about 40 years old. I have the yellow plastic bat that my roommate Stephen Ramos keeps under his bed. There is another man there who has a bat. We beat the older man. I hit the man twice in the face, back, and groin. My bat is plastic, but the other man's bat is metal."
"0541"	"(12/15/1996)"	"Alarming Encounter I am with my friend Kari Kosslyn in a room. We are making out. I take off her shirt and her bra. She takes of my shirt. We act aggressively. I wonder if we aren't moving too quickly. A fire alarm goes off."
"0542"	"(12/18/1996)"	"Dangerous Man/Dinosaur I'm in a computer lab in a school. A guy named Scott that I know from school is working in the lab. A dinosaur may be there. I'm in a house, other than mine, watching a movie. The people I am with change. My classmate Linus Doman and an older man are there. People make fun of Linus' thin beard. He may say something about my facial hair. My friend Tom Napper and others are there. We are watching a movie with something Jewish in it. We change positions, and I sit in a big lazy-boy-type chair. Tom is struggling to get comfortable on the floor. There is a noise. No one else is concerned about the noise. I go to see what it is. I walk up the stairs. There are two small children, about 4 or 5 years old. One of them is a girl. They have just come in the door. There is a knock at the door. A man with a gun comes in. I am going to ambush the man, but he goes downstairs towards my friends. I get the kids out the door and yell at them to run. We run to the neighbor's house. The girl falls. I go back and pick her up. The man with the gun is dangerous. He may be a dinosaur: either a Pacheyosaurus, which is a dinosaur with an 8-inch thick skull for ramming heads in competition for mates, or a raptor."
"0543"	"(12/18/1996)"	"Matt Yams is Getting Married I'm in Rock Village with my mom and my sister Ramona. We're going ice fishing. We stop to get bait. I go up to two old men in a shack-like place. I buy worms and leeches. The bait comes with two stunned fish. The containers of bait are in the mouths of the fish. The men tell me the fish aren't dead, and I should let them go. One in ten of these stunned fish will live. We leave, and I realize we don't have an ice auger. I look in back of the car for things that we could use to make a hole in the ice. There is a hammer, a crow bar, and some metal rods. I decide these things would work. We are back in Wilmerton, and I know my friend Matt Yams has three or four augers, so we go to his house. We are pulling a boat. I go into his house, which is different. There are two dumb, skanky girls there. One is Matt's girlfriend and the other is his brother Jasper's girlfriend. Matt is getting married today! I'm shocked, and I think to myself: ""Matt, what are you doing?!"" I think getting married is a big mistake for him. We get the auger and jigglesticks, which I had totally forgotten. A guy from the Franklin Hall dormitory my first year at Brimson is there. He is the middle-height guy from the triple off the lounge, and I think his name is Mike."
"0544"	"(12/18/1996)"	"Bike Stolen Twice I walk in the south side door at Carter Church in Oak Valley. There are choir or music people on the left side of the altar. There are people sitting near the back of the church in the last five or six rows. I go to the balcony. There is a woman there. The balcony is a mini-church: the front of the mini-church being at the south end of the balcony. The woman seems to be silently playing the organ, which is at the rear of the mini-church. I sit. There are no pews in the church. My mom is there organizing or directing. My aunt Rachel Redding is there. She offers me some candy from a table, which I accept. One of my uncle Miles Redding's kids is having a wedding. My bike has been stolen. I look around for it. It is a black Trek Antelope mountain bike. There are a lot of other bikes around the back of the church, in the entrance, and in the balcony. My bike isn't there. I go outside. My brother Wally rides past on his bike going towards the flashing lights of the railroad crossing. I yell at him, and he stops. We don't find my bike. My bike has now been stolen twice."
"0545"	"(12/18/1996)"	"Riding With Annie I'm going through a park on a motorized cart with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. The park feels like it is in Washington D.C. Annie points out that the ""gook"" is smaller than the other statues of white soldiers. There is some sort of gathering: a family reunion. Many of the people are dressed in red and white. There is a lady there that impedes our way when we are driving. She is a leader of the gathering. Annie tells the lady we're not interested in the cause of the gathering. The lady doesn't respond to Annie's statement. I accelerate the cart by pushing a button on the right handle bar, and we drive by the lady. There is a man that says something, and my name, to me. I say he must have met me before. Either Annie or I have a deflated rubber kick ball. One of us rides on the cart. The other walks. One of us is then on a bicycle. The other walks. I ride the bicycle. We are at Brimson in the music building. We get to where the Carter church rectory used to be. Annie has a red bicycle there that she borrowed from our friend Emerald Reinhold's boyfriend Steve. We go to the front of the rectory. It has a big porch, and I think many people live here. My grade school friend Patrick Bergman is there. He asks if we are going streaking. We aren't. He pulls down his pants as if he is going streaking. He doesn't pull down his underwear, which are like white shorts. It is getting late. Annie and I are on the porch. I am still very attracted to her, and I wonder if something sexual will happen between us."
"0546"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Rubbing Queen's Cheek I'm at Brimson. I'm supposed to meet my friend Queen Billman at 2:00. I think we're meeting in my room. She thinks we're meeting in her room. She comes to my room a little after 2:00. I have a wet face and wet hair. I rub my cheek on hers. It is a way of flirting, in which I can show I'm attracted to her without going so far as a kiss, which may be going too far."
"0547"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Trip from Carter School I'm going on a field trip. The bus is leaving from the back of Carter School, by the bouja kitchen. I run out to the bus, past my ex-girlfriend's father, Bill Thomas. He says hi and starts to talk in his friendly voice about mundane stuff. I keep running. He stops talking. The bus is like a metro bus, with a row of seats along the sides of the bus in back. I sit next to my roommate Stephen Ramos. The field trip might be for math class. The bus drives down the alley towards the playground. It is winter, and snow is all around. People are outside. The bus turns left and goes on the service road that runs along the railroad tracks."
"0548"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Iron Deficient Tea I am in a class. We are making iron deficient tea. People in the class drink the tea. No one likes it. It is difficult to swallow a couple gulps. I quickly drink my whole cup of tea. It doesn't taste that bad. The tea is supposed to turn hair and skin green. I see this happen in other people. One man tries to drink a lot of the tea. He can't swallow it, and spits the tea out, laughing."
"0549"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Norman and the Boeing 757 I'm at a party with a large group of people including my friends Norman Noman and Holly Lapson. Someone talks about a Boeing 757. Norman is uneasy about flying on a 757. I say to him that he must have flown in a 757 before in one of his flights to school from his home in Seattle. I tell him I'll sit next to him and I'll take the window seat. There are people with rice crispy bars and other cereal bars."
"0550"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Fat Face No Beard I wake up and find that someone has shaved off most of my facial hair. They have done a poor job. It is longer in some places than in others. I have a fat face."
"0551"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Man With Slug On Head I go into the Carter School gymnasium. It is dark. I have the flashlight that my dad gave me for Christmas. There are some men being hidden under the stage through the doors on the front of the stage. There is another man near the lunchroom with a flashlight. He approaches the group of hiding men. I go with this man and approach the hiding men. My flashlight isn't put together or working yet, so I use the light from the other man's flashlight. We get closing to the men. It is like the men are hiding from Nazis. I see that one of the men is balding. This man has some kind of a slug or leach-like creature on his head. He then realizes it is there, but isn't extremely alarmed by it."
"0552"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Sex With Natasha I'm with my old roommate's girlfriend, Natasha Lens. We are at Carter School in Oak Valley by the old pop machine. We are having a sexual encounter. I move my hand around her butt and crotch. She moves her body, and gives me some sort of instructions. People come and sit on the floor nearby, in the hallway at the bottom of the stairs below the pop machine. Three people come at first. They include my friend Tiny Combs, Alec Johnson, and another person. Then a class of people comes. The people know Natasha and I are there. She and I decide to move to the stage. I tell her to wrap a blanket around her before we go, because she isn't wearing a shirt or a bra. We get to the gym, where the stage is, and there are many people there. She says we can go back to her room. I'm then out by the pop machine. I may be leaving. Natasha's boyfriend, my old roommate Jens Nils, is there. He is confused and upset about what is happening with Natasha and I. He says no: this can't happen. Natasha and I leave despite his objection."
"0553"	"(12/19/1996)"	"Animosity Penalty I'm at Carter School. I see my friend Matt Yams. We meet and I speak German to him. I have a car inside the school. I attempt to drive the car out of the side door by the gymnasium. It doesn't fit, so I back up into the gymnasium and turn and go down the short flight of stairs and out the front door. My old roommate's girlfriend Natasha Lens and another person are at the doors as we exit. We drive over near my friend Gino Teavor's house. People are playing football there. Among them are my friends Kory Reynolds, Gino Teavor, and my roommate Stephen Ramos. Gino really gets into the game. I play. My team is on defense. Gino's team is on offense. They get near the end zone. The quarterback throws a receiver, and someone says that is a penalty called ""animosity"". I agree. Gino throws a tantrum. We argue, yelling. The penalty is for intentionally passing the ball too far. I say to just put the ball back and re-do the play, on second down. Gino is really mad. He has the ball and snaps it, even though he's not the normal quarterback. He runs into the end zone. I am there, and I don't try to tackle him. I walk back to the other end of the field. Gino kicks off. The ball comes to me. Gino is still on a rampage, and he intimidates me. I catch the ball on one bounce, and am tackled for no gain. I should have tried to gain some yardage."
"0554"	"(12/20/1996)"	"Fighting Tony Ramada I'm outside a dorm room at Brimson. There are some tall, skinny guys there. My brother Wally, cousin Henry King, others, and I are there. We go in the room. I am selected to fight my friend Tony Ramada. He is preparing by listening to music. I am standing there waiting for him. My sister Heather is on the bed with other people, watching. Her leg is in the way. I tell her to move it because it could hinder my fighting. I decide to go all out: to put my entire efforts forth to make Tony submit. The fight starts, and I grab his head as he lunges forward and smash his nose and face into my knee. I am then fighting my classmate Shirley Brown. I bend her leg around backwards until she submits. Bending her leg around is an unusual thing to do, but it works. Afterwards, she says it doesn't hurt that much anymore to have her leg in that position."
"0555"	"(12/20/1996)"	"Ahmed's Bait Shop I'm at a bait shop with my dad. My friend Binky Ahmed is working there. I buy 15 ounces of night crawlers for $1.56. The other option was to buy a dozen for $2.22. My dad buys some minnows. Binky has a huge live fishing his hands with a bite taken out of its tail and a few scales missing. I am in water. Our boat is near. I want to get back in the boat. When I try to get back in, the boat capsizes. There are straps lengthwise and crosswise on the boat. My brother Wally is there and helps counterbalance the boat so I can get in. My dad, and sisters Heather and Ramona are there too."

It may be my friend Kevin Simpson's ice-fishing house. I am trying to make a hole in the ice. I succeed after removing the wood cover to the floor of the house. The water is dirty, and difficult to see in it. I see a small northern pike go by, and I throw a piece of wood at it. My classmate Scott Botwright and one of his roommates stop by. It is dark. We are coming back tomorrow to fish. I crawl on the ice over a hole and get wet."
"0557"	"(12/21/1996)"	"Esther Thurman Topless I'm at a party. I am in a bedroom with my friend Esther Thurman. We are flirting, and we start having a sexual encounter. She is soon topless and laying back on the bed. This has happened before, I know. There are police cars outside with their lights flashing. We take the screen off the window and climb out. We go into the next room through the window. There are a bunch of women in the room. Among them is my grade school classmate Misty Ryan is among the women."
"0558"	"(12/21/1996)"	"Plane To Australia I'm at the airport with my roommate Stephen Ramos and friend Emerald Reinhold. I am on a cart with a man who works at the airport. I tell Stephen and Emerald that we are going to be on a different compartment. The man and I leave. The man drives backwards, and we leave the area. I am afraid he may hit something and injure me, since I'm on back of the cart. I'm then on a plane. The seating area is small and cramped. All the people for my class flight to Australia are there. My friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman are there too. The plane is flying very close to the top of a city: very low. My friend Yvette Ullman is there. She acts and talks as if she was my girlfriend. I see Stephen and Emerald in a different compartment. I realize I've left my backpack at home. It contains important items. The backpack is in the hotel where we stayed the night before. My friend Kate Francis is there and we talk briefly. People are eating Mr. Freezies. Green is the best color Mr. Freezie, although purple is also seen. My high school crush Harmony Allure is there. I see her and say hi. The first thing I notice and say is that she is wearing a lot of makeup. That is an uncomfortable start to our conversation. She leaves quickly after we stumble through an uncomfortable conversation on the topic of school."

They are standing up while driving, and their bodies stick out the top of the cab of the truck. The driver is really skinny and tan. I have a nice wooden sign that I use to advertise the watermelons. My dad is there. He wants to buy a watermelon. He tries to talk me down from $3.00 to $2.00 for a large watermelon. I say I'll sell it to him for $2.50. I may drop my price to $2.00 as he is leaving."

I'm in the classroom, but I leave for a bit before it starts. I'm going to a restaurant. I see my friend Sam Kingsley's mother Faye Klump. I go in, and we sit down together at a table with two older men and talk. I joke with her and say that I own this restaurant. The two men and I eat fried chicken."

On the third message, I hear that my friend Holly has been hurt or killed. The message is like hearing a news report. It goes as follows: ""Holly had been with friends all night. At 3:00 am, her friends and her were going to watch a movie. Holly turned to her Jeep, a man was there, and ..."" The rest of my messages are in the same news-like format. Someone sits down on the bed next to me. I turn, and see that it is Holly. She is wearing a skirt, white socks, and brown shoes. Her face and arms are badly bruised. She is half lying on the bed with her head and neck up against the headboard. I ask her how she is, and she says okay. I touch her arm. She looks and acts frightened. She says we need to talk. We go into the hallway to my locker, which is glass inside a wooden frame. At first Holly is confused and thinks it is her locker. I tell her it is my locker, and she says, ""Oh, right."" She is confused because of the beating. Our classmate is Pauline Davies is there and she wants to talk to Holly."

I say an analogy to something, which may be related to soul. Stephen and Norman yell something about strawberries. The athletes are watching football on television. I go upstairs to see my ex-girlfriend Annie before I do homework. I want to kiss her. It feels as if we are a couple. I go to the Humanities computer lab, where my professor Greg Welters' class is meeting. I have a red plastic cup full of milk. Greg tells me to dump it out before I enter the lab. I drink some of the milk and dump the rest out. I fill the cup with some water and drink it. The lab is really full. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. There is a first-year woman who keeps talking to me. My co-worker Katie James is there. I find the lone Power Macintosh that is available. It has Humanities-Fine Arts Applications open. I go to the chooser and select Social Studies Applications."

It is foggy and hazy outside. The sun is rising. The man I am with urinates. We drive. We're low on gasoline. There is a rocky shoreline. Near the shore are pirates in boats. We get near them, and we are attacked with guns and knives. I kill many pirates by cutting their throats with razor blade craft knife. There is a competition between two men. One of the men is tall and fat. The other man is smaller. The larger man is stabbed with a pen in the jaw or neck, stabbed with a knife, and cut with a razor blade. The man is unaffected. A vacuum sucks out a lot of the larger man's blood. He is unaffected. The smaller man is scared and runs. The area in which they fight is a v-shaped channel with water in the middle and metal on the sides. The large man writes two columns of lines. One column is entitled ""winner"", and the other ""losers"". Next to the column of winners her writes Manleys, and circles it."

If one person kicks the back of another person's shoes, sperm comes out of the toes of the person who was kicked. I am in a school where one of my old basketball coaches, Todd Banner, is teaching second grade. The kids in the class are having a meal. Todd is dressed in white pants and a long sleeved, yellow and red patterned shirt. He talks about ""bloodied toilets"" for the girls if they need them, and other bathrooms for boys and others. His only requirements are that the students chew and eat."

There is a woman, who I then realize is a man, sitting next to me. We are in the front left portion of the classroom. The man next to me talks in a high-pitched voice. The class gets out early because the teacher has no material to present. The man next to me caught chickens. I think he is from Yardville"

We duck down as people come near. I am in a band that is playing in Big Dance Club. We get paid to play. My classmate Brad Chloe is there. He demands to see a list that he thinks is in my wallet.

The formula may be B=F(E), but I think there is a ""P"" in the equation somewhere. I need to pass a few levels on the video game to get the key, which is the formula. In the video game, there is a pink wax-like worm. It bounces and changes sizes. There are things the worm is trying to kill. I control the worm. There is a large bad creature in the game that jumps off the screen. I can see its shadow before it falls, like in the computer game Power Pete. It is some kind of dragon video game. There is a laser in the video game. I hold down a key on the controller and a green laser beam shoots out, killing everything in its way. I quit playing the game because I have too much to complete before I would obtain the key. I am a police officer. My brother Wally is released from jail. He is a prisoner. We walk around the police station. He has both hands grabbing onto my arms. I have both hands grabbing onto his wrists. I maintain physical control of him. There is a laser scanner upstairs. A man and a woman I know, and a man I don't know, come to the scanner where Wally and I are. The man sits on the scanner, blocking the laser. Wally and I go downstairs. We pass my friend Carmen allure and her father Tom. I say, ""Have a good weekend"" to them. Wally is like the cardboard box bailing man at Mason Cafeteria. I have fired him for the weekend. We're in an entry to Mason. He is upset that he has been fired, even though he doesn't like to work on the weekend. I get his jacket."

There are stacks of board games at different points in the mall. My friends Nat Miller and Hilary Nano are there. We have to choose an area to work. The stacks of games divide work areas. Then we are part of an acting group. I know my role, and have done it before, but I wait for the group."

I walk down a hallway. German classes are in the classrooms on the left side of the hallway, and geology is on the right side. There is food and drinks in the hallway. I talk to another teacher outside the room, and then go in the German room, which is on the right side of the hallway. There is a final exam. My friend Gino Teavor and roommate Stephen Ramos are taking the exam also. During part of the oral exam Gino comes up to me and asks me to sign something to support him. I quickly agree to do so. Gino knows all the test material really well. That is why he can walk around during the exam. [Note: I saw a photo of Helen Hunter the day before this dream. Prior to that I hadn't seen her face of consciously thought of her for 5 years.]"
"0573"	"(12/30/1996)"	"One-Armed Cyclist Leader My sister Ramona is posing as my grade school classmate Misty Ryan at a hair cutting place. They're trying to make her hair go ""out"" more. I have a Flintstones stick. It has two parts. I'm coming back from a casino with my roommate Stephen Ramos and friend Kevin Simpson. We're on a road that signs saying Highway 7 and Highway 15. It seems like the east side of Wilmerton at the intersection between Stephen's house and the Honda dealership. There are a group of cyclists. The leader of the group has one arm tied down in a white sling. He turns off, and the group splits. I'm near Wilmerton University. I see my old classmate Dan Boyle. Stephen, Kevin, and I are returning from a concert. I'm on a bike and I jump a curb where the cement is cracked and crumbling. My friend Tom Napper is there. Stephen and Kevin have gone somewhere. I am in Jose Ramos' apartment. Stephen and Kevin are drying out their clothes after the concert. The dehumidifier is ""wet"", which is the highest setting. My old classmate Buck Green is there. It looks like he is wearing lipstick. Jose has a sprinkler-like carpet-cleaning sprayer. We get wet when it goes off. Stephen knocks salt and pepper shakers on the floor in disgust. I think this action is dumb: it doesn't help at all. Rent at this apartment is $170 per month. Buck and I say that the rent isn't bad. A videotape is being rewound. It is of a basketball game. The tape is rewound past the game: there are recordings of music stuff before the game."
"0574"	"(12/31/1996)"	"Bear Attack I'm in a tent with my roommate Stephen Ramos. I wake up from sleeping and remember a dream. The dream is as follows: We are deer hunting on his land. We are down by his brother Jose's deer stand. We see a huge black bear. We slowly walk backwards. The huge bear wanders away. I see two more black bears. They are smaller than the first, but still big. Then there are many bears all over the place. Stephen and I each have a shotgun with slugs. Stephen puts on a bear mask. It looks like the real head of a bear. The bears come near to me. I shoot three of the bears in the head: Jake and two other bears. Another bear, which is my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, is upon me, and I am out of slugs. I awake from this dream, and don't have my dream journal. Stephen tells me I should have defecated before I went to bed because I was farting in my sleep. I know this isn't possible, but don't say anything to him. We are at our deer-hunting campsite. Jose and Franco Ramos are there too. I look out the door of our tent and see two hunters walking down the path along the fence towards Jose's deer stand. It is getting light outside. I realize we have overslept and are losing valuable hunting time. I get up. I have my Washington University pajama pants on. I go out of the tent. There are two men on the edge of our camp. They are on the edge of the woods. Our camp seems to be between the house and the woods, just south of the house. The men see a buck, and we see it too. It is close to camp, and we are in the line of fire for these men, so we move. The men scare the buck by throwing a flaming piece of two by four wood at it and firing a shot in front of it. The deer runs. Everyone fires at the deer, including Jose. At first, it looks like Jose is using a handgun. The deer escapes unscathed. It runs into the field. People fired shots to make it run in a certain direction, so they could shoot it. I am looking for my bag of clothes. I can't find it."
"0575"	"(12/31/1996)"	"Crumbling Antlers I am deer hunting. A deer is running across a field. I am there. The deer is running towards me slightly. I think of shooting to make the deer run directly towards me, but I don't. I do fire, and I hit the deer. It is a big deer: it looks like a horse! It has six or eight antler tines. It runs into a nearby wooded and field area and falls down. I'm with my hunting party looking for the deer. We're in a house. It is pouring rain outside, really hard. Out in the field I see a lightning rod that is being continuously struck with lighting. People had just put the rod up early in the day. People also put blaze orange panels on the roof of a house, like insulation. I go into a small room, which is empty, dirty, wet, and tan in color. My party and I walk through a hunting camp while looking for our deer. There are two guys hunting, but not for deer. They point us to our deer, which is about 100 feet in a different direction. We see it, and go get it. Most of the deer's antlers have fallen off. It has only two big tines remaining, like an antelope. I think it must not be the one that I shot because that deer had a big six or eight point rack. My hunting partner Jose Ramos says the rack on the deer I shot was bigger than six or eight points. There are pieces of bone and antler on the ground from where the deer fell and hit the ground. The pieces are cracked and broken. The pieces look eroded, and have holes in them. I talk with Franco Ramos, another hunting partner, who says he could have hit that deer. I tell him he couldn't have hit the deer from where he was, on the edge of the field near the other woods. I show him where his shot ended up and where mine did, which is about 50 yards apart. His shot would have had to been about 200 yards. He accepts that I was the one who hit the deer."
"0576"	"(12/31/1996)"	"A Bus Ride I'm on a large bus, which seems a bit like a plane. There is a central aisle with seats on each side of it. I sit next to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. She is my girlfriend now. We're on a crowded freeway. My friend's father, Mike Reed, is driving the bus. I am confident in his driving. He is a smart driver: he doesn't follow too close and brakes ahead of time. Drinks are served. The stewardess is a black woman who wears heavy purple and blue eye shadow and eyeliner. She has slick black hair. She makes mistakes on the drink orders for my seat, and the seats in front of and behind my seat. She falls down into the seat in front of mine. I assure Annie that we're all going to make it there okay. I am confident and secure. The busload of people I am with are at a concert. I walk around an upper level of the concert looking down at the people on the floor. A lot of people are shirtless. It is daytime, I think, but I imagine a spotlight roaming the crowd and people going crazy when it hits them. I imagine myself when the spotlight hits me. There is a kid on the crowd bodysurfing. He is shirtless, but he is wearing a light blue shirt with the word ""spooner"" on the front of the shirt. I walk by a bunch of buses to find the bus I was on. I am carrying my green sweatshirt with a pair of my white underwear folded up in one sleeve of the sweatshirt. I walk on a ledge off the ground near the buses. I use the metal windowpanes of the buses to hold me up. I walk along the edge of the buses that are lined up. I drop the underwear out of the sweatshirt sleeve, and don't pick them up. A kid on the bus yells at me about the underwear. One bus I pass has a fire pole to slide down as an exit. Finally I get to my bus. It is turquoise and has dark seats and tinted windows. I know the driver's face: it is not Mike Reed any more. The other buses are orange."

My friend Tina Totts is there too. I chase Tina around a polished granite pathway. It's a continuous square pathway with steps."
"0580"	"(01/01/1997)"	"Lucid Men On Roof I'm in bed in my room at home. There is a window that looks out over the roof. The window is to the south of where the window actually is, but is still on the west wall of the room. There are two men with guns on the roof that look in at me. I pretend I am sleeping. When they are out of sight, I get up and run outside to try to find them. They are gone. I run around the house in bare feet looking on the roof. It is summer time. There is a brown station wagon there; different than the one we used to have. I think I might be dreaming, and I attempt to fly. I fall on my face. I keep running, and try again to fly with a strong will to fly. I start to fly. I go up in the air and try to maintain lucidity, but I lose it."
"0581"	"(01/02/1997)"	"Arguing About Showers I'm at Brimson with four or five people. We are riding bicycles. My friend Nate Nelling is there. We are biking north on the path by Old Main, and then past Social Science Hall. There are people coming towards us, on bike or on foot. As we pass, one of them says something about us taking up the middle of the path. I shrug off the comment, thinking, ""Fuck off"". My dad is there. A bearded man I don't know points him out to me and says that he was at the Tea Hall dormitory looking for me. I go back to the dormitory. I store the bicycle I am on. I have a door key but I drop it, and am without. I am on my way upstairs to see my dad. The hall advisor says she won't require 12 meals to be eaten with her, only 10 meals. The stairs are square, and rising. I pick up pennies. A woman comes over and blatantly asks me out. It is my old classmate Jerome Michaels' girlfriend. I say to her, ""What about Jerome?"" Another woman comes over and the two women fight. I sneak away up the stairs. My friends Esther Thurman and Jana Green are arguing over who is going to shower with me: they both want to. There are people watching. I say that neither is going to shower with me. I enter the shower alone with my towel and close the door. The shower stall is short, and I easily see over the top. The spray of water hits me on my lower torso and below."
"0582"	"(01/02/1997)"	"Wet River Flight I'm going to the airport. I am near a river area with docks. I fall in the water. I have forgotten my boots and other things. I'm going to check in at the airport, and get on a plane. I have a booklet-like folder that contains my tickets. A man slides a transparency up against the book and matches tickets. There is a man who wants to give me my passport in Los Angeles. I say, ""No way!"" My high school classmate, John Stromer, is there, and he tries to get on the plane. The man won't let him on, and he ends up at a counter where I am."
"0583"	"(01/02/1997)"	"Searched At Airport I'm at an airport to catch a plane. I am searched by a guard, and drop some coins on the floor while I am being searched. The guard woman is a bitch. My friends Emerald Reinhold, Jana Green, Becky Happs, and Amy Leopard and other people are flying out. After I am searched I wait, and pick up silver coins I had dropped. The lights go out and people rush through the ticket checking area."
"0584"	"(01/02/1997)"	"Seeing A Tornado Drop I'm in a truck with my friends Tiny Combs, Stephen Ramos, and Kristy Puffy. We're driving to work. We are by Kristy's mother's house in Oak Valley. A tornado is near. We take shelter under the overpass where Main Street crosses the railroad tracks. I am then at home. My family is there, as well as my friend Kevin Simpson, my uncle Rusty Redding and his family, and a kid from my high school, Ben Thompson. I bring Ben out through the garage and open the old yellow garage door from the inside. There is a nice brown truck outside the door. I go around to the back door and knock. My uncle Rusty lets me in. We see a funnel cloud drop and open up. I yell for everyone to get to the basement. I run down stairs, and fire alarms in the house go off. No one comes downstairs at first. In a little while the others come to the basement. They huddle in the pit room and cover up with a beanbag chair and two mattresses that are sewn together at one long edge. My cousin Melvin Redding, aunt Sheila Redding, and sister Ramona are there, among others."
"0585"	"(01/02/1997)"	"Yankees Win I'm at a Yankees baseball game. They win 10-4. I am out near right field as the game ends. Fans charge the field, which seems odd to me because I thought it was just another baseball game. I leave, and as I do I swear. A man and his little boy walk by. I feel bad for swearing in front of the boy. I walk down stairs to the parking lot and I see my old neighbor Anna Gates. I have roller-skates on. Anna grabs my shirt with one hand in the chest area. I almost fall back off a ledge, but she pulls me back. We're outside in the parking lot. I skate a little bit while she walks."

"0587"	"(01/02/1997)"	"Academic Confusion I'm in a school, which may be Brimson College, Armstrong High School, or Holy Middle School. My dad brings something for my sister Heather. He talks to me and says he wants back some hand written notes he had given me. My high school teammate Ron Lind is there, and he listens. My friends Holly Lapson, Emerald Reinhold, and Jill Banks walk by. Holly doesn't look at me or say hi. She does her characteristic nonchalant walk by. I talk to Jill a little bit. There is a dog there. I pet it, and it shirks away from me like it is scared. I am confused about the scheduling. I can't tell if this is Armstrong or Brimson. I have class in the field house during the 3rd trimester, which, I am told, is still the 2nd trimester. I'm in a hallway with a lot of people. A teacher comes out of a classroom and tells people to quiet down. She scolds the students that are close to her classroom. I say there is a whole hallway of students: why did she only yell at the ones close to the room? I talk with my friend Binky Ahmed and another person about basketball. He says I should play in the Jamboree. I say that my knees would crumble if I played, but it would be fun to play."
"0588"	"(01/03/1997)"	"Hunting At Grandpa's Farm I'm deer hunting in an area that is like Grandma and Grandpa Redding's farm. I'm out near a cornfield that is cut down. There are several small fields around it with standing corn. There is a woods there too. There are a lot of hunters outside: six or eight are visible along the cornfield. I go near a man and his son, not initially realizing that I may be too close to them. Deer are everywhere. Some men on the edge of the woods seem to be leading a doe, as if it is tame or it is a pet. Deer frequently run across the field and are seen daring around the field edges. I take a couple shots at one deer. There is a group of men driving a field of standing corn that I am near. I think I should move, and I do. There are foxes and rabbits around. I am in a small building similar to one of the old chicken coops. I see a small fawn. At first it seems bigger than it actually is. I aim, but see it is really small. I am near it. It is lying down, like a lamb. I pet the fawn. Later, the fawn is gone. Outside there is a pink-headed peacock on the road into the cornfield."

We are out of control, and slide into the conference site. The two people and I fly. I am only aware of me flying. We fly around a pink water tower-like structure. I'm really high up. It is before dawn. I hear that the fog will lift at sunrise: it is heavy now. We are getting ice cream. We control flying speed by the angle of the dip: how steep we are flying. While I'm flying I see the whole earth, and the edge of the earth with the blackness of space next to it. I see the pink and blue colors of the earth and the sun. There is a name for the earth as I see it from this great distance. It is called ""Terminal ______"" (I forget the second word). We land. It is demonstrated how to land and then store your bicycle in an apartment. A man with a white beard demonstrates how to store a bicycle."

I get two pair, Ramona gets two pair, and my dad gets four queens! My dad shows us his hand prior to betting, in his, ""Oh my gosh! Look at this!"" manner. I say he would have won a lot of money had he not shown us his hand. I am trying to explain the game ""guts"", and then the game ""in between"". My sister Heather comes over to the table."
"0591"	"(01/05/1997)"	"Two Rings There are three big cargo ships. One ship goes off around a little island and heads out to sea. Another ship goes between the island and the shore. Two of the ships dock next to each other in the port area. I'm having a party at my house one night. I get ready, but seem to not care about preparation. There was a crime I am helping police solve. A phone rings and my mom answers it. I tell her to tell the caller I'll be there with the information to help the case. There caller is a police officer, I think. The crime and police officers remind me of the movie Fargo. I climb a wire fence with my big snow boots on. I have two rings on: one with a black gemstone and one with a red gemstone, which may be a ruby, my birthstone. The black gem ring is from mom. As I climb the fence the black ring falls off. I climb over and find it stuck in a wall, with the gem side facing out of the wall. There is something about the number 85. It may indicate a percent or degrees, after I climb the fence. There is an oven there that is getting really hot. It is ""five to eight"" (that is, 7:55pm). My mom and my sister Ramona are going out for dinner. The oven is red hot. I was going to cook egg rolls at 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Without jumping, I grab a black handle stuck on the ceiling and pull it down."
"0592"	"(01/05/1997)"	"Tomato Softball I'm playing softball with my high school geography teacher Gary Kline, his daughter and my classmate Macy Kline, my friend Ivory Alshire, a classmate from Brimson Stacy Lockhorn, and others. We use hard, crisp, red, rubbery bouncy tomatoes as softballs. I'm the catcher. Gary is the umpire. One runner gets home. Then we get a force out at home plate, I tag a runner out, and I tag Macy at 3rd base. Gary wasn't at third base to make the call. He was behind some sort of a pillar. As Macy scrambled to get to 3rd base, she slowed down and my movements slow down. I feel like I am in super-slow motion: it is difficult to move. I tag her just before she reaches the base. I call Gary over and ask him if she was out, hinting that she was. The call was disputable, but because we had the force out at home anyway, the inning ended."
"0593"	"(01/05/1997)"	"Sibling 7-Card No Peek I'm playing poker with my brother Wally and sisters Ramona and Heather. We are playing ""7-card no peek"". The cards are dealt two down and one up to start. I have a four face up. Wally changes wild cards from twos and fours to twos and fives. I get mad and say he can't change wild cards after he has dealt cards face up! In my anger, more cards are flipped over. I get a five. I raise the pot two dollars to force everyone to fold. Wally and Heather fold. Ramona is in. Ramona ends up with eight cards: she drew too many. I get mad because she drew extra cards and I would have gotten some of the cards, had she only drawn seven cards. I tell her to just bet, even though I have only seven cards. Ramona has five aces. I have a royal straight flush in spades, using three wild cards. I could also have five aces, but I say I have a royal straight flush because I know more about poker than she does."
"0594"	"(01/06/1997)"	"Willard Scott In A Ball Game I'm in a game. Willard Scott is there, as well as another man. I throw balls, trying to hit people. They try to hit me with balls. The game is played on different levels. I scramble down from a top level through two square holes in the floors to the bottom level. I scrape my back as I climb down. I am beating the other people at the game: kicking ass! Willard is in a lower level. He helps me as I scramble through maze-like conditions. I throw a ball and hit someone. Other balls are lying around to be picked up."
"0595"	"(01/06/1997)"	"Peppermint Candy Football I'm playing volleyball against my high school classmate Laura Thompson and another woman. I beat them. Then, instead of playing them against me, it is a team sport: I am playing against a team of women! The game is kind of like football. A big piece of peppermint candy is the ball. I pick it up and run the length of the field, breaking and dodging tackles. There is a cute black woman there. I evade her before I score a touchdown. I hump across a road in one stride."
"0596"	"(01/07/1997)"	"Snow Jump I go down a snow covered hill and off a jump, which isn't too big. I watch little kids come down from the bottom of the hill. My friend Kevin Simpson and roommate Stephen Ramos are there and we build up the snow jump so it's big. Kids are going off the jump. The jump becomes so big that I don't want to go off it. I'm at the top of the hill with two other people. Someone is trying to force another person and I to go down the hill. Guns are being used. There is a crowd at the base of the hill. People there are like police. Something happens involving my friends Emerald Reinhold, Tina Totts, Esther Thurman, and Emily Zates."
"0597"	"(01/07/1997)"	"Mrs. Minikel Buys Us Beer I'm in a Target store with my friend Kevin Simpson. There is a liquor section, which we are in, buying beer. A grade school teacher of mine, Liza Minikel, is there. I ask her if she'll buy beer for us, and she agrees. There is a police officer there. He stops Liza from buying beer for us. Liza gets a big fine of $240 or $280 dollars for attempting to buy us beer. I get a $10 fine. We all walk away. I feel guilty, and I think of offering to split her fine between her and Kevin and I."
"0598"	"(01/09/1997)"	"Can't Slide I'm at a downhill skiing place. Sleds are being used instead of skis. I go down the hill after watching someone go before me. It is a big hill, and people start sliding at different heights, or points, on the way up the hill. I don't want to go all the way to the top. I slide down the hill from a point that is pretty high up, but I slide really slow and stop before I get to the base of the hill. I jokingly whine about the slide. A woman who seems to be a conglomerate of an acquaintance named Mary Phelps and a classmate of mine from Brimson named Heather come and jump on me. A man I know from Brimson named John comes and picks up my glove or mitten. It is dark green in color. I quickly grab it out of his hand. My friend Hilary Nano is there. She tries to assure John, who is mad at me, that the reason I took the glove was because I was nervous."
"0599"	"(01/09/1997)"	"Darla's Fiance I'm having a gathering at my house. People come uninvited. A high school classmate, Pat Mareck, comes. The big-haired, thick-glassed, non-neck moving gamer guy from Brimson comes to the door. He asks if Darla Robertson, a high school classmate of mine, is there. I say no. He comes in. He is Darla's fiance. He drove some kind of vehicle with golf carts in it or on a trailer. I look out the window and see a cart with its motor running and no one driving it. It is moving and crashing into the cars that are lined up on both sides of the street. My friend Esther Thurman and my roommate Stephen Ramos are there. Stephen drove a Tracker, while Esther drove her parent's truck. I take the running golf cart and toss it in the back of the man's vehicle. I go and tell people to move their cars, which are in a line, all smashed into one another."
"0600"	"(01/11/1997)"	"Drunk Nate I go into my living room at home. My friend Nate Nelling is there. His head is shaved on the top. There is hair sticking out on the back and the sides of his head. He is drunk. He was supposed to go home. He is going to sleep at my house, on the floor. I bring him up to my room. He is a pathetic drunk."
"0601"	"(01/12/1997)"	"Rinsing Head I am younger. I'm near a bathtub that's filled with water. I have really short hair that is like I actually do now. My head is covered with shampoo. In rinse my head in the tub, partially submerging it."
"0602"	"(01/15/1997)"	"Sydney Hodgepodge I'm with two people at an airport. I stop and give all my clothes to a man, asking him to hold them for a moment. I take my pair of black underwear and try to put them on. I spin them on my finger for a bit, twirling them. I get them on, and go back to the man for my other clothes. The man is about to sell my clothes. I quickly say that I'll give him money, but then I beat him, kicking him in the groin and taking my clothes. From then on, he is younger, and he is after me for revenge. I leave. I am with the group of students that are in my traveling class. We go to a place numbered 50 on a city map. The man I beat up is still pursuing me. Outside the airport is a scruffy young man. He asks me, ""Would you care for psychology?"" He has a thick accent. At first I don't understand him. Then I realize he wants to talk about psychology, and I say yes. I am in a mall-like area. There is a place called The Cosmopolitan, which is a small shop. It is early in the morning, and the shop is only serving beverages. My friend Yvette Ullman is there. I walk through the mall area and go into a bookstore. I walk around the counter and look at two men my age working there. I stare them down, comparing myself to them. I go look at some out of date Christmas cards and calendars, even though they are out of date. I walk in the mall, and see my old roommate Jens Nils. I say hi to him unenthusiastically. He and a group of three or four people are wearing colorful body garbs that come from a year-round Halloween shop in the mall. I see my high school classmate Brett Ball and say an unenthusiastic ""hi"". There is a display case in the mall with a few Darryl Strawberry baseball cards in it. There is nothing else in the case. There is a card that used to be of great value. It was priced at $9.75 now. The man working said he would have to check to make sure that the card is really that cheap. I'm in a house or room with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona. I am eating broccoli. The broccoli is disgusting and I spit it out. My mom asks why I spit it out, and I say I hate raw broccoli. There are vegetable dips there. I have a slice of flabby broccoli, like a thick broccoli fillet. I don't eat it. My mom points out that there are carrots, and I eat those. A kid drives by in a truck. He honks and waves his hands out the window trying to get one of my sister's attentions. My sisters and I talk about some young kid. I tell him where I saw him last, but I forget the name of the place. I start saying what I think the name sounds like, and eventually one of my sisters guesses the name ""Cosmopolitan"", which I remember to be correct. A male police officer brings three young boys to the back door of our house. I meet them as I go out. The officer says to me that these three boys told him that I've been farting in places like basketball practice, or basketball games, which is a crime. I speak to the three boys and say that's right: I have been farting. I say there is nothing wrong with farting: it is an entirely natural thing. They disprove of my viewpoint, because of socialization. The officer lets me continue speaking. I speak until I am finished, and then go back inside. The officer doesn't stop me because I have argued my point well. I get inside and see my friend Esther Thurman and my old girlfriend Annie Thomas. I am surprised! I am slightly angry that the police officer bothered me. Esther tries to grab my hand a couple times, but I pull it away. I do this both because I am angry with the officer, and because Annie is there. Annie is wearing tight brown pants and big brown leather hiking boots. One of them is wearing a big puffy yellow jacket. I'm in bed at the Manhatten Hotel in Sydney, Australia. I've told my roommate Niles Zelling the part of this dream where the man asks me, ""Would you care for psychology?"" Niles comes over and sits on my bed. He is excited. He knows what this part of my dream means. I think about it, and realize its meaning, and tell him it confirms my decision to major in psychology. He says I am exactly right. Then he looks ahead to our future plans of our ""dream machine"". He recalls our dream interpretation group in personality class, in which He says I did a good job, though I know I didn't."
"0603"	"(01/17/1997)"	"Who The Fuck Are You? I go to a card table selling tickets at an Armstrong High School Basketball game. A man at the table greets me as Mr. Hanson, and says he hasn't seen me in a while. I say to him, ""Who the fuck are you?"" He is offended. He is the father of an Armstrong basketball player. I shake his hand to make amends. My mom is there. I look into the gymnasium. The game is a rout: Armstrong is winning 25-2. It is the end of the first quarter. There is 1:02 left in the first quarter break. The team is warming up. My dad is out on the court with them. He is goofing off: tossing a ball between his legs and demonstrating a hook shot. There is a bridge-like walkway over the court about 30 feet high. I walk up and across it. The band members are playing on the walkway. My dad is talking with the players, making fun of them. I am very mad that my dad has been doing all this with the players. I yell at him and tell him that he's hurting the players. He does his goofy smile/grin and chuckles, not taking me seriously. I am very mad at him. I tell him, using the words ""big man"" and ""little man"", that whenever we converse and I want him to take me seriously, he doesn't. When he wants me to take him seriously, I do. ""Big man"" is the one who wants to be serious. ""Little man"" is the one who won't be serious. Coach Jackson Shooter comes up to me and says, ""Stop yelling at your dad and help Ben"". He is annoyed with my behavior, and thinks I am being selfish. He thinks I'm being selfish. I say to my dad again, ""You're hurting the players."" One of the players, Travis Kulik, is sick. A player who may be Andy Klien, but who has more facial hair, walks by. He does a handshake with my dad. Another player, Ryan Barnes, is there in street clothes."

The others include a fat athletic trainer, a tall man that plays center, and a man with a scar on his back. There is a practice being held. I threaten one man. I tell him I'm going to kick his ass on the court. I am then in the practice and I'm determined to do well. The practice is some sort of aerobics/dance/basketball practice. I have no, or bad, shoes on, and have no traction. My mom is there. She talks to the coach or instructor. Then she short of mingles her way around, stopping to say hi to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. My mom makes her way over to me. She says, ""It's Pink Day"".

Emerald and Abby get out on an upper level floor, which may or may not be the one I get out at. I am drawing the alphabet on the carpet with a pointy object. I draw small letters, A through H or I, and then go back and draw larger capital letters around the small letters."

A person I know from school, Janice Jones, is there. She leaves. I start telling the man the dream. I get caught up in the dream and lose my focus. I am walking. My friend Hilary Nano is walking with two people. At first it seems like I might be one of them, but I hear what both of those people are saying. Beth is telling them about us making out. I avoid her and her speaking. It sounds like she wants more than I want out of the relationship. I hide on the sixth floor. I am going to take an elevator away. I push the button and wait.

I sit in front next to Daryl. Gino sits across the stage from me. He has to sit with his underwear off. He has no clothing on the lower half of his body, but uses his red underwear to cover up his groin. The others and I laugh at him. My friend Sam Kingsley dealt drugs when we were younger. I'm at an old classmate, Jerome Michaels' house. One man is tied up there. Another man is standing. Jerome's roommates are beating the men. Finally, I say, ""Stop, don't beat him when he is tied up, he needs a chance to fight back."" The two men that were doing the beating come after me.

I bunny hop a steel cable which is running parallel to the direction I am going. I hear that a man from my home community, Walt Thompson, has died doing construction. Abraham Lincoln wrote a lot of books that are only now being discovered. The cheapest of these books costs $4,000. I'm in the garage at home in Oak Valley.

I walk by my childhood priest Father Vance Brock, who is with my grade school classmate Misty Ryan and her mother Leslie. He says, ""Hi Kenneth."" I say hi back and wave. I wouldn't have done so if he didn't first. My uncles Gary and Dannie Redding are in the wedding. I am with my mom and sisters Ramona and Heather. We sit on the right side of church, in back, saving a place for our cousin Melissa Redding. I get out of my seat to do something in back of church, maybe in the balcony. The wedding has started with the procession. My aunt Annette and aunt Elaine Grains are singing. I have trouble getting up to the balcony without having family members seeing me leave. I can't get to the doors. Then I do make it to the balcony. When I come down, my jeans, which are later black pants, are stuck or pinned together. I waddle down the steps. The choir is there as I go down. There is a reception at the American Legion. I ask, ""Is it safe yet?"""
"0627"	"(02/03/1997)"	"Asian Boy Dies Near Cliff There is a boy from southeast Asia on a bridge over a river. He has groceries/food, which may be in a sled. The owner of the boy will shoot him if the boy jumps into the water. Many metal musket balls will be fired into the water if he jumps. The boy walks slowly off to the other end of the bridge. It is kind of dark, and the owner probably won't see the boy move slowly. When he gets near the end of the bridge, he runs. He makes it to the other side. I meet the boy on the other side of the bridge, where there is a high rocky cliff below us. We find a spot to jump. I tell the boy to go for it. The boy jumps, and his the rocks on the sloping cliff, tumbles down, and dies. I am horrified. The dead body of the boy floats to the surface to the river. I feel guilty and ashamed. I didn't jump after the boy, to try to save him or to get into the river."
"0628"	"(02/03/1997)"	"Tom From Arkansas My neighbor Anna Gates drops a man off in the alley behind our house. He walks into our house through the back door. He has a beard and is wearing sunglasses. My cousins Rich and Melissa Redding are there. The man's name may be Tom. He opens the refrigerator. He wants a beer. We have no beer. He looks for, and finds, wine and vodka. He makes himself at home. He has a cordless phone in his back pocket. He starts to walk down the basement stairs. I say to him, ""Tom, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."" He stops and comes back up the stairs. He resents my request. He starts talking about how this would never happen in Arkansas, where he is from. I feel guilty for asking him to leave. I try to explain to him that to me, he is a complete stranger. I don't know him at all. If Anna had told me something about him or if he said something about her it would be different because there would be a connection."
"0629"	"(02/03/1997)"	"Hacker's Motorcycle I'm riding my friend Bubba Hacker's motorcycle. I'm headed out to County Store, outside of Oak Valley. The motorcycle will only go about 55 miles per hour, like there is a governor on it. It is Saturday night. Country Store is closed when I arrive. There is a man who gets reprimanded by his boss regarding something about nuclear power. At one point the man asks, ""Is there something wrong with that?"""
"0630"	"(02/04/1997)"	"Hank's Pike Dies I'm walking near the Brimson campus, looking for a vehicle owned by my friend Hank Anderson. It may be a truck. My friend Norman Noman pulls up in Hank's car. We decide to go to the High View Cafe in Hank's car. I get in. Norman drives fast. The band sugar is playing on the radio, but I don't recognize the music right away. Norman asks me if I like Sugar. I say I do. We are on a road that is on the edge of a cliff. Jordan drives around a corner going way too fast. The back end of the car slides off the edge of the road, and we slide down the cliff, which is a steep rocky granite hill. We stay right side up, not flipping over. The car stops. Norman tries to drive back up the slope. The car won't drive up the slope. I get out of the car, as it is stuck in the rocks. Norman again tries to drive it out of the rocks. The car tumbles, rolling down the rock slope and lands at the bottom. Hank has a northern pike that dies. Norman and I walk back to the road. The car is stuck 60 feet below the road in a stream at the bottom of the cliff. A man who runs a store says that we won't be able to get the car out. We have to tell Hank that his northern pike is dead."
"0631"	"(02/05/1997)"	"Foreign Farmers I'm on a journey with my friends Nat Miller, Niles Zelling, Norman Noman, and others. Two of these people and I hike up a really steep grass-covered hill. There is a road going up the hill. A car drives past us going up the hill. We walk towards the road. We see a coyote on a grassy mound on top of the hill. We notice it because it howls. There are stairs where the road was, and we take the stairs up. We get to the top of the hill. There is farmland on the other side of the hill. Farmers are singing in a foreign language as they drive a big 8-wheel machine over a field of hay. The farmers leave. Norman, I, and others go into town, where we will wait for Nat and someone else that have gotten a late start on their way up the hill. I go into a store and buy a bottle of Clearly Canadian. I look at water in bottles, and notice it is expensive. Another group of college students is there. The farmers were actually foreign people, and may be part of the group. The group seems older than us. People are outside smoking. I go outside with my Clearly Canadian and pretend to play the ""air drums"". It is raining. I have a white Styrofoam cup. When I open the bottle of Clearly Canadian it foams and sprays out. I put my mouth over the top of the bottle, sucking on the foam spraying out, until the pressure is released. I am having a pretty good time with my Clearly Canadian out in the rain pretending to play the air drums. There is a skateboarder in the road. He is going fast down the middle of the road."
"0632"	"(02/05/1997)"	"Holly's White Shirt I'm in a house other than my own, with my friend Holly Lapson. There are others there who seem to be a little bit like Holly's family. I kiss Holly and immediately start to unbutton her shirt. Her shirt is a white button down shirt with the two top buttons already undone. She stops me from unbuttoning her shirt and tells me to wait until her period is done."
"0633"	"(02/06/1997)"	"Dropping Nice Pike I'm in the Big Resort Area with my sister Ramona, a man, and a woman. We're fishing in an area of small rivers. The woman catches a small northern pike. I try to help the couple get a photograph of it by holding the fish for them. I drop the fish! It is in the water. We are in the water up to my chest. I pick the fish up out of the water. It is a good-sized pike: between seven and nine pounds, I estimate. I lose the fish again, dropping it in the water. I'm using my friend Kevin Simpson's telescoping fishing rod. I feel guilty that I dropped these people's fish. I case into the trees, in the woods, and on shore. I don't do this on purpose. The handle on my rod and the crank on my reel are broken. The man tells me to not open the bail all the way."
"0634"	"(02/07/1997)"	"Shotgun Blasts UFO This is a television show that I see with my mom and sisters Ramona and Heather. As the dream goes on, I lose the knowledge that this is a television show, and it seems real: Two tiny UFO's are flying in Montana, in the country. The UFO's do a loop-de-loop and fly through the windows of a big brown house. The windows break. They fly though the woods. They go past a tree. There is a shotgun tied to the trunk of the tree pointing upwards. When a UFO goes over the gun, it fires and blows up the UFO, which is about as big as a football. I see the gun clearly: I look down the barrel. There is an investigation by a team, including a man named Ross and a lead woman, and possibly another woman. A squirrel was blown to bits by the shotgun, not a UFO. The investigation group can't tell what it is. It is all moldy and rotten. It was splattered all over by the blast. The group figures the squirrel was running full speed when the blast occurred. There is an evergreen branch that had the tips rounded off in the blast. This demonstrates that the squirrel was running full speed when it was shot. People come to guard the ""thing"", the investigation. There is one woman and three men there. They are dressed with yellow clothes on. The woman has a sword. The others may too. Two men are in a pool with others. They are arguing over tape measures. One man yells at another and says they should agree on what a yard is. This man suggests a yard is ""two inches, one-quarter inch, and three-eighths of an inch."""
"0635"	"(02/07/1997)"	"Senior At Armstrong Again I'm at senior at Armstrong High School. I go to school late at 7:45am. It is raining outside. I take the Pantown Metro Bus. It costs 30 cents. I borrow a nickel for bus fare from a woman with many facial piercings. I am taking the school bus. I think of how I am a senior and am still taking the bus, but also how I can get off the bus first then, to avoid the embarrassment of being seen taking the bus. My friend Niles Zelling is on the bus. My sister Heather is on the phone at home. She is late too. One of the people at the bus stop asks if they can store their coins in Tea Hall at Brimson. I say I think that would be okay. Our bus driver is black. We get to the place we're going, which is a destination like on the Australia trip, rather than school. I eat apricots and cookies. I eat two cookies at a time. My friends Nat Miller and Kevin Simpson are there. Kevin and I wrestle. He kicks with both legs at once! He is aggressive, and tough. I leave my jacket, brown hat, and backpack on the bus. I need to have the bus door open to get them."
"0636"	"(02/07/1997)"	"Chicken Pox Fish I'm fishing for carp with my friend Matt Yams and another woman. I catch a fish and I can't identify it. I let it go. It bites me in the leg somewhere and clings to me. I am wearing a life jacket. I'm in the water. I sink a little bit, and shake the fish off my leg. There is a residence or a workplace there. Someone is raising leeches in a wooden box. There is a chicken pox fish in with the leeches. It was a chicken pox fish that bit me. The area we were fishing is full of streams. There is an island between a braided stream area. We're in shallow muddy water. I may be using a jiggle stick with a parachute-like bobber that doesn't allow me to reel in because I'm fishing too deep."
"0637"	"(02/07/1997)"	"White Castle Black Bars I'm riding a bicycle down High Avenue with my friends Kevin Simpson and Tom Napper. They are riding on the right side of my bicycle. Then one of them switches to the left side, so there is one person on each side. We coast down a big hill. Kevin and Tom steer the bicycle. We come to a circular road, like the roundabouts in Australia. My classmate Seth Voss is there. Someone says that they are giving him ""five minutes to get home and have a sausage on the table."" This may be said to me, I'm not sure. It takes five minutes to get home from where we are. I am at a castle with Kevin and Tom. It is a white castle with black metal bars as window or doors. I climb the castle first, and make it to the tower. I sip water from a mug in the tower without picking up the mug. I don't want to make any noise."
"0638"	"(02/07/1997)"	"Bench Pressing Fruit I'm hiking up a mountain near my cousins the King's house. My cousins Henry and Avery King may be there. Parts of the mountain are snow covered. I am then with my friend Hilary Nano, brother Wally, and classmate Beth Wilder. We are in my house, which has many stories in it and is very tall. We take the stairs up. There is a red light illuminating each staircase. We go to a window. Hilary goes out and watches the sun rise. I want to go see the sun rise too. Wally has just started a load of laundry, in which the tablecloth is included. He is gone, but returns with my friend Kevin Simpson in an elevator. My friend Norman Noman is there. I bench press 195 pounds of fruit. The barbell is covered with fruit. Others are there as I do this. I am going through a jungle with the bar. Some of the fruit kills others. As the bar goes flying through the air it loses weight. We lose weight as we go."
"0639"	"(02/09/1997)"	"George Star's Super America I'm at Super America in Oak Valley with my roommate Stephen Ramos. The Super America is a bait store. We are going ice fishing. My astronomy professor George Star is the employee/owner of the store. I buy one sucker minnow and a big blue and green jig head with a feather. George is on the phone. I get a bag for the minnow and find some water. I don't put any oxygen in the bag. I twist the bag up to tie a knot and the minnow is in the twisted part of the bag. I untwist the bag and redo this. We are driving a truck that is not mine. It seems to be Stephen's truck. There is a Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler magazine on the rack in the store. I take a Hustler magazine, intending to steal it. I watch for hidden cameras as I do this. When I look at it I see it is all white paper with no photographs. It has questions in it, like a questionnaire. I leave it on a display of Coke cases. George walks out to the truck with us carrying some of our merchandise. Our classmate Ryan Walker and another man are in the truck. The second man reminds me of a classmate at Brimson, but also of the Chinese man from the movie Say Anything. I put the minnow in the back of the truck in a small metal minnow bucket. The bucket tips over and the water runs out. I think I will not have a live minnow to use. There are four jiggle sticks and rods. They are in the spare tire in the truck. We have just the essentials for fishing. Stephen and I talk with George. We ask if he does much fishing. He says no, but that it's popular. Stephen asks if it's safe to drive on the ice. George says it is safe for 1.5 hours. We are in the truck, which is like an empty Ford Bronco on the inside. Stephen is in the passenger seat. I get into the drivers seat. The vehicle is a stick shift. It is Stephen's truck. I drive on Main Street. There is construction on the road I take as it leads out of town. I back up down Slope Avenue and we wait for our friend Bubba Hacker. Bubba jumps into the bed of the truck, which is a regular cab pickup now. I think that he will be cold in the bed. I get on Main Street going out of town. The road splits. I go right, when I should go left. I swerve back to the left when I realize this. I'm driving very poorly and dangerously."
"0640"	"(02/10/1997)"	"A Big Dream I'm in Carter Church serving as altar boy for an evening mass with my friend Tim Robbins. Tim's father Kent Robbins is an usher. Tim and I are up by the piano. We walk towards the back of church. We are unsure of where to go or what to do. It is hot. Father Vance Brock is the priest. I see him in the back of church as we walk back. There are very few people in the congregation, probably no more than seven or eight in all. In the back of church are Tim's mother Mary Robbins, and another man who may be an usher. There are some one-gallon apple juice jugs on the floor. They are being rolled around or moved, maybe by my younger neighbors Alan and Ricky Broud. I move swiftly down to the entryway at the base of the stops and place the jugs on a table so they don't break. I hurry to get back up to the entrance aisle because the procession is starting. There are a few young girls carrying things in the procession ahead of us. I hurry to catch up with Tim and then slow to match his pace. We have trouble walking at the same pace: I walk slower than he does. When Tim and I get to the altar I wait for Father Vance to get there before we all genuflect. Tim genuflects as soon as we get there. We get up to our chairs. I am holding the book that Father Vance reads from. I shake and tremble as I hold the book. Father Vance says he has something that will help me with the shaking. I have a white shirt on, which his unbuttoned far and slightly falling off my right shoulder. I feel queasy. I lean and fall over, and then sit. I leave the altar area and go back to the sacristy. My aunt Nisa Redding comes back to see if I am okay. She has two tiny dogs that are less than a foot long. One of the dogs is about _ pound. It has a skinny tail, about four or five inches long. My grade school classmate, Misty Ryan, takes my place serving the mass. I see the back of her head as she slips into the robe and walks out of the sacristy. Father Vance, who seems to be my dad, comes back to the sacristy. He has some sort of incense, which may be the kind that is used in funerals, in a clump, in an incense burner. He, who is my dad at this point, says that my mom died last night. I shiver and freeze as I understand what he is saying. But he is not being literal."

Lyle has five red five-dollar chips bet. He doubles down. I have a ten showing. I line up his chip stacks. The second stack of chips is one short. I add one and make the stacks even. I flip over my down card, which is like a film case that you put a used roll of film into to get developed. The card has 10 dots on the other side: I have 20. Lyle loses the hand, and $50. He throws chips on the floor. I pick them up. I think about stealing his chips. There are other dealers there. There is one small person and two big people being held captive. They're trying to get out of the basement of the casino. The phone lines are cut. Europe explodes. I see three people riding on a cloud of smoke from the explosion. They are high above the earth, like in outer space. I'm at a place, which may be home. My mom is there. Miami Sound Machine comes on the radio. The place I'm in seems like Europe. The name of the song playing is ""Point of No Return."" I turn up the radio and dance by myself in a crowd of tiny people."

There is a slanted wall near the bed I am sitting on, which makes it difficult to sit up and eat at the same time. I'm eating eggs and bacon. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas comes in. She is wearing a dress with some fishnet stockings. My friend Anna Woods says it looks like Annie just shaved her legs."

Someone suggests we go to a movie at 4:45. I have a pimple on the left side of my nose. I want everyone to go to the movie except Annie, Esther, and I. I want to be with them so we can make out. People need to get a ride home that night or the next day, as if we are down in the Metropolis."
"0644"	"(02/12/1997)"	"Nelling's Remote I'm in a house. I've gone here to get the remote control for my friend Nate Nelling, who is somewhere else. The house is on Next Avenue in Oak Valley at the bottom of the hill near 3rd Street. A couple I don't know, who lives in the house, comes down the stairs. They notice me amidst their frolicking. I am flipping through the channels on their television. I tell them I'm here to get the remote for Nelling. Either I give the remote to them, or they want it and then I give it to them. Either way, I leave without the remote. My friend Kevin Simpson's car is parked in a crooked fashion out in the road. I am with him in it, and we drive up to the top of the hill where Next Avenue intersects 2nd Street. I say to him, ""You must have been drunk last night."" He says, ""Yup."" I then think, looking at my dad's old gray car, that Kevin did a good job parking it. It is perfectly up against the curb. At the top of the hill the vehicle we're in barely moves. It is like Kevin's ice fishing house. I'm driving my truck in down town Wilmerton with Kevin. We go by the civic center and turn left towards the courthouse. I have trouble in first gear. We are then riding bicycles. Kevin finds a $1 bill on the ground. I see something and circle around on my bicycle to pick it up. It looks like a bill. I think it's a one but it turns out to be a $5 bill. My bike may be my old red Huffy that I had as a kid. We get to the bus station. Kevin takes my bicycle and intentionally smashes it into a van. He damages the van, which is red or maroon in color. I am angry with him. I am going to make him pay for any damages. I am in the bus station and have trouble getting out. To get out one needs a ticket accompanied by something else. It is like going through customs when entering a country. I have to bay $7 to get out, to get a ticket. Seven dollars is all the money I have. I need another document. I go to a cash machine. My high school classmate Phillip Brown is there. He is clinging to my back. I try to get him off my back by smashing him up against a door, window, or wall. I take a big bite of his flesh, biting down and ripping it out. At first I thought this was his arm, but realize it was his nose. He yells in pain and is bleeding a lot. He comes after me. I am trying to get cash at an ATM machine. I take out my cash, which is silver. I take out another card, which is a young woman's card. There is a sheet of photographs that I am in. The photograph sheet has to be redone because the makeup is too heavy."

I'm fishing at in Wilmerton on Main River behind Wilmerton University. My friends Norman Noman and Hank Anderson are there. Our classmate Scott Botwright is on a big rock about 30 feet above the water fishing for muskies. Two old men are fishing from the concrete ledge farther down river. They are catching muskies. Scott, Hank, and maybe Norman jump off the big rock with their clothes on. Hank is fishing in a river using three Rapalas hooked together and a bobber. I am on a bridge with my friend Holly Lapson.

Gino wants to leave. He and I go outside and turn left, heading down 3rd Street towards the Milk Stop. A couple has left their vehicle on the north side of 3rd Street and is walking the road carrying clothes, a motorcycle, and other material goods. We walk towards the Mayor's office. Gino has a video camera. There is a police officer by the building, checking things out. Gino is drunk. There is something dead on the road. It has fur. It looks like an animal but the body isn't there. Then we see the body, which is all burned up. The lump of charred flesh turns over, and we see it's alive! It is a young black man. He has a gold watch on. He is severely injured. He seems to look better the more that I look at him. I touch his arm to make sure that I'm not dreaming. The arm is real. I am not. I want to help this young man. The police officer looks like a gimp: an incompetent person. He looks funny. He has a beard. He may look like a man in our community, Fred Buyers, except with a beard."

Later, out diving, we look at the coral. The island may move. I am by the Main River in Wilmerton. Dead people are there. They are visible to me, but not to the living. I am dead or invisible. We are in an attic area, which is what the coral reef has changed into. It is like a shed. We pretend to sleep when Stephen comes. There is no ____ (?) for me. Stephen's paycheck is there. There is a letter for my classmate Queen Billman."

I think I should change the movement of my tongue from a sucking motion to a licking motion. A fire is burning. One doctor has cheated with the other doctor's wife. I am masturbating in my mom's bedroom at home. I ejaculate on a green washcloth. The place where the two doctors are, and where we had sex, may be a farmhouse. It is on fire."

We have to leave by 10:05 am because Darlene needs to be somewhere. Darlene needs a pipe so she can justify, which means to show, to someone that we weren't smoking marijuana, only tobacco. I ask Kevin for his corncob pipe. He takes it out of his dark blue jeans. My mom or Grandma is cooking eggs with yolks. People eat them. I want some before I go. I eat some eggs in a hurry on my way up to the bathroom on the second floor. Hank has two little snakes. He is appalled by the idea of feeding them to his bigger snake. There is snow on the ground. There is a zip lock bag of severed fingers in the back of the car, which is a station wagon. My brother Wally is working with food a lot where he is. Liver parts are being served for the vegetarian dish that night. There are apricot jam and oatmeal raisin cookies for dessert. I take a cookie and eat it."

I am handed the keys from the man's car, which is a BMW, to go to town and get bait. I go outside. The car is parked on a steep slope. Some people wave at me from the next hilltop. I think the car is stuck at first. The people that were on the next hill are then next to me. They include my mom and others. They point out that I can back the car down the slope, turning it, and come out a different way to get on the road. I do this. There is a lake at the bottom of the hill that isn't frozen. I drive into a town that I am not too familiar with. I am then on a bicycle. I stop to buy stamps at the post office. I don't have a shirt on. Then I put a shirt on."

I am wide open in the lane. I understand Tony's statement to mean that I can't be any more wide open and I need to score. He is using sarcasm, saying that if I don't pound the basket home something is wrong. When I hear him we all burst out laughing. We fall to the floor and roll around in laughter: it's hilarious!"

There is some poisonous cottage cheese there. My classmate Monique Thorble is out of breath at the football game. I give her CPR, including chest compressions. Another woman and I give Monique chest compressions as we walk her down the crowded stairs. There is a prisoner with handcuffs there. He walks back to his institution docilely instead of trying to flee. He must be out on parole or something. I leave Monique because her boyfriend is there. The stairs are crowded with a group of little kids. I try to intimidate the kids by standing and looking mean."

There is a photograph of Dan's son Tim Zelling, who is my friend. I think the photograph is my grade school classmate Tim Robbins."
"0660"	"(02/24/1997)"	"$18.35 To Rent Fargo I'm outside a hideout with my friend Kevin Simpson. We're on roller-skates picking up coins. People come out of the hideout. We roller skate quickly down my alley. I hide behind my neighbor Alvin Bround's bar. A fat gangster and a couple of fat women come down the alley. One of the fat women's names is Smalon. She is huge and fat! Another fat woman comes up by the car. I stand up and hit her with a good-sized log. She throws a log at me back, and I dodge it. My neighbor Greg Olson may be the gangster. He scurries along the fence line between Broud's property and the house next to it, fleeing. Smalon gets in the back seat of the car on the driver's side. I run. It is difficult for me to run, and I move slowly. I want to get out of sight. I may become the fat women named Smalon or Smahon. I am at the intersection of Hill Avenue and 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I roll the fat lady into the yard of the red house on the Northeast corner of the intersection. I want to get her to the corner of the yard to nobody will see her. I may cover her up with a tarp, trying not to make it obvious. The fat lady and the car roll down the hill in Alvin Broud's yard and across Hill Avenue. I think the car will smash into a wall on the other side of the street, but instead it rolls up a driveway. I go to a fancy movie place to rent the movie Fargo with my friend Holly Lapson. It costs $18.35 to rent it! I walk away, thinking it is outrageous to pay that much for a movie rental! I am roller-skating in a Mall with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I pick up coins. It seems to be a familiar mall."

Something happens with sodium chloride and sugar: maybe burning the man's penis with the sodium chloride. Something is happening with pop stars. Janet Jackson's music video ""Control"" is on. Something may happen with a mean dog."

"0664"	"(02/28/1997)"	"Tickets For Two Bucks I'm with my friends Niles Zelling and Tom Napper in a car. Tom says tickets to the Red Hot Chili Peppers are only $2. We're outside an old brick building. There is a radio station in the basement on the left side of the building. My classmate from Brimson Al Gurney is there. Niles tells us that he should have said or done something. We're in my mom's station wagon. I wipe fog off the inside of the windshield with a shirt."
"0665"	"(02/28/1997)"	"Delivering Tires I'm riding a bicycle delivering newspapers. I decide to quit this job delivering newspapers. As I ride up to the first house my bike keeps pulling leftward, and is difficult to steer. I take off a tire and bring it to the door, hanging it on the doorknob. I forget to leave the inner tube, so I go back and leave it on the doorknob. The tire and the tube are the newspaper. A little girl is at the door. She may be scared of me. I ride to a gas station. I'm putting air into the tires of my brown Toyota Camry. My grade school friend Todd Hinz is there with his brother Chad. Someone introduces us like we are strangers, but we know each other. I say hi and we talk. Todd is working at a printing business in Wilmerton. He tells me of a certain kind of printer or printing. I am familiar with it. I say printing is Wilmerton's biggest industry. As I am trying to put air into the tire, the air spout collapses and recedes back into the tire. My bicycle now has low air pressure in both tires. I tell Todd to look me up when we're home. I tell him it will be under my mom's name, Natalie Redding, in the phone book. I am near the city of Hillston. I'm trying to find a route back to town. I am in a very wooded area on the outer edges of town. There is a river there and some hills or mountains. I am lost. My classmates Kyle Mendelson and Kelsey Bobber help me to an underground tunnel. I saw them and decided to yell. They wouldn't have helped me if I didn't yell. They have a torch. They lead me to the house of my academic advisor Mary Monroe. My roommate takes me down some stairs. He says that an acquaintance of mine, Mary Phelps, has not given up on me."
"0666"	"(03/01/1997)"	"Mistaken Bass I'm at a lake. Someone is fly-fishing. I get the rod and start casting. The lake is rectangular. I cast about 20 yards out but realize I could have gotten it there a lot easier by going to the opposite shoreline. The cast landed about five yards from the other shore. The big yellow fly I am using is very near the other shore. A fish hits the fly. It is a huge largemouth bass, which is fighting well. I think it looks like about 10 pounds! My mom is holding the rod. I scramble to grab the net. My dad is there, and picks up the fish without a net. I'm worried it might get off the line, but it doesn't. I hold the fish. It is not a very big fish, maybe a pound and a half."
"0667"	"(03/02/1997)"	"1-800-Arizona I go into a dorm room. My friend Hilary Nano's roommate Annette Gollum is sleeping there. I have several floppy disks I want to give or do something with. I go out of the room, and into Hilary's room, where my high school friend Gino Teavor is in a bed. A friend of his, named Kari, may be there. Gino and I talk about spring break and Arizona. There is paint on a wall or ceiling. Someone is doing back flips on this paint. Gino says he and his friend are using thumbtacks to keep track of each other. I think that's sad: they're all tied up. I tell Gino to call 1-800-Arizona."

He falls on his face into the water with rocks in it. There is garbage, litter, on a rock. There are houses. There is a plane with the letters KHanson written on it. The plane almost crashes into pine trees, but avoids them."
"0669"	"(03/02/1997)"	"Shunned By Marianne Stash I am in a class of my psychology professor Marianne Stash. I stay after class and talk with Marianne a bit. I really like her: she is a good and smart professor. I tell her my aunt Willow Redding is a clinical psychologist, and ask her how many years of schooling it takes to be a clinical psychologist. She says it takes a long time. She isn't as interested in me and what I have to offer, as I am interested in who she is and what she has to offer. She leaves. I spend a long time trying to get my books into my backpack. This takes much more time than it should. The janitor woman turns the lights out when I am still in the building. I leave."

"0672"	"(03/05/1997)"	"Carrying A Pig Head I'm outside a building. Inside the building are my classmate Mark Helmut and my sister Heather. Mark wants to fight with me over a dessert. My friend Terry Foss is in the building. I don't want to fight Mark, and get tangled up with either Heather or Terry. But he wants to fight me, so I break free of the disdain from Terry and Heather and fight him. I have the head of a pig, which has hair on it. I'm carrying it around by the hair. There may be other pigs around. There is a little baby that is crying. A parent of the baby is there. The pig head and I are in the alley of my neighbors the Robbin's block. There are dogs in the alley that are barking."
"0673"	"(03/05/1997)"	"Fish Cleaning Boat I'm in Alaska with my friend Norman Noman on a fishing boat. We're cleaning fish. There is little or no time to look at the beauty of the land. Norman and I are swimming. I have a knife. There is a lot of vegetation in the water. I see and come close to white-colored flashes in the water. Norman says these flashes are all muskies. I hear a very loud noise. Norman says it was a bald eagle. I don't see the eagle. The water gets shallower. It flows into a storm drain and into a ditch. A couple of small fish and a good-sized northern pike swim into the ditch. I go over towards them and they swim back into the shallow water. I throw my knife at them, but don't hit them. I'm at my friend Nate Nelling's house. Nate is not there, but his mother is. I tell my roommate Stephen Ramos not to touch Nate's father Walt's new motorcycle in the garage. There are some fishing poles there."

My high school semantics teacher, Jerry Brock is the teacher. There is a man playing a game on the computer before class starts. I shake my head no to indicate that this isn't an acceptable thing. Jerry Brock isn't fond of it either. Jerry starts talking about tests, presentations, and projects. I am scared: I have a lot of work to do already. I don't have time for more major projects. My grade school and high school classmate Sonya Nittles is there, looking as aloof as ever. I'm playing basketball with my high school classmate Aaron Meyers and others. I am getting fouled a lot and I whine about it. I decide to stop whining and play tough even though the play is dirty."
"0675"	"(03/05/1997)"	"This is Our Home I'm finally at home. I'm leaving for the Big Resort Area soon: today I think. I need to be up in that area. There is a red sports car in the street. One of the Burns girls from my neighborhood is in the passenger seat, and a man is in the driver's seat. There is another Burns girl, who may be the third girl in the family, and the oldest, in the house. She walks over to the desk by the telephone and picks up a set of keys. Something is wrong with her, and maybe with the Burns family. My mom has a new black bicycle. Our car was recently hit at Sears. My grade school secretary Angie Sacks comes in the house. She has a problem. My mom is upset with the Burns' and Angie. I get involved. I walk over to Angie and stand right next to her to physically intimidate her. She reprimands me for trying to do that. I back off, apologizing, and give her room. I yell at Angie with very strong feelings. There is anger, confusion, chaos, and indecision. I ask Angie to leave. I argue with my mom and the other kids. I tell her that this is our home, our family, and that we love each other. I tell my mom I'm feeling strong resistance to letting anyone in. I am in my room, then, at home. I am going to be late getting to the Big Resort Area because it's after 4:30 pm and I can't call to insure the truck until the next day. I pack my bags. I'm going to do laundry. My dad is at the base of the staircase yelling hysterically. He asks where everyone is. He yells that the purple box on his containers is empty! It needs to have writing in, and his wife Lisa Lawson usually does that. He feels neglected and helpless. He needs caring for. I yell at him furiously, telling him, ""You need to calm down!"" He does calm down. He counts, like counting to 10. He is shaking and trembling. I hug him. We cry. I cry like I am a little boy. [I awake from this dream with a song in my head. The words go: ""And if I call..."". I remember the tune, low and droning, and then high pitched.]"

"0677"	"(03/07/1997)"	"Chicks With Dicks There are people stuck in a house. One is stuck in the attic, and another in the basement. The stairs to the basement are cut off and boarded up. One man commits suicide so he can be with his dead relatives. On the second floor of the house are a living man and dead people that look alive. The living man has a shovel and he uses it to try to hit the head of a dead man after the dead man throws a pie in his face. This works. I'm in a bedroom with my cousin Anna Strange. We are engaging in sexual activity. She checks to make sure she isn't having her period. She isn't. She says it was bad this month. She pats some toilet paper on her vagina and then tastes what is on the toilet paper. She says it's okay. She and I are wearing underwear. She crawls on top of me, and under the sleeping bag. I then have female genitals, and Anna has male genitals. I take her erect penis and put it in my vagina. I move her hips at first because she doesn't get the hang of it. Then she does get the hang of it. This feels good to me. She ejaculates quickly. I am not even close to orgasm. She cries, feeling guilt and shame. There is semen and secretions all over. She then has a vagina and I touch her. There is semen everywhere. We need to clean up. I take something that looks like a rag, but it is a washcloth."

"0679"	"(03/07/1997)"	"Kate Francis In A Towel I see my classmate Kate Francis in the lounge in my dorm. I go in. She is wrapped in a towel. I sit next to her. There is a movie on the television. We talk a bit. I don't want to seem too concerned about sitting distance, so I sit right next to her so we're touching. I flirt with her. She leans over, and I put my arm around her. We kiss. She withdraws after several moments. She asks me to go get coffee with her. I tell her I won't because it keeps me up at night. She says that it keeps her up too, and that she vomits to rid her system of the caffeine."
"0680"	"(03/07/1997)"	"Brain Vincent's Kitchen I'm at a sawmill. My mom is driving a car that I am in, with others. We're pulling a trailer. The road is narrow, and we go over a narrow bridge. We go slowly. At one point I think we're going off the side of the bridge. The bridge is made of plywood and has no railings. We are not in a car anymore. We go through a tunnel. My mom says that the key to the tunnel is to slide, and she demonstrates how. I am in a room. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. My cousin Anna Strange is there, and has food in her teeth. A man from my paleontology class named Ian is there. He has a turkey drumstick with his name on it. His name on the drumstick is W____ W____ W____ ( I forget the name but the initials are W.W.W.). A classmate from Brimson is there, named Hunter. He says his only name is Hunter. There is a tunnel that looks and smells like plastic tubing. People are supposed to go ion it. IT starts out funnel-like. There is facial hair in the funnel part of the tunnel. I'm in the kitchen at home. I'm eating dinner with my mom and my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I talk about why I'd rather not do something (I forget what it is that I'd rather not do). I say this because I have a routine and I need to avoid stress so I stay in the routine. The routine I talk about is my way of doing homework at Brimson: the way I block time to allow for everything. I say Annie's mother was really rude to me the last time I saw her. Annie says that her mother has changed. There is a new drug. My brother Wally may be on the drug, or knows about it, my mom says. She talks about how Wally is doing. I pick up a chocolate frosted yellow cupcake and walk towards the bathroom. Annie goes into the bathroom with me. She pulls down her pants and boxers shorts, sits down on the toilet, and starts urinating. Urine and feces start coming up out of the drain of the sink! The feces are white like old dog feces left to dry in a yard. The mixture is frothy and bubbly in the sink. Annie says her head hurts. I pat her head. I flush the toilet, which has already been flushing. Some urine and feces get on the floor. I pick them up and put them back in the sink, and rinse my hands. The bathroom is tilting from side to side. The water from the toilet overflows and splashes on the floor as the bathroom tilts. The room we are in is like my uncle Brian Vincent's kitchen in Iowa. My cupcake eating was messy. It was a chocolate cupcake that crumbled into the sink. Brian has an 11 person International House in Iowa. Things in the kitchen are stuck to the floor as it tilts."

I ordered them but didn't realize I was doing so. My friends Holly Lapson, Jill Banks, and other biology majors are there. I ask them if they need a new textbook. I have all these new books and no use for them. The group makes a circle to play duck duck gray duck. My friend Esther Thurman sits by me. I am talking with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. There is a man there who is my friend that is saying to Annie and I that we are going to hook up in a sexual encounter. I disregard what he is saying though I know that I would hook up with her."

Heather and I have garden hoses. Heather's water spray is spread out like a sprinkler. My spray is in a straight stream: I have adjusted the nozzle. Anna comes to the door. Heather and I spray our family, who run in the alley in their swimsuits. My sister Ramona, brother Wally, and my parents are there. I don't remember seeing Wally. I spray the family. I time the spray so I spray just a bit of water, and it is aimed ahead of the person. I hit my mom with a nice shot, and laugh. My dad is young, and has a dark beard. The whole family is younger. We decide where to eat. I think of Subway, but we decide the Grease Pit. We get nine burgers. I order two. We get one or no orders of French fries. It costs $90.99. My mom is going to write a check. I object to this outrageous price! My friend Matt Yams is working and he checks the price. It is 14 dollars and change. It is their mistake. Matt tells us he keeps a journal in the bathroom in which he writes bad things about some of his employees. He says he called the other day to see how I was doing. He is planning to go to Boundary Town for the fishing opener. He says he's fishing for himself this year. I am about to tell him about my job in the Big Resort Area."

The girls may be the woman's daughters. I talk to the woman in her office. At first I close the door, but then I open it because it doesn't matter if its' closed. I tell her who I am, what I do, that I graduated two years ago, and that I go to Brimson. I tell her that I had come before to do classroom observations for my Educational Psychology class, and I'm back to do more observations. I ask if she'll write me a pass. She asks me in whose room I'll be observing. I say Mr. Hacker, Mr. Grizzy, and others: whoever doesn't mind me being there. She says that Mr. Hacker will mind that I'm there. I tell her that he won't mind my presence. We disagree."

We were going to go to Wally's bank, but then we'd need to go to my bank too to deposit the money, so we just went there to cash the check in the first place. We are driving by very small square houses. The area is in poor repair. There is a large brown wooden house off the ground, as if it were being moved. We are in the Big Resort Area. There is a moose. My mom sees it as we drive past. I see it behind the car. We then turn, and I see an elk."

We turn right onto 1st Street, and then turn left on Park Avenue and pick up our friend Niles Zelling at the Hill's house. The guys tell stories about the time Max had sex with a woman, while seeing my friend Tina Totts at the same time. The woman's name was Bobby L. Mathers. I recognize the name as ""The Beaver"", and I laugh. Niles gets in the car. He talks about how his sister used the word ""nigger"", and behaves as if he is angry with her. I remember recently when I reprimanded him for saying the same thing. He was trying to convince others and I that he wouldn't use that word."

My classmate Jackie Hunter is there. I don't recognize her at first. She says something about going up to the crowd by the stage. I realize it is she, and run towards the stage, past her. Simon and Garfunkel are about 30 years old, which I think is old. They are pale with dark hair. They sing old covers of popular songs. I am then with Jackie in a bed. We may be near a highway. We lie there and talk. It is dark."

He wants me to bring them from the first hole to the green on the sixth hole. He tips me $1.50. It costs a little bit to play. He gives me money to play too. I go inside and record the money information on a sheet and give the fee for golfing to a lady. I look for a bicycle or something to ride to the golf course. I'm in the basement. The path descending to the basement is covered up with plastic sleds. I get some vague directions from my boss. I get on a three-wheeler and go. My friend Ivory Alshire is there. She runs along with me, and later gets on the back of the three-wheeler. We go near a school. I look over a wall and see what I think is a golf course. A lady tells me the course is down the road. The place I look at has brownish grass. I ask the lady if it is more or less than a mile. A woman sees me and recognizes me. She taught me when I was little. She calls me by my name. I tell her she has the wrong person: that I'm from the United States. We are in Australia. She says she knows I'm from the United States. She tells me I'm from Wilmerton Armstrong High School. I'm amazed that she knows me! I go into a house of horrors. It is not scary, but is interesting. I get out of the place before Ivory. I see my friend Kathy Branch, from high school. I lie down and act as if I don't see her, until she comes near and says hi. I'm wearing a wife beater and my bush hat. I put my hand over my stomach, where the most of my fat would be. She says hi. I get up and we talk. There is another woman there from Armstrong too. Kathy says her name, but we don't talk to her. I walk and talk with Kathy for a while. She is with an older man, who is about 25 years old. I come to some big tents. There is a large green canvas tent that is blowing over. It looks like the tent is blowing away. A little tent is being pulled up and blown too. In it are a bunch of little stands. At first I think I want the big tent to pull the little tent off its stakes. Then I'm in back of the little tent, pulling items out of the stands. I pull out two large packages. I know there are dead bodies in each package. I then pull out a box with writing on it. It says something like ""You can't pull this box out"". The box looks like the white boxes that the library gets its trash bags in. I pull out boxes of books and fruit. People help me save the stuff in the tent."

Someone else and I each grab a bag of cans to take to room F. Then we are on a bus or a plane. I see some open seats so I go there and lie down, but I can't get comfortable. I move because people come to sit in the seats I am laying in. My boss Carly Lunch is there."

I am not able to keep my lure out of the weeds. I can't fish. We're on the east end of the lake. We swim to the second boat landing, which I don't ever use. We get out of the water and walk along the shore back to the main boat landing."

Other holes are about a foot in diameter. I walk by the area. My dad is there. He has just hit a ball and now he digs up a clump of grass with his club. I toss a ball up and hit it casually. It lands between my dad and another man. I'm in Forest Village looking at the bluffs."

I see quite a few cars. There is a black hearse on the south side of church. I hug my sister Heather when she gets out of the car. I walk into church with my family. The Robbins' go home. I think it is okay that they do. I am surprised they even showed up in the first place! Kent was wearing a turquoise sweater. We walk in the south door of the church and find a place to sit near the back on the left side. I say to my mom I don't want to have this funeral if I am still living: I want to be dead first. I feel pretty good, not like I am dying. The minister is there. I raise my hand and walk forward to the front of the church to speak. I am going to speak to the congregation. I feel very strongly that I don't want to have a funeral if I'm not dead."
"0697"	"(03/20/1997)"	"Gun With Scope I am with others. I have a gun with a scope on it. I am on the step of a building. I look through the scope on the gun at cars that drive by. I am looking for something to give me a reason to shoot."
"0698"	"(03/21/1997)"	"3 Dollar Australian Coin I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson. This area seems like Australia. We're on a lake next to Trout Lake. A couple is there and asks us how to get out of the lake. I say, ""The only way out is to portage. It's a hard portage but you'll like it."" We have a choice of buying coyote or Squirt pop. We are in a little bay. There is a river flowing in. There is a beautiful pond and a stream flowing in. A person can see their reflection in them. The water is very cold. Kevin and I walk in the stream. I have on my Nike cross-trainers. In the pond I see what I think is a school of eels. It turns out to be a school of suckers. I have been sucking on leeches. I spit them out of my mouth. There is a nicely cut area of green lawn with cement sidewalk and buildings, like a courtyard. There are pop machines there. A person on roller blades goes by. There is a skateboard in the corner by the pop machine. A boy comes to get the skateboard: it is his. I find three pennies, a $2 coin, and a $3 coin. A psychology professor I know from Brimson named Kari Cutting comes to me dressed in black and on crutches, to ask for directions."
"0699"	"(03/21/1997)"	"Morning Jokers My friends Kevin Simpson and Bubba Hacker pull up in my driveway at home. It is morning. They are driving Bubba's truck. They are in the truck listening to a song before they come in my house. They are in a joking mood. There is ice cream in our freezer."
"0700"	"(03/21/1997)"	"Waiting For Jackie I'm standing outside of Mason Cafeteria at Brimson. I look at a clock. I am waiting for a woman. A person I have a crush on, Jackie Hunter, and her friends walk by. They ask me if I'm waiting for them. I say no, it's a long story. I ask their names. I introduce myself. I have trouble hearing Jackie say her name. She has a visible red rash above her shirt line on her chest."
"0701"	"(03/23/1997)"	"Sex With Fat Black Woman I'm with a fat black woman. She is naked. I'm trying to touch her vagina but she keeps her legs closed. Gradually, she opens up and lets me touch her. I tell her I'm going to give her cunnilingus. She gives me fellatio. Two men are there watching. They may be my friends Nat Miller and Tom Napper."
"0702"	"(03/23/1997)"	"My Paper on Liza Minikel I'm in the Brimson field house on an exercise bicycle. The woman crew coach comes and gets me to go on the ergs. My grade school principal Candy Bevner is there. She has just graded a paper I wrote. I see that I scored a 97 on the paper. She says that is pretty well. I ask her what she personally thinks about the content of the paper. She refuses to answer. The paper is about a crush I had on my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, and how she rejected me. Both Liza and Candy are there, and I talk with them about the paper and other things."
"0703"	"(03/24/1997)"	"Secret Disco Ballroom I leave a dorm room quickly for the bathroom to take a shower. A man I know from Brimson named Shannon runs after me and bursts into the shower. He thinks I stole his green shirt. I show him it is my green J-Crew shirt. Then I punch him in the face a few times. There is a party in Wonkers Hall at Brimson. I am in that dorm taking a shower in a room that is open. There bathtub is there, but there is no shower curtain. People can see me, and I am self-conscious of this. My classmate Todd who is gay is there. He says, ""Oohhh"" and reacts when he sees me naked. My friend Bubba Hacker comes in. The party has been busted, and the police are coming. Everyone leaves quickly. I take my time getting dressed. I grab my gloves, hat, and backpack, and then leave. I am going to wear a towel around my waist, over my pants. I go out into the hallway. I see my old roommate's girlfriend Natasha Lens and her friend, wearing bikinis. People are trying to get out of the dorm using stairways, doors, hallways, and other passages. Not all the people make it out. I make it out. People open doors for me. I'm going down hallways like those in Holy Middle School. Some of the route I take is clandestine. The tunnels end up at a disco ballroom, where we are free from the chase of the police."
"0704"	"(03/24/1997)"	"Elk Antlers I am on a trail with others. I find some great elk antlers. I leave by the trail to pick up on the way back. Later, others are bringing them back for me because they think I forgot or wasn't returning for them. I feel bad, because I was going to return for them. There was no need for others to bring them back."
"0705"	"(03/27/1997)"	"Snowball In Helmet Ear Hole I'm on a street corner. My roommate Stephen Ramos and friend Nat Miller are there. I am losing my sight. There is a cold front that moves in from Corn Town to Woodland, Nat says. This means that my sight is leaving. I think about restorative operations. I also think of trying to see even though I'm going blind: just ignoring the illness. A cute woman walks by. She reminds me of my co-worker Megan's friend named Courtney. A man is standing with us. He looks at us, indicating his interest in the woman. We all think she is attractive. Stephen throws a snowball at her. It hits her in the lower back portion of her neck. I have a helmet on. It is black with holes cut out for my eyes, mouth, and ears. The cute woman throws a snowball that smashes me in the ear hole of my helmet. The police come to see what is going on. I try to explain we were just joking around with the snowballs. The police take Stephen away. The woman and I get along well."
"0706"	"(03/27/1997)"	"Sex in a Bathroom I'm in the upstairs bathroom at my Redding grandparents farmhouse with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We are engaging in sexual activity. I touch her vagina and give her cunnilingus. The family that lives on the corner of 1st Street and Next Avenue in Oak Valley is moving. I grab two garbage cans of stuff and put them away, and then I run back upstairs to the bathroom. We don't have much time. We have sex. I try to make her have an orgasm. We are rushed. We hear voices outside the door, which is locked. I didn't want to have genital sex with her because I come to climax quickly without her reaching orgasm, but since we are running out of time we have sex. She doesn't have an orgasm: there is not enough time or stimulation."
"0707"	"(03/27/1997)"	"Imaginary Jens and Natasha I'm in a room with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, roommate Stephen Ramos, and others. The room is a dorm room on the Brimson campus. Everyone is forced to exit the room. There are amorous feelings between Annie and I. We, now including my friends Esther Thurman, Kevin Simpson, and Tony Kramer leave with others. Some people are drunk. We go through some tunnels. I lead the way. It is like the basement of the stairway in Billings Hall that isn't used much. It is also like the basement in the Green House. My clean laundry is in the Green House. I think I'll get it later. I go into a dorm. My friends Sherman Andrews and Lance Drift are there, talking about a beating or riot that went on because they were kicked out. They name several prominent Brimson people and say they are going back to get them. The building we're in is a hotel with stairs like the top floor of Social Science Hall. I go too far up the stairs, and then find the right floor. I can't find my room. My friend Darlene Miller is on the phone talking with someone about hot tub or movie plans. She is very particular. My room key says number 109. I find my room. There are many numbers on my room door, including 109. I open the door. People are having sex! I hesitate to go in, but do because I want to know whom it is. It is my old roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens. There are several of each of them, and they are having sex in different parts of the room! I pick up a chair and throw it over the bunk bed. It lands on the other side without hitting them. I rip off a ladder that is attached to the bed horizontally. Natasha sits up. She has read hair. I run the ladder at them, but they are not there: it is my imagination."
"0708"	"(03/28/1997)"	"I Receive A Gun A man gives me a handgun. I have to learn when to use it and when not to. We drive in his car to an abandoned building. My job is to get away from the building. He puts the gun in the pocket of my wind pants. I go down an alley with many strangers in it. I am wary of them, but none of them harm me. I go up stairs and down hallways. I am trying to get away from that area. I go out onto a roof. Storm troopers are there. I find a ladder down and start climbing down quickly. I realize for every word I speak I have to pay 25 cents. I have already spoken a lot and I think I'm running out of money in my checking account. I am near the house on the northwest corner of the intersection of Next Avenue and 1st Street in Oak Valley. Others are with me. We walk down the sidewalk on the block of 1st Street on the north side. I find many pennies."
"0709"	"(03/29/1997)"	"Melvin Dahlheimer's Turkey I'm eating dinner with people. My friend Melvin Dahlheimer is there and has two big pieces of turkey on his plate. He takes a while to eat them. My high school girlfriend Darla Robertson is there. I point her out to a man I am eating with and tell him we had a relationship in 9th grade."
"0710"	"(03/28/1997)"	"Defeating Erica Fronz I'm in a garage with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and others. It seems like the television show the Wonder Years. A black man and woman are there. They argue about when and where he can touch her. My friend Kevin Simpson may be there. A killing man is coming. I look for ways out of the garage. I try to slide under a garage door. There is snow there, and it is a tight fit. The killing man arrives. He looks like my friend Hank Anderson's friend Ryan. I don't try to run. I have a skateboard deck as a weapon. My classmate Erica Fronz is with Ryan, or Ryan may become Erica. I hit him with the skateboard deck as he approaches. Erica Fronz is there. I hold her easily, and defeat them."
"0711"	"(03/30/1997)"	"Priest Takes Porn My experimentation class from Brimson is at Carter School. My grade school classmates Sonya Nittles and Jerry Kasper are in it. I am late for class. My schoolmates John Handley and his brother Mike are outside at recess when I go by. Their ball strays near me as I go by, and I toss it back to them. Sonya and Jerry are mentally slow. I play with Sonya's hair. They leave the classroom. My high school friend Tiny Combs is there. My junior high classmate Sam Taylor is the full-time janitor here. I am then dust-mopping the place. I mop the lower stairs and the lower level. There are three big blue garbage cans, like recycling bins at Brimson. There is a lot of pornography in two of the bins. The Kindergarten area is messy: shoes are everywhere on the floor. I priest comes and takes some of the pornography and leaves. I want to take some of it too."
"0712"	"(03/31/1997)"	"Woman Pilot Crashes My friend Fran Susse gives birth to two fawns. The 24-hour period before the birth was interesting. I am flying in a very small plane. I pray the prayer for automobiles for the plane, substituting plane words for car words. The pilot of the plane is a woman. The plane slowly goes down and crashes in a cornfield. It is the pilot's fault, because she took a short cut. I am unhurt. The wing of the plane was knocked off. I am outside the plane on the ground. The body of the plane is a caterpillar-like structure, enclosed in steel bars. I go and help people out of the plane. The pilot whines, saying she needs to be able to fly again. She forgot or ignored a security check. She got into a situation where she had to restart or turn off or on an engine, but she couldn't do this because she was afraid the other engine would fail."
"0713"	"(03/31/1997)"	"Mark Long's Funeral I'm with my mom and we stop in front of our house to pick something up. We are going to my friend Mark Long's funeral. My mom drives through our neighbor's driveway. We go through alleys down tot where the funeral is, by the Hill Lodge in Oak Valley. I point out to my mom that I know everyone's car that is in his or her driveway when we go by. I am a pallbearer. They give us very brief instructions before the ceremony. My grade school friends Gino Teavor and Jerry Kasper are also pallbearers. On the way up to view the body people are passing a tiny live bird around in their hands. I get it, holding it with its legs between my index finger and thumb. Then I pass it on. I see Mark. His body jolts, jerks, and moves like he is alive. The funeral director adjusts his body in the casket. I touch Mark and say goodbye. I think that even though he moved he is dead. I sit back down after walking the wrong way. The director quickly slides the casket off the stand. The pallbearers aren't ready to grab the casket. The casket falls and the front hits the floor. This is embarrassing to Mark and his family. We pick it up. I grab the front left side of the casket. We carry it high up, near our shoulders. Some of the pallbearers complain that they were not given enough instruction, preparation, or equipment to do the job well. We carry the casket out. We make a wrong turn up some stairs. After the funeral director tells us we did so, we back down and go to the left, down some stairs. We go through a tunnel. Firefighters are hurrying in. I yell for them to watch out. I say, ""Heads Up!"", and they look out."
"0714"	"(03/31/1997)"	"Moving Casket Through Government I am with people. We are trying to take a casket into a big government building that is filled with government people. When we do this, we need to then do or get something and then get the casket back out of the building."
"0715"	"(03/31/1997)"	"Pushy Prospective Firstyear My roommate Stephen Ramos and I are in our room. He is sleeping. Our room is in our current dorm, but it is down the hall where my friends Fran and Anna's room is. A male student opens the door. I am surprised. I go out and close the door behind me. The student is with a prospective first year student and her mother. The girl opens the door to look in the room. I close it again and tell her I'll show her another room, not ours. A classmate I have a crush on, Jackie Hunter, walks by, going to a room. I say to the girl, ""Stop it"". I didn't mean for this to sound like I was speaking to Jackie, because I was speaking to the girl so she wouldn't open the door again. Jackie is going to study in a room across the hallway from ours. She looks different. She has dreadlock-like hair. My friends Nat Miller and Norman Noman are there. A woman named Bola is her roommate. I show the girl a room down the hall, (which is actually where our room is)."
"0716"	"(04/03/1997)"	"Bobby's Hard to Talk To I'm in Meyers Hall at Brimson. My classmate Jackie Hunter is there with some friends of hers. It is early in the evening. My friend Kevin Simpson, roommate Stephen Ramos, and others may be there. I try to talk to Jackie and her friends, trying to strike up a conversation. She doesn't say anything back. Her friend says, ""Bobby is sometimes hard to talk to."" Her friend is referring to Jackie. Jackie smiles when her friend says this, and she looks at her friend. It is nighttime. We walk down to the corner of Brighton and High Avenues. Jackie turns left and goes east down High Avenue. We walk across Brighton. Kevin hits on one of Jackie's friends."
"0717"	"(04/03/1997)"	"Shaving I am shaving. I cut myself a lot. I have a lot of hair on my neck. It is early in the evening. I still want to go somewhere, which is odd because I usually shave right before I go to bed."
"0718"	"(04/03/1997)"	"Smoking Cigarettes I have a green pack of cigarettes. My friend has a pack too. There are 12 in a pack. I smoke one. I don't inhale at first, but then I do inhale. I decide to throw the rest of the pack away. It is hard to do: the cigarettes are addictive. I throw the pack away. My friend has through his pack away too."
"0719"	"(04/04/1997)"	"31 Ram Skis I'm in Vail, Colorado, with friends, to ski. I'm putting on my ski gear outside by a snow bank where two women are sitting. I have a bottle of Captain Morgan rum in my left pocket. The pocket has a hole in it. I take the rum out and put it in my right pocket. I see my right pocket has a hole in it too. The holes are so big the bottle easily slips out. I get ""31 Ram"" skis, my brother Wally tells me when I go into the ski rental shop. They are for skiing tracks. There are some garbage bins there. Others and I are supposed to take the bins somewhere, fill them up, and bring them back. I walk over with my bin to fill it. The guy from who I am supposed to fill my bin has an empty bin. He may be a Brimson student I know from intramural basketball. I fill my bin up at the place and I dump it."
"0720"	"(04/04/1997)"	"Spitting Gas I'm crossing a muddy river with a bicycle. The river is coming from melt water. I slip and fall, almost going in a deep part of the river. I get up, and hang onto the mountain bike with one hand. I slip again. The bottom of the river is slippery. I struggle to get to the side of the river, and I do. There is a stairway with metal pegs sticking out. I can use the pegs to climb. I'm in a room with two men. The room is sealed off. The door is locked. The room is a puzzle or a maze. There are a couple switches on the wall. One of the switches released a harmful liquid that drips down through the stairs. I find a switch that released a gas. There is a lighter switch above or below this one. I find two sticks of dynamite that look like little red paint cans, or flame cans for camping. I find three lighters. I place a stick of dynamite in front of the locked door. I then spit out of my mouth a trail of gasoline leading away from the dynamite. My friend Niles Zelling has a book of matches. People have been approaching, which has made me hurry when doing this. Niles lights a match and tosses it on the gas. The gas ignites the dynamite, which blows the door open. Two men were coming near there. They go into the new room with us. We take all the extra supplies we have found. In the next room I find some wine bottles that have our homemade wine in them. I feel good about getting us inside the room."
"0721"	"(04/04/1997)"	"White and Pink Stuffed Dogs I'm in the basement of a house watching television. A husband to the family living in the home comes home. He says something about how he hasn't seen me in a long time. He knows me, but is upstairs and doesn't know I am here. His daughter and son are there. They come down to the basement. I talk with them. The man is like my friend's father Charles Kramer. I see some photographs of them and their house. I have two small stuffed dogs. One is white and the other is pink. The white dog is older. When I see the man he doesn't seem very happy to see me. He may not recognize me."
"0722"	"(04/04/1997)"	"Breaking Tube Boy I'm in my friends Brittany Johnson and Jana Green's room at Brimson. There is music playing and candles burning. Brittany and Jana aren't there: they're doing laundry. I see them in the laundry room, which is just west of their room. Their friend Darlene Miller is with them. Darlene takes off her pants to put them in the laundry. She is skinny and has black underwear on. There is a woman on the phone near the door to the room. People are eating dinner in a place like Mason Cafeteria. Someone has several long Kentucky Fried Chicken boxes to carry food (chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, etc.) away in for dinner. I am starting to eat. A man makes a comment ""on that damned Hansen or Hansone"". I am sitting near him and hear him say this. I get up and go over to him. He is alone under a table. Some people see me get up and they know why. They say, ""Ooohhhh"", like the man is in trouble. I pick up the table off the man. He is tubing or pipe with a block or bucket head. I easily pick his tube body up with my hand. His body is only about _ inch thick. I bring him outside. I bend his body in half and them him on the ground, which is the sidewalk near my back door at home. A few drops of green liquid have spilled on the kitchen floor at home. I wipe them up with a napkin and go to the garage to throw the napkin out. Someone says something to me using the ""forbidden"" name. I say to them, ""What did you say?"", though I heard what they had said. The person immediately rephrases their words to give me respect. I say, ""That's what I thought."" I walk by people and say excuse me if I am close to them. They are intimidated by me and don't want to upset me. I don't see much chicken with the meal. I thought there would be a lot of chicken."
"0723"	"(04/08/1997)"	"Corbet's Coulier I'm skiing with my brother Wally, my mom, and others in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Near Corbet's Coulier there are some people. I show my mom the drop of that run. There is a 30-foot drop-off boarded up, and a couple of smaller drops. People are standing on their skis and snowboards near the top of the drop. I point this out to my mom. We ski down the hill. I do okay, and make a good turn. Wally comments on my good turn. People aren't supposed to ski in some areas that are snow covered. I am with other friends near a house. I know the people who live in the house: they are my female friend and her family. The light goes on in the house. It is late and the people were all sleeping before the light turned on. We didn't intend to disturb them. I am standing in a doorway listening to my friend and her father talking. She doesn't notice I am there for a while. I stand there and listen, waiting for attention. Then she notices me and comes over to greet me and let me in."
"0724"	"(04/08/1997)"	"Falling Off Diving Board I'm in a swimming pool. There are two diving boards. One is in the deep end of the pool. I walk around the pool to find a bench to put my towel and two decks of cards with red backs that I am holding. The bench and the floor are wet. I find a large air conditioning-like unit protruding from the wall several feet above the pool deck. The top of it is dry. I put my towel and the cards on it. I see the diving board in the shallow end of the pool. There is a young boy going off the board. I go down towards the deep end. On my way I stop at a hot tub. The tub is nice and warm, and I am sore. I flop into it. I soon get out and walk to the diving board at the deep end. My friend Holly Lapson is there. We are going to go off the diving board at the same time. I don't go off the board. She goes and stumbles at the end of the board. She falls off the side and hits her head on the edge of the pool. I go on the board. I stumble and fall when I try to dive at the end of the board. I over-rotate and splash. I go down to the bottom of the pool. People are laughing. I laugh also. I think I may run out of air because when I laughed I exhaled all my air. But I have enough air and can push off the bottom with my legs to propel myself to the surface."
"0725"	"(04/09/1997)"	"Gunfight With Stephen I'm in a gunfight in front of my house. I have a pistol that is really thin, like a flimsy butter knife. I am fighting my roommate Stephen Ramos, who has a machine gun. I run along the sidewalk and hide by the bushes between our house and the neighbor's yard. I shoot and hit Stephen in the butt, and then in the leg (the quadriceps). He doesn't hit me. He fires the gun at me a little bit, but appears to be confused and fires the gun off in a different direction. After I shoot him he runs away. I could go after him and catch him to end the game, but I go inside. I have to find him before 9:30 pm. There is a girl that either I have to find or that goes with me to find Stephen."
"0726"	"(04/09/1997)"	"Shooting FDA Woman There is a fight between Americans and Mexicans or Spanish people. There is a Mexican boy. He has two emaciated brothers, dying of AIDS. The boy can't help them, so he learns bravery and fighting, and helps his father break out of prison. He uses a long light bulb as a weapon. He kills several prison guards. Everyone is dying. A woman from the Food and Drug Administration tries to break in. The boy catches her and takes her gun. The gun holds two bullets. The woman had three clips of two bullets each. The boy's friend points the gun at the woman's head. The father of the boy, who may be me, holds his hand on the arm of the boy with the gun, so as to not make the boy shoot. But the father doesn't push the boy's arm away. The boy fires the gun. The bullets pop out of the gun and drop to the floor. The woman is scared to death. The boy who fired the gun thinks this is funny. I am the father, and I am enraged! I beat the boy, who is my son's friend. I nearly kill him. I pick him up by the feet. He is very light. I swing his body into the wall, which seems like the arch between the living and dining rooms at home. I kick my son and his friend out of the house. They may go to live with the other boy's mother. I am mad! There is a piano bench. I move it, slamming it down. Someone calls me Taco Bill. The woman from the FDA is my friend Norman's friend Sunny Pile. She is there. I am in a bad mood. We quickly take the lights off the Christmas tree. The tree is sparsely decorated."

There is a pack on the floor of the passenger seat of the truck. I'm sitting in back on top of the truck with a wheelbarrow wheel and axel in my hands. The truck is on a larger truck or on a ramp. In a nearby big truck are some track and other equipment like that I used to catch chickens. We touch the stuff and get grease and dirt on our hands. A man is mad at us and tells us to leave. We ignore him. We drive away when the man comes towards us. My large photo album is under the passenger seat in the truck. I wonder if the truck will be safe while we're gone. We are on a three-wheeler. The man who is mad at us follows us in a large caterpillar bulldozer. He drives it pretty fast. We try to outrun him, and go fast. We get to a fence, lift up the three-wheeler, and toss it over the fence. In order to follow us the man would have to break down the fence, which the bulldozer could do."
"0728"	"(04/09/1997)"	"Tennis Balls on Jefferson Roof I'm at Jefferson Elementary school in Oak Valley with my mom. We go up on the roof to get tennis balls. We are careful. I climb on the door first, then use the handle and climb my way up to the roof. When it is time to go down I toss down the old, dirty tennis balls for people on the ground. I get stuck on the edge of the roof. My mom laughs. I flip over the edge and hang on, grappling my way towards the fence along the gutter by which I am hanging. I grasp a handle like that on my dorm room door. The handle turns and the door to a plane opens. There is a balding man inside, who is scary. He is in a plane, and may fall out. I call my sister Ramona and tell her to come over here as quickly as possible. She is watching a movie with our cousin Rich Redding. My mom may be in trouble. I tell my mom to jump off the roof at its lowest point and jump onto something."

"0731"	"(04/10/1997)"	"Skimpy Melanie I am at home. I get out of bed. I have my black and white striped underwear on. It is early in the morning, and people are awake at my house. My friend Melanie McDyss and another woman are there. They are dressed in very skimpy see-through dresses. I say ""Oohhh"" and joke with Melanie about this. They leave with others. I need to take a bus or drive to somewhere via Circle Highway. I take the bus back to Brimson with a woman."

We are going straight up a very steep hill, with about a 75-degree incline! There is another car driven by a woman that takes a more winding road up the hill. We get to the top of the hill, and are in the clouds. We are overlooking Sydney, Australia. Many of us take photographs. There is a camera-like structure there. It is round and has individual areas with cameras."

He then pulls up in a big, white, dirty, country truck. He says he didn't remember the time, or he got the time confused. With him are his three sisters. One is about 15 years old, another about nine, and the third about five. They have another truck there. We are supposed to go to Riverton for a basketball game. When I remind him of this he says we'll have to go home to his house and get the van to drive. His two oldest sisters take one truck. I go with him and his youngest sister in another truck."
"0734"	"(04/10/1997)"	"Indian Land I am with my classmate Bryan Beard. We're walking in something like a railroad yard. We talk. He spits a lot. His spit is white, and it has sexual connotations. We walk through Indian land. We are not supposed to be there and cannot pas through. The land is owned by one of the members of the Indian group."
"0735"	"(04/11/1997)"	"Kari Holds My Penis I am on my paper route in Oak Valley. I'm on Curve Avenue and 2nd Street. My friends Kari Kosslyn and Ivory Alshire are with me. I'm wearing my Phillips 66 shirt. It starts raining. Kari and Ivory think that it's weird that I stand in the rain, but I do. I walk with Kari towards Last Avenue. I am standing behind her, and I start to touch her sexually on the outside of her clothes. I feel down by her pubic hair. We are waiting to cross Last Avenue. She is holding my penis, which is going between my legs and out behind me. She is holding it behind me. Cars go by. We cross quickly. We are in people's dirt yards, without grass, standing on cement. I'm walking on the cement edge of a street that is in the front yard of the white house on the left of Holt's house. I think I should deliver to Mike's garage since I am near there, but I don't. I tell my friend Beth Mock, or my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, who is then the woman I am with, to wait. I tell her to come with me, and I run behind a farmhouse. There are horses in the area that run away. The grass is coarse pasture. I sit down next to a place where I think no windows will allow people to see us. Annie comes to me and says, ""Fuck me!"" I unbutton her light brown pants, which are from the 1980's, and pull them down to her ankles. We have never had sex before. I give her cunnilingus. She has an erection like a dog's erection: no penis head. She doesn't like me sucking on her erection: it doesn't feel good. Her clitoris is on the underside of her erection. I like her erection."
"0736"	"(04/11/1997)"	"Breathing Under Water There is a river by a mountain. Homer and Bart Simpson get buried in the mountain. I'm with my roommate Stephen Ramos and my friends Kevin Simpson, Kristy Puffy, and Kevin's mother Karen Simpson. There is something valuable in the mountain. We have three necklaces that allow us to breath underwater. I give my necklace to the others. I have a ""Sluuu necklace"", which is mine. I give it to Kevin so he can breath underwater. Kevin comes back and says there is air in the mountain! I swim, following him under stairs in the water. I go through a narrow tunnel area. There are spikes in the tunnel. I have trouble holding my breath. I imagine the inside of the mountain to be like a treasure."
"0737"	"(04/11/1997)"	"Deer Hunting I'm deer hunting with my roommate Stephen Ramos. I have a black powder gun. There is a deer way off in the distance. It was closer but it ran away from us. I took a shot, reloaded, and fired again. It is now really far away. I shoot and hit the deer, which is probably about 250 yards away. The deer drops! I'm surprised and excited. I run over to the deer with Stephen. As we get close we see two more deer. Stephen hits one and I hit the other. They both drop. We walk over to the deer. All three deer are close together. There is a doe and two bucks. Jake's buck has four points. I got a small doe and a larger buck with two or four points."
"0738"	"(04/12/1997)"	"Inferior To Reddings I'm with my aunt and uncle Rusty and Sheila Redding, and their kids Rich, Melissa, and Melvin. I'm hugging a toilet bowl. I say, ""It's all about ceramic toilet bowls."" Rusty says, ""It's all about licking heads."" He licks my head, and then Sheila's. We all have dinner. I open a box wrapped with green paper after dinner. There are some dessert bars inside. I eat one. It crumbles as I try to eat it. The box was supposed to go to my aunt Raquel Redding. It had my mom Natie's name on it, short for Natalie, so I thought it was for my mom. She wouldn't mind if I opened it. Rusty, Sheila, my mom, and others see that I opened it. This is a terrible thing for me to do. I wasn't supposed to open the box. There is no way to repack the box. People are mad at me. I feel guilty and shameful. My sister Ramona washes the dishes, though she doesn't want to. I'm in my room upstairs at home. Rich and I might play chess. Rusty comes up also. Something happens with stuffing a closet. I'm then in the kitchen. I'm drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and taking some garbage out to the garage. Someone comments on my smoking a cigarette. I say I've only smoked 10 cigarettes in my life. An ash from the cigarette lands on the gas tank of the lawnmower. The lawnmower explodes. I run into the kitchen and close the door. There are several loud bangs and explosions. A fire breaks out. People come quickly with fire extinguishers. There was a direct telephone line to the police or fire department so they will be coming even though the fire has been put out."
"0739"	"(04/13/1997)"	"Paper Towel Propeller I'm with a group of six others in an area that is flooded. There is $3.99 for all of us to eat. We are waiting to be rescued. There is a woman and a child. They sled down an icy hill onto snow and up to where I am. The woman sends her child before her on a tiny sled. Then she follows. They go fast and become airborne after a bump, and then crash into the snow. The snow I am on collapses. I fall through down into a narrow gulch or ravine: a big crevice. I manage to climb up a little ways. When I get to the top I yell at the woman to move away from the edge of the unsafe snow. She doesn't move, and we both fall down. It is cramped rock area with snow. We slide down a long ways. I am with my classmate Bryan Beard. We go to the setup area for the rescue plane. The area is a big hanger. We need to move a big platform that we are on to the big door and attach it. The platform moves, kind of floating. We try to get it into position. I fall out of the platform and hang onto the big door, grasping a lock. The platform moves back around and I jump in. The plane is there. Bryan and I have paper towels. We must hold the roll of paper towels to wrap around the propellers of the plane. It is a last resort. We don't have many options. I hold the tube of the towels with my fingers in each end. The end of the towel is wrapped around the propeller. It turns slowly. Before I know it the towel is unraveled. It didn't help the propeller much."
"0740"	"(04/13/1997)"	"Twins Game At 4:00 I'm with my aunt Mary Redding, her family, my mom, and my sister Ramona. We're ordering pizza from Pizza Hut or Dominos. We're getting three large pizzas. Ramona orders cheese bread without lettuce form Subway. It is 3:30. I'm going to a Minnesota Twins game, which is nearby, that starts at 4:00. My friend Norman Noman is there. He might go to the game later."
"0741"	"(04/14/1997)"	"Attempting Cunnilingus There is a man with a fortune. There are two women, another man, and myself. I try to give the women cunnilingus."
"0742"	"(04/14/1997)"	"Fellatio Chain I am in bed with my childhood neighbor Andy Jones and a woman I work with at Brimson named Marie Bonnet. We are laying crossway in a bed. Marie gives me fellatio while I give Andy fellatio."
"0743"	"(04/14/1997)"	"Smoking Up Blood My friend Norman Noman and others are smoking marijuana out of a pipe. There is marijuana and blood in the pipe."
"0744"	"(04/15/1997)"	"Growling Dog I'm at my neighbor Andy Jones' house in Oak Valley. There is a boy outside with a dog. A different large dog growls at me. The boy tells it to be quiet. I go inside the house. People are in the basement or another room. I go to the green house on the corner of Home Avenue and 3rd Street. I knock at the door to get a woman who is a friend of mine. I say we're waiting for her."
"0745"	"(04/16/1997)"	"Runaway Jackie I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson and my woman-friend Jackie Hunter at a country restaurant having dinner. Jackie is talking about two men she knows named Matt and Dan. We are talking on the phone in the restaurant. I tell her if she's not interested in me I don't want to wait around thinking I have a chance with her. She has to leave. My truck and Kevin's Bronco are parked outside. Kevin and I are going to get in my truck. Jackie calls me over to the Bronco. I jump up and lean my weight on the open window. I fall in the window, and the door closes. She may be on the phone. I lay across the front seat with my head in her lap. She backs the Bronco up. There is a skunk on the side of the road. The skunk is spraying a thick golden-yellow syrup-like liquid out of its backside. A car stops behind us, maybe because of the skunk, or because we're backing very near to the road. Jackie wants to talk, as we start driving. She says we should have dinner Monday night. I tell her my feelings again. She kisses me, hard. She straddles me and kisses me, ignoring the road! I try to steer and kiss her at the same time. We drive through a stop sign because we're going too fast and can't stop, and then go over railroad tracks when the red light is flashing. We finally come to a stop on the shoulder of the road. There is a field and lake off to the right. She asks me if I had garlic in my drink for dinner."
"0746"	"(04/16/1997)"	"Biting Goats At Grandpa's I'm at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's farm. My uncle Dannie Redding is there with my grandparents. There is a cow or a goat that gets loose in the house because of me. It bites an old blue blanket in Grandma's bedroom. I get bitten and scratched by it. It runs out to the plant room and jumps through a window. I had gone to the plant room earlier to study. There are cows or goats in the door or window that seem to want to get in. I don't want people to know the window is broken. I'll probably have to pay for it. I tell them about my cut, bite, and scratched hand."
"0747"	"(04/16/1997)"	"Biochemical Health Hazard I'm skiing with my family in Colorado. I ski with my brother Wally. We go on a helicopter ride in a trailer of a helicopter. We go over water and turn steeply that scare me. Someone, who may be my woman-friend Jackie Hunter, says it's scary going over the water. I think it's not scary going over the water, but rather it is cool. I do think the 90-degree turns are scary. We are leaving. I look at a newspaper in the gas station. There is a huge photograph on the front page of a man with a 100-foot python. He doesn't want the python to eat his horse or other farm animal. We leave. Wally is driving. I'm in the passenger seat. My mom and my sisters Ramona and Heather are in the back seat. When we are actually driving, my mom is in the driver's seat and a couple in their late 20's is in the passenger seat. I am behind the couple in the back seat. I don't know who they are or why they are there. I don't want them to be there. White lights go on in the rear of the vehicle signaling there is something wrong with the rear brakes. I have a map. I try to figure out where we are and where we're going. We're going to a park at a tri-state junction of Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota. We're in Colorado or Wyoming. We see an exit for Waterville or Watertown. I want my mom to take the exit, and she does. We go very slowly. I am anxious and annoyed. I want to go faster. My mom suggests we stay in a hotel for a day and see what is wrong with the car. I ask why not stay at Grandpa's, since we're here? I don't want the couple to be with us. We pull of the highway on the exit ramp slowly. The exit ends. We're in a grassy area that is sparsely wooded. There is a narrow cement path, not wide enough for a car, going off to the right. I get out of the car. There is a wooden post with some colored bottles on the side of it. I easily break the post off. It has the words ""Biochemical Health Hazard"" on it. I hold it up to everyone and tell, say ""Look!"", and then disgustedly tell them to get out of there. There is as stream next to the post. The stream is the health hazard. I try to get back to where the car is. I go over the stream. I step on old brown boards that are rotting. They are dried out. I fall in. I have my clothes and boots on. I try to swim. My sister Heather is yelling, saying something about going backwards. I finally make it to the edge of the stream, which is cement."
"0748"	"(04/17/1997)"	"Jordan Clemen's Dorm I am in a dorm room at Brimson which may be my friends Fran Susse and Anna Woods' room. A psychology professor from Brimson, Jordan Clemens, is there. He is changing his clothes. There is a lighter atmosphere than is usually between Jordan and I."
"0749"	"(04/17/1997)"	"New Years Eve Parties There is a video of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation going on. There is a group of many African American people. They are in rows doing their own dances. Jasmine Guy is in front. The group is moving side to side, but not in total unison: people move independently. A white man comes in with his date. The man has AIDS. It is a New Years Eve Party. I'm there with my dad. George from the television show Seinfeld is there with his father, who is huge. George and his father hug each other, and think or say something about who will die first. I leave with my dad. My roommate Stephen comes out. I hug him goodbye in the hallway. It is an all night party. We get outside and are supposed to prop the door open. We don't do this because the person who left before us didn't do it either. The door locks behind us, so no one wanting to get in could. I see a kid I know from Brimson that we call Death Boy, and his girlfriend. They want something, maybe food, and ask us if we have some. I am with my friend Tim Zelling. He has some Whoppers back where he is staying. I have some too that I give to them. I'm afraid the couple will rob us and take my $200. It is New Years Eve. I'm in the large upstairs bedroom at home. There is a party. My geology professor Greg Welters is teaching others and I how to use an instrument for measuring with two hooks. People come to the room. Some of them are drunk. My friends Kevin Simpson and Emerald Reinhold come through the window. Others come, including my friends Nate Nelling, Tiny Combs, Larry Rollie, and Nicole Peterson. My dad is trying to sleep downstairs. I say it is okay for people to stay if they are quiet. The phone rings. I don't answer it at first. Then I hear my dad yell from downstairs. He is angry that someone would call this late at night. I pick up the phone. It is my friend Elise Rooks. She is at our classmate Susie Pastor's house where there is a party going on. I am wearing my Australian bush hat. People at my house can't be quiet so I make them leave. I tell them I can drive some people home. We go down the stairs. A person I know from Brimson named Brad Heller falls down the stairs. He is a drunken idiot. He acts dead and then smiles. I kick him while he is lying down. My dad and my sister Ramona are in the living room. Ramona is talking on an old, cream-colored phone. My sister Heather arrives home through the front door. I apologize to my dad, saying it was my friends and I that were loud, and that the phone was for me. It is cold: winter. I put on my boots and winter clothes. I go out to start the brown station wagon. It is covered with snow and frost. Everyone is in the car. The car barely starts. I turn the heater on and get out to scrape the windows. I hear a commercial for the Army about a career move or profession. There is a plumbing van there. I say, ""Fuck that commercial!"" My neighbor Wanda Stalk calls out our back door saying there is a phone call for Hannah, who is my sister Heather. She thinks I am Hannah. I tell her Hannah is not outside. I kind of want to get my bush hat and go to the party at Susie Pastor's house."
"0750"	"(04/17/1997)"	"Autofellatio 7 I'm with a classmate from Brimson named Kim, my sister Heather, and my roommate Stephen Ramos in a room. There is a very sexual overtone in the room. Kim says something about a man who put his hand in her vagina and went all the way up and touched her breast. I fart. I tell Heather and Kim they should fart. They try to. They say it will make noises if they spread their legs more. I give myself fellatio. I have a long penis."
"0751"	"(04/18/1997)"	"Huge Steep Mountain I'm at the top of a huge mountain with two men. There is a woman there with ski boots and poles but no skis. She is going to jump and step down the hill. The hill is very steep. I go near the edge of the hill. I think I will slip and fall down. The hill is a cliff-like slope. I hang onto a branch and ask my two friends to help me up. I pull myself up the cliff. There is a little station at the top of the hill, like a ranger station. There is a ranger in a suburban. We walk over to a different place and look at the slope. It is steep! People have huge plastic toboggan sleds made of colored plastic that are 20 or 30 feet long. There is a gentler sloping run and people slide down it. It's fast! One woman hits some trees, but is okay. I think she'll get hurt. I think two men and I should go on a run down the hill in the big sled."
"0752"	"(04/18/1997)"	"Mounting Carol I'm in a car with three people: a driver, an older sluttish woman, and my coworker from Brimson Carol Flanders. We're staying in a small town for the night. We drive by a tire store, and then by a tiny restaurant/bar. We were going to go there later. We drive by a baseball field at night where a game is being played. The older woman in the car is naked. I have my arm around her and my hand on her butt. I creep my hand around, touching her. She laughs, because my actions are cheesy, but she doesn't resist or move. She says I'm going to get gonorrhea. I tell her you have to mount to get gonorrhea. She touches my penis. I move away from her. Carol says that she wants to mount. She straddles me. I pull off her underwear under her skirt. I tell her to give me fellatio so I get an erection. She doesn't understand what I am saying. She rubs and scratches the base of my penis. When my penis is erect I move to put it in her vagina."
"0753"	"(04/18/1997)"	"Releasing Game I'm bow hunting. I see two men wearing blaze orange from afar. They come closer and walk by me, not aware that I am there. I draw my bow and aim at them. I get their attention. They have live rabbits and geese. They are going to kill them. I make them let go of the game (the rabbits and geese). There are some pornographic magazines in the forest. There is a large magazine, several feet long, with black people featured in it. There is more pornography that is older, ""tasteful"" pornography: not as revealing. We leave, and may come back because my coworker Megan Hughes and her friends are coming. I want to go back and get the pornography. The pornography is of a party at my neighbor Alvin Broud's house."
"0754"	"(04/18/1997)"	"Town Of Moter I'm on a mountain bicycle going down a hill by Washington University. Cars go by. It is a big hill. My bicycle is thick, heavy, and sturdy. I go on a path that puts me in the Big Resort Area. The path is right on the edge of a cliff next to a huge lake. There are many rocks in the water: a rock island is barely underneath the surface. I can't continue on the path: a tree is in my way. I pick up my bicycle and walk back to the road. The road sign points to the town of Moter. I am looking for a town that has a name that begins with the letter ""S""."
"0755"	"(04/21/1997)"	"Offering Of A Kiss I'm in a store with some friends from home, including Marybeth Neumann. We see Marybeth and kind of ignore her, playing coy. Others start to leave. I stay there. I look at Marybeth over a counter. She starts to cry. I go over and hug her. She is sad. Things have been difficult for her. She broke up with her boyfriend Jeff, who turned out to be her fiance. When I leave she offers me something. She words her statement funny, like what she is offering is entertainment. She is offering me a kiss, I realize."
"0756"	"(04/21/1997)"	"Stuck In Snow I'm in a lot of snow. The side of the road I am on was not plowed. The snow is deep. I struggle to move. I am not upset, this is kind of fun. I get stuck. I'm on Home Avenue in Oak Valley. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. I'm afraid of being hit by a car. A police car comes and throws me a rope so I can get towed out."
"0757"	"(04/23/1997)"	"Blackmailed Murder I'm with my friend Nate Nelling and my girlfriend Jackie Hunter. A man is being forced to commit murder, or say he committed murder. It is a mob-like scandal. Later, evidence surfaces that will free this man. There is a person speaking on a pay phone. The words spoken by the person are played on a loud speaker outside the house of my classmate Chuck, and they are spoken to my classmate Virgil. The message is threatening. The speaker runs way from the phone so he won't be discovered. A large corporation has an interest in concealing the murder. They threaten the opposing lawyers with loss of the most important things in their lives. The lawyer or the person that has been blackmailed knows what is happening. The pressure to concede is great, and the potential loss for standing one's ground is huge. It may be that I am the lawyer. I don't seem to be there. Nate is making a list of people. On it are our former basketball teammates Tony Kramer, 6'4"", John Kulik, 6'8"", and Nate. It is like a basketball roster. There are more people on the list."
"0758"	"(04/23/1997)"	"Chris Dies I'm driving a van into the parking lot at Scott Junior High in Wilmerton. I park the van funny, across the yellow painted lines designating parking spaces. I adjust the parking job by driving and rolling the van into the spot while I am outside of the van. It seems like walking along a bicycle. We go into the school. I'm wearing my bush hat and some other outrageous clothes, including a feather cloth around my neck. I walk towards the office. I see my high school science teacher Mr. Grizzly. I stop and talk with him, asking him if he's been to the Big Resort Area lately. He says that it's been tough to go with diapers, baby food, etc. I think he must have a baby, and then I realize he is talking about me! I laugh. I tell him I got a job in the Big Resort Area this summer. A boy in the corner makes a comment. I walk out of the room. My cousins Rich and Melvin Redding are there. I shake Rich's hand and pat Melvin's head. I hear that a boy from my neighborhood named Chris has died. I leave. I go by my Brimson classmate Molly and others. I go out the front door. There is a ship-like hearse and the casket is like a boat. A woman is directing three men. The men are putting the casket in the holder, and she is telling them how to secure it. I watch this as I walk past my van. I turn around and go back to the van."
"0759"	"(04/23/1997)"	"Breaking Norman's Pipe I'm with my friends Norman Noman, Hank Anderson, a classmate named Jake, and others. We're in Norman and Hank's room smoking marijuana. I am having difficulty lighting the lighter: I can't get it lit. Then I try and light the pipe on fire! The flame is large, and I quickly snuff the flames out on the bed. The pipe breaks into many pieces. I think this is terrible: I am going to have to buy Norman a new pipe!"
"0760"	"(04/23/1997)"	"Mobsters Soil My Car I'm in a car with my roommate Stephen Ramos. We're on Superhighway 100 near the town of Crystal. There are several police cars in the area and traffic is backed up. People are pulling over to the side of the road. There are more flashing lights on cars. We stop. There is a man right in front of our car. Stephen is driving. Four or five men start beating our car! They dump things in the car, soiling it. I'm afraid they're going to blow the car up. They are working for their boss, who is a mobster. I get mad and want to beat up the leader of this group. I do beat him up, and then run down many flights of stairs, jumping and scrambling away. I go through doors and down more stairwells. There are many doors. I go through some doors, which lead to more doors or elevators. There are many possible ways I can go. I hope I can lose the people following me."

Later I learn that a bullet has hit my friend Sam Crimson. I think he is dead. Later I see him. He was hit in the head but appears to be okay. A large chunk of hair and flesh on his head is missing, and there is a big scar."
"0763"	"(04/24/1997)"	"Zoe Madden Eating Lunch I'm at Brimson in my room, which in real life is my girlfriend Jackie's room. My roommate Stephen Ramos is there. He leaves the room. As the door closes behind him I see that Jackie is sitting on the floor across the hall from the door. I am folding laundry. Jackie comes in the room. I say I'm going to the bathroom because I have to urinate. I go into a large red or pink room with lots of windows and many small beds with metal frames. I decide to defecate. I go into a stall. Stephen comes in with me, jokingly, and then goes out. I sit down on the toilet, but I can't defecate. I can see the whole room. There are four or five men there eating. It has been a while then, and I think I should return to the room because I told Jackie I was just urinating. My economics professor Zoe Madden and some men with very thick glasses are there. They look like stereotypical ""nerds"" in high school. They are eating lunch in a cafeteria-like area. I get up and wash my hands. I go past the women's bathroom to the men's bathroom. The men's room is a large open area. There is a sink of warm water that I wash my hands in. There are large windows and a Jacuzzi, like a spacious health spa. There is a ceramic water fountain-like structure. I urinate in it. I run water to rinse the structure out. I think someone is about to enter the bathroom so I stop urinating. No one comes in, so I finish urinating. There is an upside-down water tap on the fountain that I use to rinse it. I go out into the room. My friend Simon Naver is there. We talk. I tell him about my job in the Big Resort Area. I'm eating lunch outside what feels like a luncheon for prospective students. There are a lot of people who aren't familiar with the college and the food. Stephen is there and we talk with a man about the food. The man is the father of our high school classmate Aaron Webbed."
"0764"	"(04/25/1997)"	"Fighting Al Livern I'm in my neighbor Wilma and Gary Stein's yard. It is winter, and cold outside. There are some young, naked people in the yard dying. The youngest is a small toddler, who is cut loose from something by a tire. Three people from the group can die at once. I chase my classmate Al Livern, who is in the lilac tree. He runs away. I chase him. We fight. I smash his nose into my knee, and his nose bleeds profusely. My nose bleeds a little bit too. I think of my high school classmate Tom Dement. I know Tom bled when he was in this situation. The three young people are dispersed in the yard, separated, to die at once. I either want this to stop, or I want four people to die at once: one in each corner of the yard."
"0765"	"(04/25/1997)"	"My mom Condones Making Out I'm at home with either my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas or my girlfriend Jackie Hunter. We're in my room making out. I fall asleep. Later I wake up. I am supposed to baby-sit at 9:00 pm. My mom talks about me making out with a woman like it is no big deal. I'm in the kitchen with Jackie. We talk about what is going to happen with our relationship this summer. It is mutually agreed upon that there will be no commitment. We hug, and hold each other for a while. I get a phone call from a woman I am babysitting for. I tell her I'll be over in a minute: it's now 9:15pm. She is going to be at the house working or studying, but she needs someone to watch her kids. I get my winter clothes on. My winter jacket isn't on the hook by the front door."
"0766"	"(04/28/1997)"	"Mr. Black's Wife I'm walking with my roommate Stephen Ramos down 1st Street in Oak Valley. We talk about the weight of canoes. I tell him my dad's canoe is so light I can pick it up with one hand, but it doesn't have a yoke. I'm going fishing. I'm at Mr. Black's house on the northwest corner of 1st Street and Old Avenue. I'm with a woman. Mr. Black's wife gives us lunch in a big brown paper bag. There are a lot of cookies in the bag. There is a little dog that doesn't bark. I pet the dog, and it jumps up on my shoulder. There may be another pet there that Mr. Black's wife has."

I am near the Baseball Pub in Oak Valley. There is a stream with a cement bottom. The cement is a conglomerate. I see many northern pike and a long rainbow trout in the stream. I have a green and yellow spoon fishing lure on a string. I toss it out in the stream and try to snag the trout. The trout swims away. My sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine is there. I ask a man what time it is. He says it's 8:00. We need to be back in town by 8:45, so we need to hurry back to Washington University. There is something I want to do at Washington before I leave there, which makes me want to hurry back there. I lose $5.00, dropping it on the ground. I chase the money down by Sundial Park. I also dropped other money in my key safe. I snatch it up and shove it in my pocket. I plan to get a ride with Wally. I forgot his car has a dead battery. He needs a taxi to tow his car to Washington. I have several shoes: two black converse hi-tops, and two types of white tennis shoes, one shoe of each type. No cars come on the road that could jump-start Wally's car. My mom's car isn't strong enough to jump start his car, and it is at Washington."
"0768"	"(04/30/1997)"	"Crazy Fishing At Many Fish I'm going fishing with my buddy Matt Yams at Many Fish Lake. It is night or very early morning, and is dark. I call him, and he asks me about the battery. I have forgotten to charge it, and quickly put the battery charger on it for a bit. My friend's mother, Sharon Kasper, whose name is pronounced ""Shorn"", calls for me. My mom gives me the message that she wants me to pick up her son Jerry and his friend in Beetville tonight. They are in Beetville without a ride home. I don't call Sharon back. I don't want to pick them up: I'm busy going fishing. My mom says I should call her, so I go and pick up the phone. There is no dial tone. I say hello. It is Jerry's father Myron. I say to him that I just picked up the phone and even without a dial tone he was there! I feel guilty, but I tell him that I'm going fishing at Many Fish and I can't pick up Jerry tonight. I tell him where the lake is. He wanted to go out with his wife and needed someone to pick up Jerry. We get dressed for the cold. My brother Wally, and sister Ramona are going too. I wear a red ski mask with the face cut out and a blue scarf. We leave. We are out at the lake. My classmate Diane has a reel with no rod. She is marking out an area by casting. Seeing the weed line, I tell her to just cast it out a little bit. She does, and reels it in. She gets a hit when the lure, which is a blue/gray/silver rattlin' fat rap, is almost in to shore. That was a test cast for her. She is holding the line in her hand, on a spool of fishing line. We are on the water. I take of my glove-mittens and throw them to a third girl who is in the water. I grab the rod, which is in the water. I tell her to let out a lot of line, because I know the fish will break the line coming from the spool since there is no flexibility. I connect the line with all its slack to the rod, which doesn't have a reel. I get washed in towards shore as I start to wind the line around the spool of thread. I feel the weeds on my body, but I am clothed, so it's not as aversive a feeling. A big wave comes and washes over me. I am washed up, now on the shore. I follow the fishing line. The fish is on the end of it: a nice-sized northern pike. It is still hooked. I cheer! Matt and another person are there. Matt takes the fish and lets it go at the shoreline. I am happy. It is dark. I remember I forgot to pick up Matt. Wally or Matt lends me a quarter and I go to Sandwhich Heaven to call Matt. Matt's brother Jasper answers the phone. He tells me Matt knows I forgot, and he wanted a confirmation call. He had driven out to the lake and will hope to meet us by the shore. I go back to the lake. Matt is swimming in the water with a man named Bobby whom I know through a friend from Brimson, and his friends. I'm in a large, nice boat with an inboard motor. Matt is driving the boat. We bump into some boats that are docked. There is a party-like atmosphere. I am on an object that may be a jet ski, in the water. I bounce on this object, going down to the bottom of the water, to a cement pool-like bottom. Then I shoot up out of the water 10 or 12 feet into the air. Once I squish my classmate Kyle Mendelson between the object and the cement floor. I squish his head. My cousins Bertha Strange, Archie Weber, and Ramona had their faces photographed in one of those circus items where the bodies are painted on a board and the heads are cut out. There is a photograph of me looking like a goofball and making my funny noises. There is a photograph of my friend Niles Zelling. My classmate Sarah Pauly is singing Karoke. I walk on the floor of the lake/pool with my eyes open. I poke Kyle in the shoulder. He is scared of me because I hurt him earlier. I push off the bottom and get to the surface for air. I am standing on a platform above the water. I decide to take paleontology for a grade rather than Pass/Fail. My classmate Shawn or Ryan Bay is on a similar platform, and decides to take a class Pass/Fail. I slide down a pole. I am going down a lattice-like ladder. The water looks like a lake in some respects."
"0769"	"(04/30/1997)"	"Ten Feet and Ten Days I arrive in Australia or Latin America by plane with a group. I take an escalator down, then up, then down, to get to the customs area. It's a crowded airport. I don't think I have all the necessary papers and passport, but I do. I go through the pass gate. The lady asks me how long I'm staying. The woman next to me says 10 feet. I say 10 feet. Then I realize the inappropriateness of that answer, so I say 10 feet and 10 days, joking around. The woman charges me $26 for my stay. I move to pay for the bill, and since I don't have enough cash I put it on my MasterCard. While I'm paying, someone comes up to the lady that is helping me and shows her a photograph of her jogging with a neck brace on. My friend Tim Zelling wants to look at hacky sacks to buy. I say okay. I don't have much money, and I owe money on my MasterCard."
"0770"	"(05/01/1997)"	"Fishing Life I'm in the Big Resort Area. I go into my room. It is big, I think very big for two people. I realize more than two people are living here. There is a toilet on the ground floor in the open. The room has a loft, where I think four people will live. I meet my roommates. One is named Matt. He is a larger man in his mid twenties. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are my roommates too. I meet some of the other employees. They are older than I, and larger. Mike looks different than I pictured: taller and scruffier. There is a lake nearby. One guy starts up a boat with a motor and makes a small circle before docking again. Someone seems to control the boat from shore. The controller seems to have a mini boat next to the shore, which goes in a small circle next to shore, and also controls the movement of the larger boat. They want me to start the motorboat. The boat is like an alpine sliding cart, made of plastic. I try to start it. There is long rope connecting the sled and I with the boat. I sink in the plastic ""boat"". I get help from people that live there. There is a heavy crosswind, like being on a river. I can't grip the handle, which is like the stock of a gun. Then I grip it well and the engine starts. I'm in the plastic sled and I can't make the boat move. There are loons and a bald eagle there. There is a group of canoeists on a trip singing and playing guitar. The mosquitoes and the slugs are really bad. I am wearing a yellow rain suit when I go to start the boat. I walk in the water and don't get wet except through the collar. A man I work with is carrying a girl out of the water. I am taking the rope out. The man gets pushed under the water a bit."
"0771"	"(05/01/1997)"	"Sloppy Basketball Game I'm in a basketball game. The game is very sloppy. It is largely unorganized. I get fouled, and a man gets in my face to argue. The referees call a technical foul on the man. I shoot some free throws. I line my feet up unevenly, and miss the first free throw. The referee calls me up add tells me to keep my back straight and upright, and to follow through. I re-align my feet. The referee says to bank in the free throw. I do what he says, and bank it in. I narrowly miss the next free throw. The game is suck sloppy confusion and disorganization."
"0772"	"(05/02/1997)"	"Java Backpack I'm arriving at a retreat house with my dad and his wife Lisa Lawson. I get out of the car after we drive around to the back of the house. I take my fishing gear, my new rod, bucket of minnows, a cup of worms, and my friend Kevin Simpson's bow. I don't shoot the deer we see when we're in the house. I see a doe and a fawn. One or both of the deer vomit and bleed. They collapse on the floor of the house. I easily hold the deer in one hand. There are many floors on the house. I find a room with some broken glass in it. It is AIDSGlass on the glass. I get a lot of tiny pieces of glass on my arm. I brush them off carefully, not wanting to cut myself and contract AIDS. I then wipe my arm off with a cloth. I find a small blue Java backpack, the one that my brother Wally left at home for me. I thought it would be bigger. It says ""Java"" on the label. I was looking for the cause of the dead deer."
"0773"	"(05/06/1997)"	"Elusive Skeleton There are two wolves that are clenching their jaws around two tanned wolf hides. I am with my friend Jack Thigpen, who is a moose. I have a small shoe gun. It's a foot long with a widening barrel. I'm walking with the moose down a road. The moose can speak. I realize that it's silly for me to control the moose, which I am threatening, because in a second the moose could easily stomp on me. The moose and I find a haunted house. We go in and look for a skeleton. I'm with Jack. The skeleton man is supposed to be here. I have a flashlight that I shine on the skeleton. The skeleton is quick: it will be in the light, and then move to another place quickly. I try to grab it, but can't. It escapes down a tunnel. The person with me dives down the tunnel after it. I go down the tunnel too, but it takes me longer to go. I hear their voices at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel ends in a clean and neat room. Someone is getting married. My cousin Henry King is there, and is cleanly shaven. Another man is there. They are both wearing tuxedos: white shirts and black pants. My roommate Stephen Ramos has dust and dirt between his toes. People there laugh at me because they know that I know the transition of how I got here."
"0774"	"(05/06/1997)"	"Baby Eagles I'm at a house, which may be my brother Wally's. I'm looking at fishing gear in the garage. Wally shows me the big blue backpack he told me about in the garage. It is nice. It has an air-filled plastic tube as a cushion that goes around one's neck to cushion the weight of a canoe. I put the pack on and fasten the straps. Wally has some stuff in the pack. He has me step into two plastic bags and strap the bags to the pack. He says it will be easier to carry. I find difficult to walk like this: I can't take a full stride. Wally has a briefcase-like pack, which I put on. He will give it to me. There is a woman there. I pick up a pair of red rubber rain pants with rubber stocking feet. I turn the pants inside out, then inside in. I look at the fishing gear on the wall. There is no good fishing line. There is a huge spool of pink and yellow fly-fishing line. There's a lot of old fishing gear, one of my dad's big cork bobbers, and a lot of jiggle sticks. My aunt Willow Redding's friend Paul is there. I ask him if he had a good time at the Brimson Picnic. He says there was too much meat there: nothing to eat. He sys he didn't have a piece of the Caber, which is the hog. One or two cameras fall off the little shelf. I pick up one of the cameras and start taking photographs. I use a tiny one-inch by three-quarter inch camera. There are two orange, brown, and gold hawks or eagles flying about in the sky, fluttering and losing feathers. My uncle Dannie Redding is there. He walks towards the birds and whistles, holding out his arm. One bird lands on his arm. The other bird he picks up from the side of a telephone pole. He sets the birds down on the ground. One of the eagles gives birth to a young eagle, and then a second, and a third. There are no eggs, and the young are rather large. They are wet and slimy when they emerge from the mother, but quickly become dry and fluffy. They are about the size of the older birds, but puffier."

My classmate Ryan Walker and my friend Kristy Puffy are there. We're on our way to a basketball game in Riverton. I think I need a tape for video camera, but a tape is in the camera when I check it. I'm with my dad driving back to our house with my siblings. My brother Wally is a third string power forward in the basketball game. He needs six liberal arts classes to graduate. I suggest that he take five classes in the fall, implying that they are easy. I'm in the Riverton High School gym. The freshman or B-squad basketball team is practicing. I am stretching. The varsity team comes in. There is a black man on the team. He is belligerent. He argues with me and gets in my face. I stand up to him, and decide to walk away. I feel strong because I was able to walk away, when I could have fought with him. I see a lady that looks like she is on the staff here and I ask her to show me where the principal's office is. I want to make a formal complaint about the man. I complain formally, and discuss my problem with the administration. The administration doesn't care and finds me guilty. My old basketball coach Terry Brady is a student at this Riverton College. The administration thinks I am retaliating and getting back at Terry for going there. This makes me angry. I say I'm going to kick the shit out of their basketball team. I leave angrily. My home is being redone. There are holes in the roof, and there is no second floor. Some of the windows are gone. I go to the bathroom and shove a towel up a chute. I'm going to go up and get the towel from an upper level or the roof. My neighbor Gary Stein is working on the house. There are granola bars and milk chocolate chips, in green bags. These are used to patch the roof, like shingles. My mom tells me how long it will take for each item on the house to be done."

I go through woods and hear the music of Nine Inch Nails. I think the music I hear is soft and mellow. I get to Super America in my truck. I put cash on my Brimson ID card, which I put into a machine to pay for gas. The machine is like a copy and cash machine. I start putting money it in. A woman hits the ""change"" button and I get it all back in coins. I put all the coins back in the machine. They are large coins. I don't know their value. There is an orange coin from the casino with a burning skeleton on one side. The larger coins are worth a lot. The coins add up to 19 dollars and change. I tell the next man in line to leave the card in the machine while I pump the gas so I can pay for it. I go out to the gas pump. It is already running. It stops at $16 and change. I go back inside. Fitted Minnesota Twins baseball caps are on clearance. My gas is paid for. My roommate Stephen Ramos has my ID card. I want my $3 change and don't know where it is. I go back to the cash/copy machine, kick it open, and take the change that is laying in it. Stephen and a man in the store laugh at me. The man is sitting at a table in a cafe-like area with other people. The hats on clearance are gone. Boxes of Mr. Freezes are on clearance."

I take out a dollar to help Matt pay for it, but he doesn't except my money. A lady asks me where the Doritos are. I work at the store. I look for the Doritos and can't find them. I look around and point the lady to aisle 17, a long way off, where I can see some big bags of chips. The chips I see are generic, not Doritos. Matt and I have other groceries. There are women with us who take the groceries. We go to get our grade school classmate Tiffany Maples' black car. We can't find it right away. There has been a snowstorm. It is cold. Only a few cars are in the parking lot. A turquoise truck and trailer burst through a pile of snow. It is a nice looking, powerful truck. There are two semi-trucks that three men are loading snow into with a bobcat and a snow pusher. Forrest Gump and his girl are in their back yard. There are some dangerous holes filled with snow. The girl falls into a hole, and Forrest gets her out of the hole. I shovel snow out of a hole, down to the dirt bottom. There is another man there wearing glasses. I may be Forrest Gump. I punch Forrest Gump repeatedly. I backhand this man, which is what I am supposed to do. I punch the man many times. He punches me back, but I am unaffected. I am unable to punch him hard. I can make no hard contact to knock him down in one or two blows. I punch him so many times that he becomes a bloody mess. Then I am not Forrest Gump. My hand hurts from punching. A neighbor calls."

I ask the guy if we are having burritos again for dinner tonight. He says yes. There is a woman next to me. We say hi to each other. I ask her where she is living this year, as if I know where she lived last year. She says in the same place. I say ""Oh"", even though I have forgotten where that place is, and don't indicate so. She asks me and I say Tea 2nd. The train is so crowded there are three people in two seats, but I get my own seat. I give the vegetarian guy $5 for a group gift for the professor.

I take it off my tie rack and give it to her. She wants another bracelet too. I want her to leave. Melvin is running around, and is between my bed and the wall. I tell them I need privacy. Ramona wants to look for another bracelet. My sister Heather walks past my room to hers in the hallway wearing a towel, coming from the shower.

He asks students if they would prefer the final to be a Friday or a Monday. He comes up to me and asks what I prefer. I say I prefer the choices on the left half of the board, which include Friday and Monday. We need a partner for the assignments. I'm one of the last people to get a partner, who is a woman named Katie. She has dark skin and hair, a little bit of acne, and slurred speech. No one else wants to be my partner.

He is always talking about how you have to do the right things to get the car started. I'm with my friend Sarah Miller at the house of Steve Baylor, a man I used to deliver the newspaper to in Oak Valley. This house is also the location where my aunt Nisa Redding used to live on 3rd Street in Wilmerton. Both houses are green. Sarah is looking for a place to rent. There is a man and a boy outside the house. A ""For Sale"" sign is by the house. We talk to the people. There are eight bedrooms in the house. There is tall wavy grass that stands straight up. It is very neat and trim. I say that the rent must be around $2,000. We walk back towards the white house next to Steve's house and sit down in two small wooden chairs. We are going to be pulled in the chairs across the snow, which is on Steve's side of the lawn. The grass is on the neighbor's lawn. Sarah, who may be male, picks the head off a flower. There is a man or boy on some kind of motorized vehicle. He takes off on the vehicle, pulling Sarah. I take my chair and go to the sidewalk. They meet me on the sidewalk. I am being pushed by the vehicle, while sitting up on a small wood chair in front of it. Genetic stuff is being scraped off or away while I am being pushed. A person I know from grade school that lives down the road from where we are, Don Olson, is pulling Sarah and pushing me. We talk about fishing. The Olson family is gone.

I am in awe of its huge and massive size. On a smaller peak next to it I see a ski lift and ski slopes. I am so excited! I am happy and I cheer and think that we are going to have so much fun! I am skiing with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling. There are three boxes of cereal and two gallons of milk, one of which is 2%, where we are staying. The milk hasn't been refrigerated and is warm and sour. We seem to be in Australia. There are many lifts to go up the hill on. There is a power quad lift. We go up on a lift. There are then no chairs for the lift, which is a rope or cable that we're hanging on to. It keeps going up with no end in sight. We might not be able to get off. There is another lift near where we are. We are low to the ground. I ask the guys if we should just jump off and go to the other lift. My dad is there. He tells me to wrap the cable around the metal pole that is holding the cable up, so the cable will stop moving. I do this by pulling myself up and stretching and wrapping the cable around the pole. Tension builds as the cable is pulled tighter, without snapping. My coworker Shawn Tryner is there. I tell him to watch out or he could get hurt when the cable snaps. I go up a lift and ski down in deep, powdery snow. Another man is there. I have just gone down an area that I picture to be like Corbet's Coulier in Jackson Hole. The man says something about ""frag"" or a ___, which are puffy snow sculptures of these images on top of the four or five feet of existing snow. He says how he likes how he likes one better, or how one is easier to wipe out or kill. I go through a brick tunnel, past a loading area, to another ski lift. I go past my friend Melanie McDyss, who is waiting for a ski lift. I talk to my friend Norman Noman, who is by the ski lift. It is almost 2:00 pm, and I say I'll meet him down by the chalet for lunch after my next run down. Where we are, part of the slope is grassy. I go to the lift line. I have a snowboard attached to my left foot. I wait, and a young woman comes around me in line. I get on the lift with a woman. We don't talk for a while. Then I say, ""How ya doing today?"" I slur my speech a little bit. I think she is about my age. She replies to my question. I realize she is an older woman, 50 or 60 years old. I didn't realize this earlier. We ride up. There is snow in places and grass in others. It is warm and the snow is slushy. Cows are out on the slopes sitting and grazing. We get to the top. I get off the lift and can't move well because I'm on grass. I had been carrying my skis up in my hand by their tips. I am holding a show chunk that I scooped out of a snow bank on the way up the hill. I want to throw it at a cow, but the woman is there and she would think I'm cruel if I do that. The lady skis well when we get off the lift, even though there is no snow. My classmate Kyle Mendelson is there, wearing roller blades instead of skis. The snow is melting on top of the mountain, and there is a lot of grass. People are looking for a snowy area to ski down the mountain. I have no poles. It is hard for me to move on flat land at the top. There is a frozen lake that we go over. I go by a shed with many brooms and dustpans in it. I think of using the broom handles as poles.

They run and look for someone. I am looking also, but am not in the dream. A horse runs out of the turnstile in the building. I am furious that this has happened! I hold up the small woman in charge by the neck. People are appalled that I do this. I don't care about their reactions: I am furious! I ask what things are doing in front of the building."

I grab him by the head to hurt him, imprint him, and scare him. Sean comes over and stops me from hurting the man. Sean has a big long nose, medium length bowl-cut straight hair, and thick-framed glasses. I threaten the man. I am so angry the computer is in pieces. I feel violated. Two women are there, named Esse and Anna. Esse is a pretty Asian woman. She has long dark hair and a nice smile. I tell the man if he ever comes in here again without knocking I'm going to beat the shit out of him. Sean says no, I won't do this. I call the man a jerk. Sean tries to keep the peace."

I tell the girl there they are mine. She doesn't believe me. I say I can show her a photograph of me wearing the hat: I have one of my brother Wally and I at Brimson where I am wearing the Milton hat. She has a Milton hat too! She says okay. We walk back to my house. We see two of what look like UFO's on the walk back. They are bright lights outlined in the sky that fade into the distance."

I ignore them at first, but then react quickly and punch one man. There is a fight. Among the men fighting are my classmates Alec Johnson, Al Livern, and another man who I know from Brimson. We fight and punch each other. I escape. I am running away. I bite off the finger of the person chasing me and run for the fire escape doors near the end of the gym or field house that I am in. I go towards a baseball field where people are. I am then in an elevator with my friend Bubba Hacker. We are running from my friend Lance Drift and others. I jump down many stairs at once. I am in a locker room with a man who is looking for my friend Niles Zelling because he wants to hurt Niles. I pretend to help the man, but I really help Niles. The man is dumb. I talk loud so Niles can hear us coming and hide. At one pint the dumb man and I actually pass Niles when we are walking."

I am scared at what I might see. The plane is broken, but not disintegrated. The pilot is a pretty young woman who looks like my friend Emily Zates. She is alive: her eyes open. I see her, and tell her that I'll be right there, that I'll get help. I am stalling because I'm scared of getting too close to her. I feel guilty for not helping her right away, so I go up to her in the wreckage and help her. I do what I can. I am afraid the plane could explode."

My classmate Shelly Mac is spilling her drink. My friend Yvette Ullman is on my back, clinging to me for a piggyback ride. She has hairy legs. We're in a room. She talks about her thighs: she is dissatisfied with them. She says they're not okay. I tell her that her thighs are okay: I don't want to dwell on that topic. I count my money. I have more than I should have gotten. Yvette tells me not to count it on her thighs."

The other room has a door connecting it to the room I am in. I wonder if my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is staying in the other room. I looked through the windows earlier but didn't see her. Now there are more people there. I look, and Annie is there. I am excited and nervous to see her. I want to make a good impression. I really want to see her. She is in a class in the room. A woman from my economics class named Tamiska and Zack Morris from Saved By The Bell are in the class also. I want to knock on the door, but she is in class, so I don't.

The movie with her is an important event for him. The movie with him is not important to her. I have an image of her walking in her business suit, very self-righteous, and the man running along trying to catch her and keep up with her, holding flowers, as if she is careless about being late or missing the show."

The fat boy keeps giving me rope. We need six ropes to get the boat in the water. I cut through the crowd, saying excuse me, while I wind up the rope. I say excuse me to twin girls named Mira. I get to the boat, and the fat boy isn't there. There are two women and a man in the boat, which is on the beach. I push the boat off and it promptly sinks. I think it is too heavy.

It is played well, but it seems odd to me because some sexual words or feeling in the song. Each of us needs to pick out a small child from the day care to take with us or to have. I go to do this, and forget the name of my child, a boy, and can't find him. My psychology professor Marianne Stash is in one room with some kids. I feel stupid because I can't remember my boy's name. My friend from high school Marybeth Neumann is there. I don't want to talk to her at all. She shows me the boy that I chose was myself.

The store is selling t-shirts for three or four dollars because they are closing and moving to a new store. The shirts are the thin, worn-in kind that my friend Holly Lapson likes. Tiny steals a shirt. I get in my mom's car and quickly leave. Tiny is in his car, and also leaves quickly. I am not comfortable with Tiny stealing a shirt. After we pull out of the parking lot we are near the round park by McDonalds in Wilmerton, as if we had just pulled out of the McDonalds parking lot."

I am mixing some cookies in with ice cream, stirring them together. My college classmate Jason Sonnefelt walks out of the doors. I expect to give him a ride or go with him, so I expect him to get into my car. The passenger side door is open. He walks by the car and doesn't get in. I am surprised and confused. I close his door and get in my door."

I tell her I'm going to the store to get stuff for an Astronomy presentation. I walk away as I talk to her. I'm trying to by sly, and make my mom accept my statement without questioning me. I'm really not going to the store, and if I am it is not important. I am with two women that seem like play things. They are very flirtatious and giggly and stupid."

He is a very young boy, 12 or 13 years old, with long straight hair. There is a countdown to the vaccine. It is unorganized. Kevin is unorganized. He runs; he has to be somewhere that he isn't. The countdown is at 14 when Kevin starts running. I go by my teacher, who can't count well, and say all different numbers instead of counting down. The vaccine occurs at 20 according to her count. I'm in a classroom as a guest. The class and teacher are friendly. They know I've graduated. I say that I'm back to observe. They say I'm tall. I say I have knee problems. I have a laptop computer that I plug into the socket in back of the desk in front of me. The male teacher, who seems to be the dominant teacher because he is in front of the class, jokes about a dream in which he loses teeth. The kids comment about my height, as does a female teacher. The female teacher says I should take off my shoes to see my height. I don't do this. She says I need to put on more weight, and get wider."
"0810"	"(05/28/1997)"	"Ernest Jones I'm in a small town high school like Barden High School. There are signs up saying half the hallway is closed down for the basketball players. Other hallways say half is closed down for the wrestlers. I like this. I think this is neat. I walk through the hallways. There are small signs outside some doors that have the names of one of the five starting basketball players on them. I see the names for four of the starters near different doors as I walk. They are good players: they score many points. I am looking for Ernest Jones, who is scoring 31 points per game. I somehow see Ernest. I see he is abusive towards his father for breaking a radio. Ernest is a jerk, a bastard. He is white trash. Ernest is a black young man wearing a wife beater. I see him looking washed up with a broom or a newspaper."
"0811"	"(05/28/1997)"	"Sending Letters To Myself I'm with, or am going to meet, my friend Bubba Hacker, who has a new phone number and a new residence. I meet my dad near Bob's Sports Arena in Wilmerton. He has taken a long time: he walked there. I was hoping my dad would get there sooner so I could get in touch with Bubba. There is a basketball game going on at the arena. It seems to be a B-squad game. I have a game that night against Nimen High School. There is a game tomorrow night too against Rival High School. My dad gives me two stamped envelopes with letters in them, addressed to me. I mail them to my house for me. I'm with a man and two women.

"0814"	"(05/30/1997)"	"Meeting A Big Tyler Lawson I walk into the basement of the student union at Brimson and go to the north side of the building. It is the end of the year. There is a party atmosphere. I see my dad sitting at a table. I'm surprised he is there. I go to talk to him. My roommate Stephen Ramos comes up behind me and jokingly pretends to have butt sex with me. I tell him not to since my dad is right there. I go over to the table where my dad is with a group of people eating. The lights in the room are dimmed. I meet my step mom's ex-husband Tyler Lawson, and we shake hands. He has a firm hand shake. I try to give a solid shake as well. He is a big strong man with a beard. My brother Wally is there with our high school classmate Holly Tanks, sitting at a table. Wally kicks the chair out form under Holly and she falls. He is joking. Tyler and I think this is inappropriate. Tyler stands up, which seems to be the polite thing to do, giving Wally a visual reprimanding. I go into the grille and order a Rueben. The grille is like Mason Cafeteria: the man gives me a Rueben on a plate from a big stack of Ruebens. I realize I don't have any money left on my student ID card, so I give the sandwich back. I'm in Billings Hall outside my friends' room. My friend Melvin Dahlheimer walks up the steps and into the room with a man who I think must be his father. Melvin tells me he and his friend they do Chemistry together, so it must not be his father. There is a woman in the room that I see when I enter. I don't know what she is doing there, but they don't pay her much attention. My friends Niles Zelling, Tom Napper and others are making a trip to the east coast: maybe New York or Washington D.C."
"0815"	"(05/30/1997)"	"Tickets For An Alpine Slide I'm in line by myself to get tickets to an alpine slide. There are two lines. I see my grade school friend Patrick Bergman and his sister Heather there. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan is in front of me in line. I feel socially inept for being alone. A person from my high school named Shawn is there. I catch him trying to budge in front of me in line. I verbally reprimand him, but then joke around because he intimidates me and I don't want to upset him. A ticket costs $1.50. I give the woman a dollar and try to slide two quarters off her work desk without her noticing while she is helping the person in front of me. The woman selling the tickets is the short, big gray-haired woman at Mason Cafeteria. She catches me sliding the two quarters and verbally reprimands me. I give her a $5 bill to go along with my dollar to pay for the ticket. She gives me back a bunch of one-dollar bills with a $5 bill on top, some coins, and my ticket! She obviously made a mistake, but I don't say anything and quickly move out of the line. The woman behind me sees the error and says something about it. I try to get away with the money and ticket."
"0816"	"(05/30/1997)"	"Teeth Problems I'm at the dentist. My appointment seems to be in rush. Either the dentist or I don't have much time. It may be the end of the day, a last minute appointment. The dentist is a young blond man, and there is a woman assistant there. They tell me I have teeth problems. I have a lot of plaque, cavities, early gingivitis, etc. They talk about horizontal lines on my teeth that can be felt with a finger if they are clean. I try to feel these lines. I am shocked to hear this because I think I brush my teeth a lot: morning always, night nearly always, and sometimes during the day as well. I floss a couple times a week as well, I say, though actually I know I don't floss this much. I brush my teeth there and spit into the chair. I wipe up the toothpaste spit, and spit the rest into the sink."

They are sliding down the road. There is a trickle of water running over the rood that they use to slide on. I see a slide and hit her head on a big rock. A boy gets hurt too. Later, I learn the final injuries are a girl with a broken arm and a boy with a broken thigh. I think that a broken thigh has got to take a long time to heal. I park my truck and put on the parking brake. The truck starts to roll back towards the class, which is behind the truck! I press the brake but I can't stop the truck from rolling. I bump into the kids behind me. The hill I was rolling down starts to go up, so I stop rolling and settle into the bottom of the valley. I look down at my bright yellow sleeve and see it is soaked with oil. I am next to a lake, which is on the side of the road. I jump into the lake, yelling, to distract people from the fact that I just bumped kids with my truck. I wash my sleeve and all the oil comes out. I dunk my head under the water. I get out of the water and apologize to the teacher and the class for bumping them. I'm the in the woods, and the class is going away. I have an erection that won't go away, even though I just masturbated. I walk with some logs to get rid of them. I see a cute chubby baby boy who is one or two years old. He is standing. I go over and take his hand and walk with him. I realize that he must be a part of me. I pick him up carefully, so as not to make him cry. I realize I am dreaming and am cautious about waking up. I fly with the boy. I go through a small part of our garage at home, and then make it out into the open. I go high in the sky, in the clouds. I can't see far below because of the clouds. I think I might scare the baby if I go too high."

My friends and classmates Nicole Peterson, Wyatt Belzer, Hank Anderson, Norman Noman, Jimmy Youngman, Mya Rousing, and others are there. There is a young kid where we are. It feels like an ice skating warming house with a rubber floor. It is winter, after spring break, and there is snow outside. People are returning. There is a very carefree atmosphere. A salesman is trying to sell the young kid really expensive roller blades. The kid resists buying them, saying they cost too much. The salesman then tries to sell him an expensive CD player. I need to get a ride back home. Hank and Norman have a full car. Mya can give me a ride with her father in 20 minutes. I dance with Hank, Norman, and Nicole. I knock a bowl off the counter top in the house. It is my mom's good china from the wedding. The party is at my house. There are many people there and some injuries. I want everyone to leave. Something bad has happened to my classmate Wyatt Belzer. My friend Sarah Reed and her mother Rachel help to find out what has happened and where he is. I go through big garage doors, and find my gold colored deep diving metal fishing lure on the ground. I'm looking for Wyatt. I go in the house where there are black people, including my classmate Chad Owens and his brother Ron. I go out of the house and the police are coming. I walk nonchalantly to the back of the house and signal for Sarah to leave without me. My classmate Trevor Adams is near the front of my house. I see him and we talk. The tall, crazy, dark, lanky man from Brimson says hi to me like we're buddies. He wants to use my house. I throw a snowball at him, and think he is a fool.

Rachel interviews me second. I say, ""It (the game) is about whoever has the stronger mind."" There is a photograph or video taken. I joke about getting a front-page article written about me, saying that I am strong. The reporter says I am skinny. There is a phone call, an interruption. Music is playing loudly. The police come. I say we're not changing anything because we're not doing anything wrong. The fat old police office can't do anything, and he leaves. There is snow on the ground. People are throwing snowballs. The bass from the radio is playing in the neighbor's driveway. Our music is loud."

My classmate Christian and another man drive me to a place. There is good music in the car. I get carried into the place, which is owned by an older male friend of my friend Kevin Simpson, for a party. Kevin is there with his pants dirty. My friends Bubba Hacker and Sam Kingsley are there.

We rob the same store right after he does. He doesn't have a gun. One of us has a gun. A member of my group holds up the teller while his group robs them. They take all the $5 bills being traced. We hold up the same store right after him. We put a gallon of water and a gallon of lemonade in a blue crate like the ones we use at Fishing Haven. We get the $10 bills. We go outside to a pay phone. We need to call a number and get a phone number, and then call that number. It is a slow and cumbersome procedure.

She hast eh room first, and then I was placed there. Outside the deck-like screen window is a large gray metal tunnel. It is about six feet long and goes to the outside. I see and hear someone coming in. I go over to the window and see my classmate John Thomas climbing in the tunnel with a bunch of guys behind him. When he sees me he stops. I exchange words with the other men, and tell them to leave our place along. One short fat man is particularly belligerent. I can kick his ass. Back in the room, Diane and I are on separate beds and don't say much to each other. It is a little before 3:00 pm. She is trying to rest before we both need to leave at 3:15 or 3:30. I'm watching television. I use the remote control to shit the television off, but it keeps turning back on again as soon as I shut it off! I start to talk to Diane, asking her about the living arrangements at first, since I was just placed here. We start talking about other things. I realize that she looks almost exactly alike my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. Then Diane is Annie and she has made a brief trip to Australia, stopping in Amsterdam first.

"0827"	"(06/06/1997)"	"Sprained My Ankle I have sprained my left ankle. It begins to swell and turn red. Two young men who are trainers or doctors are there. One of them does most of the examining. He looks at my ankle and says it is hot. He presses it in a few places, which hurts. He tells me I have a broken ankle. He shows me what has happened inside my ankle by taking the interior structure out of my right leg. First he pushes some liquid/ice cube-like content and it moves up along my leg from the ankle. He says there should be a different amount of this substance there: that is how he knows it's broken. The interior structure of my right leg consists of thin tubing, a few joints, and a couple of stretched springs in the ankle. The man starts putting these together to show me. I see this and complete the ankle spring system. I explain to the two men, and others who are there, including my old neighbor Natasha Lens, that I have had trouble with this ankle in the past: I sprained it a few years ago. It was a bad sprain in November or December, and then I sprained it again in March. I have been active on my ankle, playing basketball. I tell them it is still sore in the morning when I get up. The doctor who hasn't said much says that it sounds like a misdiagnosis when I first injured it. I say the doctor then told me we could get an X-ray, but I didn't have any money. It is time to leave. There are ants all over the ceiling. I say to everyone the Tarro ant killer is on the shelf of cleaning supplies. I need to bring two cards with me. One card is mine. The other an old woman dropped off for her son, whom is one of the other workers. I ride in my truck towards the driveway of the place. My brother Wally is in the driver's seat. I am in the middle. I tell Wally to drive and while I shift gears. We pull out of the driveway and go west down 3rd Street in Oak Valley past the Milk Stop and some vegetable stands. I am then on Wally's shoulders, and he is carrying me. We go by young wives that are part of the Carter Church Parish. Wally can't carry me anymore, and lets me down. We walk home, up the hill. I am limping. My mom is on a 10-speed bicycle. She comes down the steps and turns to meet us. She asks why I'm limping, but doesn't seem too concerned. I tell her I sprained my ankle."
"0828"	"(06/06/1997)"	"Scoring Skating I'm at an ice skating rink with my roommate Stephen Ramos. It costs $1.75 to rent skates. There are two attendants at the rink. One of them tells me I have to pay 50 cents when I leave for skate rental. I tell him to remind me to do this. I skate around the rink a few times. I am partially in control of my body on skates, partially out of control. One end of the rink has a tight brownish-gray carpet on it. It is easy to skate on the carpet, and it gives me traction. My old neighbor Bill Dinks is the other rink attendant. I nearly collide with him, but we avoid each other. At the non-carpeted end of the rink a person gets points if he or she does tricks or stunts. We are now on roller blades. Stephen is saying in his characteristic way that he is nailing his tricks and getting good scores. I don't really care about what he is saying. After you do tricks you sit back down on a bench and your score for the trick is displayed. Stephen is saying how his scores were in the 700's. I do a bunch of out of control 360-degree spins and get 325 points. I see myself sit down on the bench. I am wearing my red economics t-shirt and I have long hair. The rink is then around my house. I go off the rink onto my neighbors the Trammell's lawn, down the hill in front of their house, across their driveway, and jump off the hill on the other side of their driveway. I roller blade down the sidewalk. My high school friend Jack Miller is there. He jumps over a boat on a skateboard. I go to the intersection of Home Avenue and 2nd Street. There is a nun driving a bus. I think she is driving too slowly. I see my classmate Monique Thorble get dropped off at the intersection of Next Avenue and 2nd Street. She starts walking south on Next Avenue, going home. I roller blade down 2nd Street and turn right on Next Avenue, going south. Monique looks good, as always. I try not to look like I'm trying hard to impress her. There is a woman on roller blades going north on Next Avenue who goes past us. She is wearing a lot of fancy roller blade gear. I turn right onto the Christianson's sidewalk and go behind their house over to Mrs. Shelly's house. I think of jumping off Mrs. Shelly's steps, but instead I ride down them. I cross Home Avenue and skate up the smooth part of our steps. In our back yard is a baby that is with my young neighbors Ricky and Alan Broud. My sister Ramona and my cousins Melvin, Rich, and Melissa Redding have left the baby. I am very disturbed that this has happened. I change the baby's diaper. I am not good at changing diapers. I pull off the old diaper and notice smelly yellow transparent feces. I wipe off the butt and penis of the baby, which is a boy. The baby may start to get an erection when I do this. The clean diaper is made of cloth. I get the diaper on the ground and want to have the baby sit on it so I can wrap it around his waist. The grass is freshly cut and some blades of grass keep getting on the diaper before the baby sits down. I learn that the reason Ramona and my cousins aren't here is that our cars have been crushed. Someone hit the parking brake on a vehicle and our car and the two cars from their family collided. My classmate Ted Fitz drives up in a new used car, which is a gray convertible. It is the replacement car."

We are going to improvise in the concert. It seems we're on the Thru Highway in Wilmerton near Armstrong High School heading towards my ex-girlfriend Annie's house. This is a big concert with many performers. I walk down some very steep stairs to get there. Parents and friends of other performers are walking there too. There is soda spilled on some steps, and I warn people to watch out for this. In the room where people prepare their act are my friends Melanie McDyss, Kevin Simpson, Carmen Allure, and others. My classmate Tom Dement is there, later. Kevin does a skit that ends with a big piece of artificial feces. I laugh out loud from my place on the side of the stage. It is like the Talent Show at Armstrong High School."
"0830"	"(06/06/1997)"	"Muriah Dinks Chases Me There is a small gathering that seems to be at Hill Park in Oak Valley. People have the option of seeing some kind of show. If they see the show they must laugh at it all, even if it isn't very funny. There are some Chinese people who toast their friend or relative who is on stage. My high school classmate Muriah Dinks is there. She chases me around flirtatiously. I escape from her into a bathroom. I urinate for a long time. There is the threat of her entering the bathroom because she knows I'm the only person in it. In a smaller group two people are naked and are having sex in an odd position."
"0831"	"(06/07/1997)"	"My Truck Is Hit I'm at home at Fishing Haven. An alarm goes off. My roommate Sean Williams talks a long time to get up. I get up too. I am working later in the day. I put on my brown corduroy pants, green J-Crew shirt, and blue sweatshirt. There is a dry erase board with a picture of my truck on it. The bumper of my truck has been damaged in a hit and run accident. The bumper is now rubbing the tire. I am mad! I go look at the damage."
"0832"	"(06/07/1997)"	"Salty Annie I am at or going to my friend Emerald Reinhold's house. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there. I kiss her. Her mouth tastes bad: salty. She pulls back, like she does not want to kiss me. This baffles me. Later, she does kiss me, but then I am not interested in kissing her."
"0833"	"(06/07/1997)"	"Mark Long and Overflowing Toilet My friend Mark long is at my house with my brother Wally and I. There is a babysitter. We are in a hurry to get to church. Wally and Mark go into the bathroom and then come out. I go into the bathroom and urinate into the tank of the toilet. I urinate on the little toilet ""rugs"" and decorations, staining them. I pick up some cloths and wipe off the toilet. The toilet has overflowed. I urinated for a long time. A blue shirt is clogging the toilet causing it to overflow. There is a bar of soap in the shirt. There is a lot of laundry in the basement."

There is a formula for measuring the thickness based on one measurement. Something in the formula is _. My friend Jill Banks is in the class. I sit in a corner. There is a metal shelf system that partially blocks Jill's view of me. My classmate Todd Murphy is there. Greg asks for any questions. My hand and arm are lying across my forehead, like I do when I fall asleep, but I don't have a question. Greg looks at me, but seems to know that my arm is up because it's comfortable for me, not because I have a question. I hoping he doesn't call on me. There are no questions. He then gets the test scores out. I get a 96 on the final, which is the top score! My upper teeth are pressing down on my bottom lip. I associate with Jill and Todd. I can't talk because of my lip and teeth. I feel like I am getting sick: I have a dry cough. But I think I'm not getting sick. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas in the hallway. I'm at lunch in the Brimson grille. I see my economics professor Zoe Madden there. She congratulates me on my good geology grades. I say thanks. I ask her what happened to my economics grade: why I got an A-. She says I failed the final test, but I went to class, to the extra sessions, and I did well on the other tests so I got an A-. I'm getting orange juice. Kari Cutting, a psychology professor, is there. She asks me if I have a boyfriend, but I know she means a girlfriend. I say no. She asks if I'll wait with her at the bus stop. There are sexual intonations in her question. Though I am not interested in her, I agree to wait with her. There is no juice in the grille so I tell her I'll wait for her in the hall by the juice machines. I'm in a car with George Costanza from the television show Seinfeld. He is driving. I'm thinking of writing down my dreams, which involve a Seinfeld episode. We're near a college like the University of Montana. He is going to the university for a visit. I tell him I forgot about Kari Cutting at the bus stop so I need to go back right now! He refuses to go back, and won't return to drop me off. I make a huge fuss over this. I kick him, hit him, and yell at him furiously. My black and blue sunglasses fly out of the car and land on the road ahead of us as we slow down. A lens on the glasses cracks like the pattern of a spider web, and gets scratched. I blame George for this. We turn back. I'm on a bicycle on Superhighway 100, and am going to take the Superhighway 200. I'm going slowly on the bicycle, and there is about a mile before the exit for Superhighway 200. I pass a semi truck that is parked. I am in a semi truck. I go into a large truck yard. My friend Jerry Parsons from Fishing Haven is there driving a huge truck. He has stolen it for a joyride. I think this is bad. He drives with another man. Eventually I drive the truck too. It is an 8-wheel dump truck. I drive for a bit and decide I'm refreshed. I decide to leave. The man and Jerry try to stop me from leaving. I take my green shirt and dark blue sweatshirt from the building when I leave. The building is a house that is used for cleaning."
"0836"	"(06/09/1997)"	"The Good Miners There is a map and a story of some miners. The map shows how they set up their land and sifted the soil for something. They would work every day, go out and have fun at night, and then work the next morning. The police never had any problem with the miners."
"0837"	"(06/09/1997)"	"Story Of A Trout There is a story of a trout. It may be a movie or a film. There is a disappearing boat or person. It is fake television show, but is kind of neat. Lake trout are swimming and jumping like dolphins, eating each other."
"0838"	"(06/09/1997)"	"Breakdown I call my friend Kevin Simpson's house and leave a message for him with his sister Melissa about going to the Big Resort Area this fall. I am with Kevin in a canoe near river water. My high school classmate's father Gary Lind is there. I talk with Kevin about the Big Resort Area and about the trip. I say it will be two weeks: September 1st- whenever, and we'll go from Woodsville to the Backcountry Highway. He is skeptical about the trip. We leave and kick paddle our canoes back to a house. We do this by leaning our legs out the back end of the canoes while lying on our stomachs, and kicking. We get to the house. Kevin's father Dilbert Simpson is there. He scolds us for kicking our canoes past Gary. He says Gary was fishing and we shouldn't have disturbed him. We walk up the shore a little ways. Kevin nods and says yes, accepting what his father has to say. I tell Dilbert off. I say it makes no difference whether he is fishing or not. Kevin is standing there wishing I would shut up and shaking his head as if to say, ""No! Don't say it!"" But I go on. I say to Dilbert, ""Whether you are grilling and a boat goes by, who cares? I don't like you! You are cold and impersonal. One can turn to you for any work problem: to fix a boat, car, wall, or anything, but not to deal with people."" Dilbert is agitated but remains poised. He says, ""I'll borrow a phrase"", as if he is too good to use normal language. He says, ""I'm pissed off!"" He is mad at me. I say to him, ""Kiss my ass! I don't give a fuck what you think or feel! You don't know crap!"" Dilbert is flabbergasted. He is hurt and speechless. He says nothing in the wake of my angry venting. There is nothing he can say. Kevin is hurt too. He doesn't want me to talk this way. I go to my truck in the alley at home in Oak Valley. It is dark outside. There is a yellow car behind me as I go down the alley hill. The truck moves before I start it. I put it in 2nd gear when I do start it because I'm already moving. Dilbert and Kevin are inside my house saying goodbye. They are about to leave. I'm in front of the house with my mom, sister Ramona, uncle Rusty Redding, and my cousin Melvin Redding. I am going back to the Big Resort Area. It is my day off. I shake hands with Rusty, saying goodbye. My car is a green Volkswagen Beetle with a trailer attached. There is a clip missing for the windshield wiper on the passenger side. Rusty adjusts the clip that is on the driver's side windshield wiper. My mom and I share a hug and kiss. I kiss her on the cheek and on the lips. This is strange: I haven't ever kissed mom on the lips. It feels almost incestuous, uncomfortable. I tell them I've got a lot of driving to do for a tired guy, and that I'll get some caffeine when I get gas. I ask my mom to stay and talk with me a bit before I leave. She does, and the others leave. I tell her about Kevin and what happened with he and Dilbert. I am upset over this. Ramona is there. I let her stay and listen to us talk: who cares if she is there, I think. I start to drive very slowly. I say I've got to do some work on that dream, recognizing that what happened with Kevin and Dilbert was a dream. I start to cry. I stop the car on Home Avenue. I yell out loud and cry! It is very emotional for me. I leave the car there. I have a strong need to work on the dream. I quickly say to my mom to take care of the car. I run back home to work on the dream. The dream is calling me."
"0839"	"(06/10/1997)"	"Atomic Bombs Drop I'm in the back yard at home. I have a pistol with three bullets and three chambers in the gun. George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld, from the television show Seinfeld, are there. I pull the trigger and the gun goes ""click"": It won't fire. I unload and reload the gun. I keep pulling the trigger, sometimes with two of the three bullets in different positions: ""click"", no shot. We see the northern lights. I realize the lights are actually many big planes above. I think it is a crop duster leaving trails. I get my parents, who are inside cooking dinner. The planes are very low and are in a very neat flying pattern. One plane shines a light down in our back yard. I am in the illuminated spot at first, and then I run out of the spotlight. It is like a light from an alien spaceship. An object drops from a plane. I know it is a bomb. I run and hide next to the red brick wall separating my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard and the adjacent house. I crouch down and cover myself. There are many atomic bombs dropping all over. One bomb lands in the back yard of the yellow house on the corner of 2nd Street and Hill Avenue. I am running by when it hits. Everything is destroyed, including me. I see the bomb's energy raze the area. Dirt lifts up into the air from the impact, like sawdust bouncing on a workbench when a hammer is pounding the bench."
"0840"	"(06/10/1997)"	"Eating With Ron Owens I'm eating with high school classmate's younger brother, Ron Owens. I turn away to do something. When I turn back, I think Ron or his buddy has done something to my plate of food, of which not much is left. I scrape the food off the plate with my finger and throw it away. My classmate Nick Schreder is there, and I'm eating with him. He is a wrestler. We talk about him wrestling someone and doing very well."
"0841"	"(06/10/1997)"	"Playing Right Guard I'm playing football. It seems that my arms are going out the sleeves of my jersey crookedly, or my shoulder pads are too big. People are tossing the ball around warming up. I want to play tight end. I get assigned to play right guard. I go and tell my classmate Bud Slick, who is the right tackle, to move over because I'm the right guard. The linemen must lie flat before the snap, then get on all fours, then up on their toes as the play is called. I'm not quick enough to do this. I'm still on my knees when the ball is snapped. On the first play the man I am defending helps tackle the quarterback. On the next play I block well, keeping three men off the quarterback. We score a touchdown! The coach tells me I did a good job blocking."
"0842"	"(06/10/1997)"	"Playing Tom Gugliotta I am having a contest with Tom Gugliotta. I recognize him but he has a different name. Before we begin, one of the female teachers I have had in the past indicates to Tom that she thinks I can rebound better than he can. We keep track of points and rebounds. We use a beach ball-like ball. We're in a tiny room. Before we start I tell Tom that it's not how high you jump that makes you a good rebounder. I say I'm a good rebounder because I know how to use my body in rebounding. I block some of his shots. I'm playing better than he is, and I outrebound him. There is a marathon going on in a cafeteria-like area that seems to be at Brimson College. There are many senior students there, who are tan and stylish, just sitting around. I run in this race. People look at me, and I look at them. One woman thinks I'm looking at her because I'm attracted to her. While she isn't unattractive, I'm looking at her because she is a senior. The marathon is run clockwise around this place. A man who worked in Mason Cafeteria as a cook is yelling out to students that are in back of the line, asking them if they want some food item, which may be turkey. They have hot turkey, which looks appetizing."
"0843"	"(06/10/1997)"	"Big Resort Area Fishing Farm There is a fishing camp up where I am somewhere in the Big Resort Area. The camp has huge shallow ponds filled with different types of fish. I see many northern pike ponds that are about an acre large. There are a lot of dead fish floating, but many more alive in the pond. People go here to fish, and pay by the pound for the fish they catch. There are price boards in the little store there, for how much it costs to fish. I meet a man that works at the store who is about my age. I think that I'd love to have his job. He says something to me about two-on-two volleyball, which some of the summer employees in the Big Resort Area were going to do. I ask him how big the fish are in the ponds. He says they get three pound smallmouth bass, and that the northern pike don't get very big: they eat fast or something like that. I see his living quarters, which are simple and neat. An older man tells him to use his shotgun to fix part of one of the cabins or houses there. The young man shoots a grenade-like bomb into a window, which blows up the room it lands in. I don't think he realizes what happened. I get a note later saying that it was blown up."
"0844"	"(06/10/1997)"	"Fishing at Carter School I'm fishing at Carter School. My old classmate Gino Teavor and others are playing a World Series baseball game. When there is a break in the game the team goes off the field, by me. Gino thanks me for coming to the game. I catch a nice three-pound smallmouth bass in a lily pad pond on a jitterbug. I get my rod, tackle box, fish on a stringer, and leave. I go on a red bicycle. I had a pile of stuff, including a pair of new hiking boots that I haven't worn yet. My schoolmate Laurel Kipp and a girl are talking about their mothers, who are there. They are saying how they are like their mothers. My brother Wally is there. I fish in a tiny pond. A bass follows my lure. It inhales my lure, and I jerk the rod. The lure comes right out of the fish's mouth. I try to hook the fish, and can't. On the back side of the school near the kitchen is an aquarium. I try repeatedly to hook a bass there. I hook a tropical fish. I take the fish out of the aquarium. It is strange and puffy looking. The cleaning man from Mason Cafeteria at Brimson is there. I put the fish back in the water because it wouldn't be good to eat."

She yells at me and says she'll be mad at my for a long time for saying I think we should see other people when we left school this spring. I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona. We're in an airport with a walk ramp. My mom goes to a movie. It is an action movie with a one-word title, like ""Predator"" or something. I walk home from the rally, which was at the Uptown Theater in Oak Valley. I'm with Ramona. Three teenagers walk by. One of them has a spray-type pellet gun. I bump into one of them. They shoot me. It doesn't really affect me much. They shoot me again. I beat the three of them up very badly. There seems to be four of them, one of whom I don't beat up. The police come to the Uptown Mall. I run and leave Ramona behind. I go over a fence and down along 3rd Street. I go through yards and porches of houses. The houses are surrounded by water. I jump, climb, and crawl from house to house on porches. Homosexuals and drug addicts occupy the houses. I get to a house that I'm familiar with. It is the Brew Ha Ha House. It seems like my classmate Jake Fowler from Brimson has lived there. I get into the house through a window or door in the basement."

I'm drinking orange soda. Someone is building a canoe with scrap wood. People can dig through wood. Students do something first, and then citizens. This might be building a canoe."
"0848"	"(06/12/1997)"	"Failing Carter School Calculus I'm at Carter School, where I went to grade school. I go to the front door. It is locked. I forgot something inside the school. My high school classmate Nancy Meyer and someone else come down the stairs and turn down another hallway, but they don't open the door for me. The door is then unlocked by itself. I go in. I see my classmate Persia Miko. She sees that I got a 96 on a test. She says I did ____ (I forget). My friend Esther Thurman comes out of the Billie's Daycare bathroom down the hall. I didn't know she was there. I'm in a calculus class that is on the 2nd floor of the building. A teacher I know from middle school, Mr. Thompson, is the teacher. He is a jerk. I know I'm going to do poor on the test. I'm not following along with the homework, and I really don't care about it. My high school classmate Connie Rodes is there. She is doing well in calculus. She shows me at the beginning of the chapter where the author of our textbook writes that the pace of the work can change for the student: some can go quicker and others slower."
"0849"	"(06/13/1997)"	"Lost My Books I'm at some sort of gathering. My high school classmate Chad Owens is there. I talk to him. He jokes about his girlfriend, who is a short, skinny woman. The gathering ends. It seems like, or it is, a Teen Variety Night that I would go to in junior high. A lot of people from my high school class are there. People leave quickly. I go to the room where people's shoes are. I can't find my boots. I look all over and can't find them. Something may happen with my Grandpa and Grandma Redding: it may be their house. They say someone's shoes always get stolen."
"0850"	"(06/13/1997)"	"Flame Gun I'm sitting around at an outdoor cafe. Some people there are on two opposing teams. One man is shot, and he disappears into thin air. A man on the dead man's team shoots a flame out of his gun, spraying the crowd. All the opposing players that are in disguise disappear. There are two or three of them."

I see my friends Hank Anderson, Norman Noman, and another person walking on the side of the road. I honk the horn and pull into a picnic-like wooden shelter that is there. I shake hands with these guys; it's nice to see them. Hanks asks if he still owes me five dollars. I tell him no: forget about it. His mother drives up my friend Jack Thigpen in a station wagon. She is looking at a road map that has lines drawn around, or to, the Big Resort Area. Jack joins us. He has a tiny baby doll. He leaves it there when he goes away from where we are for a little while."
"0852"	"(06/13/1997)"	"Autofellatio 9 I'm masturbating without my hands, just by thrusting my pelvis. My sister Ramona is sleeping on the living room floor. I go in the bathroom from the floor of the dining room. I stroke my erect penis, and a little bit of semen comes out. I suck the semen off the head of my penis. The toilet breaks: it falls off the bolts. I put it back, but it is not bolted down to the floor, just sitting in position. I'm outside in the bed of my truck that is parked in the front driveway at home. I'm masturbating by thrusting my pelvis. I'm going to give myself fellatio when I ejaculate. My uncle Rusty Redding is a postman. He walks by and waves on his way to delivering the mail. I think I'd better be careful: he might have seen me."

The flight and meeting times have changed because an heir to one of the professors is going with. My classmate Jim Barry is going again as a helper. A man who makes a living as a clown is going. I see some of the face of the people who are going. People are on two school buses. One is a short bus, and the other a long bus. I'm on the long bus. The driver is a black man with curly short frizzed out hair. He is listening to some oldies music. He seems laid back, and I like him. A car and the two buses are being chased. They are cornered in an alley by a strong gate that the buses can't break through. It seems like the downtown Wilmerton Post Office area, behind the building. One cowboy-like man runs at the gate, as if to knock it down, but it is then open, and when he jumps to kick it, he falls on his back. There is not a chase anymore. We are trying to get the gate opened."
"0854"	"(06/13/1997)"	"Tina's Shitty Trip I'm in a lounge. My friend from high school Tina Totts is in the kitchen next door. I'm horny, and I think of having sex with her because she has sex with everyone and it would be easy. I ask her how her trip to Mexico was. She says it was shitty. They got stuck with some crappy tours. She looks different. She is shorter and has a wide mouth with lipstick on. She has a big smile. She has short, wavy hair, like the woman Krista that my friend Hank Anderson was dating a few weeks."

I see a middle-aged married couple walking down Old Avenue. The man is wearing a tie. He may be a professor. The campus is active, like there is party occurring. I see my childhood friend Ray Jackson. He is running back to a waiting car on the Old Ave frontage road after looking for someone. I wander around. I get tapped on the butt or the back with a branch. I turn and see that my roommate's old girlfriend, Nora. We talk a bit and I ask her how her summer was. She says it went well. I'm glad she had a good summer. She asks me if I'm going to the bathroom. I say no, not right now. She says she asks me this because my shirt is tucked into my jeans and my white brief underwear. The elastic strap on my underwear is visible outside of my jeans. I am embarrassed, but say, ""Oh well, no big deal."" I walk back towards my room, which seems to be towards Tea Hall. The buildings are old and made of brick with vines on them. There is a garden. I walk into it thinking I'll go through on my way home. There are big red tomatoes that are picked and stacked in long rows and piles. This is my friend Holly Lapson's class garden for her Plant Physiology class. A biology professor named Kim Sands is at the desk of the garden. I sneak through the garden, thinking it will be a short cut. I pick up a tomato and start to eat it. I am in rafters, up high. I need to be very careful so I don't fall. The rafters I am standing on shakes. I need to find a way out. I call Kim on the phone to distract her so I can get out. I say something about a quart of mayonnaise. I slide down a 2x4 piece of wood, then slide down a rope, and then run. I get to a corner of a building. I see there is only one-way exit, which is the way I came in. Kim Sands is then my psychology professor Marianne Stash. Marianne comes looking for the person in the store, which is I. I hide among racks of clothes. I try to escape out the entrance. I hide and run, trying to be stealthy. Marianne finds me. I don't try to run away. She sees it is I. I tell her I needed a Christmas ball-type ornament, but it was too expensive, so I put a dent in one and either bought it cheaper or stole it. I probably stole it. Now I have more money, so I wanted to take the dent out and return it."

Among them are my friends Bubba Hacker, Sam Kingsley, Wyatt Belzer, my roommate Stephen Ramos, and others, including some women. They come and greet us. There is a pause before Sam and I greet each other. We are assessing the changes that we have gone through since last seeing each other. There is a cabin at Mud Lake. I'm staying there with friends. There is a lot of sex going on that night. I see Sam, Kevin, and Stephen's erections and compare them to my own in terms of length and thickness. I see one of them grabbing onto two trees, posing. The overhanging bookshelf in the dining room at home in Oak Valley falls. Everyone is safe, but narrowly. At the cabin, there is very hot incense. I burn it, put some fort of a cookie around it, and people eat the cookie off my leg when the cookie is soft and mushy. In the morning I get up at the cabin. I may have been with someone that night. I'm naked. I open the window. It is cold and snowy outside: there is a blizzard. My high school friend Marybeth Neumann is there. I know that my dad is gone and that his house is empty for two weeks. I think I should take advantage of the empty house. I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas at home in Oak Valley. We go upstairs to my sister Ramona's room. There is a bed off to the right of the two main windows. There are two blankets and no sheets on the bed. A few of my friends are downstairs but won't disturb us. I give Annie cunnilingus, and then we have sex. She seems a bit uncomfortable. She has betrayed me. She got involved with another man this summer. I want to ask her if they had sex with him, but I don't ask. His name is Mr. X. He has to come to her house for something, as if she is pregnant and they need to deal with that. She shuts off the lights in the room, so she doesn't have to look at me. We lay there. I shut the music off, but it keeps playing. I shut it off again. I hold her off to one side. She is not feeling what I feel, not acting, and not responding. I recognize this, but don't want to accept it"

I see the interview on television. I think I have a flat face. During the interview I talk about me lobbing the ball over and then having it smashed back at me. I make noises during the interview to illustrate this."

I realize I am dreaming and I can breath underwater. (I am not fully lucid, but have a degree of lucidity in the dream)."
"0859"	"(06/15/1997)"	"Tanya Simmons In My Dream I'm at Brimson. I see my high school classmate Tanya Simmons, who looks like another woman and has freckles. She has light brown hair. I tell her she was in a dream I had. A woman is leaving for a golf tournament. My classmate Kory Reynolds is there. He is leaving too, though he has forgotten something and goes to get it. I walk up stairs. My old teammate Tony Kramer is jokingly bumping my butt, to get my attention. We are in a crowded cafeteria. There are long lines for breakfast. My mom is there. We were at a table, but she comes over to me with my stuff, so we are moving, I guess. I think they should have more than one serving line, or have several serving areas. It looks like they might have this, but they don't."
"0860"	"(06/15/1997)"	"No Plug In On Airplane I'm at an airport. It is snowing heavily. Snow is sticking to parts of the glass windows. I Think people may not be able to see. There is no plug in on the plane for my laptop computer. I may be flying to Australia."
"0861"	"(06/16/1997)"	"Lucid Pushing Mike My boss at Fishing Haven Mike Hollow says something to me about doing something with or on the 24th or 25th floor. We are near water, on a dock. Mike is wearing a life jacket. There is a spot on the right shoulder of his jacket that is missing. It is as if someone took a bite out of the life jacket. This is my cue that I am dreaming: I realize I am dreaming. I push Mike off the dock and under the water."
"0862"	"(06/16/1997)"	"Returning To Australia There is another trip to Australia. More people are going. The night before I go I call my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. She isn't there and I talk to her sister Jessica. Jessica says Annie is leaving soon. She is rude on the phone, as if Annie is too good to talk to me on the phone. My brother Wally is going to Australia. I'm with my parents. We're leaving at the same time as the last trip to Australia: 11:00am. It is 9:30am now. It takes one and a half hours to get to the airport, because we're in Wilmerton. I have not yet packed, and am not prepared for the trip at all. I've waiting until the last minute thinking I've done this before and it's no big deal. I run with my dad to get ready. I have him pack near the inside corner of the L-shaped building where I live, which may be a school. My high school classmate Wyatt Belzer runs along side of me. I'm in a job employment office. It turns out that we leave at 5:00pm, not 11:00am. I look for my name on a card, to get some information about the flights. My cousin Rich Redding is going. I talk to a man about a job. He knows I am interested in sleep and dreams. My classmate Rebecca, from Brimson, is there. I have a long thin line of burned skin on my left arm. It is like a scar, but it is raised up. I'm at home, and the answering machine is flashing indicating eight messages. Wally is there and is all packed up. He tells me to check message number 11 on the machine. My mom's voice recorded the outgoing message, which I hear. On it, she confuses Wally and I, mixing up what we are doing in our lives. I'm with my mom. We are walking and talking in a large house. My aunt Sheila Redding is there watching television. I am sleeping in a room. It may be the night before we leave. My dream notebook is full of holes from a pen when I awaken! I am very angry when I see this! I tell my mom, and explain I want to use these dreams for a book. She comments, but seems not to care, implying I can have more dreams and use those dreams."
"0863"	"(06/16/1997)"	"Lucid Becky Long I'm with my friend's sister Becky Long. She has red hair. I seem to know this is a dream. I smile and chuckle: this is a funny situation. I realize it is a dream. I kiss Becky, and then I give her cunnilingus. (There is more to the dream but I forget how it ends)"
"0864"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Humoring Persia Miko My high school classmate Persia Miko and some other women are doing a funny little production, including me. It is written out on a piece of paper like a personality profile, but not in content. It is all for fun. I play around and go along with it. My high school classmate Carmen Allure is there. She tells me she is now at University of Montana-Dillville for medical school, or that she planning to go to medical school after she gets out of the University of Montana. My high school classmate Anne Trapper is there. She tells me she is now at the University of Montana-Dillville and will graduate in a year. She went there because she can get it all done in a year and graduate. I see my classmate from Brimson Jimmy Youngman. He talks with me about Australia, and wants me to go with him. He says I'll have to pay the difference between my deposit for the study abroad program and the total cost of the trip. I tell him I'll already be in Australia on the study abroad program."
"0865"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Naked Dishwashing I'm with my coworker Jenny working at Fishing Haven. We're in the back room. She is washing dishes, and I'm supposed to dry them. I am naked. I dry some dishes while I am naked. I am not totally embarrassed, but am a bit uncomfortable since I'm the only one that is naked. I decide to get dressed. I walk into the packing room from the back room where we were doing dishes. I put on my red underwear, which are all stretched out and full of holes. I woman is on the phone and can see me. I pull my underwear up and adjust them as best I can."
"0866"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Miles Nanger's Long Tie I'm in Lakeville with some people driving in a car. The city is much bigger than it really is. In the car is a woman describing to me who a person named Matt Bateman is. He goes to Brimson but I can't think of whom he may be. My friend Tom Napper is there, and says Matt Bateman ran cross-country with him. My sister's grade school playmate Belinda Bark is in the car. We drive down a street. It is winter. The road is covered with slush and snow. I see two Nanger brothers that are dressed up for the prom. They are wearing long overcoats. Miles Nanger's tie is very long, almost down to his knees. I comment on how long it is, and say I went to school with him. I se a photograph processing center and remember I have some photographs to pick up. I say this and we go to get them. I get two packages of photographs. My package costs $17, and my roommate Sean Williams' costs $3. I am very surprised at this. I think it should be the other way around because Sean had the fancy processing done, not I. I look and the package that the woman said was $17 is mine: I see a photo of grandma Redding."
"0867"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Computer Fishing Contest There is a fishing contest game on a computer. A line is on the screen, which is the shore. A player casts and fishes by extending a line on the screen. Someone says you've got to work the shore well. Then I am in a country area. I am shirtless and my farmer tan is prominent. This is a punishment for something, but it doesn't seem to be a bad punishment. I see Herb, the long time Fishing Haven customer. He says he got two small fish."
"0868"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Giant Mosquitoes There are giant mosquitoes around me. They are huge: as big as a golf ball or a tennis ball! I hit some of them trying to kill the, but they don't die."
"0869"	"(06/17/1997)"	"A Ski Bog I am snowboarding on a ski slope. My roommate Stephen Ramos is there. He is being a jerk. There is a competition between us. He goes down the hill, jumps, and cracks his snowboard. I am cautious about taking another lift farther up the hill. I see my classmate Amy Leopard on a ski lift. I go down the hill out of control, spinning and going backwards and forwards. At the bottom of the hill my classmate Alec Johnson is there. We joke around and wrestle. I wonder if I'll see him again. I have a flat football for a lift ticket. I see my high school classmate Lyle Zeffman and some other guys at a table when I rid the lift up. My high school classmates Kari Otis and Carol Derth are on a ski lift. I am about midway up the mountain. I go across the hill because I don't want to ski down, but I don't want to go up any higher either. I go by a sled race area. Two people in plastic sleds race down tracks, like ski racing. There is a big drift area, which is a bog, and is dangerous to go in. I new truck is parked near this bog. I don't go into the bog, but walk away from it. I man in line for the race or the lift makes fun of me. I say to him, ""Hey mate, shut the fuck up!"" I go up on a lift. I try to get on a chair with some women but they go ahead of me and I am not quick enough. I ride up the lift alone. My old classmate Gino Teavor is then on my chair. Our classmate Bud Slick and two women are a few feet in front of us in a chair. We talk about fishing. Gino has several small spinners in his hat or somewhere. As we ride up the lift there is very little snow, and grass is everywhere. Gino points out a broken light bulb. I don't want to go up farther to the more difficult hills, but I do."
"0870"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Sue's Sweatshirt I'm with my brother Wally at home. There is a broken light bulb. He has a kit to fix it. My mom is gone. A woman named Sue calls. She asks for Sue. I say she must have the wrong number. She doesn't have the wrong number. She is calling about her sweatshirt. Wally and this woman have a formal date. The shirt she is calling for is at the mall being cleaned or embroidered."
"0871"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Catching Toads I'm fishing with my dad, my sister Ramona, and Tom, my co-worker from Fishing Haven. We're on a porch in school. Around the porch is shallow, weedy water that we fish in. We catch toads and frogs. The toads are three or four inches long and wide: very big. I am going to hook a toad, and then it is a lure, and I try to thread a huge orange and yellow jig head into it. The jig (I think, or the toad?) cracks. Cancer is the worst epidemic of the century. I hear something about Ebola, and how fast it is spreading. My dad is on the phone. I catch a toad in a net, and then a frog. My friend's father, Brian Otis, is there, walking around to the neighbor's houses, surveying. I tell him to be careful that he doesn't scare the frog and the salamander under the porch that he is standing on, because we're trying to catch them."
"0872"	"(06/17/1997)"	"Lucid Crushing Beast I'm in prison. Some black men and some when men are arguing. There is tension between them. The black men are the aggressors. They are angry, they say. They want more rights, and want the white men to go back to Europe. One black man punches and kicks some of the white men in the face. He crushes them, smashing their skulls and popping their heads. He turns into a fire-breathing beast with horns! He is about 15 feet tall, a huge monster! Everyone runs. When I run he comes after me and grabs me with one of his arms. He is going to hurt or eat me. I realize I am dreaming. I break free of his grasp and crush him by clapping my hands around him, flattening him like a pancake between my hands. Since I am dreaming I pick up a picnic table and try to break it in half. At first I can't do this, but then I do. I think I should be more productive in my dream, so I fly. I run and jump, and get very low to the ground, but I do fly. I want to ejaculate, so I imagine myself having sex as I float on my back. Then I lie on my stomach and rub or thrust against the ground. I'm near Carter Church in Oak Valley. My friend Ivory Alshire goes by on roller blades. At this point I have lost my lucidity. I go into the north side door of the church. There are oranges piled up that have greenish growths on them. I go into a meeting of education with social leaders there. It is like a city council meeting. I offer words of advice, which are well taken. There is a black man in a green suit in front of me. There is some odd black stitching on the collar of his suit. There are two women next to me that are vigorously taking notes. People are talking about education. The speaker or leader says PET boxes aren't even available to high school teachers through public funding. These PET boxes contain each student's academic history. The issue debated is how to fund everything."
"0873"	"(06/18/1997)"	"Gary Redding's Tie I'm talking with my uncle Gary Redding. We close the door on a semi truck. There is a ladder that has rungs that are split in half and won't stay connected because a piece is missing. Gary and I walk back home from the area around the Chinese Buffet in Oak Valley. He has a pornographic magazine. We walk past where the old Corner Cafe was. He talks about shipping neckties at least two days in advance of a big event. I get down to where my neighbor Donald Branson used to live. My uncle Rusty Redding is there. As I walked to his spot a little girl passed me up walking. My cousin Melvin Redding is there. Rusty is outside the house building a clothesline."
"0874"	"(06/18/1997)"	"Bug River Launch I'm landing at Bug River in the Big Resort Area with another person. I go down stairs and paths. There is a small, very neat stream. We're supposed to load at the bank of the building that is there. We wait for the party to arrive. Then I'm going on a trip with my friends Nate Nelling, Beth Mock, and another person. There are two stairway paths: a long one going down and a short one going up. Katie W. Egge is the party we're supposed to launch. She reminds me of the large woman named Katie that I worked at Subway with. We're supposed to launch. We have a 17-foot lightweight aluminum canoe and a yellow Mad River canoe. Beth and the fourth person say they want to get strong, so we should portage a lot. They help carry the packs in. I take the Mad River Canoe. The 17-foot lightweight breaks up into three sections. I say we've got to carry it whole in order to get strong. I think we're headed towards Crescent Lake or Rock River. My mom is there taking photographs. There is a party to our left with Chinese people in it. Three of them are drinking red wine and getting their photograph taken. The three drinking wine stand up and raise their glasses and yell when they get their photograph taken. My mom turns to take our photograph. A Chinese man who has puffy, layered, hair sprayed hair obstructs my mom's view of me. My mom takes a photograph as we smile. She moves only her arm to the left, holding the camera in her hand, to take another. She waits a long time before taking it. I get tired and stop smiling. There is no ""click"" for the photograph."
"0875"	"(06/18/1997)"	"Wally's Wedding My brother Wally is getting married. We're at home preparing for the wedding. Wally comes and expresses his concern that no one is there yet. Grandma Redding is there, using a cane or a walker. I go to the bathroom. When I return, the ceremony is over, and they have just been married! I have missed my brother's wedding! Photographs are taken. I kneel down next to my cousin Melvin Redding."
"0876"	"(06/18/1997)"	"Two Bears Fighting Two bears are fighting on the side of a mountain. One is black and the other is brown. It is winter. I get close and watch the bears, but I am scared and drive away in my truck. There are two bears with cubs there."
"0877"	"(06/18/1997)"	"Selling Drugs to Porn King I'm driving my truck in mud and gravel. My classmate Bethany Hurwitz is watching me. I am selling drugs to a man. I try to act cool because Bethany is watching. The man I am selling drugs to hires women because he runs a daytime strip club. I see one woman, who seems nice. The man is mean to the woman, and won't let her have the day off."
"0878"	"(06/19/1997)"	"Stealing From Target I'm with my friend Yvette Ullman. We're in the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. We go to eat lunch in Target. We're in a hurry. It's 11:58am, and we have to be back in two minutes! I get a thick sandwich with turkey, chicken, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and three pieces of bread. My friends Emerald Reinhold and Holly Lapson are at the food counter when we go in. I get four little packages. I pay for the sandwiches, not for the things in the packages. Somehow I manage to go through the register without paying. This may be due to a mistake of an employee which I took advantage of. I steal the packages. I go the bathroom and rip up the UPC codes of the packages so the theft sensor won't pick them up as I leave the store, and the alarm won't sound. My classmate from Brimson named Donovan comes out of a stall in the bathroom. I put all my things in a plastic bag. There are many other bags in the bag, and some envelopes. I go out of the store. The alarm sounds. Security is there. In my bag are a razor, a tweezers, and some kind of small pointy poker. I also have my half eaten sandwich. The security guard is a black man. I sit at a table with other black people. Another black security guard is there. I say I don't know what happened: why the razor, tweezers, or poker is there."
"0879"	"(06/19/1997)"	"Two Gangs There are two gangs. One gang is very belligerent, irrational, ruthless, and aggressive. I talk to a leader of this bad gang on the phone. I tell him I am Mr. M, trying to sound cool. I work 12:00pm to 12:00 am for the gang. The gang is strict. I agree, but in not in tune with the harsh ways of the gang. Then I am hiding in a residential area, and am part of the good gang. The bad gang is speeding around in their vehicles with guns, trying to scare me, to get me to run, or just to show myself. I lay quietly and they don't see me."
"0880"	"(06/20/1997)"	"Anna Woods' Genitalia My high school classmate Lyle Zeffman is naked in my apartment. He is talking about a pornographic movie called ""Jizz __?__ Jizz Suckers"". There is a knock at the door. I tell Lyle to cover up or put some pants on. It is my friend Anna Woods at the door. She is wearing short shorts and has nice tan legs. She pulls up her shorts to show us something, and I see she has a little penis along with her vagina. It is as if both male and female genitalia are present, but only one is dominant and functions. Anna has leg hair that is three or four inches long, and is thick and burly. The hair stops where her shorts/tan line is, and above that line she has short hair."
"0881"	"(06/20/1997)"	"Heat Circulating Steps There is a house with two couples and others in it. I may be there, or I may be viewing this. There is a loft-type area in the house, with a whirlpool near it. The couples are trying to decide who gets to stay in the loft for the first night. There is styrofoam insulation around the steps in the house. This is what keeps the house warm, and keeps the heat circulating."
"0882"	"(06/20/1997)"	"The Jay Heimer Incident I am back in 8th grade. Things are being replayed, re-enacted. My classmate Gino Teavor is fighting Bill Shucks. I am with my friend Bubba Hacker. We re-enact the episode where I beat up my classmate Jay Heimer. This is what we do. We're in a classroom. There are three big tomatoes in front of me on the desk. I pick up one and toss it over my shoulder. I am a bit reluctant to do this at first. The tomato splatters on the desk behind me, making a mess. The teacher walks in. The teacher is my 8th grade social studies teacher Mr. Walter. He plays along with this and doesn't reprimand me for tossing the tomato. I have lasagna in front of me. When I try to eat it, it flips up and sticks on me, splattering. The teacher has put something in the lasagna. I realize I have been duped. I look up at the teacher and smile in my realization. He smiles too: he has tricked me."
"0883"	"(06/20/1997)"	"Chocolate Poker with Tony I'm playing poker. My high school friends Lyle Zeffman, Tony Kramer, and others are there. In this hand, threes, nines, and fours are wild. There is a big pot of poker chips, money, and candy. We have many cards. I get a straight flush with the 5,6,7, and 8 of spades with a four in a red suit. I say we should order our cards and flip them over. Everyone selects his five cards. Lyle starts flipping his cards over. He has a good hand but doesn't see it. He flips some kings and aces, and then four wild cards. He must not realize what is wild. He is out then because he thinks he hasn't beaten my straight flush, which I have showing. Tony stalls, so I start eating some of the candy in the pot, as if I've won. People get mad at me for this. I tell Tony he's got to show his cards to win. He starts to flip his cards over. (I forget the outcome.)"
"0884"	"(06/21/1997)"	"Flying Three Planes There are three planes going on a bombing mission. I am one of the pilots. The planes are small: about seven feet long. They have a couple of bombs on each side and a gun in the front. I adjust the seat in my plane in the alley. There are two wheels on my plane directly on the front of the plane, the corners not suspending the plane at all. We are going to the east side of Wilmerton, where we'll land. We're trying to destroy something or some group. We have allies there waiting. I try to go, but it doesn't work well. There is a cord to pull like a lawn mower to start the engine. I pull the cord and it breaks. We're down at the white house next to my neighbor Mr. Olson's house, in the alley. My mom is on the phone in their garage trying to see what to do about the broken cord. I fix the cord by tying to back together. I have never flown a plane before. I say this to the other pilot, but it doesn't seem to matter. I'm excited and nervous about fling a little plane so high up. There is a scene like in the movie Top Gun, in which there are two pilots getting ready to take off. One of them is a rookie. One pilot flies over and drops a fake rubber bomb, just joking around. The rookie is annoyed at this. The rookie and the veteran pilot trade punches, kind of sizing each other up when they meet. My friend Kevin Simpson may be a pilot of another plane."
"0885"	"(06/22/1997)"	"Birthday Gift From Fishing Haven My coworker Tom from Fishing Haven presents me with birthday presents. They are from my bosses Mike and Phoebe, but Tom gives them to me. I get them a month early. I get a cap made of animal fur with a tail, and it says ""vegetarian"" on the front. I also get a fishing lure, which is a yellow floating lure with a weighted tail that sinks. I talk to Mike then, and he indicates I can have a backpack too. I am happy because my backpack is falling apart."
"0886"	"(06/22/1997)"	"Peach Deodorant I find some good smelling peach deodorant and decide to buy some and give it a try. A woman I know is there."
"0887"	"(06/22/1997)"	"Jens Nils' Sister I'm in a very old big house with my grade school mate Jim Granger. I do something with Jim. I think I may have been Jim's second choice of people to accompany him. I go to my room. My old roommate, Jens Nils, is there. Jens' sister is also there. She has blond hair and is physically larger. She goes out to her car and brings back two CD's of her favorite band to play. I have never heard of them. I have trouble with the CD player: the discs slip and won't come out, they are hard to grab. Jens gives me a used comb and a toothbrush he got. He bought 16 combs for $2. The sink is very dirty with his used toothbrush and dental floss covered in toothpaste spit. This disgusts me. My friend Norman Noman is there. I am going with him upstairs. It seems as if the house I've been in is my house for this coming fall at school. It also seems that Jens' sister is my current roommate Sean's sister who is coming to visit us for dinner tonight."
"0888"	"(06/22/1997)"	"Ramona's Insurance My sister Ramona's automobile insurance is twice as high as mine. At first I didn't' realize this. We both pay $542. I pay this much every year, while she pays this every six months."
"0889"	"(06/22/1997)"	"Letter From Wally I'm in my truck. I follow my friend's father Phillip Hacker as we leave my grandparents the Redding's farm. We drive towards the town of Farmington. It if very foggy and I have trouble seeing his call all the time, and am afraid that he'll lose me. It is early morning. We drive through a cornfield. I just keep driving. We ride bicycles through an old west town, flipping over a deck of a porch or something. I am then in a restaurant. I talk with a prostitute, as I'm a bit drunk. I drink and joke with her, playing around. The prostitute and I site in a booth. There is a letter from my brother Wally to my mom on the table, and some other Hanson family artifacts, including photographs, one of which is of a big northern pike."
"0890"	"(06/22/1997)"	"Quit Fishing Before Light We have gone fishing very early in the morning. We quit fishing before it gets light out. This isn't characteristic of me, I think: I'm usually in for the duration of the fishing day. My friend Kevin Simpson throws a snowball at a latrine. He hits the latrine, and the snowball almost goes inside it."
"0891"	"(06/22/1997)"	"Friday Night Hardees I'm in a Hardees restaurant with my high school classmate Carmen Allure on a Friday night. My brother Wally and his friends Jeff Bautsch and Perry Glide are there. We walk by them, and go back to where they are when they call us over. We sit and talk to them. I think they are dorks for being in Hardees on a Friday night."
"0892"	"(06/23/1997)"	"Playing Brimson Basketball I'm at Brimson in the upstairs gymnasium. I'm sleeping or trying to sleep. People are playing basketball in the gymnasium. They include my high school teammates Carl Everson, Bill Jamison, and a man I know as J.P., who is a guard. I think he may be my coworker from Fishing Haven Jerry Parsons. The Brimson basketball players are there. They are practicing and have a team meeting. I go to the meeting because I want to join the team. There is a game then. I start as a player in the game. There is a man that is 6'10"". I'm not sure whose team he is on. I block a shot, and play all right in the game."
"0893"	"(06/23/1997)"	"My First Nightmare? I'm sleeping. I wake up. I need to awaken at 6:00am. My alarm clock has broken. My boss Mike Hollow is in the bed next to mine. He says he'll wake me up. I need to urinate. I go outside. It is pouring rain and dark. I feel a hand on my back. It feels like it is scratching me. I am terrified. I later learn that my neighbors Wilma and Gary Stein watched this happen, maybe from my other neighbor Mrs. Shelly's house across the street at home in Oak Valley."
"0894"	"(06/23/1997)"	"Tarp Less I'm camping. There is a group that has made a big campsite. There is a huge tent and a fire. The group has three large heavy-duty lodges set up using some kind of contraption. I have a tent with no tarp underneath it. It is raining. I put on a rain poncho. My classmate Brad Chloe, from Brimson, is there. He helps me put a tarp underneath my tent."
"0895"	"(06/24/1997)"	"Gang Rape A woman is being raped. It looks like she is accepting of the sexual intercourse, but it is rape. It is as if the man says, ""I am going to rape you."", and she has no choice in the matter. She unbuttons her dress and gets down on all fours. The man tells her to spread her butt cheeks. She does. I see her vagina clearly. He licks her vagina, giving her cunnilingus, and nips, almost as if biting her clitoris. He then penetrates her. Other men are with him. They rape her when he is done. Two children see this. It is a tragedy, but it seems to happen willingly: the woman doesn't struggle and the people watching don't help. Next I see the woman in the hospital. She is naked. Her legs are spread open. She has been raped."
"0896"	"(06/24/1997)"	"The Mountain Top I'm going up a mountain, trying to get to the highest point. I climb and climb. I get to the top. There are people there. Snow is on the ground. The view is beautiful. I see down upon the clouds. I'm walking and then I am in the back of a pickup truck, which is surrounded by fog and clouds, so I can't see the ground. The truck drifts in the spot like a boat anchored in the wind. There is a kid that I know on a snowboard. I say something about skiing but realize the snow is soft and mushy. The snow is deep. The whole area is very pretty. I go into a garage-like space. A man follows me, parking some sort of vehicle there, so I must move out of the way. I go into a gymnasium-like area, where there are several different rooms in which activities can take place. There is one activity where a small hard ball is hit up against a wall. There are two people playing this game, and some spectators."
"0897"	"(06/25/1997)"	"Reprimanding Tom and Kevin I'm in an old room that has the feel of a pale green color. My mom is there. Something happens with a window. My upper body is hanging out of the window, and has gone too far down near the ground. The building is old brick. The reason we're leaning down is that my mom has come and leaned out of the window as well. Someone else is there with me. My mom is on the phone. My friend Tina Totts is there. She puts on bright red lipstick and is all made up for a prom photograph. She walks over to the people who are also having their photograph taken. I see that one of them is a man who was my high school classmate Holly Hughes' prom date. He looks a lot like my junior high classmate Fred Grendson. My friend Kevin Simpson is there and talks about pornography very loudly and explicitly. My mom can hear this while she's on the phone. I get mad at Kevin, and say that my mom is on the phone. He is out of control, acting dumb, wild, and silly. I try to contain him, to corner him, to catch him. I end up jumping on him. Grape juice is spilled in the struggle. My mom and my brother Wally pull me back. I am very mad at Kevin and my coworker Tom from Fishing Haven for not controlling themselves. I hit the wall very hard several times. My mom and Wally stop me from doing this. I see Tom walking. I go up to him to confront him. It is clear I am the strong, dominant one. He says he thought he and I were going fishing, and he became jealous when I spent time with my roommate Sean Williams. I tell him I love my family and they take precedence. We talk. He is remorseful, weak, and immature. I go to clean up the grape juice. I see my boss Mike Hollow as I get the water bucket. There are a couple of spots of juice on the carpet. There are quill-like needles from where the dog was when it was moved during the struggle."
"0898"	"(06/25/1997)"	"Risk Of Contamination I am fishing. My friends Niles Zelling, Melvin Dahlheimer, cousin Nisa Redding, and others are there. A recycling truck comes. The large containers of recyclables are flipped over in a truck. People are instructed to leave if they haven't been exposed to this type of contamination before. I have been exposed to this before. We are in the recycling truck and wait for the process to be complete. Metal doors flip or move, as it is complete. Melvin looks concerned about the contamination. I get out of the truck. We use leeches and slip bobbers to fish. One man in our party gets a fish. We all move down the shore a ways. I throw two lines out. Nisa wants very badly to catch a smallmouth bass."
"0899"	"(06/29/1997)"	"Canal Boats I am working for Fishing Haven. I'm bringing out customers in canal boats. My coworkers Amy and Jenny are there with their customers, who are black. We serve Leinenkugels Beer and lemonade. We use paper cups. This costs a lot."

"0901"	"(06/29/1997)"	"$600 For Gabby I'm at a gathering that is like a Teen Variety Night that I went to in junior high. A janitor stops the dance until the kids raise $600 for my boss' dog Gabby. The spirit of the crowd is reluctance at first, and then everyone starts throwing money in. I think if we divided up the money per person it would be more than five dollars each. I throw in the two one-dollar bills that are in my wallet, but not the five or 20-dollar bill. I put my one-dollar bills on a stack of money, which is ordered so that the largest bills are on the top and the smallest on the bottom. My high school classmate Tanya Simmons is there. I seem to be at Carter Elementary School. I am wearing only white briefs underwear. I walk down the north stairway, trying to look physically fit: not flabby with stretched out underwear. I go into the bathroom by Billie's Daycare. I am going to defecate. My high school classmate Mya Rousing comes into the bathroom. She says my name and tells me that she has vomited into the toilet. She says this like she needs help, like this is her weakness and she has given in to it. I sit on the toilet and fart. Mya hears this. Then I fart more quietly. I am full of gas. My high school classmates Carmen and Harmony Allure are there. Harmony has kissed a track runner from Bell College named Moab, who I think of as the track runner I know from Brimson named Paul. I come out of the stall. My high school friend Tiny Combs is there. He is naked, and facing away from me. I see his butt and butt hole. There is a pig in the bathroom. It is small and has muddy feet. My foot is bleeding like it has been cut on the bottom. I explain this in some other way."
"0902"	"(06/29/1997)"	"Warts I have warts on my hand. There are three huge warts that cover my hand. The outline of the warts can be seen, like ringworm. I think I can get one of them frozen off, but I don't know about the others."
"0903"	"(06/29/1997)"	"Bob Mould's Pink Crush I am listening to a Bob Mould CD on my stereo. I take all the CD's out of the stereo so it won't skip funny. The Bob Mould CD I put in is called Pretty in Pink, or Pink Crush or something like that. I have heard the first song that is played. The center of the CD player is oblong, like an oval. The CD's won't play correctly because of this."
"0904"	"(06/29/1997)"	"Scottie Pippen's Suicide I see my friend Nate Nelling. He is happy to see me. There is a room of kids taking the ACT test. The kids are too young to be taking the test. The boys seem young. They cheat by looking at each other's tests. They cheat in such a way so they will fail the test even though they cheat, because they cross out and scribble over the multiple choose answers that they don't want, and put a check mark by the answer they do want. They are dumb. I may hear from Nate that Scottie Pippen has committed suicide because he was forced to or unknowingly received an injection in his ankle to operate, remove, or repair his anterior cruciate ligament. Michael Jordan is at the free throw line. He misses two free throws. He walks into the locker room with a suit and tie on limping. He shakes peoples hands as he walks."
"0905"	"(06/30/1997)"	"Mower Sled Races There is a race in the winter. The participants use lawn mowers, but ride on the back of the mower like in a sled dog race. My boss Mike Hollow and my roommate Sean Williams are there. I try the mower and I go slowly. The race is on a snow-covered trail in the forest. A man I know from Brimson named Korey is there. He it talking on a pay phone to someone about fishing for Lake Trout."
"0906"	"(06/30/1997)"	"Big Dark Beast I'm at my Grandparents Redding's Farm. There is a horse/dinosaur beast. It is huge and gray and black in color. It looks thick skinned and strong. I go to pet it, thinking of it as a horse. It's huge neck and head knock me back. I'm lucky I don't get hurt. It hurls things towards me: large objects that I avoid. One object crashes where the barn used to be. I run through the chicken coop, as if I am being chased. There is a thin wire, taut, at the end of the coop that is basely visible. I see it and turn. My friend Tom Napper is there. We give each other a high five. Someone else from Brimson is there. I'm driving a van along the dirt road that leads to the Redding farm, as if I'm going to town. There is a gap in the road that I jump. It was there unexpectedly, after rounding a corner. I'm climbing in a sand dune area. There is a pool there. My uncle Dannie Redding is there. One of us has a yellow and green drink with pineapple served to us by a waitress. I argue with my mom about drinking alcohol at parties. My sister Ramona takes part in the argument."
"0907"	"(06/30/1997)"	"Standing Up To Mike I hear from my coworker Sean Williams that my bosses Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills are dissatisfied with my work. Mike later asks me numerous questions, which basically concern my efficiency as an employee. He says I slack off, and he has been watching me. I argue back at him, offering explanations for all of his accusations. The man from the Conkle party, customers at Fishing Haven, comes up to us while we're talking. The man likes me. We joke around, he says women like me. He licks my ear with food in his mouth. I get offended, and I punch and beat the man. Mike asks me about drinking alcohol on the job. I honestly deny it. I say to Mike that I am an efficient worker."
"0908"	"(06/30/1997)"	"Two Marks I am in a van with my dad and a friend named Mark. He is driving. I see my friend Mark Long, and I tell my dad to stop the van. Mark is alive, but he has just committed suicide. I talk with Mark, and tell him it's good to see him. I notice that my friends have the same name."
"0909"	"(06/30/1997)"	"Jerry Driving a Boat My psychology professor Jerry Rice is in a boat. He comes to the shore, where I am, and picks me up. We go somewhere."
"0910"	"(07/01/1997)"	"Grandma Redding Dies I'm with my mom, grandma and grandpa Redding, sister Ramona, and others. Grandma is having chest pains. She tries to breath but can't. She tells us this. I ask my mom if we should call 911. I do call 911. A woman operator answers. I act like I am worried or frantic, but I don't think I really am. They put grandma on the couch and elevate her feet. We're supposed to put cold compresses on her. I am not worried, for what can I do? My boss from Fishing Haven Mike Hollow is there. I talk with him about my watch. It has three hands and tells two different times. One time if for, ""Like, when you're at a dance"", he says. I am on the phone with a man to whom my original 911 call has been transferred. I don't' say much to the man. I walk into a room. My mom is there, with her sister who seems to be one of or a combination of my aunts Joanne, Sherry, and Nisa Redding. They take care of grandma, who is naked and on the toilet. They are cleaning her. Grandma's body is then on a table, and one of the daughters is pulling, scraping, cleaning, or cutting the flesh in her mouth with a tool. There is white stuff in grandma's mouth. I ask my mom how grandma is. Grandma looks dead. My mom is at a sink. She turns around and looks at me. I know from the look on her face that grandma is dead. My mom has bloody hands. She is holding a heart in her hands. Blood is dripping down the drain. I hug mom, and hold her. I cry. I think about my death and dying class, and if I can apply what I have learned. Blood comes from my mom's mouth as she cries. She scratches my arm as she hugs me. She is in turmoil."
"0911"	"(07/01/1997)"	"Heather is Dead My sister Heather is dead. I walk, sliding backwards like I'm doing the moonwalk, on 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I see the sunset. It is snowing and slippery outside. An old man named Tom walks with me. We talk about Heather's death. She died in her sleep, with my mom in the room. We walk through a house where remodeling is occurring. A man is putting in a water heater. My mom is going to counseling a bit to compensate this man for his work. This makes no sense to me since my mom should owe both for the installation of the water heater and for the counseling. She should owe twice. I call out my mom's name to see where she is. She answers from a partially remodeled room with insulation as walls. I break through the insulation to be with her. She is watching the news on television about deaths. Everyone is okay but Heather. A girl has drowned. On the news, her parents fish out something heavy, like croquet balls, and also contact lenses. It seems it wasn't an accident: someone murdered their daughter."
"0912"	"(07/01/1997)"	"Sloping Tents I'm with others. We are finding a place to set up two tents. The land is steeply sloping. The old tow driver for a competitor of Fishing Haven is there. My friends Stephen Ramos and Emerald Reinhold are there. There is a big building. We move to flat ground. The carpentry is good: wood and twisting stairs. There is an attic. I go up and look in the attic. It is not good for sleeping or being in because tables and chairs are taking up the space."
"0913"	"(07/01/1997)"	"Blond Beard People make fun of a man with blond hair and a blond beard. There are women in a bar that are almost like prostitutes, but they are not. People may be drinking beer."
"0914"	"(07/01/1997)"	"Shopping With Jane Rock I am at the Quaint Bookstore near Brimson with the Brimson student body president Jane Rock. I buy two books. They cost $75, which includes $12 tax. I get two fishing lures with the book purchases. I look at poker chips and cards, but they are too expensive to buy."
"0915"	"(07/01/1997)"	"Stuck With the Thomas' I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, her father Bill, and others. I'm at their house in Wilmerton. I want to see and be with Annie, who is upstairs in her room. But I have to say downstairs and watch television with the others. Duck Tales is on television."
"0916"	"(07/02/1997)"	"Netting My Own Trout I'm reeling in a big fish. I see it is a big lake trout with a huge mouth! I grab the net to net my own fish."
"0917"	"(07/02/1997)"	"Photographing Morris I'm driving with several other people. We see a moose that hangs out around Fishing Haven, that we have affectionately named Morris the Moose. He has larger antlers than before. I want to take a photograph of him. I click the button on the camera as we move past, kind of in a hurry to get to a good shot of him, but also to stay on the path. The camera didn't focus, I realize. The camera breaks. Something happens to the camera and it rewinds the film. There is a large button to push, like on the toy camera of a child."
"0918"	"(07/02/1997)"	"Bad Smelling Vaginas Someone is talking about vaginas that smell bad. I can relate to this, and I think of my experience with my friend Hilary Nano, whom I thought had a bad smelling vagina."

"0920"	"(07/03/1997)"	"Fresh Snow Mountain There is a ski mountain with fresh snow and few tracks on it. I look at the ""S"" pattern left in the snow from a few people who skied down, weaving back and forth. I hear a man's voice talk about the trails on the mountain."
"0921"	"(07/03/1997)"	"The Building Game I'm in a building with my friend Emerald Reinhold. We run around, as if in a game, and go by our friends Holly Lapson and Jill Banks near some stairs. We try to sneak by them. We get into an area where a person is. It is like we shouldn't be there. We hurry to move. We go to a place where there is an ""exit"" sign, but I'm not sure if that is where we want to go. We exit. Something happens without an elevator. Outside the building and the elevator there are three black men loading bicycles into something. I am scared of them, but help them move the bicycles. I am bare foot. There is broken glass on the ground."
"0922"	"(07/03/1997)"	"Group Tourism It is the night before a big day of tourism at a slide or ski park area. I'm in a group of people. There is an older man, who is the leader. It is snowing. We are in a room. Two of the people are new to the group: one man and one woman. The woman may be Chinese. We are going to watch a movie or television. The leader asks what time we should get up in the morning. I say we should get up at 7:00am. The television is behind me and to my right. The new Chinese woman is to my right. We must turn around for the show on television."
"0923"	"(07/03/1997)"	"A Fellow Dream Enthusiast I'm in a car waiting for my mom to arrive in her car. I ask a man to awaken me when she gets here. Just as I am going to lay down my mom arrives. I see her and sit up. The man comes to awaken me. I know the man from working at Fishing Haven: he is a customer who was a member of a party whose 17' lightweight canoe leaked when they were out on their trip. He is smoking. I am in a group of people. Everyone seems to have an area of interest or specialty. There is another person in the group who is a dream enthusiast, besides me."
"0924"	"(07/04/1997)"	"Family's Free Meal I'm at a restaurant with my mom, my brother Wally, and sister Heather and Ramona. The restaurant is in the city in a shopping mall. We order and eat. The waitress is crabby and short-tempered. Several waiters are there to help clear away the dishes when we're done. A man comes to our table. He seems to be the manager. He is wearing dark pants, a white shirt with stripes, and a tie. He wants my mom to write a check to pay for the meal, and then he'll give her cash. This somehow benefits him. He estimates the cost of our meal using a calculator. He figures my mom's meal to be about five dollars, and everyone else's meal to be about $2.75. I had what my mom had plus an appetizer, so I figure my meal will be the most expensive, costing more than seven dollars. My meal costs a lot more than the others. The man figures the cost of the meal to be about $25. He gives mom a $20 bill and $5 for a tip. He comes back a little bit later and says that $25 isn't enough to pay for the bill, and gives mom a $50 bill. Wally, Ramona, and Heather order more food. I don't realize they do this until it arrives at the table. When it does, they are not at the table. I eat whatever it is that I can, stuffing it into my mouth. The food consists of fried appetizers. My mom writes a check to pay for the meal. The man ends up paying for the whole meal. The waitpersons are crabby and impatient. We walk out of the restaurant. I see a person I know from high school named Karin Bellview. I look at her and say hi. She is sitting on the ground. It takes her a little while to realize it is I, but she does, and says hi. I say that the whole experience in the restaurant was weird."
"0925"	"(07/04/1997)"	"Bubba's Trailer Home My friend Bubba Hacker and I each have a place to live. He has just turned 21. He shows me his new driver's license, and a temporary photograph, which is of his family. He had them taken in Lakeville, so I am assured I can get mine there. I think about leaving where I am. People leave Bubba's place, so I go over to see him. It seems that we each have trailer homes to live in. We look at photographs. Some of the photographs are of my cousin Melvin Redding at a beach with a watermelon. Others are of my friend Kevin Simpson and I fishing. There are some photographs of me with a big northern pike. In one, the fish is flipping around, flopping. In it, I have blood squirting from my finger because it has been cut off or cut. I had been at Bubba's place earlier, back when the people left. There are two little boys outside: they are five and six years old, respectively."
"0926"	"(07/04/1997)"	"Morris the Moose I see Morris the Moose, a moose that I see a lot in the locale I live. His antlers are a bit large, and lighter in color. They are hardened stubs, which are uneven. He is wearing clothes. I go close to him to take a photograph. He looks like he could charge me, so I retreat cautiously."
"0927"	"(07/04/1997)"	"Poisonous Snakes There are two poisonous snakes that have a label on them identifying them as poisonous. There is a snake that isn't poisonous. One of the poisonous snakes is orange and black. My friend from Fishing Haven Jerry Parsons is there. He says a big poisonous snake just ate the cow we had set out for it! Now we'll capture the snake since it can't move."
"0928"	"(07/04/1997)"	"Older Group of Men I am in a group of men who are older than I. We are going to do some sort of sport or recreational activity. They know and call me by my name. They ask me if I am drooling, or something like that, with fluid on my face that looks like snot. I say yes, I am, as if it is a good thing to do, as if it is something I should be doing."
"0929"	"(07/04/1997)"	"Hitting Hilltop Baseballs I'm with some men hitting baseballs. We are hitting from the intersection of 1st Street and Slope Avenue in Oak Valley, from the top of the hill that goes down 1st Street. I have a bat, and am going to hit the ball. I wait for people and cars to move out of the way. It takes them a long time to move. A man parks near the houses on the southeast and the northwest side of the intersection. We're hitting balls down into the grass lot at Hill Park."
"0930"	"(07/04/1997)"	"My Infected Toe I am in a locker room area before a game. I have a band-aid on my toe which has slid down to the narrow part of the toe. I have a toe infection. I pop the infection and puss comes out of it. I have long toenails. I scrape the skin of the infected area off in a big chunk. I go to get another band-aid. There is a young kid watching me."
"0931"	"(07/04/1997)"	"Opening The Door To School I'm in Woodland. I'm riding my red Huffy childhood bicycle holding a bag of apricots. It's the day before I am to move into the Whitman house. I have my stuff in a room on campus. I ride past the Brimson Crew Team boathouse. The house is on a lake, which is south of Brimson. I ride over the boats, which are on trailers. I see a woman jogging with a cast on her broken foot. She hops on one leg. I go past a house that is a place you can buy blue jeans. A lot of blue jeans are stacked around the sidewalk and yard. I ride past a golf coach and his high school golf team. One left-handed kid makes a long putt. I clap for him. His coach is jubilant and encouraging. The kid downplays his great putt, as if he has been struggling playing lately. I go by the Whitman house. It looks trashy because of the people that have lived there during the summer. There is a teal or dark turquoise mini van parked on the front lawn. The front lawn is smaller than usual. I go through the next yard where there is a lady with a gun. I turn around. Something happens with the lady and blueberries. I'm riding my bicycle singing an oldies song, with my bag of apricots. I drop apricots, and pick them up. As I head back to campus I wonder who will be there to talk with. There is a door leading to school. I try to open the door while still on the bicycle, and drop apricots. I pick them up and try to open the door again. I sing and try to open the door to school."
"0932"	"(07/05/1997)"	"Mt. McKinley There are people sliding down Mt. McKinley, which is in northwest Washington state. They are having a lot of fun. I talk to the people I am with about the height of the mountain, and we compare it to Mount Everest."
"0933"	"(07/05/1997)"	"Live Crash Landing I'm in a small plane with three men, two of whom are good and the other who is bad. The bad man tries to push a good man out of the plane. We save the good man from falling out. We push the bad man out of the plane. The door to the plane is like a trap door in the bottom of the plane. We drop the bad man's bottle of Aunt Jemima syrup out the door after him. One of the other men starts to fly the plane. We are going to land. We have sort of a crash landing. We live. While we are spinning around in the plane once it has crashed, I say to the other men, ""Hey, we lived!"" Two men are at the airport where we landed. I ask them to keep a pack of Trident gum."
"0934"	"(07/05/1997)"	"Liza Minikel At Student Union I see my third grade teacher Liza Minikel outside the student union at Brimson as I walk down High Avenue. I say hi. My voice is very high-pitched. Inside the union are people. My high school classmate Tanya Simmons is there. I ask her if she is sick. I ask her about how she is going home: which route she is taking."
"0935"	"(07/05/1997)"	"Church Deer Hunting I'm deer hunting in a church. The back of the church is being remodeled, and it is out of order. The wood is dark in color. I have my shotgun, which is already loaded."
"0936"	"(07/05/1997)"	"I'm An Altar Boy I'm a priest. I'm at the back of Carter church giving a blessing and spraying people with holy water. Then we walk up to the front of church, carrying things. I carry Degree brand deodorant in one hand. I'm then serving as an altar boy with my grade school classmate Eric Stoner. We put the things we're carrying in the back room. I'm not sure it is appropriate to bring deodorant out in view of the congregation, so I leave it in the hallway of the back room. I go out next to the pulpit to get a sign and move it. The sign has responses to petitions on it. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan needs the sign there, so I don't move it. I go sit down. I sit in the chair for the altar boy who holds the wine chalice. I have a wooden medallion on. Eric doesn't have a medallion. We are not wearing robes, which I notice when we sit down."

My roommate Sean Williams' sister is hiding from us somewhere in the building. Others and I make noise and run around, trying to find her or get her to expose where she is hiding."
"0939"	"(07/06/1997)"	"Bear In The Basement I'm with my coworkers Amy Rancher and Jenny at my cabin near Fishing Haven. I'm in bed wearing white brief underwear. They are in the next room or in my roommate Sean's bed. They get up at 6:05am, which is really early I think. It is 6:00am now. Jenny gets up and goes towards the stairs. I say to her, ""I like you, I really do."" She replies, ""Then dump me."" She yells out because she sees a bear at the bottom of the kitchen stairs. I jump up and run over to the stairs. I look down and see it is the grill. We see it from the flashlight she is using, which is pretty dim. I get a better flashlight and shine it down the stairs. We see a sow bear and her cub! I close the first trap door, which still enables me to see the bears from the top of the stairs. I pound on the wall with my foot. The bears stir. There is a second trap door, like the one we actually have, which closes the stairs off totally from the kitchen. I try to close this door. There is a hinge and chain which doesn't allow it to close all the way. I stomp on the door, pull it, and break the hinges. The trap door then lies flat. I think the bears will come up the stairs. The bear starts to come up, nudging open the trap door. We run. I get some pots and pans and clang them together to scare the bear off. There is only one bear now. I almost hit the bear with them, which would be a mistake, but the bear runs off from the clanging pots."
"0940"	"(07/07/1997)"	"My Mom's Strict Birthday Nun I'm in an underwater world. It's an area of water with glass tunnels for walking through. There are houses and people living in the water and outside the enclosed tunnels. I am shown a map. The map is about deer hunting land. I see Wisconsin shaded on the map because there are so many deer there. There are only a few deer in Minnesota, the some states to the south and west of it. There seems to be a line running north/south along the map from the Wisconsin-Minnesota border along the other state borders that denotes the good hunting land. I am with a group of people from ____ (I forget). I have a cigarette in my mouth. I don't smoke it; I just let it hang there to look cool. Someone comments on my sideburns and goatee. I am the only person with sideburns and a goatee, which I kind of like. I'm dressed like a cowboy, all made up in my clothes, as are some men from my high school who are there, including Brett Ball, Izzy Hay, and Rick Hartley. I think it's odd that we're dressed the same. We are leaving. It seems we may have been at Grandma and Grandpa Redding's farm. I get into a jeep with my friend from high school Lyle Zeffman and my roommate Stephen Ramos. We pack into crowded jeep with others. Someone else is driving. There are two other vehicles going. We are driving to a place. There are more women than men, maybe in a 13:4 ratio. I say I've had my cigarette for a day. I fold up the unsmoked cigarette and put it in the ashtray in the vehicle. I say that we need to get my friend Kevin Simpson. We're going to a hotel-like place that is run by a very strict, staunch head nun. She does things only her way. It seems the has been entertaining groups like ours for years, and she likes and expects ups to come and meet and greet her in the same way as the other groups. We are instructed about this before arriving. At this place it is my mom's birthday. They are making some sort of lemon coffee cake especially for the occasion. People are lined up to get some of this. I am kind of out of line, so I budge in front of people. We need to line up again, and I go to the end of the line since I feel guilty about budging in front of others earlier. They are two groups I know at the end of the line. They allow me to go ahead of them because they don't think I should go last in line, since it's my mom's birthday. There is a fat army man serving the food. After one gets their food they are supposed to go down stairs. When I am served, coffee spills off my plate. I go downstairs. They ask us to think about a question while we eat. I sit by myself to figure the question out. My mom is there. My friend Matt Yams' brother Jasper is there, eating. We are to file back up the stairs when we're done eating."
"0941"	"(07/07/1997)"	"Mountain Bicycling I'm riding a mountain bicycle down 3rd Street in Wilmerton going west past the intersection of 3rd and Bar Avenue. The road is all torn up. There are other people riding bicycles. I am riding in a rough rocky area, with boulders everywhere. We are riding over rocks. I go slowly and steadily. Some people falter. I pass them very slowly and steadily. It is difficult riding terrain. My brother's friend Jeff Bautsch may be there when others and I stop at a rest point or at our destination. My high school classmate Todd Warden may be there."
"0942"	"(07/08/1997)"	"Foolish Belligerence There is an airplane flying. I have a view outside of the plane, into one of its windows. It is getting dark and the lights in the cabin are on. There is a person, which may be me, hanging from the edge of a window outside the plane. I feel the grip the person has on the window. The person moves along, hanging from different windows, moving towards the back of the plane. The person finds a window that has a good grip. The person knocks on the window with their right hand, to signal for help! No one is seated next to the window. A woman with short dark hair, who reminds me slightly of my coworker Lauren, is sitting across the aisle from the window. She notices the knock, but looks over as if it is impossible anything is outside the plane. The woman eventually comes over to the window or realizes, to her horror, that there is someone outside the plane! When she realizes this, the engines of the plane fly into reverse to slow it down so they can bring the person in through the window. The people inside the plane roll the inner window down and somehow get the outer window off. The mother of the person outside the plane, who is a girl, is inside the plane. The mother has long straight blond hair. The girl climbs in through the window. I feel myself climbing in through the window. The girl hugs her mother. I am on a plane with my mom and my friend Melanie McDyss. I hug Melanie. I feel exhausted and relaxed, as if I have just finished or accomplished something important. I am happy. Melanie sits on my lap. I hug her while we sit. I tell her how much I care about her and love her. We are sleeping. I have my arms around her. She moves my hand because it may have made her uncomfortable where it was, resting on her thigh, with some sexual feeling to it. I am then careful about touching her because I don't want to offend her. She moves and sleeps with my mom in her seat where there is more room, and where we won't be touching. The plane has landed. We go out to eat with my dad, my aunt Sheila Redding, and others. Shelia speaks of brown sugar stir-fry with pecans, and says she ate all of it. I'm in a car driving with my mom, Sheila, my brother Wally, and others. I talk about what a busy schedule I have. My schedule overlaps. I am supposed to be somewhere for three weeks from sometime in August until September 8th. Schools starts September 8th, and I am supposed to work then as well. I'm walking near Wilmerton University. Other people are there. I see my psychology professor Marianne Stash and her partner, who is really pale-skinned. They are having a good conversation as they walk. Marianne is characteristically attentive. We walk by each other, and I don't say hi. I go into a big building. There is a party being held there later. I have a big roll of crepe paper. Three admission men deny me access to go upstairs while others are setting up. I want to go upstairs. They say I can't because if I go upstairs I'd have to walk through the gymnasium, and there are people in the gymnasium who want not to be interrupted. I am mad! I think it is dumb that I can't go in. The men don't really have authority. They get it because people accept what they say. I think to myself: why do I even listen to them? I walk out of the building feeling frustrated and say, ""Fuck this!"" The women's bathrooms there are being cleaned. Marianne walks by as I leave. She is going in the women's bathroom. I tell her that they wouldn't let me in, and we'll see how she can do. I see a big list of people on a kiosk that are coming. It is comprised of many alumni and professors. I wouldn't want to be there. As I walk out, I see a friend's father, Greg Kulik. I say hi and walk towards him. I have the roll of crepe paper in my right hand. As I walk towards Greg, I shake someone's hand. It is an awkward handshake because the grip wasn't right. I shake Greg's hand when I get to him, using my left hand. I think that I am greeting him warmly, while in the past I have been wrong or bad to him, which I know in the back of my mind. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and her father Bill come in the outer doors in the background of other people. I don't do anything, but act like I don't see her, in order to make her react first to seeing me. Suddenly my high school and grade school classmates John Kulik, Patrick Bergman, and Eric Stoner are right in front of me. Eric is shirtless, but wearing a light blue v-cut jean jacket that looks like it is from the 1980's. John is arrogant, like he has heard me talk about how dumb, weak, and stupid he is. He is there with a big cocky grin and long hair. He has come with his buddies to retaliate to what I have said and to make a big deal of it. They want to fight me. One of the three goes in front of me, and another behind me, where a granite bench is. It is as if they are going to push me back over the bench. I say to them, ""What are you guys doing?"", with a tone in my voice indicating I think their actions are dumb. I think I could beat up all three of them. I am more powerful than any one of them, but I think maybe I can take them all on at the same time. I am not afraid, but this is not the place for a fight. Annie is there and she smiles arrogantly as if she has sided with the three of them, and wants revenge against me as well, and she'll get it by having the three men come after me. She smiles as the three men prance around me. They are belligerent. I know I could beat them up but would rather not do so with all the people around, right in front of them."

At one point I feel as if I may be the shark. I am swimming or am underwater, and I have to go a long way. Debris sinks on top of me as I or the shark moves. After this show my friend Fran Susse and her father are on an infomercial about cards. They ask people to call in and comment on or discuss a card game or situation that they have just demonstrated."
"0944"	"(07/08/1997)"	"Getting A Flush There is a method for poker that I see demonstrated. It pertains only to certain hands of draw poker. It has to do with getting a flush, and what cards one should draw in different situations."
"0945"	"(07/08/1997)"	"Lakeville News I'm watching television. The news from Lakeville is on. On the news is a man who steals things. A photograph of him is shown on the screen. I am with someone, who may be my coworker Tom from Fishing Haven. Something happens with collecting paper recyclables in Wonkers Hall at Brimson. I talk a lot, in circles."
"0946"	"(07/08/1997)"	"I'm Already Dead I'm in a muddy swamp area. I am wearing new looking white and red Nike high top sneakers. There is a basketball hoop there, which is kind of small. I jump up and rise, slam dunk the ball and break the rim. I feel powerful. I notice the hoop was shorter than it should be. There is a gang there dressed in black. I walk around a car. Two men pull out their handguns and try to fire at me, but they are out of bullets. I go back around the car and the trunk is open. I pull out a machine gun and kill everyone, mowing them down. I shoot a lot of gang members. I get shot from behind, and I say to the person who shot me that I'm already dead! I feel nothing. I'm in a building with others. I'm in a room with two people. We're supposed to watch a movie, which we go to do. I have seen it before, I say. The movie is not that good. In the movie, there is fake blood on a dead person."
"0947"	"(07/08/1997)"	"The Beast Of Fury In Me I'm at Carter School. I'm cleaning up the floor outside the secretary's office, picking up and sorting paper scraps. I pick up plastic bottles in a bag as well, and put the ripped back into an intact bag. I do grunt work. I play minesweeper. My friend from high school Simon Naver is there. He wants me to hit a mine. My grade school classmate Eric Stoner is there. They are in front of me. I challenge them. I punch one of them, and then the other. They don't retaliate. I rip off Eric's skull, tear his jaw off and rip it apart, rip apart his skull, throw it on the ground, stomp on it and crush it, eradicating it. It feels great to do this! I feel free. The Beast of Fury has been unleashed within me. I am with my sister Ramona. I'm flooded with ideas and memories of dreams. I say that it is more dream than I can handle. I ask Ramona to help me write it all down. PERM is an acronym for something self-destructive."
"0948"	"(07/08/1997)"	"Huge Frying Pans In Trees I'm canoeing with my sister Ramona and uncle Rusty Redding. I am alone in a canoe, while they share one. I go ahead of them. There are people underwater, laying down in the shallows. They may be breathing through reeds. I go further into the bay. There are huge frying pans, 10-15 inches in diameter in trees. There are also canoes, gear, packs, and people, all tied up in trees. This is a portage area. It is crowded with people. It is then a sandy area, and a store is there. There are black people there. It is a tourist area."
"0949"	"(07/08/1997)"	"Seeing Myself It is morning before I go to work at Fishing Haven. I'm in bed. Outside our cabin is a deck-like wooden walkway. There are other cabins in view of the deck. I see someone who looks exactly alike me walking by my apartment on the deck carrying a crate of leeches. He is smiling. He is I! I watch myself. I am very curious, surprised, and confused. My roommate Sean leaves for work. I hear a vehicle come back towards our cabin. I think he must have forgotten something, but I see it is a golf cart. I see my boss Phoebe Mills walking and smiling, and I see my boss Mike Hollow at a desk. I ask myself, ""Am I dreaming?"" I slide off my bed and try to fly, but I can't fly. I've got an erection, probably from REM. I want to masturbate and put something in my butt. I break apart a section of a wooden chair and go to the bathroom, which is the bathroom at home in Oak Valley. I have a pimple on the lower left side of my chin, which I see in the mirror."
"0950"	"(07/09/1997)"	"New Planning Room Class I'm at Armstrong High School in Wilmerton. I'm in a group of people. My high school classmates Gino Teavor, Annie Thomas, Kari Otis, and others who are not usually there are in my planning room. The whole planning room class is over by the freshmen lockers. I go to the bathroom to blow my nose. There is no toilet in the stall. I see myself in the mirror. I look like my friend from Brimson Holly Lapson. My hair is long, dark, and clean. I go out of the bathroom. The planning room has moved. I wander about, going through the commons, and find it near the doors by the lunch line. There is a stage or platform and the class is sitting around listening to the person on the stage."
"0951"	"(07/09/1997)"	"Those Hansons, Up To No Good I'm at Armstrong High School in the office signing my name on the in/out sheet. I realize I shouldn't be here. I don't go to school here, and don't belong here. My brother Wally got apprehended for something he did at Armstrong, and was shipped to Canada, where there is a ""cold north wind"". I joke, ""Those Hansons, up to no good!"" The head bouncer Ted Berry laughs because he remembers the incident where I let mice go in school. I laugh, and other women laugh too. My classmate from Brimson Holly Lapson is at the office getting a pass. She gives the excuse that none of her teachers could sign her absence slip. I know her excuse is bullshit. I go into the library. My high school classmate Mariah Beck and my coworkers from Fishing Haven Heather and Rachel are there. They talk with me about eating a lot of cold cereal: a box of Life cereal that is on the staff refrigerator in the commons. I tell them I'll eat some of it later. Other people from Fishing Haven, including my friend Jasper, are playing cards. One person wants to play Hearts, while another wants to quit. I pull up a big black chair, like the ones at Carter School, and join the group."
"0952"	"(07/10/1997)"	"Free Tin Of Chew There is an offer of some kind for a free tin of kiwi or cherry flavored chewing tobacco. My coworker Tom says I should get the offer. Many people are working to dig paths. The snow on the ground is deep everywhere, 5 feet in many places. My high school classmate Binky Ahmed has a snow/ice saw he uses to cut and lift blocks of ice and snow. I shovel part of a path. It is as if we need a base camp in the snow to be able to shovel more snow, so we're shoveling snow for the base camp."
"0953"	"(07/10/1997)"	"Jackie's Agreement I'm with my ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter in a bed. We talk about sex. She agrees to give me fellatio if I give her cunnilingus. This was her suggestion. I say I've always wanted that. We are in the garage at home in Oak Valley. We toss and turn in the bed to get comfortable. There is a button knob on the mattress that irritates me. My roommate from Fishing Haven Sean Williams is in the garage. It's nighttime. My mom is sleeping. Sean turns on a radio. I get very angry with him! I yell at him and say my mom is trying to sleep. I turn the radio off, and it keeps playing! I turn it off several times, turning and pressing a different knob each time. Finally I jerk the power cord out of the wall. I go up close to Sean and show him my fury! He comments on how I'm close to him yelling. I say I realize I'm close to him! I feel powerful. Sean is weak. He turns away, not wanting to face me. My friend Kevin Simpson is in the garage with his friend George Packer. Kevin and I are supposed to be somewhere at 10:30pm. It's 10:30 now: we're late. I get dressed quickly. Jackie has to leave. George can't go with us. Kevin and I are up to our ""no good games"", having some fun at night again. I walk around the sidewalk to the front of the house, and down to the steps. My mom is awake, and is walking over to the neighbor Wilma and Gary Stein's yard. She returns with her sister Joanne Redding, who is homeless and has been at Sea Island looking for shelter. I tell Joanne to go inside and get some sleep. It seems that we made Joanne go out and try to find someplace, and when things got rough for her we let her back in. In particular, I am the person allowing her back in. It is very cold and snowy outside. I carry my boots with me until I get out in front of the house, and then put them on. I'm in a hurry. We're going to a barbershop, Kevin says. Kevin clipped the barber's hair today while he was getting his own hair cut, and we're going to get the hair he clipped. This is a big feat for anyone to achieve. We need to clean the hair after we get it. We head down Home Avenue going south. I look through binoculars down past Main Street to the house adjacent the railroad tracks. I see nothing, but I say that I see a few ribs."
"0954"	"(07/11/1997)"	"River Jumping I'm with my friend Melanie McDyss. She and I jump off a cliff by the Main River into the water. It is later. I'm with a girl whom I don't know. We see two men across the river from us. They are jumping off what looks like a giant metal underground tunnel. The tunnel opens up at the street bank and they are jumping off it. The tunnel is big: it could easily hold 20 people. The girl I'm with won't jump with me. I remember jumping with Melanie, and I think, ""I wonder what Melanie was wearing when we jumped"", but I can't remember. The girl and I may be in a power struggle, which is why she doesn't jump. I see something down by the Main River, and I want to head right for it. It is something big that I want to see. I start to walk there. It is as if I am on the west side of the river in Wilmerton, just north of the hospital. I see my high school classmates John Kulik and Aaron Stevens. I walk by, keeping my distance. They verbally antagonize me. They say something about my sister Heather's friends beating me up. In his cocky attitude Aaron tells me to come towards him, taunting me. I walk over to him, poised. I get near them, and they come at me. I fight them. I punch them each several times, solidly. I know my mom will be home tomorrow. These two may come to our house for me and disturb her, which I don't want."
"0955"	"(07/11/1997)"	"Running Away Something supernatural is occurring. I have an image of humans fighting some kind of critter. It is cold and snowy. Later, I am in a vehicle with two other people. We're being followed but we have a head start. I am very anxious. I keep saying loudly and impatiently, ""We must go! We must drive fast!"" We lose the road that we are following in town. I say take any road, just keep driving to get away!"
"0956"	"(07/11/1997)"	"Red Pajama Suit I'm going to baby-sit at the house which is second on the right as one walks north on Home Avenue from it's intersection with 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I arrive at the house. The woman is preparing to leave. She has two kids: A male infant and a 3 year old. She tells me I should put on my red pajama suit. I remember she told me earlier to bring a red pajama suit to wear. I tell her I forgot it, and then say that I don't have a red pajama suit. Coincidentally, I am wearing a red long-sleeved thermal shirt. She says she'll go find me some pants. She doesn't seem happy that I forgot a red pajama suit. She directs me to the bathroom with the pants and tells me to change. I go into the room I think she pointed to, but it's the kitchen. It is very crowded and cramped, with hardly any walking space between appliances. I squeeze through into what I think must be the bathroom. I have trouble changing clothes. I can't put the red pants on the outside: they are under my other pants, which seem like rain gear. Finally, I get the red pants on the outside. The woman's friends arrive. It's time for her to leave. Her friends ask me a few superficial questions about school. I am back, then, after some time. The infant and child are asleep. The infant stirs and whimpers. The kids must have put themselves to bed, or the child put the infant to bed. I pick up the infant when he starts crying. I calm the baby. I may drop the baby, but not all at once. The baby is on the ground."
"0957"	"(07/11/1997)"	"Kids Playing Lacrosse My mom rides her bicycle to Fishing Haven, which looks different. I tell her I have a bicycle too, and we should ride over to 15 Mile Lake. She can't: she has to wait for our neighbor Luke Stalk to pick her up. We talk in my truck. My brother Wally is there, standing outside my truck on the driver's side. I tell them my experience saving the Loon. There is a sports field below us, down a little hill. Many kids are playing lacrosse there. My mom asks me what I need. I say she has given me so much food, more than I'll use. I say all I need for my birthday is some good strong fishing line. I say I'll buy my own pasta in bulk from now on. A truck from Lake Lodge goes by. The old man from a different outfitter is driving it. The back end of my truck is sticking out into the road, so I drive forward a bit. A thunderstorm is coming. It is moving to the north, I see, but I think it will also move east and hit us."
"0958"	"(07/12/1997)"	"Piece of My Thumb I'm with my friend Stephen Ramos in a room. The KYCK radio station from Wilmerton is playing, and says something about a thumb contest. I have the tip of my thumb, which has been cut off, in my hand. I have both thumbs intact. But I know the piece of thumb I'm holding is mine. I think I'll use the piece in the contest. Stephen doesn't recognize it as my thumb when he looks at it. It is kid of smashed. There is a gas stove. One of the burners is lit. All the burners are then lit. I can't the burners shut off. They don't turn off, and when they do they turn back on. Finally, I think I may succeed in shutting them off."
"0959"	"(07/12/1997)"	"Dessert At Home I'm at home with my mom, brother Wally, sister Ramona, Aunt Willow Redding, Uncle Rusty Redding, cousin Melissa Redding, and others. We're eating dessert.

"0960"	"(07/12/1997)"	"First Falling Dream There is a basketball team made up of a core of four black players. There are other players, of which I am one and my classmate Chuck from Brimson is another. The core players play with one of the players who isn't good. When I am on the court, I play, but not really. The players don't include me fully in play: I just run around, and am not really participating because I am not good. I'm not part of the team, it seems. I am then watching a game. My friend Jasper Parsons is next to me. We're sitting on chairs. There is a man in front of us talking to people about eating and licking the inside of noodles. There is a generic lady's office. Her family is there. She tries to control them and work at the same time, and this doesn't go well. She is a resource for students, like at the Learning Center at Brimson. My friend Matt Yams is there. There is an old woman with a fishing rod dangling it back towards me, unknowingly. I tug on the line hanging off the rod. Matt tells her she has a bite. I took a lot of black book-like catalogs from the woman's office. She has a lot of catalogs, and is filling more out. I wonder if there is one for every person. I have the control panel for an elevator there. I joke around, pressing buttons to the first or third floors. Then I hit a button by accident, and I go up in the elevator to the seventh or eighth floor. I'm at the top of the building, and the elevator seems to be leaning and unstable. It opens onto the small roof of a leaning building that is swaying. I get out of the elevator onto the roof. There is a six feet gap between the elevator and the roof: it is as if the elevator is not next to the building. I jump back into the elevator immediately, before the door closes. The elevator starts to sway; it leans and bumps into the building, which starts to tilt and lean, swaying. Then the elevator starts to fall. I'm in a yard where a woman plays kick ball with a little girl using a beach ball. A metal rake is on the lawn with the teeth pointing up."

"0963"	"(07/14/1997)"	"Witch Lunch Lady I yell at someone harshly. I tell them exactly what I think and feel, what I care about, what matters to me, and what is important. The scene may be at Jefferson School in Oak Valley where people are eating lunch. I'm afraid they'll discover that I've eating there already. The mean lunch lady is there: the tall woman with red/brown hair. She is stern, and like a witch. I hate her."
"0964"	"(07/15/1997)"	"Holding Hands I am in a room with my coworkers from Fishing Haven Amy Rancher and Jenny. I am physically higher up than they are. I slowly slide down headfirst, between them.

"0967"	"(07/15/1997)"	"Sex Fantasy I have a fantasy about having sex with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas in many ways. She is giving me fellatio. I give her cunnilingus, which I can tell by her voice is kind of painful for her, as I lick her clitoris. So I slow down and do things differently until it is more pleasurable for her. I keep giving her cunnilingus, and really get into it. I like her butt hole. We have sex in different positions, and I realize that eased entry is not missionary position, but rather with her laying on her back and having her legs spread and up on my shoulders. This way proves to be the easiest entry and the best sex."
"0968"	"(07/15/1997)"	"First Night Terror I feel pressure on my back as I lay in bed. I know a man is there. I can't move. He laughs a wild and stringy laugh. I know I'm dreaming, and I know this is a night terror. I'm scared. I thrash about in my sleep, but my body doesn't move. I swear at the man, telling him, ""Let me go, you fucker!"" I'm scared. I awake and see my alarm clock with red digital letters flashing 12:00."
"0969"	"(07/15/1997)"	"I Block Pretty Well Two men are outside Carter School throwing a football around. One of them looks like my classmate from Brimson Al Livern. One man kicks the ball high in the air. I'm going to catch it, but it bounces near my feet. One of the men is my old basketball coach Gary Simms, and the other is a football coach. I tell them, ""You guys taught me to block pretty well"", and a I block both of them like I was a football lineman. I note that my trouble was keeping my balance. My weight would sometimes be too far forward, and when the opposing linemen dropped down to his knees, I'd fall over him."

In another car I see my classmate from Brimson Monique Thorble, a woman from my grade school named  Liza Kroll, and two other women. They are all made up for a college dance. They are wearing bright, literally flashing clothes, lots of makeup, and glitter on their faces. I feel like a dork riding in a big station wagon. They know I see them, and they look back at me, noticing that I notice them, but not noticing me back. They are making fun of me, saying I am funny looking and gross, and acting repulsed that I notice them in the car. I'm at Carter School. Lots of kids are there to get school supplies. Parents may be there too. I see my grade school classmate Jeff Vaurnet, and talk to him. I say I work with his brother Ryan. Jeff seems to know this already. He says, ""Yeah, leeches with hooks in them with leather (somehow on the hooks)."" There are long lines to buy school supplies. There is a line for each of two categories. I'm in the category with more people. The categories are based on experience: maybe grade level. There is a fat salesman there. When it is my turn I tell him he is a jerk. I deride him and leave. I am outside of the school. I try to slam dunk a plastic milk carton on a rusty net less basketball rim. The rim is high, and I don't come close, so I lay it in. I think people are there watching."

I land the plane in a very quick, almost crashing way, but the plane and I are okay. My friend Kevin Simpson, my mom, sister Ramona, and my bosses two dogs, Gusty and Musty are there. Arnold Schwarzenegger is also there. He has an X on him. Where I land the plane there is an eagle that is dying, lying in a large skull. I hug my mom, and tell her I love her. The man who owns the plane then flies it, and I push the plane off the dock and climb up the plane as it begins to move. I am getting dragged along a big by the skis of the plane."
"0972"	"(07/15/1997)"	"Buying Beer In Australia I'm in Australia with others. We're at a liquor store. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor exits with a six-pack of Pepsi or beer, and wants my to buy it for him, since I'm 21. I will buy it and he'll pay me back. My friend Tom Napper says he'll get 12 Miller Genuine Drafts. I say not to, and offer to split a 12-pack with him, which we agree upon. The beer is expensive. Someone finds my wallet, which is my old black wallet, on the floor. I have a lot of money in it. I think I may bring some money home after the trip to Australia. I buy the beer, and get Gino some Moosehead. There is an Australian man who is buying something after me. He is short a couple dollars and asks us to give him money. I hesitantly give him two dollars. He needs $1.50 more. Someone else has change so he shoves a dollar back in my shirt pocket angrily, and gets the change he needs from the other man. I go out of the store, turn right, and start to follow some women down the street. I hop over a green bicycle. I don't keep following them, but turn into a bar-like area that seems to be attached to the liquor store. I see my friend Jill Banks at a table with two other people, one who looks familiar. Jill starts laughing at me as I walk towards her. I know she is laughing at my facial hair. I think: I don't need this ridicule, and I turn around and leave. I walk by my high school classmate Mya Rousing at a table and say hi. I don't say anything else even though I know she'd like to talk. I keep walking. I find the table where we are sitting. My friends Stephen and Jose Ramos, Gino, Tom, Emily Zates, and others are there. I only bought a six-pack of Miller Genuine Draft; I forgot I was splitting a 12-pack with Tom. Emily got a 30-pack of ""Party of Five"" for $19! That is a lot of beer, cheap! I think maybe I should get some of that to hold us over. An older man there walks by. He asks us whose breath smells. Tom says something in reply. The man then says that it's Tom's breath!"

I ask them how they know the Thomas'. Sherry says she has a class with Annie. There are many shorthaired women there. My dad and I talk to Bill Thomas. I try to avoid Annie. My dad takes out his checkbook to make a deal with Bill regarding Annie and I. Annie comes towards me happily. I turn and direct myself towards her when I realize she's approaching. She is wearing blue and is happy. She happily says that she and I are going to take a 10-minute walk. I guess my dad bought or bargained with Bill for me to have 30 minutes with Annie. There is a boat in front of their house. A motor is in the boat. The boat is old and run of water: run down. Annie drives slowly out of the driveway in a small green car, ready to go on a walk. My dad follows in a car. I'm walking. I motion with my hand for them to go by me and keep going because something is not right: the timing or a distraction. A big Lite Ice beer semi truck comes towards us, the doors on our side of the truck are swinging open as it goes past. I Think Annie will come back and get me for our walk."
"0975"	"(07/16/1997)"	"The Movie ""Pincushion"" I wait for my dad outside the courthouse in Wilmerton. I back my truck up and part it. Elmer and Shannon Mohs are waiting in a truck in the parking lot too. I'm going to a movie with my dad and my sister Ramona. Ramona and I have a movie picked out. The three of us walk across the bridge over the Main River downtown. It is a metal grate bridge. My dad wants to see the movie ""Pincushion"". We have heard it's good, so we agree to go. We have sometime before the movie, so we're going to the Dairy Queen nearby in my brother Wally's car. I'm in a mall-like restaurant/hotel-like place. My mom and Ramona have come to clean up my sister Heather's cat's mess at the hotel. Heather wanted a cat for her birthday. She is at work, and can't take care of it. There is shredded paper and urine in the fountain of the hotel that needs to be cleaned up. There is a formal gathering occurring there. I empty a garbage can containing green class. A man tells me to be quiet because of the gathering. I am quiet. I tell my mom I think she has given Heather too many chances. I take the trash to throw it away in rooms that have signs on the outside that say ""Open"". Two very short ladies go to use the bathroom. Along the walls are photographs and drawings of northern pike's mouths with the whole fish in the background. There are some men painting in the mall. They ask me no questions when I toss out the garbage."
"0976"	"(07/17/1997)"	"Stephen's Coma There is a woman at a portage on the Big Resort Area who has had a seizure. My boss Mike Hollow goes out in a boat with my friend Stephen Ramos. When they are out at the portage, Stephen hits his head on a rock and goes into a coma, I am told. Stephen's father Franco is then going out in a boat with Mike. They go backwards in the boat. The area is not Eagle Lake: it is a different lake. I am on shore. Mike and Franco need a double-bladed paddle. I get their attention and drive out in a wide fishing boat to give it to them. On the way back I drive across grassy lawns and cement sidewalks in the boat. It seems I am over near Riverside School in Wilmerton. I get down to the end of the lawns and do a baseball slide onto my high school classmate Tanya Simmons' front lawn. She is inside the house cooking: I see her through a window, and feel like I'm disturbing them. I go into my friend Tiny Comb's house, which is then there. Tiny, his brother Matt, and their mother are there. They warn me about scraping up other people's lawns. They say people will be mad at me. I say I understand. I'm at home in the large bedroom upstairs. My friend Stephen is in a bed. He moves. I say, ""Ramosluuu, are you awake?"" He is. I ask him what he remembers. He has no recollection of his coma. I tell him what happened to him. I'm going to bed. He shuts off the lights in the hallway for me. There are other people in the room, including several young girls about 14 years old. One has red hair, and several have brown hair. I get a phone message from a girl from Dayton's whose name is Cretia or Lucretia. I remember meeting with her vaguely when I understand the message. She is going to call back. My classmate from Brimson Jana Green is there eating some kind of cookie-like cold cereal. She doesn't like it. I try it, and spill some on my bed. I don't want to eat it off my bed because the bed is dirty, crusty, and gross."
"0977"	"(07/18/1997)"	"Continuously Blooming Flower There is a plant that grows in the desert that flowers continuously. It is supposed to be rock-like. It is supposed to turn into rock. You can dig these plants up underground and find rock there. Here in the desert they bloom and flower continuously."
"0978"	"(07/18/1997)"	"Kissing Amy Goodbye I'm at some sort of a staff gathering or dinner for Fishing Haven. One man there is getting married. I seem to remember him having something sewn haphazardly on his crotch or zipper, very jaggedly. I talk with my coworker Amy Rancher and say maybe I'll see her next summer, but maybe not. We kiss each other goodbye. We'll see each other later tonight."
"0979"	"(07/18/1997)"	"Five Minutes Is All I Need There is an old woman in a workout room. I go through the crowded room carrying four unwrapped bars of soap. My classmate from Brimson Jim Miller and his buddy come in acting exhausted, like they're recovering from a trip. The old woman says the room closes in five minutes. I say five minutes is all I need. I start doing my back exercises. My left ankle is sore. I am in a different room. My classmate from Brimson Eric Dole puts a present box in the hallway. It is a gag box of jokes: it itself is a joke. Someone drops a big box of Styrofoam peanuts out from above. Eric complains to the president of the college that he is ill. This is his ploy to draw attention away from himself concerning the gag gift. People all know it is Eric's ploy. Everyone knows except the president."
"0980"	"(07/18/1997)"	"Serving Mass in Orange I'm serving mass at Carter church as an altar boy. I think I volunteer to because no one was there to serve. The candles by the altar are burning out; there is no wick left. I'm wearing a green and white sweater that is too short for me. My white t-shirt shows from underneath the sweater. I have on a pair of jeans and tennis shoes. Back in the sacristy I change into and orange and white striped shirt with an orange windbreaker over it, and tan colored pants with boots. Fathers Dan Pink and Vance Brock are presiding. I see them in the sacristy. I get an extra long robe to wear. The sizes on the robes have a three-digit number. My number may be 267. My brother Wally is at church but doesn't help serve. I play the Bare Naked Ladies or Grant Lee Buffalo in a cassette player over the speakers in church before mass starts. When I shut the music off, my sister Ramona goes up and starts playing the piano as the introduction to mass. I go out the south side door, running to get back by the time she is done playing piano. I go through the basement and the kitchen. Items for baking are set out. I'll come by later and get something to eat. I go up the back stairs to the sacristy. One sign reads ""Construction"". The hallways lead to a hospital and other places. I have trouble finding the sacristy. I find it: it leads to or is a gymnasium. It's full of people. My mom, Ramona, Wally, sister Heather, aunt Sheila Redding, uncle Rusty Redding, and their kids Melvin, Melissa, and Rich are there shooting free throws in some sort of a game or contest. I'm outside Carter School. We get 24 large metal cans delivered on two trucks. I carry two cans at a time on my shoulders to exercise my back muscles. My boss Phoebe Mills may be there telling me where to put things. I haul the cans to the old equipment/ball room. The trucks that left the barrels also left some wet, dirty equipment packs for us, from the dump. I hang them above the Thermarests in the equipment room at Fishing Haven. One man driving the truck wants out glass for recycling. There is some outside and some in the equipment room. My friend Tom Napper is there with a big dog. It wants to go outside again, and Tom is annoyed with it. I'm back in the old equipment/ball room. Some people who are seniors in high school have submarined the room, messing it up. The room is half full of balloons. I try to pop them with a torch, which doesn't work well. Then I pop them with a scissors, so we'll see and take class. The school is empty. There is a mail jeep with a red and blue stripe parked outside. I find some chocolate ice cream in a refrigerator down where the first grade coat area is. I run with the ice cream. I'm going to eat it or put it in the freezer. I go through the gymnasium. The door to he music room is open. I get down near the north end of the building on the lower level where the freezer is. My third grade teacher Liza Minikel is there cleaning. I hid the ice cream on the side of my body, and run down the hall towards the main doors. She doesn't see the ice cream, and must think I'm strange for running. Ramona sees me and chases me. I fake going out the back door to the playground by pushing it open, so she would hear it, then hiding around the sliding gymnasium door. I laugh as I go up the stairs, and she knows it's me. I don't fool her, and she comes into the gymnasium. She is wearing a bra and full brief underwear. She asks me if I like them. They seem scrunched up: vertically compressed."
"0981"	"(07/18/1997)"	"Sex With Amy My coworker Jenny from Fishing Haven has two main men and two backup men, Tom, another employee, and I. My coworker Amy Rancher is in a car leaving my driveway at home. I ask her to stay and she resists. I kiss her and tell her no one will be home. I'm hanging my body into her car window. She agrees to stay. I take her shirt off with my teeth and lick her body. I block her breasts and she strokes my penis. I take off her underwear. Her vagina is wet. We're on a couch. My high school friend Binky Ahmed is there. I make him leave us alone. We go into the living room, and may be going to take a shower. We are naked and horny. She sits on my fat erection, and we have sex. She leans back against me, her back against my chest, and my erection slips out of her vagina. I put it back in. I ejaculate semen all over. Something happens with my sister Ramona's aqua colored watch. I may ejaculate on it. I have no pleasure when I ejaculate. I masturbate in the bathroom to get the pleasurable sensation of ejaculating. Water is overflowing from the sink onto the floor."
"0982"	"(07/21/1997)"	"Tim's Phone Conversation My friend Tim Zelling and I are talking on the phone. I called him. He tells me the dates of their Big Resort Area trip. They are leaving Thursday or Friday and staying for three days. The dates work well for me. I ask who is going. He isn't sure. Our friend Hank Anderson is doubtful to go. I say I am going. The total number comes to 10 people, if everyone goes."
"0983"	"(07/21/1997)"	"Party Station A party is going to occur. Some men my age come up to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, others, and I to tell us about it. It will be held down at an old brown deserted train station. The men who tell us are tobacco chewing, Oakley and baseball cap wearing, gimps that I think are losers. I say I know where the spot is, and act like we'll show up, but I know I won't go because I don't want to."
"0984"	"(07/21/1997)"	"Getting Home Late I get home at 6:00 or 6:30am. My mom is there. She is in bed. I say I am going to sleep for five hours before I get up, by noon. I feel a little bit rebellious coming home so late. The room is like an apartment, with a couple beds."
"0985"	"(07/21/1997)"	"Amy's Period My coworker Amy Rancher is waiting for her menstrual period. Her mother wants to know when she gets it. She should be getting it soon. Amy gets out a tampon and goes to the bathroom. She has gotten her period. I put a tampon in me: in my vagina or in my butt hole. It doesn't fit well: part of it sticks out and won't stay in. There is blood on it. I may get it to fit."
"0986"	"(07/22/1997)"	"Slip Bobber Fishing I'm walking with my high school teammate Tony Kramer to Jefferson School in Oak Valley. We are in front of the old rectory on Bauer Avenue near 1st Street. I'm wearing maroon colors, and he is wearing tan. We're dressed up. We walk to Jefferson, where our teammate John Kulik and others are playing basketball. There are cabins up north. I stay with Tony in one cabin. He is also staying with a woman named Kristen in a different cabin. Our cabin is a one-hour cabin. It is pretty nice, with a double bed and a refrigerator. My friend Matt Yams and my boss Mike Hollow tell me of a dream of catching frogs. I am going fishing with a slip-bobber and my slip-bobber rod with 12lb test line. Mike makes me take my ultralite rod too. I walk by my high school friend Tina Totts in the forest area where the cabins are. She asks me about her eyebrow clipper, as if I have it and she wants it back. I see or am in a scene where people are sledding. It is winter and the hills are covered with snow. People go fast down hills on different types of sleds. One man does a nice jump. I walk through a trough-like stream of icy water. I go into a bathroom in a building. My grade school football coach Fred Truck is in the bathroom cleaning his butt hole with bidet."
"0987"	"(07/22/1997)"	"Ruining Kevin's Ego People are in front of my truck, pushing back against it as I try to drive. The people include my friends Stephen Ramos, Kevin Simpson, Lyle Zeffman, and Marybeth Neumann. I try to drive, but the truck won't move forward. I am furious! I get out of the truck and promptly throw a punch at Stephen, which grazes his chin. I don't punch Kevin because I have too much respect for him. I yell at them both furiously! I grab hold of Kevin by the shirt and tell him to leave my truck alone and respect me! Marybeth is in front of the truck. I ask her politely to move the table that is also in front of the truck, so I can drive. She refuses to do so. I pick Marybeth up and put her in another place. I drive, pushing the table as I do. I say that I'd beat up Lyle, who is also in front of the truck, but he's not worth the effort. He lays there feeling insulted and does nothing. Marybeth is annoying. She is acting like a feminist. She calls me a homosexual, which is a name for someone who discriminates against others. I move her and tell her to leave. I say seriously and angrily that I don't ever want to talk to her again. She is trying to coerce Kevin into adopting a child, as if Kevin is the father of it. I am adamantly against this, because it will ruin Kevin's ego."
"0988"	"(07/22/1997)"	"Game Room There is a game room of some sort. Two women are playing ping-pong with a specific paddle for each hand, which is shaped differently. My coworkers Jenny, Tom, and others are there. There are some balls that are made of a special substance called ____ (I forget). There are some attractive women with good bodies wearing tight clothes that are there."

"0990"	"(07/22/1997)"	"Sex With Melissa Cod I am in a play with my high school classmate Melissa Cod and a group of others. We return to my home and go upstairs to my room and my sister's room. I say something about getting fellatio twice from the same women for $5 or $10. My high school classmates Binky Ahmed and Nate Nelling take hallucinogenic mushrooms. They ingest green pills with yellow liquid. One of them spits it into the mouth of the other. Melissa and I engage in one short kiss. Everyone leaves when she goes to the bottom of the stairs. I ask her what she is doing tonight. She comes back up the stairs and says that I really didn't kiss her before: it was not a good, hard, engaging kiss. I am in my underwear. She is crying very hard. I hold and hug her as we lay on my bed. She stands and takes off her shirt. I push her up against a wall and kiss her, hard. I kneel while she stands. She starts to give me fellatio, and I lay down. She puts my hand on my erection, to have me stroke it as she sucks. I say my penis probably tastes bad, from the sweat from the play. She says it doesn't. I lose my erection. I gently stroke her vagina with my fingers. She shudders, I think in pleasure. She says, ""Please don't hurt me."" My penis becomes erect again. I flip her over onto her back, put her legs up, and penetrate her. I move her on the bed and keep thrusting. I thrust deeper and deeper each time. She is on her back on the edge of the bed and I am kneeling on the floor. It is uncomfortable for her. I am close to ejaculating. She is in pain. I pull my erection out, and tell her to give me fellatio because I'm about to come. She is in pain, and doesn't do this. I ejaculate weakly on her, on my sleeping bag, and on an open beer bottle."
"0991"	"(07/22/1997)"	"Roller Skate Policewoman There is a woman who is picked up and transported with a laser by three alien people. She has a gun and is on roller skates. She seems to be a police officer. The laser moves her to another place where she keeps acting as if she were in the first place. She falls into a water drainage area, and gets pulled into a big water tunnel. The woman is a partner with Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Arnold is at the gymnasium with his adversary, competing by doing one-legged jumping calf raises. He gets a phone call. It is the woman, his partner."
"0992"	"(07/23/1997)"	"Tourist Muskie Fishing I'm going muskie fishing down at the river, which is also Crescent Lake. I hold a very short, fat muskie in my hand. It has a body like a crappie but has a big head and tail. I walk up the ramp way, then hop over another ramp above it. The ramps are slanted, like a switchback. I let the little muskie go down a slide-like black tube with water in it. It slides down. That is how one releases a muskie here. I am walking and I see my grade school classmate Helen Vader. She has really changed. I remember when I last saw her at the fair and told her that she had really changed. I don't say that now. She has chin-length straight blond hair and is wearing a lot of makeup, including lots of pink blush. We talk a little bit. She is going to school in Forkville. I see her mother Doreen Vader and wave at her. Doreen doesn't recognize me. The area is crowded with both fishermen and non-fishermen. I notice my aunt Sheila Redding and cousin Rich are standing next to me on my left. I turn and say hi to them. My uncle Rusty is there too. Sheila sees or hears my friends coming. I look down the walkway and see my friends Kevin Simpson, Bubba Hacker, Stephen Ramos, and Tony Kramer coming to fish! I yell to them my greeting, ""Sluuu!"" They come over to where I am. Tony bumps me hard when we meet. I'm not sure this is friendly or belligerent. We go to fish muskies. I walk past a swimming pool in which I see a northern pike chases a kid's spoon lure and hit it. The boy catches the fish. My big muskie lure gets caught in Tony's green sweatshirt. He gets the hook out and throws it to me. Not wanting to catch the lure, I let it land. The metal lip on the lure gets bent. I swear! I think I put the lip of the lure in my mouth, like a mouthpiece. My classmate from Brimson Ed Yarns is there. I go downstairs to where we get in. A man operates this place. It is a tourist place. I jump over some parts of the stairs onto another set of stairs. All the rules for the place are posted. People come and pay for time to fish here. I have my yellow spoon and two huge plugs. My high school classmate Jack Miller has the plugs in his life vest. The man is going to charge me $2 to use the spoon and $3 for some sort of permit. He says that the fishing will damage the rainbow trout population, and that's why I have to pay the fee. I say I'm not fishing for trout, I'm fishing for muskies, but he says it doesn't matter. Kevin comes down to the man and I. He doesn't have the other two lures. It would cost more to bring those in. I don't' way to may that much, and I leave. I go up to the man to get my yellow spoon, and the man tries to keep mine and give me a cheap version that looks like mine! I get angry with him and call him a fraud. I tell him I'll expose him! He quickly covers up his name on the boxes and things that are around so I don't see his name and tell others bad things about him. His name has five letters, starts with K, and contains the letters l, e, and i in it as well. I leave and go upstairs, walking out of the place. There is a very attractive young woman sitting at a table with others. She reminds me of an attractive young female customer we had at work recently. She looks at me briefly. I catch her off guard as I walk by. I can tell she is attracted to me. I walk out of the place, tossing a crumpled up piece of paper at a garbage can and missing. I don't stop to pick it up, and feel like a fool because the attractive woman may have seen my do this. I am walking in a mall. There is a bar there. I think of stopping to get a beer. My classmates from Brimson Monique Thorble, Seth Voss, and others walk by. My high school classmate Carrie Zadra walks by."
"0993"	"(07/24/1997)"	"Light Stick Game I'm at basketball practice. It has been a long time since my high school team has had a game. There is a new man there who has red hair. We are warming up. The coach sends me down the road a ways. He says 50 miles, but just means for me to go down. I go down a road and stop where I see a blue X on the ground. I'm on Home Avenue in Oak Valley and have just walked from near home to past my neighbor's house. The coach throws a light stick at me, the kind one cracks at Halloween so it glows. He throws it up in the air. It is a game of some kind. My classmate from Brimson Ivory Alshire is there."
"0994"	"(07/24/1997)"	"Ramona's Crush I'm at Scott Junior High in Wilmerton. My sister Ramona is there and she sees a boy that she is attracted to. He is a bit older and may be a popular television or movie personality. I tell her she should ask him to shoot baskets. She does this as I leave."
"0995"	"(07/24/1997)"	"Cream Less Shaving I have sideburns like I do in real life. My brother Wally is there. I am shaving my sideburns. The shaving cream goes away very fast, as soon as I put it on it just isn't there. I splash some water on my face to see if the shaving cream will foam up again. It doesn't. I cut the side of my cheek near my ear shaving."
"0996"	"(07/24/1997)"	"Moving Into A House I'm moving into the new house Whitman House near Brimson. I arrive, and am living with my friends Norman Noman, Stephen Ramos, and a woman named Katie from the Seafare Restaurant in the Big Resort Area. Katie shows me upstairs. Norman's room has lots of sports equipment and other stuff on the floor. Stephen and I are supposed to share a room upstairs. It has brown carpet and walls. The color seems like it's a cheesy brown from the 1970's. There is a bed for me. Stephen's things are all set up, including shelves and posters. I want to check out the room in the basement first before I move upstairs. On the way upstairs a woman comes in the basement from the outside through a door. Outside the door is dirty, broken glass bottle area. Someone commented on how we should be sure to lock the doors."
"0997"	"(07/24/1997)"	"Annie's Underwear Shopping I'm on the sidewalk at the southeast corner of the intersection of 2nd Street and Next Avenue in Oak Valley. I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We kiss and touch each other. Her hair blows in my mouth. She has to buy underwear. I say that ""this makes me want to bend her over"". We talk and it is clear that any physical contact that occurs between us is simply because we're physically attracted to each other. There are no other expectations or commitments. This is made clear. We are somewhere near Curve or Last Avenue in Oak Valley, somewhat near the Olson's house but also near the yellow house on the end of Last Avenue next to the railroad tracks. She asks me, ""What did you get from that day?"", referring to the day I wrote the brutally honest letter to her. [I awaken here due to my alarm clock, but I know that what I was about to reply was, ""A feeling"". It was a feeling of relief, of freedom, of honesty. A very good feeling.]"
"0998"	"(07/25/1997)"	"Old Fashioned Green Car I'm in a parking lot. My brother Wally and others are there. There are two or three old fashioned green cars. They are a rich dark green color, but not shiny or flashy. Painted n the corners of these cars are pink squiggly lines. Someone there says how he or she would like a green car like that. I think they are indicating one without hubcaps. I get in one of the cars, and the keys are under the seat! I start the car. Wally gets in the passenger seat, very surprised that I have the keys. I drive forward a bit and bump into one of the other green cars. The car is difficult to drive at first. I man comes out, and is angry. He asks, ""Where'd you get the keys?"" I tell him they were under the seat. I start to drive. The man looks at the other green car to see if I scratched it when I bumped into it. He gets into one of the other cars. He seems to be an owner-type guy, like he operates the place with these cars. He is going wherever I am. He doesn't want me to go without him, so he's coming along wherever I go. Two other dark green cars go out besides the one I drive. It is dark out. It's fun to drive. It feels neat, and I am nervous. I'm not going anywhere in particular, its' just that I'm out driving the old car. I'm nervous because I don't want to damage the car. The car is a stick shift. I accelerate quickly, after a bit of driving when I'm used to the car. I can see the old fashioned tires spinning around. I say it won't accelerate as quickly as my truck. I'm then on a bicycle. I cut across the road near a sidewalk where my grade school classmate Beth Tense is. I ride across in front of a turning car, and am close to being hit. Another woman is there. The bicycle seems to not have handlebars. I control the bicycle by shifting my weight or grabbing the frame somehow. It is as if there is a rod or stick that I use to steer, which extends out in front of the bicycle a couple feet. I reach straight down as if I were grabbing onto the frame and grab this steering device. I ride by some people that go to Brimson. My high school classmate Tammy Jostens walks by. We look at each other, knowing that we recognize each other, but don't say hi. I ride on the grass and the boulevard. I ride by people I know but we don't greet each other. I see a sign for Superhighway 200, which seems to be my destination. This may be at or near Brimson. There are racquetball courts with large windows cut out of the sides of them. There are houses there. My classmate from Brimson Kari Kosslyn cries because she is sad when her roommates go by her without talking to her. I say it's sad when that happens."
"0999"	"(07/26/1997)"	"Crossing The Street I'm crossing the street in Lakeville. There is a traffic police officer there. He says, ""One hundred, two hundred, three hundred."" A hundred is about equal to one person. When he says this he means of the person to cross the road. Two hundred does not mean two people, it means one person: he just counts in order. I'm on a bicycle. I have someone named Aaron's film. It is too late to drop it off for developing. There is a huge satellite dish by the town that turns."
"1000"	"(07/26/1997)"	"Tow On The Dirty River I'm doing a tow with my friend Jasper Parsons on the Dirty River in Oak Valley. We need to move the two boats from by the Railroad Company train area to the portion of the river behind the Boy Scout Building. We can't drive or pull the boats through the water to go from the train area to the river, though there is a small swampy waterway. It is not big enough. I have both boats loaded onto one trailer, side by side. I look for a spot to land them. The pond in Hill Park is a possibility, I think, if we drive the boats through the storm drainage pipes. I see the pipes are full of water, and there would be no room for a boat. Our boss Mike tells us we need to pick up a different party of customers. We need to do one job after another, and will be a time crunch: we'll be late for the second party. I can't find a spot to land the double trailer. The sandy area right next to the river by the Boy Scout building is too steep to use a double trailer. There is another landing we'll have to use. It is back past Big Rock and connects to the main river via that swampy area. It is a nice, big, open paved landing. It is just a bit out of our way, but we'll have to take the time to do it. I eat all six rolls. Jasper asks me if there are any rolls: he wants some. I apologize, and say I ate them all. My boss Phoebe Mills threatens her partner Mike Hollow. There is a moving man with a wife-beater under his work shirt. He is young, tan, and strong. Phoebe says she's going home and she'll make love to the moving man. The moving man was just there. There is a line of food, like a buffet. My brother Wally is there and others I know. I get some food for Jasper since I ate all the rolls, and some for myself."
"1001"	"(07/27/1997)"	"Orgy I'm with my friends Bubba Hacker, Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos at home. We're joking around laughing. My mom is trying to sleep. She says it's 1:00 am. We'll have to go to the basement and do something mellower. I'm sitting in my living room with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, and our friends Emerald Reinhold, Esther Thurman, Elise Rooks, Marybeth Neumann, and Stephen. Stephen says he would sit there amongst us in his underwear. This is like a dare, so everyone says that they would sit there in their underwear. I am the last to respond, because I think this is a dumb idea. We all take off out clothes. I say that looking at all the breasts has gotten me aroused. I am giving Annie cunnilingus. At first it seems like she is not physically there, as if I am nuzzling the thighs of an imaginary person. Then she is there. I do some kind of sucking action with my mouth over her clitoris. I lick and finger her clitoris. She starts rubbing her clitoris with her own fingers, masturbating. She is really into the sexual experience, so if I don't do exactly what she wants she'll do it herself or move my hand so it's done right. I see her genitals vividly. They are larger than life: bright red and pink colored, full and fleshy. She is secreting a lot of vaginal juices. She has an orgasm. She ejaculates a stream of fluid out of her urethra at the moment of orgasm. Stephen gives someone cunnilingus. There are other naked women available all around. I start to lick Annie again, and she doesn't like it. Emerald says something about Annie's ejaculation, implying I should know that Annie wouldn't be ready for or wanting cunnilingus again. The week before this, Annie and I had a sexual encounter. She has a crooked tooth, because she hit it when she was drunk at a bar. Then I have a crooked tooth. People talk about good smelling underwear. I say I don't have any. Someone says that I do: those polyester shiny silver pair. The whole time that this orgy occurs, my mom is in the next room, which is her bedroom."

My junior high classmate Jim Harris' older brother is working in a computer store along with a woman who is wearing a suit and tie. I go in the store and make copies of something to do with a personality inventory, like the MMPI, and something else that has to do with work."
"1003"	"(07/27/1997)"	"Carter Dirt Lot I'm in the dirt lot behind Carter School after returning late one night from a baseball game. There are lights for the lot which are located on its northwest corner, by the alley. I switch the light on and off. I put some wine bottles by the north end of the fence that borders the lot on the east side. There is a man there who also went to the baseball game. He is on a bicycle, and it going to ride home."
"1004"	"(07/28/1997)"	"Dark Side of the Moon I'm with my roommate Sean Williams. We're in a dump-like gravel pit area. We see a white car that has Montana license plates, and then has Nebraska plates. Then the car is gone. I know for sure the car was there five seconds before it vanished. We didn't hear it start up or leave. We look and it has not rolled down the hill. I suspect supernatural activity. A flashlight is shined towards us, and a woman calls out. She needs help. She has been shot in the knee. She is with a man, who may have been shot as well. Sean doesn't want to help them. I think that it might be a trap. I run to the side, behind a building. She yells out in a blood-curdling scream, ""Damn you! Bastard!"" She yells this repeatedly. I am going to help her. By going around the building I want to make sure it is not a trap or a hoax. My classmate from Brimson Jill Banks and I are behind the building. We have to run fast. She says, ""We have to make a good show."" We're going around the building to see the woman and man's predicament from the other side of the pit. Behind the building a couple feet of snow is on the ground. There area is the dark side of the moon."
"1005"	"(07/28/1997)"	"Racist Camper There is a white man with his wife and three boys, who have blond hair. The family is camping. There is an Asian man there who talks slowly. The white man makes fun of the Asian man. I think this is cruel."
"1006"	"(07/28/1997)"	"Beer In Calculus Class I'm in a lunch line with others. I have my retainer in my mouth, which I have not worn in a very long time. It does not fit well, and my speech is slurred, it is difficult to talk. My high school classmate Carmen Allure and Brimson classmate Shannon Barns are there. They also have retainers in which makes it difficult for them to talk. Carmen has very short hair, shaved in the back. I'm going up stairs to level six of a building. I go past my high school crush Harmony Allure on the sixth floor. She is at a sink brushing her teeth. She has shorter hair, hairy legs, and is wearing big yellow slippers and a green robe. I'm in school going to a class. She is out of school. I walk behind her pretending not to notice her. I get near the room and realize my class is downstairs: it's a 10:30am calculus class with my calculus professor from Brimson, Professor Simpson. It is close to 11:00am, and I'm late. I run down the stairs, jumping over railings, skipping flights of stairs. I'm trying to act cool near Harmony, and I succeed in not falling as I run down the stairs. I get to the classroom and enter. The class is watching a movie. My friend Stephen Ramos, grade school classmates Eric Stoner and Patrick Bergman, and high school teammate Barry Everson are there. I don't sit down in my normal seat, but go to where my two returned tests area. I take them to Simpson's desk and he explains my grades on each, and the grading procedure. I got a 91% on the first test, which I am happy with, and a 25% on the second test. On the second test there were two questions, 107-114 points apiece. The questions were not about math. I think the second question had to do with the earth, moon, and tides. The answers were supposed to be well explained, so saying it simply, using one perspective, wouldn't get one all the points. The answer had to be inclusive of many perspectives and aspects. I have a Heineken beer. I take a sip of it. Eric, Patrick, and my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper have a sip of it too. Then they drink it all! I can have a beer in class because I'm 21. I intend to charge those guys $.60 each for the beer. It cost me $2, and all I got was one sip! I tell Stephen that I went down six flights of stairs in about 10 seconds with no flaws."
"1007"	"(07/28/1997)"	"Birthday Fishing A boy and his grandpa, who is my high school math teacher Ray Banks, are talking with me. It is Ray's birthday today: he is 51. The two guys went fishing yesterday and caught a lot of fish."
"1008"	"(07/28/1997)"	"Sara Miller's Grudge I buy something at a store, and then I go to the service desk. My friend from Brimson Sara Miller is working there. I haven't seen her in a while, and she has longer hair. I go up to her and she doesn't talk to me. Another woman assists me. I want to put something on my credit card, when I had actually written a check for it. Then Sara speaks to me. She is holding a grudge against me: she says I'm a ____ (the equivalent of an asshole or a fucker). The woman that is assisting me says something. I decide to play the asshole role that Sara says I am, so I tell the woman to shut the fuck up. I say to Sara, ""You know how I am: I mean no offense"", implying that she has no reason to hold a grudge against me. She changes her attitude towards me and gives me a piece of paper that says Happy Birthday Kenneth. We seem to get along fine then, and she is her smiling self."
"1009"	"(07/29/1997)"	"My Mom's Baby My mom is having a baby. She wants to go to Oval Lake in the Big Resort Area with my sister Ramona tomorrow. I say to her, ""What if your water breaks?"" She doesn't think it will. She is due at 6:30 am tomorrow. Then her water breaks on the dining room floor, and the carpet gets wet. She instructs Ramona and I as to what we should do, because she is experienced. We hurry. We are to put the chicken, hot dogs, bratwursts, and potatoes in a cooler. We are bringing these to the hospital with a big pot, to cook them. I get ready. I bring a whole small chicken. I get dressed. My friend Jerry Pasons and my roommate Sean Williams from Fishing Haven are in my room sleeping. Sean then goes to urinate. Jerry is still sleeping, and rolls over onto Sean's bed. I'm at the hospital. My brother Wally is there. I grip my mom's hand while she squeezes my hand back. Wally just found out that my dad is the father of the baby. I have known this for a while, and am not happy about it. I am afraid of what will happen, and what we'll see: my mom's vagina! I eat a cheeseburger with tomato, bacon, and cheese. I'm swimming with my friend Kevin Simpson. We have life jackets or seat cushions on so we float around. We are in very deep water, like an ocean. We swim and dive under the surface, having fun. My high school classmates Sam Poll and Karl Mueller think we are diving for lake trout. I play with a full can of gas, which floats. There is a little red house underwater. Some very big and tall weeds come up from extremely deep water. I have fins on my feet, and I swim above the tips of the weeds, underwater. I swim down towards the red house. There is a woman near the house. I seem to be able to breath underwater. I jump from the ground or roof of the house. I go a long ways with one spring of my legs, like there is less gravity, though I am underwater. There is a black funnel that falls or sinks quickly past the house. I go after it quickly. It lands on the surface of some water, which is underwater. I swim very fast with my flippers, as if it is important, and swoop down and pick the funnel up. I swoop upwards, flying, and lucid, realizing I am dreaming. I try not to wake up. I focus on the area around a tree. I fly around it. I think I may fly through the ground, going under and through it, and then coming up, like either the ground or I am intangible. I try to make my ex-girlfriend Annie appear in the tree area so we can have sex. I try to have sex with something-anything, even the ground."
"1010"	"(07/29/1997)"	"Receiving Cunnilingus People are skiing in wet snow. There is an area with no snow in Vail where people are hiking and cross country skiing. I ask some people if they've seen anyone cross country skiing in the foothills near Jackson, which is where I am. They haven't: it is all hiking, even in snow. I'm on a bicycle and am with my friend Niles Zelling. I go down a hill. The bicycle flips over. It is sunny but cold. I'm dressed warm, but Niles isn't. I say I have a chunk of something slimy in my crotch from masturbating earlier. I think I have female genitals. They feel warm and slimy. I'm at home near the front driveway. A person licks my vagina, and it feels good. Then I am inside the house and have male genitalia. I'm having sex with a woman on a piano bench. I think about how homosexuality is futile in terms of reproduction. I rub the woman's clitoris with my finger as I have sex with her from behind. I'm not sure if she enjoys what I'm doing: I'm just trying things out."
"1011"	"(07/29/1997)"	"Going to Middleton I'm at the University of Montana-Great Falls campus. I'm on a bicycle, riding towards Middleton College. My friend Tiny Combs gets out of a lecture at Middleton and I see him. He didn't enjoy the class. I'm near home. It is really icy, and I slip on my bicycle as I ride. My classmate from Brimson Anthony Holden and others are at a party. It seems to be near the northeast corner of the intersection of 2nd Street and Next Avenue in Oak Valley. I decide to drive my truck to Middleton, and give others a ride in the bed. I go home, and people are gone on vacation. The front door is open. I close and lock it. There are two blue Chevrolet Suburbans in the driveway. I think one is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas', but then I realize they belong to Fishing Haven. I want someone to drive the suburban to Middleton while I drive my truck so tomorrow someone can drive it to work at Fishing Haven."
"1012"	"(07/29/1997)"	"Binky Ahmed, Goodbye I'm at my high school friend Binky Ahmed's house. There is a sign in a tree, along with many wooden sticks that are bundled up. I carry a vacuum and extension cord up a long wooden staircase to his house. He is going to visit his roommate/friend down south. I think I am invited, but I don't want to go, even if that is the case."
"1013"	"(07/29/1997)"	"New Basketball Team Basketball is being played at Armstrong High School. I'm there with some of my old teammates, and some of the new players. Coach Jackson is there. I am left with the new team and Coach Jackson, while the other guys went somewhere to scrimmage or play. I feel out of place. I'm not involved. I want Coach Jackson to incorporate me but at the same time I'm much older than the new team, and I feel out of place. Track runners are there practicing on the indoor track. My sister Ramona, college classmate Bernice Grovner, old teammate Ron Lind, high school classmate Mark Raden, and others are there. I'm in a different gymnasium area where a young man is practicing running the 400. He is the only person there. He has a camera that is set up to take a photograph of him as he completes the run, to time him. I run on the track a bit to warm up. I'm pretty stiff, and out of shape. I get two Polaroid photographs of Ramona and I when I run."
"1014"	"(07/30/1997)"	"My Dad is Dying I'm at a big house where my dad and Lisa live. Lisa's sister and her three kids visit them, arriving in a tan-colored mini van. My dad is sick. He has an illness in his urinary tract. Lisa's sister cries as she says goodbye to dad, like it's the last time they'll see each other because he is dying. My dad holds up her little blond infant daughter, and moves her around the room flying like an airplane. The infant smiles. My dad and I are going into the house. He can't open the door. Lisa is inside. She must not hear us at the door. I go around back and Lisa is relaxing in a rocking chair. She says the door is open. I open a screen door in the back and enter just as my dad gets the door open. He needs to urinate frequently and pays close attention to the color, time, and salt in his urine. He is sick. My brother Wally and sisters Heather and Ramona are there. We're upstairs in a room. My dad is downstairs. I look at a book of CD's, many of which have skulls and dead people-like monsters on their covers. We look at Ramona's yearbook which has photographs and movie-like clips of Wally and I. Wally's friend Trevor Peterson and other volleyball players are there. They talk about playing a good opponent one-on-one: always digging the ball, and being in the mud. My dad is outside in his old blue workshop where he used to live, in the storage portion of it on the left side. He is urinating. He was planning a charter-fishing trip to Lake Erie in August. My siblings and I don't know what is wrong with him, or what is happening with his illness. I feel sad and guilty that I don't know, because he is my dad. I want to know what is going on with him. I go downstairs. He has just urinated, and is washing his hands. I ask him what is wrong. He says he's decided not to go on the fishing trip because of his health. While I am sad about this, it is actually okay because I'll have more time to myself. He tells me about some sores that have developed around his mouth and nose. He says the doctor says they can be taken care of with medication. I feel that he is sugar coating it, and not dealing seriously with the problem. I walk around the house, which is nice and big. I see an electronic typewriter. My dad is frying two big fish fillets. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. He is filleting or frying fish too. I eat a bite of fish that has a bone in it that is a whole spinal column with ribs. I think it would be a terrible and painful way to die, for my dad to have trouble with his urinary tract. He is leaving. I go to the parking lot of Fishing Haven, to his car. I tell him I may take the last week or so off work so I can go home and be with him and my mom. We hug and I kiss him. I cry."
"1015"	"(08/01/1997)"	"Mushrooms Growing From My Shoulder I'm at a hotel with a woman who I don't know that has long brown wavy hair. We're staying in the same room. More people are coming to stay in our room, so I sleep on the floor and this has something to do with an egg. My classmate from Brimson Sara Miller and others come in. She tries to awaken me and get my attention. I pretend that I'm very tired, rolling over to see her, and then rolling back to sleep. I feel a poking or tickling sensation. I thrash around. The sensation persists, as if intentional. I get really mad at the people around me for doing this. I get mad at Sara, and then at another man, and then at a person I know of through friends named Dan. I think it is Dan doing this, and I hit him gently across the face with the back of my hand to threaten him. I get up and leave. The room is very crowded, with three people in a bed and many on the floor. I go to the bathroom, which is crowded. I see I have two mushrooms growing out of my right shoulder! I quickly pick them off. I am embarrassed that I had them. The mushrooms may indicate my dirtiness. Many people are reading magazines."
"1016"	"(08/01/1997)"	"Triplet Moose Calves I'm fishing with my coworkers Sean Williams and Tom and my boss Mike Hollow. Sean catches a nice walleye: about two pounds. I'm trying to hook up my lindy rig but I keep making mistakes. I have a huge white jig on, which is five or six inches long. The jig is like a Mister Twister, and my line from the barrel swivel is only four inches long. I see and point out a cow moose with triplet calves. Sean back trolls with the boat so we can all see them, even though Mike thinks we are close enough. The moose blend in very well with the forest: they are tan and white colored. We're near a narrow channel that looks good for fishing. Tom hooks a fish, and it nearly pulls him in the water twice! His tackle box falls in the water. He lands a huge walleye, one of four on his stringer! He lifts the stringer out of the water. I'm still not ready to fish, rigging up my line."
"1017"	"(08/01/1997)"	"Worthless School I'm at a school. It is a different kind of school. The students seem younger than I. I shouldn't be here because I'm not learning anything. I have trouble finding my classes. There is a strict class schedule. The five minutes between classes is not enough for me. Someone says I should be in my coworker Jerry Parson's class. I fumble around and look, and am late for class. Through an open door I go into a classroom where the female teacher is demanding the one correct answer from a boy. I yell at the teacher ferociously! I tell her that she is wrong! There isn't only one correct answer. I am very firm and clear in my speaking."
"1018"	"(08/01/1997)"	"Uneasy Defecation I'm living in a place with many other people. My friends Stephen and Jose Ramos are there. Stephen is defecating. I see him through a crack in the wall as I walk by. Jose and I both need to defecate. I use the bathroom after Stephen. The toilet is very wobbly and shaky. There is urine on the front part of the toilet seat. My friend Norman Noman is there."
"1019"	"(08/02/1997)"	"Grandpa is Drunk I'm deer hunting at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's old farm. I'm using a small bow with wooden arrows. There is another bow there, with single strings. I see some deer out by the pine trees near the mailbox. I take a bow and arrows out of the case. I walk around the house to the big porch, where the deer were walking. I get there and my friends Stephen and Franco Ramos are there. The deer walk really close by. I'm not sure if it's okay for me to shoot. Stephen looks with bulging eyes, indicating to me I should shoot, but he doesn't say anything. I pull back the bow and shoot at one of the two does from my hip. The arrow is short: 12-16 inches long. I hit the deer high on the hindquarter. It runs away. It will live, which makes me glad because I don't want to wound a deer. Grandpa calls in the deer, and says we hit one but it got away. He plays with fishing weights and jigs in his fingers as he talks. I'm really excited about hunting since right away I shot at a deer. I see a big buck with a huge rack! I stalk the deer, waiting for it to move. It gets spooked and runs away. I'm still watching the two does that I shot at from across the field. My grade school classmate Rita Bauer comes and starts chopping up vegetables for a salad. I'm mad that she is making so much noise, and I try to quietly make her leave, which she won't do. I'm eating dinner with Grandpa, Grandma, my brother Wally, aunt Joanne Redding, and others. Grandpa overeats, eating spaghetti noodles and peas. He gets drunk. He stands up and falls over. Wally catches him. I help Grandpa to the bathroom. He stumbles. I sit him down on the toilet. He falls off the toilet. He vomits into the toilet. I'm wearing rubber gloves while he vomits. I watch him. I remember what my coworker Jerry Parson's friend said about watching someone vomit: that one should see it! Grandpa vomits up the noodles and peas. He won't tell me which toothbrush is his. My aunt Rachel Redding and her son and my cousin Archie Weber are there. Grandma is sleeping. I look for deer using binoculars. There is a gas can on a chair. People clean up the room we are in."
"1020"	"(08/02/1997)"	"Tom's Bus Ride My coworker Tom Olson is going somewhere to buy something for me. He is riding a bus. I give him a $5 bill, and he takes four or eight quarters from my backpack to get me a card and to pay for the ride there and back. My sister Ramona is there. She has been on lunch break. She asks an Indian photograph, which is sitting there, what time it is."
"1021"	"(08/02/1997)"	"Break Time Fishing I'm at work at Fishing Haven, but I've got 10 minutes before I need to be back so I'm going fishing. I take the staff boat. It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes for me to do this. I see a picture perfect bay and want to cast there. I use a yellow buzz bait. I want to use a torpedo, but I'm short on time. There are people at a house on the bay hauling dirt, soot, and garage out of the place. I help by carrying pails of ashes. I say goodbye to the people I've helped. We're in a different place. I hug them. They are my brother Wally, my uncle Dannie Redding, and another man. We share a group hug, and then I hug them individually. I say to Wally that I'll see him in October."
"1022"	"(08/03/1997)"	"Empty Stadium I'm at a stadium or dome. There are four people in the stadium seats: it is otherwise empty! It seems to be like a Minnesota Twins game. My junior high classmates Pat and Raul Mason are there. I'm not sure how seeing them again will be, and I wonder if it will be competitive. I sit with them and my brother Wally and another man in the seats."
"1023"	"(08/03/1997)"	"Lotion Face I cover my face with lotion. The lotion makes a thick coating. I can wipe it off later."
"1024"	"(08/04/1997)"	"Glory Days Relived I get a phone message to call my high school friend Sam Kingsley. There is also a note about my new driver's license number, with a 967 or 917 in the number. Sam is with his old girlfriend Janelle West. They go by. I poke my elbow into Sam, and tell him we're going to Riverton for a basketball game at 5:30. My high school teammate Tony Kramer says we'll be leaving at closer to 4:15. I'm sitting around a table that is crowded with my high school basketball team. My friend Nate Nelling is wearing a sweater and a dress coat. It's like a reunion. I'm in a gymnasium shooting baskets with Sam and a woman. I am rusty and very stiff, my knees especially. The woman says I have good backspin on my shot. It's then pre-game high school basketball, Armstrong versus Riverton. I'm playing with my team from Armstrong. I war my old red, white, and black Nike shoes from my junior year. A rival player, Dan Dubbin, is playing for Riverton. He is tough. It is reminiscent of our glory days in high school. I sit down in a gymnasium-like locker room. I get dressed. I'm shirtless. I tie my shoes and loosen up, flexing my muscles. I slap hands with my teammate Binky Ahmed and others before the game. Binky has spilled something in his pocket. The place he spilled is where a pregnant woman's water has broken as well. The woman with whom I was shooting buckets says its' no good to tighten the second knot on a double knot. My sister Ramona, her friends, including Muriah Ahmed, my high school teammate Carl Everson, and others are there for the game. It is glory days relived."
"1025"	"(08/04/1997)"	"Paper Money I'm at a fair, like the fisherman's picnic. I drive in with my friend Niles Zelling in his car, past where people park. I give Niles a piece of paper, which is like money, but it is worth 11 or 12 dollars. He plays a game with it by crumpling it up and shooting it towards a basketball hoop. He misses. It looks like that 12 dollars was just lost! A police officer sees us and tells us we have to move the car, but we already know this and are doing so. I go into the Red Rooster Shop with my friend Stephen Ramos. He needs money so he divides up the staff tips and takes his share. I look at the merchandise for sale. I find a $5 bill behind a fishing lure, and keep it, quietly. I find two checks written to me from Stephen, which I had left on the shelf a while back. One is for $3.49, and the other for $.49. Stephen is mad at me, which is characteristic of him, because he thinks since I haven't cashed them I'm screwing up the balancing of his checkbook. There are some long thin rectangular stickers there. I leave them there: they are a secret with the guys I am with: Stephen, my coworker Tom Olson, and another man. I wear a red bandana and a gray sweatshirt when we leave in a car. I want to look good."
"1026"	"(08/04/1997)"	"The Other Fishing Haven I'm with my high school teammate Simon Naver in Woodsville. We're going to his house, walking down a sidewalk. We talk. His mother drinks rum. He is living with a ""brown"" man next year. I know this means he's living with a black person. He works that the other Fishing Haven, which is in Woodsville. It is similar to the other, but different looking. My roommate Sean Williams is fishing in a pond there that is 10 feet wide."
"1027"	"(08/04/1997)"	"Lumbering Fools I'm in a mall. My friend from Brimson Hank Anderson and my friends from high school Sam Kingsley and Janelle West are there. They may have eaten hallucinogenic mushrooms. My sister Heather walks by on her way to work. Some men are halfway walking/lumbering around the mall acting dumb and drawing attention to themselves."
"1028"	"(08/04/1997)"	"Selling the Boat I'm at home with my mom and my sister Ramona. Mark Landy calls on the phone. I had previously written him a letter trying to sell him the boat. He is calling to find out how much the boat is worth. In the letter I said between $600-$1500. I am thinking about $600 now. I don't know how much my dad paid for the boat. I may be grossly underestimating its value. Mark starts reading the letter that I wrote him to me, in an attempt to get me to sell him the boat for less than its worth. I interrupt him and tell him I know what I wrote and that I need to make a call and then I'll call him back and tell him how much I'm going to need to charge for the boat. He is quiet, and hangs up. I need to call my dad to ask him how much he paid for the boat."
"1029"	"(08/05/1997)"	"Race Car In Attic Something happens in my employers, Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills', attic. Their house seems to be high up. They are on the phone; it is late on a slow workday. There is a racecar in the attic. There is talk about a trauma: a person in surgery or in the hospital. There is a man there who plays basketball, who is not powerful. There is a large bolt-action gun."
"1030"	"(08/05/1997)"	"Spoiling Cookies I am at a Brimson party. My schoolmates Alan and Jason the basketball player are there, with many others. The party is over. People defecate and urinate in cookies. The cookies taste good. I write the recipe down. A professor talks to me in German, and I laugh."
"1031"	"(08/05/1997)"	"Lucid Life Calling My friend Hank Anderson is on a train. He is taken on the train, transported, stopped, and then thrown out into the water of a lake. He has no choice. This is his life calling: his quest. I'm on a train with my friend Stephen Ramos. I tell him that I love him, in case we don't get out of the train. The train moves fast. We seem to be in California. My classmate Kate Francis is jogging. There are apartment buildings there. I fly up to the roof of a building with either Stephen or my brother Wally. I see a woman sun tanning that has her butt cheeks spread wide open. Doctors are on the roof talking to people saying they shouldn't be there because it's dangerous. One doctor gives shots to immobilize the brain, rather than fixing ailments. I say if I fall to fix me up but leave my brain so I can dream. Stephen and I climb down from a tower-like structure on the roof. He tells me a dream he had. I am not too interested in it. I am put in a room with an old woman. We have sex and I finger her vagina. I lick and suck her genitals, and put my finger in her butt hole. This is my life struggle. The woman is my sister Ramona. I suck on her butt hole. She doesn't like it: she doesn't like anal stimulation much. I realize I am dreaming. My roommate from Fishing Haven Sean Williams is there. I punch him and the woman repeatedly. One of them is in front of me, the other behind me. I punch Sean in the face, which flattens his face, and then backhand the woman."
"1032"	"(08/05/1997)"	"Lucid Tandem Cigarette Theft I'm with my friends Stephen Ramos, Norman Noman, Arnold, and Jake Fowler in a car. Arnold and Jake go into a gas station to steal cigarettes. Arnold climbs on Jake's shoulders and reaches a carton or something off a top shelf, then runs out to the car. My friend's parents, Dick and Judy Zates see them steal the cigarettes and get in the car. We start to drive. I look away so the Zates' won't see my face. They follow us in a yellow car. We come to a huge blue bridge, made of wood and metal. Stephen jumps off the car, which doesn't have a roof, onto a walkway. Norman swerves the car so I am almost forced out. I cling to metal railings on the walkway, and climb up. I'm on the wrong side, so I jump or move over to the walkway. I go down the walkway or hallway six or seven levels. I see my grade school mate Larry Bark and other familiar people who seem to be working for the State Department in the Forestry Service. I get to the bottom hallway and am headed back to one side of the bridge. I go by my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and her friend Elise Rooks, dressed in black and wearing black bandanas. They're on my left side. My high school classmates Karl Mueller, Fred Slick, and Olie Kecker have cuts and scars on their faces like they've been in a gang fight. They're on my right side. I turn around a few steps after I pass them and say that I must be dreaming, and I am. I go into the room where they were near. Annie and Elise are there. I want to have sex with them. I wave my arm and make Norman leave, and he is gone. First I have sex with Elise. She lies on her back and I kneel. Her vagina is tight. I have sex with her in the vagina and the butt. I lean over and start to give Annie cunnilingus. I lick and suck her vagina. My coworker from Fishing Haven, Heather, is there. I remove her from the scene by waving my arm in a sweeping motion, scraping her away. I tell her to get out of her, and shove her, and she is gone. Towards the end of our sexual encounter, I suck Annie's butt hole."
"1033"	"(08/06/1997)"	"Family Reunion There is a tow to do for Fishing Haven. The customer is an older woman. I am in a tree. I climb down a meet the woman and my boss Mike Hollow. The woman has extra beer. I wait for them to arrive. She gives me a $3 tip and the extra beer, which is Leinenkugels. I say it is my favorite. I'm at home. My mom is handing out beers to people. She gives me a good thick German beer. It's thick, sweet, and buttery. It looks and tastes like runny bread pudding. My mom talks about this beer and having a taste of cat meat when in Germany. People are outside the front of the house. Many cars are there. My aunt and uncle Rusty and Sheila Redding and their children Melvin, Rich, and Melissa, grandpa and grandma Redding, the Lorenz family, and my friend's parents, Dick and Judy Zates are all there unexpectedly. It's a family reunion. I go out. I am happy to see Rusty and the others, though they don't seem so excited. I shake my cousin Avery King's hand. The King family are going to either North Dakota or South Dakota for a vacation, which is one hour from Forkville. People take some photographs. I'm in a photograph with two of my mom's old women friends. One of the women is grandma Redding. They take a photograph, and we stand close together. I hold their arms like in a wedding procession: one woman on each side of me. Grandma is wearing a gray suit coat outfit. I ask her how she is. She tells me I look good. I say that she looks good too, even though she is shaky and clearly is aging. Grandpa stands in front of us. People move in for photographs. I tell the Zates' that they were in my dream last night. Then I realize I've said that to Dick Zates and Marge Thompson, mistaking Marge for Judy Zates. The real Judy Zates comes over and asks if she was in the dream. I say no before I realize it was she. We all gather around a big stove. It's like a Coleman stove my mom has. We're going to cook bratwurst with sauerkraut and ketchup. There is confusion about which can be used: the sauerkraut or the ketchup. I say both."
"1034"	"(08/07/1997)"	"A Child's Energy Knot I talk with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas on the phone. She is in Wilmerton and wants to see me. I'm at or near my friend Matt Yams' house. I give her directions. I say I'll be outside shooting baskets when she gets there. I'm at a place with Spencer, my coworker at Juicy Poultry Corporation. He says we're far away from Wilmerton in southwest Montana. He says we're 100,000 away. I know that's not right: it could be 100 miles. I am distraught because I won't be at the house when Annie comes. I have called form where I am now, thinking I was somewhere else. Now I can't be where she is going because it is too far for me to go in the time it will take her to get there. There are some children there. I talk to them. There is a woman who speaks to the children, controlling and demanding them, telling them to be still, and other things. The woman is trying to be a good guide, trying to help the children. I yell at her. I am very loud and firm in my words. I tell her what she is doing is not helping the kids; it is hurting the growth of the child. I speak of the ball of energy in the child, and when she tells a child to be still, how that energy forms a tight ball, clenching like a knot. There area I am in Spencer says is a wilderness. He likes it. The brilliant orange sun sets quickly as we watch."
"1035"	"(08/07/1997)"	"Avalanche Many people are fishing. Some adults and kids are staying in cabins, while others are not. They may be fishing for the perfect fish. All the people huddle together in one area. I help move the kids up rocks. We're gathering because there is a big storm coming. I huddle together with two people I put my back to the approaching storm and snow: an avalanche is coming. We create air space in the middle of the three of us by the way we huddle. The storm is very powerful. It moves in from Forkville to Woodland. The avalanche pushes us along. I flip over a fence, landing in soft snow and sliding along. I'm not scared. This is fun! My friends Jill Banks and Holly Lapson, who has dreadlocks, are there. I never thought Holly would do this because it would make her hair all ratty and nasty. I say, ""Yee-Ha!"" as I slide. There is a fence there that I see. I am not very worried or too cognizant of it. It is past where we are. I don't know if we could get over it if we were pushed down to it. There is the danger of being trapped or crushed next to it."
"1036"	"(08/09/1997)"	"Tall Radio Tower I am walking by the radio tower which is out near Crystal Road. The tower is huge! It is so much taller than I thought. I am near the base of it. It is made of metal and is probably over 1000 feet tall."
"1037"	"(08/09/1997)"	"Slow Food Service I'm going to a cafeteria with my friend Kevin Simpson after lifting weights. I hope they have chicken. I hear that they are serving fish cheese. We get there. There is a deli-like place where I can get a turkey sandwich, which I want to do. They woman there has people fill out a form, like a menu. I have to get back in line though I was there before some of the other people in line. It takes a long time! I sit on an area covered with small rocks. I woman sits, waiting, next to me. The woman at the food bar has a Nin_ car. I tell the woman we're not waiting! I'm mad that its taken so long. I grab two pink sheets and look at them to fill them out. I say if she really wants us to fill them out we will. There are boxes with letters next to them. One needs to check the boxes. A woman there falls over, like she is fainting. I immediately go over to her. I yell for someone to call 911! I talk to her. She can breathe. She can hear me. She has a cramp-like symptom. She is the sister of a woman I met at a party last night named Kirsten Peters. I yell for an ambulance. It seems that she will be okay. I'm outside Mason Cafeteria at Brimson, but where I helped the woman looks like I'm outside Carter School. The table where the deli woman was is gone. It was down by the ""Bowling"" sign near Billie's Daycare. I hope I can get back in since I've been outside with the woman."
"1038"	"(08/10/1997)"	"Carrying Fishing Haven's Garbage I'm in Carter Church basement with others. I go into the bathroom. My childhood friend Andy Jones is there with a woman who works here on some kind of project. They need to get into the bathroom, which is like a storage room as well. They interrupt me as I'm trying to defecate. I get up and leave, and they do what they need. I grab my stuff, and some garbage and walk out towards Carter School. A rock star that is a young kid with dyed red hair is playing in the church. People are setting up chairs as I leave. One man says that they need six more chairs, and indicates he wants me to help. I'm not going to help because I have nothing to do with what they're doing. I see a woman on my way to the recess door of the school. She asks me what I'm doing with Fishing Haven's garbage. I realize I'm carrying it, and I tell her that I'm in the habit of it, even though I recognize that I don't work at Fishing Haven anymore. I feel dumb saying this, and I want to get rid of the garbage, especially before my former bosses Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills see me! I walk over to the parking lot behind Carter School. I need somewhere to put the garbage. I go into a door below the steps and put the garbage into a can in the gymnasium. My truck is parked outside next to Fishing Haven's blue truck. My friend Beth Mock is driving the other truck. It's full of wood for building, which is from something that was dismantled. I think it looks like there are some maps of the Big Resort Area in back. When I look, there are not. I get into the truck with Beth. She tells me she's reading some letters to kill time before she goes to the dump. I think I should tell her she should go and just drive slowly, rather than sit here where she may be seen. Beth expresses her dislike for her job at Fishing Haven. We go to the dump. We go past a liquor store. My birthday comes up in conversation, since I'm now 21. We pass Francois' Restaurant, which is a huge liquor store. I say we should go there, and want to stop. We pass a police car. I tell Beth to keep her speed under 38 miles per hour because police will give tickets for anything more than that. She doesn't listen. I put my seat belt on in case we're pulled over. We drive to the dump, which is out on the Thru Highway, but we don't go that way. We are with other friends going to a concert. It's snowing. Something attached to her boot pulls Beth along the ground. I kneel in a red plastic sled and push myself along. We are then on 1st Street between Hill and Slope Avenues, in Oak Valley, on the south side of the road. We hear songs on the radio station 101.7 which Beth says are the same songs that are going to be played at a dance show that is happening tonight. I think this is the same thing we're going to. We move on the ground. There are tickets and wristband scraps all over the sidewalk and ground. Two older men leave the concert/festivity. They have wristbands on. I don't' have a ticket to this. Michael Jackson will be at the show dancing. I'd like to see him rather than just sitting and doing nothing. My cousin Archie Weber is by the Elgins house on the southeast corner of the intersection of 1st Street and Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. He tells me to pull off to the sidewalk. I do. There are broken sunglasses on the ground, but none that are good enough to wear. Archie is checking for a parking space near there which is why he wants me to wait."
"1039"	"(08/11/1997)"	"Marshmallow Maties I'm in a large grocery store. A lady who works there marks down the price of the very large bags of cereal, including Marshmallow Maties, Sugar Puffs, and others. I buy two bags of cereal. One bag costs $1.19. Both bags are really cheap."
"1040"	"(08/11/1997)"	"I'm A Bear I'm a good-sized black bear. It is night. I'm near a tree. I lie on my back and scrape my paws together. I'm going somewhere to get something. I think that no other bears will ""interrupt"" my space: that I will get my spot back when I return. By the back door of my (human) home in Oak Valley I see a grizzly bear! I am scared. I turn and go slowly away from the bear, and then I run. I am human. I run around to the garage. There is a man and a woman there. One of us has a gun. We are afraid of the grizzly bear outside the back door, which is my ex-roommate Sean Williams. I take the weapon, which is like a prodder, and tell the others to take rakes. Sean is wearing a yellow construction hat. The bear is still there. Bears are hungry this time of year! Black bears usually won't bother you, but a grizzly bear is frightening!"
"1041"	"(08/11/1997)"	"Debbie Oliver I'm in Carter Church. I sit in back with my friend Niles Zelling. Many others are there and they sit in the front of the church. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan is a server for the mass. The priest is Father Vance Brock. At the end of mass Father Vance asks if anyone wants to stay and serve a funeral. A lot of people raise their hands or jump up, because they'll get out of the rest of the day at Carter School if they serve. I hope I don't get called on. Father Vance selects three people, not me. Then he tells the rest of us ""cocksuckers"" to leave. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there. I grab his jacket for him. Outside is it icy: very slippery. Others and I go over to Carter School. We haven't eaten lunch yet, and it's early afternoon. My friends Tiny and Matt Combs, and Jeff and Ryan Vaurnet are there. They're going to Jefferson School to have a fish fry for lunch in a trailer home. I haven't eaten since I've been in church, so I ask them if I can go with if they'll have enough fish. They say I can. I go upstairs to the secretary's office where I find a television and a VCR. I unplug them to go past them, and then plug them back in. I walk down the dark upstairs hallway with a light in my hand. The doors to the classrooms aren't closed tightly. I don't know which grade I'm in. I hear faint voice in my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's room. I don't want to interrupt the people, so I go to the bathroom. There is a tiger in the bathroom. It is huge and strong but gentle. There is a dog with antlers tied to its head. There are two cats, one of which is nice and the other mean. The mean cat climbs up my leg and scratches me. I grab it by the back of the neck and hold it, like I am choking it. I go out of the bathroom and find my name and coat rack underneath it. I'm near the door, I think, because my teachers have always seen me as being responsible enough to be away from the teacher's coat rack. I put the battery charger on my coat rack. The coat rack of an acquaintance of mine named Debbie Oliver is next to mine. Debbie and Sherry Devine walk out of the room. Debbie is starting 6th grade at Carter School. Sherry has some very crisp waffles. She says I can go eat with the others. The others have left."
"1042"	"(08/11/1997)"	"White Black Bear I'm deer hunting with my friends Stephen and Jose Ramos. We're returning after the morning hunt, to the camper, the car, and the refrigerator. I see something white up on a hill. I'm not sure what it is. I yell at it. It is two black bear cubs. We then see a huge sow and boar black bear! Stephen runs up on the hill. The bears haven't run very far away. He shoots the large bear in the head. It falls down. Stephen falls at the same time, as if he has been shot. He is then back up, and he shoots again, and hits the bear in the head. The bear falls over, and at the same time Jose falls over as if he has been shot. When we go up to the bear we see it is whitish in color and has antlers. I haven't shot a bear yet. The sow bear is still there."
"1043"	"(08/12/1997)"	"Fist Fighting Kevin Van Damme I'm in a group of men where a wicked man is killing people. I may be killing people as well. There is a huge gun there, mounted for stability. The wicked man is after me. I hold him down and yell for someone to grab the big gun and shoot him. The wicked man has a ray that he shoots me with, and I slowly die. I grab a broomstick and try to shove it through his heart. The ray is then channeled into the end of the broomstick. The wicked man gets shot. My friends Kevin Simpson and Hank Anderson and I are left there. I have a gun that shoots lasers. I fire all the lasers bullets so the three of us will have to fist fight. The winner will fight Hank, though the main fight is between Kevin and I. The fight between either Kevin or I and Hank should be no match: we will beat him easily. Kevin is then Jean Claude Van Damme when we first start to fight. We fight for a long time, punching each other with hard blows. We talk while we fight; we're not angry, we're just talking normally. He is resilient. I land most of the good punches. He holds up well. My high school classmate Marybeth Neumann is there. My friend Bubba Hacker is there wearing an orange chicken skin shirt. That is his new job. Kevin and I fight over something that is trivial to us, but important to most people."
"1044"	"(08/12/1997)"	"My House As A Hotel My house is where people stay, like a hotel. An attractive middle-aged woman arrives. I'm in the bathtub. She needs things for her room. I toss her towels and washcloths from where I am. She asks for a cover to a canoe. I tell her where the measuring cups are because I don't understand what she wants. I think she means measuring cups. Then I realize what she said. I don't know where the canoe covers are. Don't most people just flip the canoe over, I think? Her waterbed mattress is cold. I have an erection in the bathtub, which is full of sawdust. I get out of the bathtub to help her. I turn the waffle iron on to heat her waterbed. The waffle iron is on the kitchen counter. It starts to whistle very quickly, and is hot. I'll have to move it upstairs to her bed eventually. The woman is married to a man who has children, but the woman is not their mother. The children and husband are coming later. The husband's friends are also coming. They arrive. They are rednecks. I open the front door and go out to meet them, and hold the door open as they enter. The man comments on my hospitality. The husband, a male friend, and the two children are there. There is an ugly red haired woman who I think is married to the husband's friend. I think I should have tried to have sex with the woman who arrived first. She is attractive and is married to this loser man and his friend."

Then I sit down because no one acknowledges my playing. I crazy dirty man sits by me. I move away from him, and go under the stairs. The leader is playing and people are following along. A song is played. Each person selects sticks off their own large sheet of stickers and puts them in the appropriate place on a card. I find this easy to do: the selection is simple. My grandma Redding is there. Carlos Maren, a gay man I know from high school, and another gay man are there."

"1047"	"(08/13/1997)"	"Sleeping On A Ledge I kiss a woman. I'm on stairs. She is at the top of the stairway. She pulls my face towards her. Her knees are bent up towards her chest. This makes it hard to kiss her. I'm on a ledge of concrete five or six feet off the ground. I have my sleeping back, which is open. I'm getting set up with a woman who is a friend of a female friend of mine. I sit up and talk with my friend, and the woman comes. There is a lot going unspoken. The woman and I are supposed to have a sexual encounter in a dream. She may not want to do this. She is attracted to me, but may not want to have a sexual encounter with me because I do that in my dreams. The woman has blond hair and her name is Lucy. She is talkative and kind of annoying. She reminds me of my classmate Rachel Thompson. I sit up to talk. I make an attempt to be social and go through the courting process, though I am not comfortable doing so. We're outside a bar. There are some men from Brimson there who recognize me. They are baseball players. I vaguely recognize them and say hi. One of them looks like my classmate John Thomas. The man from Brimson that I met in the Big Resort Area at Fishing Haven is there, and I say hi to him. There are other people outside the bar are giving away dead fish beer and eating raw fish. Some of the fish have a huge eye on their side. There is a white limousine with baseball players in it parked nearby. Another white limousine being driven by a drunken baseball player crashes into the parked limousine. I think that the crash will cost a lot. I walk with Lucy down metal grate steps of what seems to be a baseball stadium. I ask her if she writes down her dreams. She says yes, and I am surprised! I tell her I have 10 dream journals full of dreams. We buy pizza. Fist we go to one little shop where it costs a lot and the employee is rude. Then we go to another shop. The pizza costs $1 a slice. Then it is two slices for $1. I ask the man if I can exchange half a slice for a piece, since it's two for $1. The pizza that is $1 a slice tastes good. The pizza that is two slices for $1 isn't very good: thin, unmelted cheese, and small. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. He talks about an eye mask that he wears which enhances vision. He says he uses it for bowling and hockey. His vision is pretty vivid and crazy when he uses it for hockey."
"1048"	"(08/13/1997)"	"Grandma Redding's Best Friend My sister Ramona, others, and I are at a family gathering. There are photographs of the Redding family and the Redding's children's families. All the grandchildren are assigned to be Grandma Redding's best friend. I think this isn't a good idea: it is impractical. The grandchildren won't ever call her like a best friend does."

Other people are in the car, and they remain unscathed. The man is going 100 miles per hour in an area with a 60-mile per hour speed limit. He can't slow down. The car goes off the road and into deep water. The people in it are unhurt. There is a big black man there. He may be in the car behind the fast car. His car isn't going that fast."

The people leave and take oranges and other food with them. There is a school bus where we are. On the back of one of the greenish gray seats is carved out the letters ""KMHanson3"". I could get in trouble because it's clearly me. Others have left their mark carved around there in a more disguised form, but no one has left it so clear. I go to the tiny bathroom and sit down on the toilet with the seat up. I start masturbating. Stephen returns to the trailer where I am. He is working a late shift as well. I stop masturbating. Stephen's night job is to go out near the on and off ramps of Superhighway 100 near Wilmerton and fix the signs there. The ""Yield"" sign needs to be partially fixed at the bottom: blue reflectors needs to be where pink and yellow reflectors have been."
"1051"	"(08/13/1997)"	"Sex Play Under Blue Blanket I'm in a bed with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We're having a sexual encounter. There is a blue blanket over us. It may be the blanket from my Grandma Hanson. I notice my friend Tiny Combs is at the end of the bed. At first I think he is with our friend Tina Totts, but then I see our friend Elise Rooks. Other people are in a different bed having a sexual encounter. Annie and I don't have sex; we kiss and play, joking around. We roll onto the floor. She goes to a corner like she is going to sleep. I pursue her, and try to give her cunnilingus. She has her underwear on. I take her underwear off. She is playfully resisting my advances, teasing me, keeping her legs closed. She rolls over and kneels. I lick her and lightly touch her clitoris with my finger."

"1053"	"(08/13/1997)"	"Kiss My Ass Fishing Haven I'm driving up a driveway to Fishing Haven with two people in my truck. My former employers Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills were ahead of me in a different vehicle, but they must have turned off the road to go to their home. The driveway is long and has reeds covering it. We pull in and the place looks different. I see that the towboat dock has moved. A man I worked with, Tom Olson, tells me that they now get off work at 4:00pm all the time. I go in the store. There are new employees there. They seem tame: like mindless suckers. I go back to the office to get my mail. I think Phoebe is there. As I walk back, Mike comes in the front door and walks back towards the office. I ask him for my mail. He goes into the office to get it. He fakes tossing a yellow stringer in a package at me, then picks up a new leech locker. He says I really put Gene and Marie in a bad situation. By this he means that I really treated them badly. I don't know what he is talking about. He pulls out a small tape measure and measures the distance above the door to the office, wall to wall. I tell him I don't know what he's talking about, and that he should tell me what he means because I'm sure there's an explanation for it because I've never done anything wrong or bad to Gene and Marie. He says it's about a Mad River catalog. I understand him to be implying that I stole the catalog. Gene, Marie, Mike, and Phoebe all think I stole it. I go berserk! I didn't take the catalog. Phoebe says that maybe I ""extendedly borrowed"" the catalog, using a euphemism for theft. I tell them angrily and firmly that I didn't take their catalog and if they think I did they can kiss my ass! My former coworker Amy Rancher is there. She says, ""Yeah, Kenneth... You're on a roll!"" She is proud of me for saying what I thought. I'm not putting up with these people's crap. I tell them straight out that I didn't take anything, period! Mike runs his finger down a chart on the calendar, taking into consideration what I have just said, in order to determine what response he should make. He then reads what the chart indicates, and responds by saying ""Good Lord"" or some similarly shocked expression. I think he is an ignorant, stupid person. I don't like or respect him."

My junior high classmate Rich Karn has brought a gas engine and an electric trolling motor with a battery. The first thing I say to him is that he's hauling these on every portage! We have two boats for our trip. Both are Fishing Haven boats. One of them is wide boat. In the back of the wide boat there is a video screen of some sort. I'm at a cash machine. The guys in the boat fiddle with and rewind the video. I forget to withdraw my cash card. When they rewind the tape it scrapes the card. I go get the card. I've withdrawn a lot more than I need or want to have on me: $70. My grade school friend's father Myron Kasper's red van is related to the video: I see the red van driving forward and I think it should be backwards, because the tape is being rewound. My high school classmate Arnie Heller is there. He works for an outfitter. He has a Fishing Haven radio with and is going to do a 2:00 tow. I ask him if he'll give us a tow: just the one boat since the other has a motor. He says he was out last night, and implies he has a hangover, but says he can tow us after his 2:00 tow. My friend Nate Nelling asks Arnie if he can get a tow also. Arnie replies yes. Nate doesn't realize that the tow is for all of us."
"1055"	"(08/14/1997)"	"My Fishing Haven Paycheck I'm at Fishing Haven with my friends. We're reading to go on our trip starting at the public landing on Eagle Lake. I need to get my mail. The parking area by the store is thick dark brown mud. People are gathering, waiting for the store to open. I look at my watch: it's 6:50am. I want to move the brown station wagon and boat that we drove here before Phoebe Mills and Mike Hollow arrive at the store. I get in and back the boat up so I have room to drive out. The brakes don't work. I can't stop completely. I back the boat up fast, but I do it well. I press the brake as hard as I can but the car and boat keep moving backwards. I almost hit one man. I pull out of the parking lot and park the wagon and the trailer on the side of the road. There is a curve in the road and the ditch drops sharply. I move the car and trailer so they are off to the side of the road in the rocky ditch area. I go back to the parking lot. Around one side of the building is a junk storage shed. A mans asks me if everyone needs a cushion. I say one cushion per boat is needed. I go up to the store. I see Phoebe through a trashy screen window as I walk up to the door. There is a white cloth hanging from the top of the doorway with brown writing on it. The writing advertises sales in the store. I go in and meet Phoebe and ask her for my mail. She jokes about what I wrote in my letter to them. She says I wrote that I should ""get payment"" rather than ""receive payment"", which to her would be saying that I should pay. She understood what I meant, though, and will pay me. I go to their office, which is smaller and not as nice looking. She gives me a $100 bill and an extra $20, a big sheet of stamps, and a little sheet of four stamps. Then she says something about not coming back here or to Lakeville with Morris (a moose), or Doris (a duck), or Boris (a bear). I think she is telling me not to ever come on Fishing Haven property again. But then she says that people have been leading the animals back here. I laugh, and say, ""Okay, I won't"". I tell them we're going out on Eagle Lake. Knowing there are no permits for the Big Resort Area, they ask if we're going to Lakeland National Forest. I make a quick recovery and say yes, which implies that we won't go off Eagle Lake into the Big Resort Area and that we aren't camping. One of the men in our group comes up behind me. I don't recognize him at first, but then I do and introduce him to Phoebe and Mike ad my cousin Darren King. They say they'll probably come check on us. I know this is to make sure that we don't go anywhere without a permit, and that they are being sticklers. I hate this about them, but don't say anything. I leave and walk out to the road through trees and on grass, like an apple orchard. My brother Wally is with me. We run back to the car at the Eagle public landing. I tell him the difference between Lakeland National Forest and the Big Resort Area, and what one needs permits for."

I come to what I think is the portage to Evergreen Lake. There are a lot of people there. The portage area is really big and redone. It's fancy, with gravel and some docks and a bridge. There are steps from where the 20-rod Evergreen River portage leads up to the main portage. I go to set my canoe down in the water. I slide down a steep cliff and catch my footing on the bottom of the rock race, right next to the water. I toss the canoe in. I think it may have floated away then, because I can't see it. I ask a man if it floated away. He says, ""No, it's right here."", and motions to the side of the dock he's standing on. I put the canoe to the side for now. I go through a short tunnel which is the portage. I hear a man talking about this portage, and if he's been here before. He doesn't mention Evergreen, so I think I'm not at the Evergreen portage. The tunnel is narrow and elbow shaped. I squeeze through and am in a little apartment-like place. I have some deli turkey and sliced pepperoni that I put in the little refrigerator. The door falls off the refrigerator. Three Forest Service employees arrive in a large hovercraft, powered by a huge fan propeller on back. They go right onto the portage with their boat. I'll have to go back and tell the guys we can't go in at this spot because we don't have a permit."
"1057"	"(08/15/1997)"	"My New License I get my new driver's license in the mail. At first I think it doesn't really look like me. My photograph on it is off center. There is a second photograph that is a side view. I think they got the photographs mixed up and put the photograph of the woman who took my photograph on my license. After I look at the photographs I realize that it is I, and the second photograph is a side view. The license says, ""Over 27"" on it, instead of verifying that I'm 21, or it may be good until I'm 27."
"1058"	"(08/15/1997)"	"Fake Delivery Man A man comes to the door at home. He is delivering some thin packages in cardboard. I go the door. He is dressed funny, wearing an odd hat, not like a UPS man. I sign for the delivery on top of one of the boxes. We have trouble coordinating my signature with his signature receiver. When the signature does turn out it is a bunch of horizontal scribbled lines. He goes back to his truck, which is parked in front of my neighbor's house. I look at the boxes he has delivered: they are nothing but cardboard boxes that have been broken down! I'm not sure why he did that: what could be his motive? He is by his truck getting some boxes out of it, like he will do another delivery. I hope he isn't delivering to our house again. A bit later he is back at our front door. I don't go directly to the door. I am wary of the man. I lean out of the house in an open space that would be between the front windows and the door, and talk to him. I am firm, and say that he has five minutes, which is actually four minutes and 50 seconds because the first minute is already 10 seconds past. He dilly-dallys around and then decides to use his time. He pulls out an old Wilmerton Times newspaper and starts telling me how bad the issue is. He points out the plain square boxes, the waste of space, and how they throw in sexual advertisements. My sister Heather is there. She laughs when the man mentions sexual advertisements. He then pulls a pan of sausages over, implying they are geared towards women as well. I laugh. I understand what the man is trying to do: sell a better newspaper. But he is fundamentally wrong. He is comparing the 1984 Wilmerton Times to his most recent and colorful issue of whatever his publication is (I think it's the New York Times or something to do with Science or Scientific). I know he is comparing apples to oranges."
"1059"	"(08/15/1997)"	"My Mom Doesn't Respect Me I'm at grandpa and grandma Redding's old farmhouse. It's morning and I want to cook breakfast. I find two eggs and some sausage in the freezer. I put a frying pan on the stove. The flames are too high so I turn them down. At some point I decide I want to leave. No one responds to me. There are a lot of people there. My mom ignores me when I say I want to leave. I tell her to fuck off. I say goodbye to my sisters Ramona and Heather and my brother Wally, but not to anyone else. I storm out the door. Out at the car my siblings come out like they're driving home with me. I'm really mad! I yell at my mom loudly. I tell she has always respected me but she isn't now, and say fuck you to her! She knows that didn't respect me by ignoring me and she says it's good that I recognized that. My voice is high pitched. I feel choked up, like I have a lot of energy in my chest that is constricting my voice. I think there is toilet paper in a tree."
"1060"	"(08/15/1997)"	"Carol Derth's Disease I'm in the house with others looking at photographs. There are some photographs of my brother Wally when he was little. I'm in some of the photographs too, but not prominently. There is a photograph of my high school classmate Carol Derth taking a photograph down her pants, of her crotch area. I'm with Carol in a room talking. Her brother and father are somewhere in the east, like Indonesia. She gets to visit them every weekend because she and they have friends who are very rich and fly there all the time. She has a ranch in Colorado that someone left her in a will. There is a big bar there. My friend Kevin Simpson mixes a drink with a green bottle. I taste it. It tastes good. I remember Carol has a disease."
"1061"	"(08/15/1997)"	"Shooting A Monkey I'm at the end of the alley hill on the block where my house is in Oak Valley. I'm talking to the lesbian woman I met at Fishing Haven who stayed in a cabin near mine, and a man who may be her father. I'm talking about where to camp and what to bring. They both pull out cash to tip me. The woman walks over and puts $10 in my left front pants pocket. I'm wearing my cream colored corduroy pants. I watch my mom and one of my siblings chase a rabbit in the snow. My mom grabs a clump of snow where the rabbit would be, and it runs. My sisters Heather and Ramona and my dad see a big brown dog in a tree. They chase it. It goes from tree to tree. I run home to get my gun. It is a .22 caliber rifle, but has characteristics of a shotgun and a BB gun. My mom says Grandpa Redding is getting married to Ramona, who I know is Grandma Redding. It's for their anniversary. Heather has a case of Schlitz beer. My mom is going to a meeting at Carter School. The people there won't want me shooting. They are meeting at Felix Sand's house, across the street from my house. I say that the shooting will not take long. I go out and ask my dad, Heather, and Ramona where the squirrel is that they've been chasing. They point to a branch of the tree that used to have the old swing on it. I brace my gun on the tree and aim. I'm shaky. I see though the scope that it is a squirrel and a little monkey. I fire and hit it directly in the stomach. It falls to the ground. I shoot more when I get close to it, not steadied on a tree. I see the BB's fly by the animal, not hitting it. There is a little dead monkey lying on the ground in the front yard. Heather grabs her beer and puts it in my dad's car, which is also my uncle Rusty Redding's car. Heather wants me to wait, but I go inside."
"1062"	"(08/16/1997)"	"150 Tons of Pressure I'm in a boat with my friend's father Franco Ramos and a man my age. Franco and I are fishing. We're trolling along with landing nets in the water, with the net handle attached to the boat. We catch trout and salmon like this. When the net bends back that means you've got a fish, so you jerk the net like one would set the hook and pull the net and the fish in. We catch many fish, some of which are big! We pull one in every few seconds, as fast as we can. I think Franco catches a walleye, and then I see it is a salmon. He lets the other man fish. The boat starts to veer off course. I turn the throttle down and keep it on course. The fish have dark eyes. Something happens to a stringer we are using. We come up to a 94-foot long semi truck trailer. The stringer is being attached to it. I am under the trailer by the middle wheels. Someone is by the back wheels too. I'm scared and nervous. I feel like I'm strapped to the bottom of the trailer. I feel the weight of the trailer on my back and legs as the driver hooks it up. We are hooking up another trailer, weighing 150 tons. I'm really anxious. I see the semi truck back up and the trailer creaks because of its immense weight and pressure. I get hooked up. I squeeze out of where I am and go around the back of the trailer where the driver is. There is a Greyhound bus there. People on the bus come out dressed in winter clothes like they are cold. The driver tells me he wants me to keep riding under the trailer. There is a set of wheels that he drops down a notch; they are closer to the ground now, almost touching. This will give me more room. He tells me I have to learn how to drive the bus that he is driving and that I'm under. He is in a bad mood: sick and tired of driving. I tell him no problem, if he'll teach I'll drive. I realize when I say this that I legally probably shouldn't' be driving a bus full of people. If anything happens, he'll be liable."
"1063"	"(08/16/1997)"	"Archie Weber's Van I'm with others and we're planning our trip to the Big Resort Area. I'm coordinating more than others. I remember that there may be a fire ban in effect: we'll have to call and find out. I leave in a van with my cousin Archie Weber, who is driving, and my sister Ramona. Ramona and I are in back of the van. We go out the driveway from the white house, which we were at. I see a big nest in an old dead tree. I ask Archie if it's an eagle's nest. It is, and I see four immature eagles perched on it. I ask Archie where we're going. He says to Idaho. I think he's joking. I think we're just going down to Lake Lodge on Oval Lake to get gas for the trip."
"1064"	"(08/16/1997)"	"Ignoring John Kulik I'm working at Fishing Haven. I go into the store in the morning. There is a tow at 8:00am for my coworker Tom Olson and I on Eagle Lake. I look on the white sheet and there is a note that has something to do with me. I ask my boss Phoebe Mills what it is for. She points to a purple bag that is in the locker at the desk. The bag has my name on it. She tells me some books of mine are there. I look next to the back and pull out my Historical Geology book, ""On Dreams"" by Sigmund Freud, and a brown file folder with copies of my 1996 tax returns in it. I walk out back and into the driveway with my friend Jerry Parsons. There are red gas cans all over, like the six-gallon gas can I bought for my truck. The cans are full of gas. I go over to the towboats with two gas cans, one of which I've taken the cap off of. The customers look like they're ready to go so I put the cans down and put the cap back on the one. My boss Mike Hollow is coming over, and I feel like I shouldn't have the cap off it. There are two women getting tows. There is one woman and one canoe in each boat. One canoe is black. Tom is driving the boat on the right, with the more attractive of the two women. He warms up his motor. The woman in my boat moves back and warms up the motor. The boat drifts back towards shore, and I think the prop may hit the lake bottom so I move the boat forward a bit. Everyone is ready to go, but I need to grab a flannel shirt for the ride. Tom says he'll drive my boat out to the end of the dock so it will be ready to go. I run up and grab a shirt. I run back on the big dock, past Gene and Marie, and get into the boat. Gene and Marie know that I've quit. I think they look down on me for it, but I don't care: I know what I'm doing, and am competent. I set the boat cushion on top of the red seat that is in the boat. I can't pull-start the engine. It is in neutral, and the cord is really hard to pull! I try to start it but I can't. I find the choke and open it by flipping a switch halfway. I pull the cord and the motor doesn't start. I open the choke all the way by moving the switch to the left. The motor is square and much larger than the one I'm used to using. I get it started. My high school classmate John Kulik walks out on the dock. He knows I'm there. I pull the boat away from the dock, ignoring him. We leave. Near the opening to the bay Tom's boat slows down and stops. I see the brake lights for his boat and the cars in front of it. I can't stop in time without hitting his boat, so I pull of to the right of his boat onto the shore. I hop out of the boat with one foot. The motor is still running, but I don't think it has hit the lake bottom. I push the boat along easily with one foot. I'm in a sandy area. People are there. We get off track a bit, and will need to find the trail since we got off course."
"1065"	"(08/17/1997)"	"Ivory's Roommate I am in a dark bedroom. I am lying on a bed with my friend Beth Mock. My friend Ivory Alshire's roommate is there. Her name is similar to ""Ivory"". Beth and I kiss."
"1066"	"(08/17/1997)"	"Job Offer I go into a house. My high school classmate Carol Stilten is there. She greets me and we talk. I realize she is married. She leads me around the big central room of the house. She leads me to meet a man. The man offers me a job somewhere in the north woods. The job has a 10-year commitment. I turn the offer down."
"1067"	"(08/17/1997)"	"Urinating With Women I'm urinating in a bathroom. Women appear or are there. It is an odd feeling having the women there while I am urinating, but I urinate anyways because I need to."
"1068"	"(08/17/1997)"	"Prelucid Flying Trucks I see trucks driving and they start to fly. The trucks have propellers like planes, and have wings. I think I might be dreaming. I try to fly, and land on the ground."
"1069"	"(08/17/1997)"	"Lucid Nailed Down Cat I'm at a small party in an apartment on the east side of Wilmerton. My friends Tiny Combs, Gino Teavor, and others are there. People from Armstrong High School arrive. Some go down the hall to a different apartment, and some come in the apartment where I am. My high school classmates Olie Kecker, Brett Ball, and Arnie Heller walk in. They look down upon us because they think they're cooler than us: we are two different crowds. I greet Olie half-heartedly by saying, ""What's happening?"" Gino goes down to the other apartment. I don't want to be in these people's company so I leave quickly. I'm wearing socks but no shoes. I hurry down the stairs outside: I don't want anyone to know I'm leaving. I look for my truck, but can't see it at first. I'm not sure where I parked. I walk down the road to find it. There is a very pale woman with whitish blond hair who calls me over and tells me that back near or at the apartment there is a cat that got nailed down. I think I should go help it. I see my truck. I'm going to get my truck and go back to help the cat. The woman says she's going to go help the cat, so I run for my truck to leave so I'm not near the apartment. The woman runs after me. I stop and turn around. I'm confused, startled, nervous, and scared about why she is following me. I don't know why she would follow me. I realize I must be dreaming. I punch a yellow truck. Instead of my hand going through the truck, as I expected, it hits the truck. I tell the woman she is a part of my dream and ask her what she represents. She doesn't answer. She becomes a spirit: non-tangible but visible. I engulf her, consuming her, integrating her. I walk on and see my mom. I tell her she is in my dream and ask what part of the dream she represents. She doesn't answer. I engulf her, consuming her, as well. I see three women. We are on the hill of 1st Street just west of Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. I stalk them, taking my time, poised. I ask them what they represent in my dream. When they do not answer, I consume them."
"1070"	"(08/18/1997)"	"Hidden Sexual Rooms I'm in a store that I think is Big Red's Liquor store in Oak Valley. My friends Kevin Simpson and Bubba Hacker are there returning cases of empty beer bottles. I have returned a bottle for which I received a small credit. There is a small difference in price between what I want to buy and my credit. I pick up coins that are scattered on a workbench with other junk. I can get enough money from the coins to pay. An employee talks to me. He says Jeremy Taylor was here a few weeks ago. I say ""No way! He's one of my favorite authors!"" I realize he's actually not one of my favorite authors but still is someone I would have liked to meet. It seems like the place is a bookstore. I walk towards the back of the store. I'm looking for a room. I may have something that needs to be put in the room. There is a sexual connotation for this room. I go near one room, which I realize to be too extreme and perverted for my sexual taste, so I keep walking. I get to another room, which is too extreme as well, involving kinky fetish purposes. I'm looking for the tamest of all the rooms, with maybe just pornography or something. A dog goes by me. At first I'm happy to see it. It is a pretty light tan colored dog with short hair and a long tail that it wags. Then I see the dog is on a small platform that moves by itself. The dog is permanently attached to the platform by its feet. The butt and rear end of the dog is brownish, and I know humans have repeatedly raped the dog, which is why it's attached to the platform. The platform moves in a set path around the place. I think it's usually in one of the perverted rooms."
"1071"	"(08/18/1997)"	"Binky's Dream I'm in the basement at home doing laundry. My former boss Mike Hollow and my high school friend Binky Ahmed are there. Binky tells me about a dream he had, and we talk about it. I do laundry as I talk. Mike doesn't say anything about me not working. I set the laundry machine on medium. When I realize the load of laundry is bigger I try to change the size setting to large, but I can't, so I leave some of the clothes out. In Binky's dream, something or someone fills him with hot water. I immediately have an impression from the dream. I have a little trouble putting my thoughts into words, but I tell him his dream seems to depict him getting ""filled with hot air"", or full of nothing. Though water and air are two different things, the point is the same. Binky understands and seems to appreciate my insight: he didn't think of that before. Mike listens, saying nothing. There is a man who lies on the floor in white brief underwear as if her were sun tanning."
"1072"	"(08/18/1997)"	"Fuck You Coach At Bob's Sports Arena, there is a kid at hockey practice who isn't very good. He seems to be a beginner that doesn't have the concepts down. He shoots the puck. It doesn't go in, but hits the mock goalie's stick. A man instructs him to bounce the puck off the far wall: then it will reflect back to him, and he can tap it in. I'm on the ice, or the boy is I. We go in line and do a drill, zigzagging across the ice. I don't have skates on. I jump up as high as I can and try to touch the rafters. At the end of the drill I do better, and I kick a puck in a goal with my skate. I go off the ice. The hockey coach is the short girls assistant basketball coach at Armstrong High School. I don't like him. I say to him, ""Fuck you!"" He gets right next to me, and we argue. I quit. I punch him. He says he should punch me. I tell him if he punches me I'll sue. He punches or slaps me, but I'm not bothering to do anything about it. I walk across the rink wearing my shoes to get my stuff to leave. I have a locker with my stuff in it. My high school classmates Binky Ahmed, Olie Kecker, Arnie Heller, and Brett Ball are there. The coach is near me. I tell Binky his dream is about ""being filled with hot air"" from the coach! Binky is friendly to me. He asks me what I've been doing since I've been back. I tell him I've been reading, pretty much from the time I go to bed until the time I get up. Then I realize I said that backwards: it's actually from the time I get up until the time I go to bed, but everyone knows what I mean. The other guys think I'm pretty much worthless for reading all the time. They don't understand me. Olie maintains respect for me. Binky asks when I'm home, and I tell him always. I leave the arena. I leave my friend Bubba Hacker's red and silver Coca-Cola jacket in the locker. I exit and there are all kinds of forklifts and men carrying bricks, trees, and plants around. It's crowded and chaotic. My friend from high school Sam Kingsley is there. I shake his hand and we talk. I toss my stuff in my truck. Sam says it took him a while to figure out the handles on the truck. We're at his vehicle. His family is there, but I don't recognize them. He has his senior photographs. There is only one or two of him, and they are all very fuzzy. The rest of the photographs are of small children. Sam is going on a vacation, on a 12-hour drive. I tell him to call and give me his phone number. I go back to the truck, which seems to be a maroon mini-van like Fishing Haven's mini-van. I see that Sam got into the truck through the window, which is rolled down halfway, and then unlocked the door. I know he went for a ride and put gas in the truck, because there is more gas now then there was before."
"1073"	"(08/19/1997)"	"Historical Geology At Grandparents I'm in a classroom for Historical Geology. My professor Greg Welters has the class all go to a living room. We seem to be at my grandpa and grandma Redding's farmhouse. We eat food, including chips. A lot of crumbs are left on the floor. We watch a movie that goes until 7:30, a half hour late. We all gather our things up to leave. We were supposed to take our things with us from the classroom. I fold up a chair and put it in grandpa and grandma's bedroom, which might be Greg's room as well. Greg walks in wearing street clothes. He lives here."
"1074"	"(08/19/1997)"	"Annie and Ed Harris I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I give her cunnilingus. She is very sensitive. We walk outside and around the back at my house. My classmate Ed Harris is there. Annie may be my high school classmate Carol Derth. She puts her arm around Ed like they are a couple. There is a game going on in my back yard that involves jumping or sliding over a big hole in the ground. I think Annie and I are going to a dorm. We go to an apartment or house where both she and my adviser Mary Monroe live. Mary says to me that she lives just next door. I know she is trying to discourage Annie and I from having sex. There is a postcard on the table inside the apartment to a man Annie knows in northern Montana."
"1075"	"(08/19/1997)"	"Baseball Game Conference I'm in a conference room sitting at a table with other people. I know this is a baseball game. I have a small white ball like a golf or ping-pong ball. I throw it up and it bounces off the ceiling. I catch it. This is a home run. There is a sprinkler system in the building that I don't think is a good system. Something happens with the Armstrong High School principal. There are some army items there. People start to leave. I pick up a compound bow with arrows. I explain to two men who seem to be in charge that my brother Wally is an archer, and that this is his bow and arrows. I walk out of the room and the building. One of the men comes with me. I'm nervous that he comes with. I take a wrong turn and feel dumb. Outside the building I see my grade school classmate Eric Stoner and his mother near their vehicle. My college classmates Ryan Pug, Seth Voss, and others leave the parking lot in a van. Seth yells ""Sluuu"" as they drive away, and I yell back."
"1076"	"(08/19/1997)"	"Fat Rapist Man I'm in or on a vehicle. We go by a man on the street. He is fat, and he is a rapist. I throw a bottle at him and yell some remarks reviling him. We keep driving. I'm afraid the man will come after me. I look back and see him walking a dog. He doesn't look like he's going to come after me. I get home and am scared that the man will know or find me, and will come after me."
"1077"	"(08/19/1997)"	"Construction Beneath A Building I'm in my friend Hank Anderson's car with Hank, our friend Stephen Ramos, and others. We pull up to a building next to a small space in the wall. Hank points to the hole in the wall and says we're going down there. The car is on an elevator platform, and it drops down. We go down into a construction area. Men are working hard, wearing hardhats. It is a neat looking area: dimly lit with a clean concrete finish, very modern looking. I feel out of place, like I shouldn't be here, like we all shouldn't be here in the midst of this construction site. Stephen drives off in Hank's car to do what he needs to do. I wander around away from the construction. I walk through a very modern looking area that is clean and fancy, with glass and light green colored tile. I go into a bathroom. My friend from high school Sam Kingsley is there. The urinals are very small and narrow. They spray water at one's pants when one flushes. I wonder what all the nicely dressed businessmen do about that. I urinate in the sink. While I'm urinating two businessmen come over to another sink to wash their hands. One of them makes a comment to me insinuating I'm not clean. I don't say anything to the asshole, but I lather up my hands when I'm done urinating to show that I'm clean. My coworker Tom Olson's dog is there. I don't like the dog. I want to hurt or kill it: eradicate it. We all drive home. We need to drop people off at different places. The car is crowded with six people. People make jokes about me and something to do with an erection. I was in the middle of the front seat, but now am in the passenger seat, which takes me out of the spotlight for being made fun of. I don't want to wait to be dropped off: I want to be dropped off first."
"1078"	"(08/19/1997)"	"No Underwear Required I'm with others preparing to go out. I had previously joked about not wearing underwear, but now it seems that not wearing underwear is the norm, is expected, or at least one is to wear bikini briefs. I have on my blue Girbaud shorts with a wife beater. I don't like that no underwear is the norm. I have an erection, and it sticks out the top of my wife beater in front of my chest. My cousin Rich Redding is there. He thinks his hair looks very funny, all slick and combed. I am watching a movie with others. One of the movie characters is going to kill another character in a certain way using a large spear with an arrow-like head. I'm the person that is supposed to kill the other. I wait with a spear. Others that are watching the movie leave. I still haven't killed yet. I'm out on Home Avenue in Oak Valley. It's very icy: slippery. A car passes the car that is in front of it, and then slows down. I think the driver of the car that passed is dumb and a jerk. A police car goes by. The police car stops one of the cars involved in the passing incident. I'm at the top of the hill at Home Avenue and 2nd Street. A woman needs help getting up the hill. Another man and I push her car. Then we are pulling the woman up the hill. The man is really strong and does all the hard work. I try to pull but don't help that much. My aunt and cousin Shelia and Melissa Redding are there. Melissa gives me money, which may be for helping the woman. An ambulance spins its wheels as it nears the top of the hill: it can't make it to the top. I talk with the Reddings on the southeast corner of the intersection. My uncle Rusty Redding is going to Los Angeles. It is Thanksgiving time."
"1079"	"(08/20/1997)"	"Reviving A Dream I'm in a house which later seems to be my grandparents farm. Two people are dead. One is a very skinny woman. The other may be my friend Kevin Simpson, but Kevin may be the person trying to revive the second dead person. I try to revive the skinny woman. A woman is also doing this. A third person may be reviving Kevin, or Kevin may be reviving them. The skinny woman's arms seem to be nonexistent, like they are glued to her sides. Her body is stiff and cold. I do the Heimlich Maneuver and the other woman tries CPR. The dead woman is deathly thin: her waist looks like it about 15 inches around, and her body is nothing. If you push on one part of her stomach the contents of her stomach will move: there is nothing over them but a layer of skin. The dead woman has an erection, full of blood. Her other body parts may or may not be full of blood. She coughs: she is alive! Kevin comes alive as well! Both of them were dead: they had no pulse. I cradle the woman's head in my lap. She has had a near death experience in which she saw a red light. I tell her gently that she can't go back. We get up. There is a spirit of non-appreciation in the air, as if I have done the woman a disservice by saving her life. I talk with people there. My friend Stephen may be the one who indicates I have done a disservice. I'm sitting by the sink that spouts well water at grandpa and grandma Redding's farm. My coworker Amy Rancher, high school classmate Tracy Noles, and other skinny woman come in, as if they have just got done jogging. There are a couple older men there. One of them says he is amazed how I've helped other people grow, and he points at my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper and another man. They have really changed. He asks me if I change myself. I say that I try to. I try to explain that it's a lot harder, but nonetheless I try to change myself. Stephen says to me, ""What if the whole life saving episode was a dream?"" My initial reaction is to dismiss that possibility flat out. He says this because there is a feeling of disbelief in everyone's words and actions. I am the only one that is steadfast. I say absolutely no: it wasn't a dream. Then I realize that it was a dream: it makes so much more sense that way, it's so much clearer. To justify myself I say, ""In the dream..."", and then catch myself and say, ""In reality... this is where people were"", and I start pointing out different places where everyone was at. I know the reason that none of these people appreciate this is that it was my dream: my experience."
"1080"	"(08/20/1997)"	"Movie With Jenny I'm at Fishing Haven driving my truck down the driveway to the 15 Mile property. It's a dangerous road consisting of big rocks. There is a cliff next to the left side of the road as one drives down. I go slowly. The road is uneven because the rocks are so big. I think the rocks look different because I haven't been down the road for several days. I've been staying home, which may be there, reading and such. I go inside and set a green glass bottle of beer in the refrigerator. It may be Heineken. The twist off cap of the bottle is twisted so the seal is broken a little bit. My old roommate Sean Williams is moving things around a lot. The refrigerator and the freezer are moved. The floors are wooden. The rooms are bigger. Some other Fishing Haven employees come. One or two of them are new. We don't talk. I know they are new. My former coworkers Tom Olson, Amy Rancher, and Jenny come in. I immediately ask Jenny if she has my books, and as I do I realize it may be rude to ask that right away. She has one book with her, and hands it to me. It's gray and black, and it may be ""Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande"". I see and hear Amy tell Jenny to ask me something. Jenny asks me if I want to go into town and go to a movie. I don't want to spend the time going into town, but I don't want to turn Jenny down, and she is attractive, so I say, ""I'd love to."" I change my clothes right there. Tom and Amy wrestle. I wonder why Jenny asked me out. I think she and Tom must have broken up, and now Tom is dating Amy. Jenny is folding my clean laundry. I ask her what she is doing, and tell her not to fold my laundry! I take the gray wool pair with the red stripe to wear and throw the rest in my suitcase."
"1081"	"(08/21/1997)"	"Colorful Gas Hose I'm on Eagle Lake in a boat with others. I'm navigating. I go off my normal route and am lost. I pull out my enlarged Eagle Lake map to see where I am. I can tell I'm west of where I want to be. The motor stalls, and we can't get it started. There is no pressure in the ball for the gas can hose. The hose is loosely connected. We take off the hose and replace it with a smaller, shorter, narrower, more colorful hose. There are two packages that need to be flown out. I try to tie some kind of air-structure to a model of the plane. We are controlling the plane by radio control. My friend Matt Yams helps me."
"1082"	"(08/21/1997)"	"Everyone Has To Decide I'm at a racetrack with people. There is a race between small hair barrette-like objects. My object color is green. I win, and so does my friend Niles Zelling. We each get a check for $147.50 from a woman. I think we get a ""trifecta"", or the first three finishers correct. The woman says that we actually won $647.50, but since we didn't pay a damage deposit we don't get the other $500. I start to protest that she forgot to ask us to pay the damage deposit but she gets defensive and angrily stubborn. Then I understand that we aren't getting the rest of the money because we didn't pay a damage deposit: I didn't understand that at first. I'm going to a job interview. I walk by many Juicy Poultry Corporation semi truck trailers. I write ""KMHanson"" on some of them. I seem to be over on Cemetery Drive where Preppy Printers used to be in Oak Valley. I walk in a large warehouse. People are processing spinach. There are large square vats of spinach being thawed out. I walk, and think I am headed for a workshop-like room with tools and junk everywhere. Maybe I'll meet the man there. I am near Kentucky Fried Chicken, and then it seems I am in the Ace Hardware store. I call the man on the phone. My interview is at Kentucky Fried Chicken. The man asks me if I'm aware that we're scheduled to have a personal interview, not a phone interview. He is annoyed that I'm calling and am not there in person. He is a jerk. I'm on my way. I hear someone other than myself talking to him on the phone. The person says they are coming from Fishing Haven and will be there for the interview soon. The man just wants the person to be there, period. The person talking says they can leave their job early. This person is supposed to be me. The man gets mad when the person says that, because strict employment, jobs, and hours are important to him. I say to him on the phone that everyone has to decide sometime: has to make a choice. I'm walking out the back exit of Carter School talking on a red cordless phone as I say this. The phone belongs to Fishing Haven. I walk down the alley towards 2nd Street. I run and try to hide the phone. It seems that Fishing Haven is in Carter School and I don't want my former employers to see me with their phone. I will return it later. I walk and run through yards. I'm wearing blaze orange. I think and speak in terms of risks and benefits as I walk though yards, over fences, and by people. I seem to be going west, towards home. I think people will be able to see me from a long ways away because of my blaze orange."
"1083"	"(08/21/1997)"	"Men's Fest I'm sitting in a place writing my dreams. There is a woman sitting across from me who seems like my former coworker Jenny but she has dark hair. Some of her friends come, sit on my left for a bit, and then leave. They are getting their hair cut. A woman comes and sits on my left, across from the person, who then is Jenny. Jenny introduces the woman and I. Her name is Kari Johnson. I say to Kari, nonchalantly, ""Didn't we sit next to each other in 7th grade?"" She says that we did. I tell her I had a dream a couple weeks ago about our 7th grade classmate Kelly Furlong. Kari thinks I am dreaming about Kelly because I'm attracted to her. She doesn't understand what a dream means to me. In this place there is a disagreement and arguing over an accident or a fight: who is guilty, who is to blame? People gather inside the place. There is tension. My friend Kevin Simpson is there and talks about guilt. He doesn't blame himself, which I think is unusual because he's always sacrificing himself. Instead he blames my brother Wally. I think that though the fault lies somewhere, much of this should go blameless. The situation arose because of the circumstances, for which no one is to blame. My friend Stephen Ramos is outside. I go outside to avoid the conflict. I listen through the window, but don't want anyone to know I'm listening. I try to sneak back around front without them knowing I was eavesdropping. Inside there is a small crowd. My dad is there. I imagine a fight. I would support my dad if someone started trouble with him: someone would have to deal with me first, and I consider myself to carry a considerable amount of strength and power. There are two yellow school buses on the corner near the place where we are. One bus is rolling towards the other. Someone yells for me to put a package or a bunch of cheap white razors in a hold on the inside of the front of the moving bus, so when the buses collide they will explode. I run into the bus, put the razors in the hold, and quickly exit the bus. Main Street in Wilmerton is packed with cars. The police arrive, driving their cars on the median. The place we are at seems to be the glass store near McDonalds. I walk west on Main Street. I want to get away so that the police don't question me about the incident. I walk in my underwear. My face is scarred and torn up. Men are crowding the sidewalks and street. This seems to be a Men's Fest. Many of the men are holding a can of beer. There is a man hitting baseballs on the St. Mary's Church field. All the men are supposed to get to do this. They walk across Main Street and traffic stops. There are a few thousand men. I walk through them. I don't want to be a part of Men's Fest. I see pencil drawings on white paper as I walk. Some of these are large. Most of the drawings are of men and women. I know I had a drawing done, but I don't' know with who or where it is now. As I walk the back of my underwear may drop down, exposing my butt. I want to be away, to escape the police. I think of different routes I can take. Cutting through yards is probably the most clandestine route. I think it will be difficult cutting across the Thru Highway out in the open: the police would see me."
"1084"	"(08/22/1997)"	"Dry Paintbrush I am painting something with a paintbrush. The brush runs out of ink. Bubbles and water come out of the brush. I find something else to use to paint. (My dream notebook pen running out of ink instigated my recollection of this dream.)"
"1085"	"(08/22/1997)"	"Hospital Trespassing I'm with my friends Nat Miller and Tom Napper at the Wilmerton Hospital. We're in the maintenance shop. I'm fixing a phone. Part of it is sticky from a glue-like coating. I set it up to let it dry. I wonder if it will be in anyone's way, but Nat says the only person coming through is ___(I forget her name), the night cleaning lady. We leave the shop. I see my friend Kevin Simpson, who has really short hair. He works at the hospital. To have some fun, he leads us down a stairway to the basement where we exit out of a garage door into a parking lot area between buildings. We need to shut the garage door. Tom is close to it, but is too short, so I go back and close it. Kevin leads us to another building for which he has the key. Five security lights go on outside the building as we approach it. We scramble for cover, but not too frantically. I lean up against a wall to get out of the open. Tom runs away. Kevin, Nat, and I go into the building. We go up stairs and down hallways, just running around. We see security guards coming in their cars. It is now the daytime. I'm in front of the others. We scramble down stairs. Kevin directs me, but I don't know all the doors. We get to the first floor and go out the door on the other end of the building. We decide if security catches us we're going to say we're friends of a friend of a friend. We walk away, and go by huge tree stumps that are tan and white in color."
"1086"	"(08/24/1997)"	"Arnold's Drive In I'm at Arnold's Drive in on the east side of Wilmerton. I'm in a back area of the shack. I order food and drink. I pay a girl there $1.25, which is for doing my laundry, but at the same time it may be for the food. She is getting ready to put the laundry in the washer. I point out to her that there is a white shirt inside a dark green shirt, so she doesn't wash them together. My grade school classmate Patrick Bergman comes up to me and says he is there with his buddies and they will kick my ass if I go near his table. I don't bother to go near him. I sit alone on a picnic table in back of the shack, and am content with this. I'm talking to my high school teammate Binky Ahmed and Olie Kecker about parties. Olie wants to have three big parties. I tell him we're not having them at my house: I've already had my big parties, and am not having another. I may have a party if I get an apartment. Binky will have a party."
"1087"	"(08/24/1997)"	"Kari Otis' Punch I'm at Armstrong High School taking some junior and senior classes, that I need to complete. I walk into a bathroom. Usually the men's room is on the right and the women's is on the left. I see my grade school secretary Angie Sacks go into the bathroom on the right, so I look above the doorway to see how they are labeled. I go into the men's room, which is on the left. There are showers with a wall obscuring the shower stalls. A hallway is visible. I seem to be at Brimson. Women are in the bathroom. My grade school classmate Annette Smith is defecating in a stall without a door. My classmate at Brimson Laura Robinson is urinating in a stall. I think that's odd sine she is a woman, but maybe she has a penis. I urinate in a stall. I wash my hands well afterward with soap and water. A person is putting a small ball of garbage in the trashcan. The ball has some red stuff on it, which I think may be menstrual blood, and I find that aversive. Angie Sacks and my brother's grade school classmate Shelly Jenson are in the bathroom. I walk out past the showers and get a glimpse of Shelly and my classmate Sarah Miller standing, drying off after a shower. I try to do a task separating two wife beater tank tops and something else, but I can't do it or I have trouble. I walk out of the bathroom. My grade school classmates Kari Otis and Misty Ryan walk towards me. Misty is telling Kari about some of her dreams. They are joking around, and we joke and playfully punch each other. Kari then punches Misty hard in the face, which is inconsistent with the playing that had been occurring: it was malicious! Misty is hurt, and taken back. Kari apologizes to Misty, but it is not a genuine apology. Kari is mad and was expressing real anger and aggression in that punch. My high school classmate Linus Doman is there. I say that Kari punching Misty hard would be like me punching Linus. I have a pair of glasses with lenses five or six inches in diameter. They are candy, and I try to eat them. The glasses are so big they'd be more easily eaten if they were in pieces. I go into a class on sex roles, which seems to have something to do with my economics professor Zoe Madden. I walk in and sit down behind my friend Matt Yams. People behind me try to bully me, and I ignore them. The male teacher is collecting books and blue papers. I don't have my work done. I didn't have the same work done at an earlier class period. I woman I recently met is in the class."
"1088"	"(08/25/1997)"	"The Snarkel Dream I'm in a big city. There is a very tall hotel with many stories. Off the side of the hotel quite high up is a platform that extends 25 or 30 out from the building. It is all enclosed and finished off. This is Alcatraz. The platform has a satellite dish on it, pointing upwards. It sends out small waves and gets the waves back when they are larger. The platform ledge is used for high-class business or social functions. In the building there is a large round elevator with a hole in the middle: donut shaped. People stand where the cake part of the donut would be. The elevator is about 70 feet in diameter and holds a couple hundred people. It goes up and down many floors of the building very fast, but gently. I am in a round green room. There is a woman there on the other side of the room, and others. The class of 1997 from Brimson is in the elevator, and they enter the room we are in from a metal hatch door on the floor. They walk up and in like the elevator is below the room we are in. Alec Johnson is among them. He talks to another woman about Josh Lanky, my high school classmate. Alec says that Josh is a good guy. The class is going to watch a movie in the room. A woman I know comes up to me and says I have to move because the class will be sitting where I am. I hop off the table I'm sitting on and she sits down there. I realize that this exact scenario of the woman telling me to move has happened to me previously in a dream. In that dream I told the woman to eat shit, and wouldn't move. In this case, I moved. I go sit by the woman I know. The room doesn't fill up: not all the graduates come. The areas near the walls are occupied but the center of the circular room is largely empty. The people and I watch a movie on a big screen. My friend Tiny Combs is there. In the movie there is a black man who gets electrocuted and dies. He is digging, mining, and connects two wires together. The two other free ends of the wires touch his feet, completing a circuit, and he gets shocked. He is alive later, and a woman straddles him; they have sex. There is a round brick vertical tunnel about 10 feet in diameter. Next to the tunnel is a ledge. There are some metal bars extending both out from and across the tunnel. There is a round concrete platform, about two feet in diameter, that moves up and down in the tunnel. I am hanging on the bars. My friends Tiny and Nate Nelling are there, also hanging. We have to let go of the bar, land on the platform, ride it a little ways, and then jump and grab onto the bar again. There is a snarkel there. The snarkel is a little man who lives in this deep, dark tunnel. The tunnel is very deep and dark. At the bottom the tunnel curves and becomes horizontal: the tunnel is actually U-shaped. It may go back up on another side. The snarkel says that he fell to the bottom of the tunnel once. It took one and a half years for the platform to come down so he could jump on it. At the bottom of the tunnel, at the bottom of the U-shape, there is a light. The rest of the tunnel is dark. The platform will make it to the bottom sometime, but we don't know when. The platform moves where it needs to go, where people need to go. One needs to jump on it while its' moving. My friend Tim Zelling is there. We hang on the bars. Someone tries to use a fishing net to help me and one of the other guys move from the bar that we're hanging on, like we are supposed to step in the net or onto the metal edges of the net. The net isn't strong, though, and it won't hold. I want to jump from the bar, pushing off from the wall with my feet and legs, and land on the ledge without using the platform. This is dangerous. I might not make it and would fall down into the deep dark stone tunnel. I get ready to jump. I tell Tim not to grab me too soon or I'll lose the jumping momentum. I'm aiming for a metal support bar on the corner of the ledge. I hope I can jump and grab onto it! I have to be careful when I jump not to hit my head on another bar farther out in the tunnel."
"1089"	"(08/26/1997)"	"Donating Sperm I'm donating sperm. I'm standing at the counter where a woman is getting my file. My sister Ramona is at the counter. I feel embarrassed with Ramona there. The woman looks at my file, which is a pink folder, and says my sperm were 90% dead. I say that I know that. I'm uncomfortable and embarrassed. She gives me the things I need to donate: the cup is shorter and wider than the one I had before. I think it will be easier to aim into. She points me to a room across the hallway. I go out into the large, wide hallway. There are many doors. I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to go into. I walk down the hallway, looking into rooms. One room is large and empty: classroom-like, and has religious artifacts around it. I wonder if it's a good idea to ejaculate in that room. I'm near the end of the hallway. I see my friend Simon Naver walk by, around the corner. He sees me and after pausing, he comes over and we talk a little bit. We shake hands: I don't get a good grip. I ask him how much money he made this summer, because I hear he made a lot. He says he made $9,000! We talk, but are uncomfortable doing so. Our high school teammate Tony Kramer may be there. I leave, and walk back down the hall to the office area. There are several famous movie stars in a room: a man and a couple women. A woman was raped earlier, though she didn't realize it. As a result it hurt have to have sex when the group was donating sperm."
"1090"	"(08/26/1997)"	"Man Trolling A Torpedo I'm at a lakeshore. A hilly gravel windy road runs along the lake. I'm with others. A man trolls along the shore of the lake, about 50 feet out from shore. His fishing lure drags really close to the shore: one or two feet. He's using a baby torpedo lure, I see. I ask him if it's a tiny or a baby torpedo, even though I know what it is, just to make conversation. He stops and talks to me, saying it's a baby torpedo. He is trolling for bass. He uses the name ____ (I forget) instead of bass, which is unique. I think there probably aren't many bass in this lake. It's a very clear lake, and the depth drops off from shore really fast with little shallow shoreline for bass. He says that a thunderstorm is supposed to move in shortly, tonight or tomorrow, and after that we're supposed to get clear weather until it cools off this fall. I think that's good news because I want sun when we're in the Big Resort Area. I am in a basement with the man and my friend Hank Anderson. We talk about moving a wall back for more space. Something comes up or happens with buffalo and Indians."
"1091"	"(08/26/1997)"	"Metroid I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson playing the Nintendo game Metroid. His player dies quickly when it's his turn. I'm a good player, and my player does well: gets far. I go in one are to find the freeze ray. Everything with color on the screen is the color of freeze ray: silverfish-grayish-white. I shoot missiles all the time, not just bullets. My player jumps up. There are cars in the game, which I shoot. I begin going on a race track-like path with many cars. I control one car. I go fast and shoot many cars that blow up. I do very well: I'm going very fast shooting and going by things in my way. I'm going to win the game, pass the level, and finish the race first. My cousin Henry King steps on my car, keeping it from moving. I control the car by pushing a button on my pants, like a joystick. I try to finish the race in the remaining time; I don't know if I can."
"1092"	"(08/27/1997)"	"Drowned Black Cat I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in the Big Resort Area. We canoe along. We're dragging a yellow minnow bucket. A black cat is right next to the minnow bucket. The cat drowns. We are swimming in the water, dragging the cat and the bucket. It seems we're on Little 15 Mile Lake, and we get lost again. He finds our orientation, and we head southeast, to make a loop in the time we have. We're using his Grumman canoe. There are two yellow canoes ahead of us that make it to the portage before us. We go past the Jordan portage to the Lora portage. It's 90 rods long. The water we cross is turbulent. I carry the canoe on the portage. The yoke is very close to the back of the canoe and my view is obstructed by the back seat. I say to Kevin that we forgot the bent-shaft paddles! A man at the portage tries to drag two aluminum canoes by putting the bows of each on each of his shoulders and driving his legs. I pass this man, running carrying our canoe, which is really light. We come to an open area. I am leading with the canoe. Kevin follows, with a younger kid and a man in his party. They want to take a photograph of me because I handle the Grumman like it's a feather, even running with it. I stop for them to take a photograph. The front of the canoe bends like I am carrying a carpet. The open space we've come to is a motor home park. There is a blacktop road, and open camping area, and some store areas. We walk in towards this tourist area. I see many northern pike that swim along the side of the road, where there is a four or five foot wall that drops down to the water level. I think we may be able to get some paddles here. Kevin asks about the amount of propane we have: he thinks we may not have enough. There are big ice cream cones in the tourist area."
"1093"	"(08/28/1997)"	"Ultimate Frisbee I'm playing a game of baseball. I'm then playing a game of soccer with a Frisbee. My friend Niles Zelling is on my team. Several other people are there. Our team doesn't have enough players, so the other team has some of their players play for our team. There is a goal on each end of the field. After the first game we're supposed to play a second game. Niles questions whether this is a good idea because we have a basketball game later that day, and he thinks we'll have more Frisbee games later as well when our players show up, because we'll keep winning (as if it's a tournament). My high school classmate Buck Green shows up for out team's second game. We play. The other team kicks off. I receive the kick off, which is a football. I catch it in a fishing net after it bounces, and sloppily throw the net and ball to Niles, who is behind me, when the other team approaches. A tall red-haired man that I know from Brimson defends me, and I defend him. The other team then has the Frisbee. I hold the man, giving him cheap shots, the whole game. While I do this I ask him if there is a rule against holding, even though I know there is. He says there is a rule, but it's not called holding, rather _____ (I forget). When we get the Frisbee he defends me cleanly and very well. He is a very good player, much better than myself. The other team scores easily. It seems I am only on offense at the first kickoff, and then am on defense the whole time. They have the Frisbee on the sidelines for a throw-in. The player I'm guarding, who is my former roommate Sean Williams, rolls an entry pass instead of throwing the Frisbee to his teammate. The Frisbee rolls like a wheel. Sean and I both chase it. He is faster than I, and picks it up. I chase him. There is no one between him and the goal, but he is still a ways from the goal. He is going for the goal, and will probably make it. I dive when he throws the Frisbee, trying to deflect it with my outstretched arm. (I awaken with my right arm outstretched hitting the fan on my floor.)"
"1094"	"(08/28/1997)"	"Beer Cabinet My friends Queen Billman and Marge Drummond are trying to unlock a bike with a stuck lock. One of them has a small red car there. They seem to be downtown Wilmerton outside Ciatti's on the sidewalk near the mall. I'm in a room with my friends Niles Zelling and Hilary Nano. We're trying to pry open a cabinet that is stuck closed. We fiddle with the key, and can't get it to fit exactly. We use a crow bar and have to position it nearly perfectly in the slot, but do and pry the door open. Beer is inside. We all say yum! We hug each other. Hilary is in the middle and Niles and I are on the outside in our 3-person hug. I pretend to have butt sex with Hilary. There is some sexual feeling in our interaction. There is a box of envelopes in the cabinet. Tim Zelling is there and takes a 12-pack of Miller Genuine Draft bottles out of the cabinet for him. There wouldn't be much left, and the owner would know that we took some, so I leave the rest there. We all walk down lofty stairs, which are built to one can see between the steps. My old roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens are walking down the stairs as well. They heard our ""Ummm, beer"" chant when we opened the cabinet. Many people now head back to the hall to hear music that has been playing there, and to take part in it. I'm in a crowd of students waiting to re-enter the building. We all sing, on cue, at appropriate times. The first line we sing is pretty clear for having so many people singing. The next cue is all jumbled and incoherent. People get in groups and do the hokey pokey. I wonder why they do it the way the do: holding their arms up, bent, touching one hand to the opposite elbow. My sister Ramona, my mom, and my friend Kevin Simpson are there. We're in a circle with others. Ramona does the hokey pokey in the middle and then comes over to me, which means it's my turn to go in the middle. I laugh at this because it's funny, but I also am hesitant to dance like this: I feel embarrassed and self-conscious. I fall down laughing, then slide on my back like Michael J. Fox's character Marty in the movie Back To The Future. No one really likes my dance. Kevin is next. He moves a stone on the floor with his head, and then kicks it to me. I kick it back. I don't want to dance again."
"1095"	"(08/28/1997)"	"Taming Bullies A class photograph is being taken. I sit on the top row of bleachers where the ""Hansons"" and other ""H"" people sit. I sit close to, and in between other people. It makes me uncomfortable that we're so close. I'm then in the front row next to my friend Gino Teavor. Small yellow pillows and other things are handed out for the photograph. Since we're in the front it matters what we do with our legs for the photograph. We are supposed to hold hands, somehow. The camera is a video camera. There are many television screens that must be adjusted for people on the side of the group; the screens are turned. The group consists of students, and the people organizing this are students as well. Some physically big kids, who are younger than I, start bullying younger kids. The directors don't know what to do. I can't let this go unnoticed. I run over and confront the bullies. I reprimand them. They don't challenge me, but leave the younger boy alone. They have a difficult time backing down, though: they lose a lot of face! I'm in a restaurant type place with a couple others having a small celebration, which may be due to the victory over the bullies. I have my bottle of Key Lime Schnapps and pour it in some glasses. It's kind of milky, and I wonder if it has gone bad, but it is okay. A kid tries to take one of the chairs at our table. I yell at him, and he leaves the chair. There is an older man there who may be a good fighter. We fight. I punch him in the throat and he quickly falls down. I feel very powerful and in control."
"1096"	"(08/28/1997)"	"The Racist Joke I'm with my friend Nelson Eastman, Uncle Phil from the television show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and others, in a room. Nelson tells true story a bout what I said the previous night when I was drunk. I said it's your kind of joke, referring to the high school boys back home. The joke goes something like, ""What's worse than Robin Givens face?"" or ""How is Robin Spence's face like a ___ ( I forget)?"" The punch line is ""Roman Meal"", which is the whitish colored corn mush. This is a racist joke. I say I don't remember telling the joke, because I don't. I sit in a bathtub feeling very guilty about making a racist joke. The judge looks very sternly at me and asks for my explanation. I don't speak. There is a man with Nelson and I, the judge is now a ways away. The man says that he told the joke, not I! The joke wasn't mine and wasn't told by me. The judge comes over. I say to the man that he needs to tell the judge this or I will. He doesn't tell the judge. I tell the judge. The judge doesn't understand at first. Then he realizes that I didn't tell the joke, that the other man did, and that he projected the joke onto me. I am furious! I stand up in the bathtub and start to yell at the judge. I throw a drill bit-like piece of metal and some utensils. I am enraged at being accused and vindicate myself. I seem to work at the place I am, and I now quit my job and walk out. I get to the Redding farm porch where Oprah Winfrey and another prominent black woman are. I tell them as I nearly break down in tears, that ""He thinks I told a racist joke but I didn't! I'm not racist!"" They console me and we walk outside. I say I need to be alone, and I run off feeling very frustrated and agitated. I'm near 3rd Street and Home Avenue in Oak Valley on the sidewalk. The ""oppressors"" are at Carter School. It's winter. I run with a t-shirt on. I get to the hill at the bottom of our alley. A tow truck drives down the alley and skids quickly to a stop in the show so it doesn't hit a vehicle coming up the hill on 2nd Street. I walk towards home and think about drawing this dream for the afternoon and not going back to school at Carter School. I feel in control of the situation. I have the upper hand on the people involved."
"1097"	"(08/28/1997)"	"Marathon I'm running a marathon. I wonder how long or how far after the warm up the actual race starts. I think of my stepbrother Nan Lawson running the race in one hour and twenty minutes, with his worst time about one hour and fifty minutes. I wonder if I can even approach his worse time."
"1098"	"(08/28/1997)"	"Window Jumping Suicide A black man is in bed with a black woman. She refuses to have sex with him. I am there and I bump into her butt. She scolds me for bumping into her. Later, the man and another man commit suicide by jumping out of a window."
"1099"	"(08/28/1997)"	"Skinheads There are some crazy skinhead people that take over an area. They shoot many people. I am there, as is my friend Marge Drummond. Something happens with a swimming pool and swinging on a rope."
"1100"	"(08/29/1997)"	"Nylon Bicycle I get or buy a bicycle made of nylon straps. I choose one with no aluminum frame, just straps. It may be too flexible, and not have enough support. The nylon straps are very tight, but sag under my weight."
"1101"	"(08/29/1997)"	"Smiling In Photographs I'm at Armstrong High School walking in the parking lot. I'm going towards the east parking lot where the athletes park. Students walk out of the school towards the parking lot. My high school teammates Olie Kecker and Ron Lind walk by. We greet each other saying, ""What's up?"" The students all get to something like a roller coaster, not on rails, but on the blacktop, and some other object. They begin to crowd around it. I leave: this is not where I want to be. I get over the road dividing the east and central parking lots. My classmate Virginia Green is there, and I say hi to her. She doesn't seem too happy to see me. My high school classmate Lynn Escher is there smoking a cigarette. It seems that my friend Sarah Reed is there, maybe in Lynn. Lynn asks me why I am always smiling so big in photographs but walk around with a stern face in real life. I know this is true, and I shrug my shoulders, and say I don't know why. My high school classmate Stacy Brill's parents are there. They seem to know who I am. They look familiar to me. I say hi, but don't know who they are until someone says so. I meet others who seem to know me, but I don't know who they are."
"1102"	"(08/29/1997)"	"My Liposuction Job I'm at a new job at which I perform the new kind of liposuction that I recently saw an infomercial for. I go into a small room with a man who is a client. He has light brown hair. I start liposuctioning his face and neck. I ask him if he's 40 yet, and he says he's 45. I have my hand on his stomach. He sweats a lot and his stomach gets slippery. The man is pretty strong and lean. He reminds me of my friend Hank Anderson's step father. I'm not using the liposuction tool. I realize this and look for it. I'm then in my underwear, and the man changes back into his clothes: he is done for the day. I am worried that I may get an erection. The man leaves and my female coworkers enter the room. They are jealous that I got to perform liposuction on my first day with no training. They all have to wait a while before than can do that. I play the whole thing down, and try to change the topic of conversation. Some Asian people walk by the opened door. They are dressed in karate guys. I lie on the table and stick out my belly, pretending that I need liposuction. My coworkers brush me off, sillily, saying I am foolish for thinking that, even though I'm joking around. Our manager, who is an Asian woman, comes in and catches us loafing around. She gets mad at us and punches everyone out on the time clock. I talk to her and ask her if we don't even get a break. I tell her law requires breaks! I don't have a time card, and I didn't punch in before work. I work with seven women my age. I am outside in the winter. I go look at a time clock on the side of a building. There is no time card for me. I take a card that is someone else's, and put I back. All the new time cards are inside the clock and I can't get at them. I walk away. Some men from Brimson walk by, including a man named Brad from my music class. I then see my brother Wally and classmate Melvin Dahlheimer. I hug Melvin, and then go up to Wally. Wally extends his hand, and I hug him, both joking and seriously. We're near Carter Church. I'm wearing my green parka. Wally, Melvin, and others are going to Mason Cafeteria to eat: they live on campus. I tell them they should stop by. I tell Wally to call and I'll tell him how to get to the Whitman house. I have forgotten my new green backpack at my liposuction job."
"1103"	"(08/29/1997)"	"Psych Office Building I'm with a man. We walk through buildings, office type areas, looking for a place to study. The offices we go into seem to be vacant, but I'm not comfortable there. A conference or lecture is being held, and I think the rooms may be used again soon. One room has a radio in it. I see a ""Psych"" office building. I want to go there and look. There is a toy or costume Halloween-type store there."
"1104"	"(08/29/1997)"	"Handing Out Halloween Candy It's Halloween. I'm handing out candy at home. It is late, and I shut the lights off and close the door. Just as I do this people walk up the sidewalk. I give them candy and they leave. More people come. I run out of candy and run inside the house and scrounge some up. I get some Butterfinger candy bars. I am eating, or have made, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
"1105"	"(08/29/1997)"	"Installing A Blue Light Bulb I'm in a mall. A new security system is being put in at a store after the mall closes one night. We are supposed to have the lights turned off, since it's after hours. I change a light bulb in the store. I stand on a tall ladder that is very wobbly. The new bulbs I put in are blue. They seem to snap into place. To get the second bulb in I hang from a ledge and try to get my leg up on the ledge, and then hang by one arm, putting the bulb in with my other hand. I think I am a long way off the floor. When I hang down, I am only a foot or two above the floor. I let go, and easily land on the floor."
"1106"	"(08/29/1997)"	"Math With Sue I'm in a math class. It's the first day of class. My classmate from Brimson Sue is there. The teacher is like my calculus teacher from Brimson but is more mellow, easier, and geekier. Sue and I are the only two students in the room. We get assigned to do our choice of odd or even problems from the book. The teacher didn't instruct us on how to do them, just to do them. We are having a class meeting on Wednesday, and the problems are due Friday. Sue and I look at the problems. She is wearing a short gray cotton skirt with a pair of white spandex biker shorts underneath. I wish she wouldn't have worn the spandex under her skirt! The problems in the book have boxes with circles in them. Depending on where the boxes and circles are, they are symbols for addition and multiplication. Sue and I flirt, and I want to kiss her. At one point I walk down the hallway and see other classrooms. My classroom is much more laid back then the others: they are all working hard. The problems look like this: ___=_, where squares and circles represent different numbers and operations: 10 _ 10 _ 10     10"
"1107"	"(09/06/1997)"	"Hill Lodge Bar I'm at a bar near the Hill Lodge in Oak Valley. Other people my age are there. There are older people inside the bar. Some of the younger adult men court a young woman there. There is a conflict between the younger and older people about noise violations. The older people think the younger people are loud, and the younger people think the older people are loud. A person who went to my high school, Karin Bellview, is there, or the head of a puppet that reminds me of her is there. The red headed-man I caught chickens with is there. He has a goatee. I think of driving home and how much I've had to drink: what my blood-alcohol level would be. I figure I have only had three beers: two in the first hour, so if the police stop me I won't get at DWI, but rather a DUI. I think of getting a DUI on my way home: would I pull over or try to outrun the police officer? I imagine duping the police. When I get home I see a loaf of bread in the driveway when I get out of the car. On the bread my mom has written $1.25. I go inside and my mom is finishing baking cookies. I was supposed to bake cookies, and I forgot."
"1108"	"(09/07/1997)"	"Sex With Brianna I'm in a bedroom with my classmate Brianna Eggert, friend Hank Anderson, Hank's grandpa, roommate Stephen Ramos, sister Ramona, and others. We are all about to go to bed. I'm on one side of a large bed. Brianna is in the middle of that bed, and Stephen is on the other side. It's hot in the room. I take off most of my clothes and sleep with my brown corduroy pants on. Brianna sleeps half naked as well. We all lay in bed. I have my hand on Brianna's stomach in a nonchalant way. I want to have a sexual encounter with her, but I don't want to be too assertive. She moves my hand to her breast. I start to rub and suck her breasts. I don't want Ramona, who is in the room, to know I'm doing this. I move my hand down and touch Brianna's crotch, rubbing her clitoris with my finger. I awaken, and am sitting up not in or near a bed. My hand is in some crusty or crumb-like bird-food substance. I smell my fingers, which don't really smell like a vagina, but smell a little different."
"1109"	"(09/08/1997)"	"Stop Digesting My Food I'm with my girlfriend, who is a weightlifter. I am spotting her as she does reverse dumbbell curls. I kiss her forearms as she curls the weights. I rub my growing erection up against her calf as I kneel to spot her. I'm eating an apple, salivating profusely. I'm really sexually aroused, and want to have a sexual encounter with her right now! She says to me, ""Stop digesting my food."" I am taken back, because this is a light reprimand. I say, ""Okay"", meekly. I sit in a chair and read a magazine. In the magazine there is supposed to be an article on Montana fishing, on page 80. This is the September issue. I turn to read the article but there aren't 80 pages in the magazine."
"1110"	"(09/08/1997)"	"Telling My Dream I'm am talking with my roommates Stephen Ramos and Norman Noman. I tell them about my dream from last night in which I was having a sexual encounter with our classmate Brianna Eggert."
"1111"	"(09/08/1997)"	"My Broken Spoon My good wooden all purpose spoon that I use for the Big Resort Area trips is broken. It has been glued back together, maybe by my mom."
"1112"	"(09/08/1997)"	"New Boat Seats My boat has new boat seats. They are green plastic, and they look a bit hard, but nonetheless they are nice. They don't have backs, but are just the seat area. They're not high up like seats in a bass boat: they're low to the boat. My dad must have gotten around to these boat seats sooner than he thought."
"1113"	"(09/08/1997)"	"Breakfast With Tanks I'm in the kitchen at home. My high school classmates Holly and Megan Tanks are there. It's morning, and we're cooking oatmeal before school. Holly is wearing underwear and an orange/tan/pink long sleeved shirt. She tells me a dream that she figured out. I'm in the garage. Holly comes to the garage because she wants to check it out. I pour some oatmeal for myself. I ask if Holly got some oatmeal. She says yes, she did, but says so hesitantly so that I think she really didn't get any, but isn't saying so. My brother's friend Mryle Madden is there. He chews Skoal. It's winter, and is snowy and icy on Home Avenue. I'm a senior at Armstrong High School. I don't have a ride to school, and will take the bus. My sister Ramona leaves. I'm in a hurry to get ready. I'm not too worried, it seems. My brother Wally is there. He can give me a ride or I'll walk or just skip school. I'm outside by the back driveway. I see a bunch of cars brake quickly and slide on the slippery road as they start to go down the hill on Home Avenue. The cars crash into each other, rear-ending the car in front of them. I ask a girl form my high school, Rachel Ransom, if I can get a ride to school with her and her two friends, one guy and one girl. She agrees. I say I need two minutes to run in and brush my teeth, but really I also need to get my green backpack too. Rachel is then my classmate Kari Otis, and she follows me into the house. She has a plate of peanut butter stuff. We go into the bathroom to brush our teeth. She used to live in this house. As she enters the bathroom she says, ""Where's my bathtub?"" It's hard to brush one's teeth with one's mouth full. My mom has put my clean laundry on the porch. I feel guilty because I didn't attend to my own laundry. I go outside through the garage, brushing my teeth. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper and three others are sitting in my boat. They tell me that the neighbors told them to sit there. I say to them that the neighbors are ""retards"", but I pronounce that word with a short ""e"" sound, so that I sound like a retard. They leave. They're going to ride to school in the trunk of a car. I hurry to get ready. I put on my Texaco shirt, Union Bay jeans, and orange socks. My jackknife is on the floor and the blades are open."
"1114"	"(09/09/1997)"	"Sex With Yvette Ullman I'm in a grade school classroom, which might be that of my old teacher Sherry Devine. My grade school classmate Eric Stoner makes fun of me, and says I am attracted to our classmate Misty Ryan. Misty offers me graham crackers. I say no. There is a transfer student, a girl with short dark hair that doesn't have to do with work because she knows the material already. The teacher is diagramming the trajectory-type path of a football on the board. The class is using algebra II and trigonometry to figure the distance traveled on the ground. I think this is very boring. I know how to figure it out. I fiddle with my watch, pressing buttons, trying to get it to work correctly and display the time. The transfer student has left the room. I leave: I don't need to be there. I am at home with my dad and his friend Josh Hemming. They joke about sexual things, and say something about whores swinging around above us in the air, and us hitting a ""bush"", which is a joke about somebody running into the pubic hair of one of these swinging women. Josh says something about having our photograph taken with my mom while we are naked. This appalls me. I run up the front driveway at home around the north side of the house to the back driveway. I meet my friend Yvette Ullman near the driveway. She and I are then in the kitchen. I kneel down, and am lower than her head. We kiss and lean back on the floor. She is very wary of our kiss. I want to have a sexual encounter with her! She is wary of going too far with me. I try to take off her pants to give her cunnilingus. She doesn't want this. I ask if her if she'll ""kiss my penis"", and she agrees to give me fellatio. She could die from giving me fellatio because she has TMJ in her jaw. She has braces. I touch her nipples under her shirt. She says out loud that she wonders if she'll regret not letting me give her cunnilingus. My dad is outside in the driveway with some men who have foreign accents. Some of them are wearing ski-type boots. My dad can see Yvette and I through the kitchen window. I try to act inconspicuous, so he can't tell we're getting it on. My brother Wally pulls into the driveway on his bicycle. He and my dad come in the back door. Yvette and I stop our sexual activity and try to look like we haven't been doing that when they enter. My dad knows what we were doing and he says, ""Good work"", jokingly, which indicates to me that he knows what was happening but doesn't care. I feel dumb. I'm in a farm-type area. There is a flash flood. I walk down by a slippery muddy riverbank and grab an extra pair of boots and socks. I bring them home. My sister Ramona is on the phone with my mom, who is mad that Ramona and I skipped school. Ramona hands me the phone through the front window. I take it. It's my dad on the other end. He tells me to give him a call. I want to talk now, but he won't and tells me to call him back in five minutes. He wants to talk about my sex with Yvette, because he saw it, and he didn't want to talk around the others. I walk around back of the house and go in the back door. There is a little black kid at the kitchen table. My aunt Sheila Redding and my mom are cooking in the kitchen, making cookies."
"1115"	"(09/09/1997)"	"Water Tower In Water There is blue and/or brown water tower. It has a smiley face on it, like the Oak Valley water tower. It may be being painted. It is first wrapped in a large bandage-like material, like a huge ace bandage. I'm on top of the water tower. It sits in a body of water, like an ocean. There is a boat at the bottom of the tower. I'm very afraid of the height of the tower. I'm afraid of falling, and of darkness. I want to get down fast! It seems I have some sort of bicycle that I made it to the top with, and that I have to get on to go down. I'm very afraid of going from the top of the tower to the bicycle. I'm in a boat on the ocean with two men. I want to leave. I try to force them to leave; to control them. I have a rope and a 2x4 piece of wood that I use to wield my power. The man gets the rope from me: I lose it. I want to smack the man on the head with the 2x4. He cuts me with a razor blade so I won't go in the salt water. He then pops my air suit, on my body, with the blade. It's dark. The ocean water where we are is shallow: a couple feet deep. The water dries up, leaving a floor. A man committed murder unknowingly when he had sex with his wife in saltwater on their wedding night."
"1116"	"(09/10/1997)"	"Hole in Rusty's Canoe I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in the Big Resort Area. We have two canoes: one is my uncle Rusty Redding's, and the other may be Kevin's canoe or his friend's canoe. Four people approach with a bunk-type bed: a man, a woman, a child, and our friend Bubba Hacker. From a distance I at first don't recognize Bubba, but then I do and I wonder what the hell he's doing with a huge bed in the Big Resort Area. They get closer and Bubba moves away from the people, towards us, as a way of saying that he was just joking about being with them and bringing the big bed. Kevin and I push off in Rusty's canoe. There is three inches of water in the bottom of it. I say there must be a hole in it, and I see it, bubbling, on the keel near the stern. I tell to Kevin and Bubba to put all the gear in the other canoe, and let me take the leaky canoe by myself. Kevin and I had been fishing. We all see a bald eagle. I point it out. The man, woman, and child see it too. I take two photographs of it while it is flying. I don't know if they'll turn out because the camera is moving. We are headed to the 100-rod Evergreen Lake portage. We are on the south side of Oval Island on the west end. I think of the tough paddle across open water I'll have alone in a canoe."
"1117"	"(09/10/1997)"	"Buying Shredded Wheat I'm at Grocery Getto in Oak Valley. There is a lot of cold cereal on sale. I buy some bite size shredded wheat or frosted mini wheats that cost $3.00 for two boxes. I see raisins and buy a bag because I remember I need them for my oatmeal breakfasts. A lot of cereal is on end displays. There is a large toy section, with yellow trucks in it. I buy other things as well, including blueberries. There are raspberries at the top of the bag of blueberries."
"1118"	"(09/10/1997)"	"Blue Sunset Something happens putting together or winding a machine backwards. My friend Kevin Simpson and I run away because of the machine. We leave my house. We have a full tank of gas. I turn off the lights as we leave. We think of a place to go to sleep. It's raining. We don't want to pitch a tent in the rain. I think of going to Jefferson School or the Hill Park shelter where there would be something to block the rain. We stop on the road, pulling over, to take a photograph of a fabulous sunset: it's blue and orange and yellow or pink, in concentric circles on the horizon. A vehicle pulls up, and my high school math teacher Ray Banks gets out. He walks towards us and goes into the outhouse that is next to us on the side of the road. I say hi to him as he passes. I aim my camera at the sunset. Through the shutter I see a list or chart of all the really big (20 pounds or more) northern pike that my grandpa Redding has caught. I then see different parts of grandpa, and I take a photograph of him lying on a table having surgery, in which a metal tool is being removed from his stomach. This may be a drill bit. Ray loosened the tie down rope holding the two canoes on our vehicle as he walked by. We'll have to retie it. I don't mind: we'll just have to redo it, but Ray seems bad about it. After I take the photograph my film rewinds. I open the back and the roll of film has a piece of the starter strip sticking out, like it's a new roll, even though it's used up. I think this must be because after it was rewound I turned the camera ""on"" again before removing the old film, so it advanced again. Ray Banks is then grandpa Redding, and he walks to his old blue car, which he says is a '66, and still running. I tell him my truck only has 50,000 miles. HE comes over and looks at the odometer, which reads 57,xxx. My dad is there. We think of leaving the car and riding bicycles. I think of my brother Wally's road bicycle in the basement at home. My dad gives me a very large wooden bowl, nicely carved. He says he wants to reward Wally and I for our academic work. Maybe at Christmas time, he says."
"1119"	"(09/11/1997)"	"Ride To Florida On Highway 2 I'm at the Oak Valley Bank. I go out the south door, picking up a jar a salsa and a man who needs a ride. We get into my truck. He needs a ride to Florida, he says, and that we should get on Highway 2. I go west at first, thinking I'm going east, but knowing I'm going in the wrong direction. Then I go east, and it seems right. We are back at the Whitman house. My roommate Stephen Ramos' car, a light blue Monte Carlo, is parked on the side of the road, and is dented and smashed up. Another car with its engine missing is there. The engine has been stripped and stolen. The man has an old school bus parked there. I tell he should get the title and sell it to me for 10 or 20 bucks and I'll junk it for him. He wants a car to drive, and is thinking about taking the engine out of Stephen's car and fixing up the body of the other car, and combining the two. That would be a big project: a lot of work."
"1120"	"(09/11/1997)"	"The Zelling's Big Pike I'm at a lake with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling. Tim has caught a big fish that looks like a cross between a walleye and a bass. It is strung up on the dock. It is a walleye, I think, but has a huge mouth and is gray and black in color. Niles landed a big eight or 10-pound northern pike. Tim hooks into one on the dock. I go out and net it as he gets in near. Niles' fish is in the net, and then I net Tim's. It is also a big pike: six or eight pounds. We're happy when I net the second fish: we got two big ones! They hold their big pike up and I take a photograph. I am confused as to who caught which fish."
"1121"	"(09/11/1997)"	"Crazy Paintbrush Man I talk with my sister Ramona about Princess Diana's death. We're in the stairwell going to the basement. At the bottom of the steps is the wreckage from Diana's accident. There is a bullet hole in the wreckage that glows orangish-gold in color. All the wreckage fades black, but I see the bullet hold that looks like this: [diamond shape] , but with rounded side edges, keeping the top and bottom edges pointy. I know her death has been a murder. I walk out the front or hour house. I'm leery of things because of the murder. A car pulls up along the curb. I'm leaving, but am suspicious of it so I go over to see what the man wants. The man sticks his head out of the sunroof and says he wants ""pows"", which I know are caffeine pills. I say, ""Okay, pull over."" He doesn't pull over right away. When he does pull over, he runs away. His car is parked in the front driveway behind my truck. I threaten to push it back into the street by backing into it with my truck, if he doesn't come here. He is the ""crazy paintbrush man"", I know. He runs all over our yard and house. I chase him, yelling out for others to help me. Ramona, my mom, and grandpa Redding all see me chasing him and yelling for help to stop him. I chase him over past our neighbor's house. I jump on their porch and run across it, chasing him. He is dangerous: I see him as loony, unstable, and threatening. We all chase him. I catch him with help from others. Ramona and I corner him by a tree, and a clothesline is there. I get tangled up in the clothesline as I try to grab him, especially the little finger on my right hand. I catch him. He talks about catching a big northern pike. I rip him apart: he is a clothespin. I eat him, chewing up the clothespin, chewing up the metal and the wood. He is a crazy, dancing, loony, happy man: a fruitcake!"
"1122"	"(09/12/1997)"	"Hitting On Melanie I'm with my friend Melanie McDyss. I walk with her a ways, maybe to her house. As we walk I court her very subtly: dropping hints and lines that allude to use having a sexual encounter."
"1123"	"(09/12/1997)"	"Dinner With Violet I am eating dinner with my family at home. My brother Wally, his girlfriend Violet Valley, and Violet's brother arrive late. Violet has a small frame. She is very thin and athletic looking in stature. We all move to make room for them at the end of the table."
"1124"	"(09/12/1997)"	"Scrap Leftover Desserts I'm eating dinner with my uncle Rusty Redding and his family. We're nearly finished. I clear off some plates, including my aunt Sheila's, which still has food on it. I scrape off the plate, and scrape the last part into a big bag or bin. Rusty says that this bin full of scraps and leftovers will be cooked and reused as a dessert. As I leave with others, a try of dessert cookie-like items is presented to us. We take some. It's raining when we leave. We turn around because we forgot to drop off, or do something with my cousin Rich Redding. The family is playing basketball inside when we get back."
"1125"	"(09/12/1997)"	"Professional Raccoon Hunter I'm fishing for carp with my friends the Ramos'. We don't catch any big ones. Franco Ramos is a professional raccoon hunter. He hunts from a boat with a dog. We quit fishing there and follow a guide boat with an arrow on it, like a flashing orange road construction arrow. The boat leads several boats, and when it gets too far ahead of the other boats it makes a looping circle, and the boats that were following go on past the guide boat. Franco says we need to be ready to go up to 65 miles per hour. My roommate Stephen Ramos drives the boat, while Franco gives directions. We jump over trees and rocks and break through windows as we go. I'm on the bow. I fall out of the boat when a big bump happens, but I hang onto the bow and swing around and get in the other side of the boat. We come to a shallow bay. It is very thick with weeds on the edges but clear on the inside. We go into the clear area. There are a couple other boats there. I see two smallmouth bass. I cast a spinnerbait by them. They follow it a bit but don't hit it. I know this big yellow and orange spinnerbait is not the ideal lure but don't want to take the time to change lures. I cast several times near them, but don't get them to hit."
"1126"	"(09/13/1997)"	"Six Point Buck I'm deer hunting with others. I have shot a six-point buck. It's not too big, but it's okay. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. He has shot a doe. I ask Bubba if he'll show me how to butcher my deer. I might use my fillet knife to cut it up."
"1127"	"(09/14/1997)"	"Me, Returning Donor I'm at the plasma donation center. I'm there late. The cut-off time for new or returning donors is 6:00, and it's now 6:45 or so. I get in anyways. They talk to me about doing some kind of a stick or line test of some sort. I reply that I can do a Rorschach test whenever I want, and that their request is silly. I eat out of a bin of quick oatmeal. In it are oats and dried fruit. The finger prick for blood is unusually aversive to me: I fear it."
"1128"	"(09/14/1997)"	"Talking With Misty Ryan I see my grade school classmate Misty Ryan in the alley behind my home. We talk, and head towards my house. She is tame: docile. I am not too impressed by her, but am just being nice."
"1129"	"(09/14/1997)"	"Subduing Norman I'm at a boat landing where many people are. I'm involved with others having something to do with drugs. A man drives his car into the water until it is two or three feet deep in order to get his boat and trailer on the dock. My roommate Norman Noman is there. He turns his back on others and I for money. His younger brother, who is black, also does this. They betray others and I. I'm quick to point my finger at Norman for what he's done. Something happens with a boat on shore that needs to be pulled up farther. A man is there dressed in light brown. He is an authority, able to punish or deal with Norman. I subdue Norman. I physically hold him, wrapping him up with my arms and legs, so that he can't get away. I obtain Norman's gun, which I put in my back pocket. He is passive. He fells that I'm overreacting and does nothing to try to get away. I get others to help me hunt down and subdue Norman's brother. We're in a very populated area, a big gathering which seems to be in a parking lot. The people there seem to be country folks: hicks. There's a group of teenage girls that think I'm gay. I know this because I have my arm around Norman. Others and I sneak around, trying to spot Norman's brother, who is at large. This whole time I have my arms and legs wrapped around Norman so he won't get away. I see his brother cross an opening and alert others to this. We all pursue him. He may have a hostage, who is my high school classmate Nelson Eastman. The brother has a gun. My classmates Tim Zelling and Sherman Andrews help me follow him. I haul Norman with me. He whines about money and drugs. I say to him that he can have all the marijuana and the money: it's not about that! He says, ""Damn! I sold burgers for a buck!..."" He is trying to get sympathy. All that he values is money: he just doesn't get it. Sherman finds Norman's brother on the roof of a building. Sherman tells me the brother has a gun, and he is crying, like he has given up. I yell for others to go get him, but I don't go myself. No one wants to confront his brother, so I go. I release Norman to Sherman, who will hold him. I remember I have his gun in my back pocket. I take it out. I feel powerful with the gun. I point it at the ledge above me where the roof is, as I climb a ladder up to the roof. I'm anxious, nervous, and scared when I climb. I realize I've been a hypocrite in telling others to go get him, not doing it myself."

"1131"	"(09/15/1997)"	"Suit Of Armor I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson. We go to the house of Josephine Zirbes, a family friend. A female friend of Josephine's answers the door and lets in. We go in and talk with her and Josephine. There is a cat there. We've come to ask for a metal suit of armor. We want to borrow it. Kevin tells Josephine that a suit of armor that we did have let him run really fast and quickly."
"1132"	"(09/15/1997)"	"Seeing Erin Jacobs With Kevin I'm in Tressel with my friend Kevin Simpson. We're driving, towing my boat behind our vehicle. We go to a drive in place where I see my junior high classmate Erin Jacobs working. We go up to buy something. I have some desire to talk to Erin, despite ambivalence. We don't talk. Two men leave with us. We ask them where the mall is. They say they mall is closed, but they will go with us, and one of them has keys to the mall. We drive near the Superhighway 200 exit near Earthton, where the Happy Chef Restaurant is."
"1133"	"(09/15/1997)"	"Family Together I'm at home with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona. It seems that the family is all together. It is fall, and is chilly outside. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. We talk about smoking. I pick my nose and pull out a booger. Kevin and I go to McDonalds to get food for all of us. As we walk form the back door to the front yard my brother Wally comes walking towards us. He is home, surprisingly. We shake hands and hug. I'm very happy to see him. The whole family is home."
"1134"	"(09/15/1997)"	"Buried Alive I'm camping with my friends Kevin Simpson and Tim and Niles Zelling. I put some little stickers near the handle of a fishing rod. We are leaving this place to go to another place. I'm getting some wood wrapped in plastic in case it rains. There is long and short wood wrapped in plastic. I walk with this wood. There is a large steep cliff about 100 yards from where I am. Rocks are falling down the cliff. I think I'm safe from them. More rocks fall as I get wood. There is a big log, like a tree trunk that is leaning up against a log entryway shaped like an upside-down U. A rockslide starts. I hide among the smaller rocks on the side of a smaller cliff ledge. I hope the big rocks will tumble over me and I'll be safe. I realize that the rocks are going to pile up on me, and they may wholly or partially crush me. I won't be able to get out of the rock pile: I will be buried alive, or maybe dead, by the avalanche of rocks. I feel scared, and doomed."
"1135"	"(09/15/1997)"	"Hanging Myself By a Helmet I'm in a trailer home. I hang myself by a construction helmet. The helmet is stuck to my head and there is something attached to the top of it: a rope and I think a pulley system so that when I pull the rope down I lift myself up off the ground, stuck to my helmet, which is seemingly cemented to my head. I seem to be on Carter School playground in Oak Valley. I take a photograph or two young black girls. The battery in my camera runs out: it is dead. At first I had straps around my arms to hang myself, then it was just the helmet."
"1136"	"(09/15/1997)"	"Bagel Store I'm in line in a bagel store. As I near the counter there are women on the side, kind of in front of me. I feel it is unclear to me who was in line first, so I motion to them and say, ""Go ahead."" They act righteous, and say that they were there first and they will go ahead. I feel dumb for offering to let them go first, since they said they were first. I get two bagels: one with blueberry and one with apricot jam. After they're prepared, a woman working there submerges the bagels in water to cut them. I get some English muffins to carry the bagels on top of."
"1137"	"(09/15/1997)"	"Digging A Hole At Fishing Haven I'm on Fishing Haven property, on the 15-Mile property on the hill side of the driveway. I'm back in the woods 50 feet from the driveway digging a hole with a shovel. I move leaves, dirt, and lots of worms. I have branch clippers too. A person is coming up the driveway. I see only their legs under the tree branches at first, and then he or she comes into view. It's a young man with a short red beard. At first I think it's my old roommate Sean Williams. I say hi, friendly, and then see it's my former boss Mike Hollow. He tells me to move my things and pick up the clippers and leave. I show him that the cardboard box I was digging from isn't on some plants, which is why he told me to move it. I ask him why he doesn't respect people. He replies with a question about my respect for him. I know I did maintain respect for him until he became unworthy of it. I walk down the path to the driveway. Mike follows slowly. I tell him that in his dream the skeleton is a part of him, and if he doesn't know that by now he must be pretty ignorant. He doesn't respond, but acts stern and silent, like he knows best. I can't find the clippers, and ask Mike in a friendly manner, which is quite an abrupt shift from my stern words a moment earlier, if they are back near the trail. He doesn't answer. I think I must have walked by them."
"1138"	"(09/17/1997)"	"Scented Pages I'm with others in a forested area. There is a suggestion to use pages from some magazines we have as bait, and to add scent to try to attract animals. I look through a magazine aimed at the teenage girl crowd. I think there has to be a good picture to add scent to that is not plain. There is a two-page picture of a woman, viewed from the side, an all fours. She is partially naked, and her butt is raised in the air. The picture or advertisement has something to do with butt sex, and that is what it reminds me of."
"1139"	"(09/17/1997)"	"Rival Poker I'm playing poker at home in the kitchen with some guys from high school. Among them are Lyle Zeffman, Gino Teavor, Tony Kramer, Binky Ahmed, and Pat Mareck. Just as we are starting to play our classmate Daryl Yeller comes in. Daryl wants to sit at the end of the table. It is as if I am preventing him from doing this, even though I'm not sitting at the end. I'm sitting next to Lyle on a piano bench, which leaves only a couple inches between the bench and the table: not enough room for my legs. Lyle doesn't really want me to sit there: he doesn't like me. I think our classmate John Kulik may be there as well. There is great tension and mistrust among us because of the fear that one will cheat. We're not friends. It's a greedy atmosphere: everyone, including me, for themselves. To begin, I pull out a handful of chips from my pocket. I didn't pay for them. They are extra chips, but no one knows that so I take them as mine, cheating. The first hand is dealt, and all the cards are face up. The game is five-card stud. I get dealt a straight, and I pick up my cards like I would to play a regular hand. They guy before me bets one chip. I'm unsure about how this game is being played. I have six cards. There is a wildcard too, which changes with each player. In my case the wildcard is a five. I have three 6's, which I think is a pretty good five-card stud hand. If I can go out by using five of the six cards in my hand, I win, and get the pot. I lay down my 5's and 6's. I think I'll have five 6's and will blow everyone away. But I have only four 6's when I get them down, which is still an unreal hand, but I didn't use all five cards. I pick them back up, and everyone knows I have a good hand, once again (they saw the straight I was dealt initially). I manage to make a straight out of my hand by going Ace-6-2-3-4-5, where fives are wild. I know this isn't legal, but no one catches it. If I were to use the five as a two, then the six wouldn't match up after the four, and I would need to use six cards. I win. There is a feeling that I have betrayed all the guys. Lyle won't hand me the cards, even though it's my turn to deal. He puts them under the table. I criticize and yell at him for this. My mom offers to deal a round of hands for everyone, but the guys don't like this."
"1140"	"(09/20/1997)"	"Lucid Mary Monroe I go into a building which is a house-like place where some young women live. They are playing ping-pong. It's late in the evening. I go to see my advisor Mary Monroe. She isn't in her office. I wait for her. She comes and I ask her a question. I feel dumb and immature: like I am dependent on her. Whatever it is I asked her is totally up to me, which I know, but still want affirmation from Mary. I leave, feeling dumb, and say I'm going to work on a dream, even though I'm not going to: that is just an excuse for me not needing to be with her anymore. I leave the building, where there is a party going on. People don't like me. People are mad at me, and I think they'll chase me. I'm on the street in Wilmerton that runs past Jim's Bait Store. I fly and float. I think I am partially awake, and this experience must be what people describe when they say they were half awake and half asleep. I realize I'm dreaming. I focus on remaining flying, trying not to wake up. I float down past downtown. I know I am moving. It is as if I push myself by the buildings using my vision, by looking at the buildings."
"1141"	"(09/20/1997)"	"Autofellatio 11 I'm dancing with my friend Bill Hanson, his girlfriend Ingrid Dorth, and our classmate Erin. There is a sheet or blanket around us as we dance very close to each other, partially wrapped up in the blanket. I seem to be having sex. I know I am dreaming and I want to see if I can ejaculate just from the rhythmic movement of my body, which is in rhythm with a fan. It's like touch less masturbation. I give myself fellatio."
"1142"	"(09/21/1997)"	"Stephanie Peterson A woman I just met last at our party named Stephanie Peterson stops by our house with a mini green and white basketball. She is on her way home from work at the malt shop. We talk a bit. I tell her to hold on a minute and I'll grab my shoes and we can go play basketball. She has long curly blond hair. We talk about my roommates Stephen Ramos, Norman Noman, and Jack Thigpen. I tell her they're all gone, on dates. She seems interested in Jack. I really want to spend time with her, to get to know her better. I imagine, or think, that the basketball court is outdoors. I might be able to show off and dunk the mini ball."
"1143"	"(09/21/1997)"	"Very Effective Snow Removing Machine I'm in the Brimson recycling room, which is different. It is smaller: a tiny basement-like area. There are stairs running down to it. There is a kit there for a ""very effective snow-removing machine"". Many recycling employees are gathering in their crews. I talk to a first-year student named Mary, who has short, dark hair. She may be a lead worker. She is bossy and assertive. She doesn't really know that I'm the head of the recycling organization. I don't let on that I have any authority, I just relax and stand around. Jim Suds and Mark Samson are there. My friend Nat Miller is there. He has $6.00 and gives me four quarters. It's about time to go so I whistle and shout and in a moment people are filing up the stairs on their way to work. I feel like I may be abusing my power, but I get no hassle from anyone. Everyone just goes to work compliantly."
"1144"	"(09/21/1997)"	"Sarah Broud Dies I'm hunting on private land in the Big Resort Area. There are cabins and a road there. My neighbor Alvin Broud and his children drive by on the road. I know they have a cabin, but I didn't know it was up here. I walk back. It seems I am walking from my alley (which may be the road) around the south side of the house. I walk by windows. Ricky and Alan Broud see me. I wave. They look like they think I shouldn't be there. There is a huge tree with a thick trunk. The trunk is cut or worn in a way so the tree is leaning. I think the tree is in Broud's yard. I tell Alvin he has a leaning tree on his property, though it may be on our property, I realize. I see a photograph of my mom when she was younger. She had light, blondish hair: no gray hair. She is with her friend Kate Dancer in the photograph. My mom tells me that Sarah Broud died yesterday. Alvin is there and we're in the kitchen. There is no break in the conversation, as if no one is sad that Sarah has died. I know they are sad, but I'm not, so I don't react. I'm eating sweet corn with barbeque sauce on it. Some of the kernels are really hard. Alvin and my mom talk and tell me about airplane discounts, and say that people get credit for flying now, like a free flight with one paid or a free $50 food certificate (which may be for use on the plane). I take care of Ricky and Alan at their house. They eat sliced cheese."
"1145"	"(09/21/1997)"	"Sun Sets In The South I'm canoeing in the Big Resort Area with others in one or two other canoes behind me. We're on a lake in the late afternoon or evening. We are camping on an island. The lake is K_____ ( I forget). I point to the west, saying that's where the car is from us. I say it's three miles, but later say it is 10 miles. The island we're camping on is in front of us, to the north. The sun would seem to be setting in the south, or I'm mixed up! I lead the three canoes into a stream and paddle up it until I get to a bald tree trunk, which has fallen, across the stream. I want to go beyond it to make sure our portage is there before we all cross over the trunk. I get out of my canoe, stand on the trunk, and move my canoe to the other side of the tree trunk. My coworker Carol Flanders is behind me. I tell her not to cross until I've found the portage, just so I'm sure it is there."
"1146"	"(09/21/1997)"	"Twin Babies In Boxes I'm back at Armstrong High School for a basketball featuring Armstrong versus Rival High School. It's winter, and I'm in the northeast parking lot. I have driven there with my parents. We have twin babies with us. They are in shoeboxes in the vehicle, which may be a mini-van. My dad wants to check the twin's diapers to see if they urinated before we go into the game. I start to do this, but it is bitter cold: windy and well below zero. There is a sheet of paper on top of the first box. As I start to remove the paper I say to my dad that maybe we should do this inside, out of the cold. He agrees. I carry the twins in. I think one is male and one is female. I go in the athletic doors. The woman selling tickets is my neighbor Wanda Stalk, or my aunt Sheila Redding. I ask her if she has sold a lot of tickets. She hasn't, I think. I tell her we sold a lot of tickets last night. By that I mean we sold a lot of cups for beer at our house party. My uncle Rusty Redding is there smoking a cigarette. I give my dad the babies, which are now each in a tennis shoe. They are small. I can't see them when I look into the shoe, but can only see the clothes surrounding them. I pay the woman with a $5 bill. She gives me $2 in change. I hear the buzzer: the game has started. I'm wearing either snow boots or roller blades. I run into the gymnasium, going down the hall past the maintenance area. The hallway opens up into the gymnasium after a quick left turn. As I enter one team shoots a three-pointer from what would be out-of-bounds, on the other side of the backboard. It goes in and is counted. There is a large space of about 30 feet between the bleachers and the court. I sit by myself on the second row of the ""student"" section. I see my cousins Rich, Melvin, and Melissa Redding. Armstrong does well. My old neighbor Tim Robbins and another kid yell at me to come sit with them up near the top of the bleachers. I do this, though I'd rather sit by myself. Next to us are two guys doing the Rocker High School basketball radio show. Armstrong does well, and we cheer. Several parents who seem to be from Rival High School look up at us with disdain. They frown on us and look down upon us, maybe because we vocally support the team. Two of them are my old teammate's father, Todd Kecker, and a person from Rival High School, Alex Zadra. I go down and sit right next to them: in the middle of them. I ask them why they're being so belligerent. I sit and talk with them, calmly. They don't want me there. The two people are not Todd and Alex, but two men I don't know. The game we're watching is a junior varsity game between Rapidville and Holy High School, but it seems one game is Armstrong versus Rival. These players are not varsity caliber. I'm confused as to who is who, and which team is which, because I don't recognize anyone. I don't know who to cheer for. My high school friend Sam Kingsley and his old girlfriend Janelle West are there. Sam is a sitting a few rows down from me. He says hi. I feel dumb, as if I had been ignoring him, which I hadn't been: I just didn't know he was there. Had I known, I would have liked to ignore him. I say hi and we talk. He is in school in Metropolis, but not at the community college because they didn't give him enough financial aid. He attends a different school named Boris. He says it's going okay. I tell him to give me his phone number. I express happiness when he tells me his classes are going well, and this surprises him, because he thinks I wouldn't care."
"1147"	"(09/21/1997)"	"Three Blizzards For $3.33 I'm in Wilmerton on Roundabout Way at the intersection with Friends Ave, which I know is 15th Street, by Scott Junior High. A black man is there. He is going to Hawaii and needs a ride to the airport. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. He and I argue over the directions we are going to give this man on how to get to the airport. Bubba wants to direct him down 19th Avenue, even though there are a lot of stop signs, and actually because there are a lot of stop signs, because he has concerns about the man's driving ability. The man takes a taxi. My advisor Mary Monroe is there. She is the director or boss. My friend Nat Miller is on the side of the road, waiting in a yellow cab. Several people are in the cab with him. He is getting off work, or getting easy work, since he gets to drive the cab. I may be his co-worker. I tell the man it's going to take at least 1.5 hours to get to the airport, which may not be enough time for him since he indicates he needs to be there in 10 minutes. I'm on a school bus with Mary, my friend Norman Noman, and others. A large man asks a question about ""When would be the best time to...?"" I cut him off and say, ""Now"". He was either asking the best time to eat at Dairy Queen or the best time to go to the bathroom. In either case, the answer is now. We all get out of the bus. It costs $3.33 for three Blizzards at Dairy Queen, and one gets a free Blizzard as well, so Norman and I decide to do this and each eat two Blizzards. He gets Heath flavor as his first one and tells the worker to put a lot of Heath in it. I'm getting Heath flavor for one of my two Blizzards as well."
"1148"	"(09/22/1997)"	"Allergic To Smoke I'm in a place where there are many high-class model or sorority women all made up with make up, etc. I'm sitting reading a magazine advertisement, which is a single page. I flip the page over, again and again, and keep reading different advertisements. A short woman with chin length dark straight hair comes up to me. She says something indicating she thinks I'm very sexy. She pulls out a cigarette and asks me for a light. I say I don't smoke, implying that I don't have a light. She says something indicating she thinks it's not cool that I don't smoke. She asks me if I'm allergic to smoke. My nose is stuffed up and running. I wipe my nose and blow my nose a lot, which I think is not cool since there is a physically attractive woman right next to me who is interested in me. I say I might be allergic to smoke but I don't know: I've never been to a doctor for it. I pause before indicating that I haven't gone to a doctor specifically for a smoke allergy. Because I pause, she understands or thinks I'm saying that I've never been to a doctor in my life, period! My friend Norman Noman is there. He thinks that this woman is cute. She asks if anyone wants a glass of water. I say that I'd love one. I think of chewing gum because I haven't brushed my teeth yet today. I kiss the woman. I pull down her pants have sex with her from behind as she bends over. I ejaculate quickly. Then I'm standing on the side of her and I rub her clitoris with my finger. She is then on her back with her legs up and we have sex. When I feel that I'm going to ejaculate I pull my penis out and put it up near her mouth. She gives me fellatio briefly, and I ejaculate into her mouth. She clears her throat loudly and spits the semen out. She isn't tactful and is clearly there just for the sex. When I ejaculated the second time I felt a strong need to urinate, and I may have urinated a small amount immediately following the ejaculation. After I ejaculate I put my penis, which is still erect, back in her vagina and continue thrusting."

I shave around my genitals. I use a pick to comb the largest remaining patch of pubic hair, which is right above my genitals. I frill or comb the hair, it looks kind of like dread locks."

Many people are having a night for drinking Rolling Rock beer. I join in and say I'll drink (15 Rolling Rocks???) Someone is recording the number of beers that everyone wants. It costs five dollars for a 12-pack, which I think is cheap. I change my mind and say to Emerald that I would sleep in the same bed with a woman. I think may do this with intentions of sleeping with her in the back of my mind."

I'm not attracted to any of the women in the photograph. The women in the photograph may show up and look much better in real life! I have a business card stuck below my lower lip. I think my third grade teacher Liza Minikel may be there. I leave to deliver something. My grade school friends Jerry Kasper and Patrick Bergman are there. My mom's station wagon is parked by the bowling alley. We go by there. There may be others with us that go in or near the bowling alley. We may be delivering a pizza."

The line on my reel gets tangled. I take off the spool from the reel, untangle the line, and then cast. I didn't reattach the spool to the reel so the spool is cast out into the water with the line! I quickly start reeling in line to recover the spool. [Note: This is impossible. The spool needs to be on the reel to recover line] People come swimming up to our canoe. There are four women among them, including my high school classmate Josie Heck and my roommate's ex-girlfriend Brandy Roberts. They sit on the front of the canoe next to me. One of them says I smell bad. I think that she means my breath is bad, but then realize she means my body odor. Kevin and I laugh at her disgust. They jump off the side of the canoe. Kevin and I are on land. My friend Melanie McDyss is there, wearing a skirt. We talk. Music starts playing. Melanie says she wants to be like Kevin and I: free. I tell her we all have to jump around to the music. We do this and laugh. I fall over, dizzy, and laugh. We are in a long, fenced-in area. A dog and a horse run by. My roommate Stephen Ramos says loudly that I should put my penis in Melanie's butt. Melanie almost hears this, but I don't think she does. I don't want her to hear."

The stairs are tricky: I have to walk on the side ledge of the stairs, not on the stairs themselves. My roommate Stephen Ramos follows me. A man passes us on the stairs. At the top of the stairs are living quarters. There is an open space between two rooms, with two people living in each room. I'm going to live here. There is a stove, two refrigerators, etc., pretty much everything we'll need to live. Two of the men that I'm going to be living with are there. They are stereotypical ""nerds"": big and goofy. We're on the very top floor of the house. It's shaky, and will sway when everyone shifts his weight. I'm leery of living here because it's shaky. There is another set up stairs going down in a corner of the second room. When I first walked in on the ground floor, I saw a set of stairs, which may be these."

My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, friend Nicole Peterson, and a man named Sam or Hal is there, who may be Nicole's boyfriend. My mom is there. They have come to pick someone up who is with us now. We drive away. I drive my mom's station wagon. My truck is there. I have the keys with me. I think Annie will not be able to drive it because I have the keys. I drive, and others follow me in their vehicles. I turn left near where the Stevens' used to live, and may go by Dan Hellman's house. I'm on the service road along the railroad tracks by Dan's house. I'm wearing shiny black dress shoes and a nice shirt. I'm on the ground sliding on some device. I move by kicking my feet, scraping my way along the ground. I scuff the toes of my shiny black shoes as I move. I get near Brownie Bruny's house. I think that I don't want to look like a dork crawling on the ground, so I get up and walk. Mr. Bruny is in the driveway with another person. He tries to give me a shiny black pair of shoes. I tell him I already have a pair, pointing to my feet. He is very persistent in trying to give me the shoes, and may offer me a shirt as well. I keep walking. I go by a house with a big chandelier in its front window. That house seems to have a square feeling."

I'm with Kevin and Stephen in a house I don't recognize. It may be my or Kevin's house. We walk through it and talk. I talk to Kevin about his girlfriend. She has her period. I say they should have sex and he should just wash his sheets, which I know are dark green. I think this because he needs to wash he sheets anyway! Kevin has a book on the man who started making Busch Light beer. At the beginning of the book, the beer bottles have orange labels. There is a funeral in the book next, and then the man who started Busch Light beer."
"1160"	"(09/24/1997)"	"Tickling Holy College Woman I'm in a basement study room in the Brimson library with my roommate Stephen Ramos, classmate Shawn Tryner, and others. They are being loud: repeatedly slamming the door. I get mad at them and tell them to shut up. Two librarians come down and kick us out. I'm angry because I didn't' do anything wrong, and tried to get the others to calm down. As I pick up my things to leave, I smart off to the librarians and tell them to kiss my ass. I spill a mug of tea on the floor and feel stupid. I wipe the tea up, but it is going to leave a stain. I shrug this off, and am on my way. My classmate Heather Madly is outside the study room. The woman from Holy University who is in my religion class is on the floor. Her leg is sticking up. We flirt, and I tickle her foot. I feel foolish and immature after I stop ticking her. She wants to use the phone."

They are long, but I'm not sure the arms will be long enough. With me in the store is a woman who may be Stephanie Peterson, a woman I'd like to date at Brimson."
"1162"	"(09/25/1997)"	"Nodes Of Ranvier I'm in my front yard at home. It's Christmas time, and may be Christmas Eve. It's dark. There is about six inches of fresh powdery snow on the ground. I'm not wearing a shirt. I may be going skiing later tonight. I have pimples on my body, which may be on my right half on my back and hip. I look at or see photographs of when I was younger. There are many photographs of me with fish, when I'm fishing. There are photographs of me playing in the snow when I was little, and riding a bicycle on the front sidewalk in six inches of fresh snow without a shirt on. I fell in the snow. It is very calm, still, and peaceful outside. I hear a car coming up the hill on Home Avenue. I walk up onto the porch to get out of view. One the porch I look at tracings or carvings in the snow, almost as if I'm paging though a big book, four feet tall and wide, and on each page is a fresh six-inch layer of snow with something traced into it. I go inside. A man and a woman are on the sidewalk arguing. I try to close the front door, which swings like it's a 270-degree angle-swinging door. The door won't latch. I try to adjust it and shove it closed. The man and the woman, who is his girlfriend, continue to argue. He is forceful, belligerent, and seems to be an abusive man. He batters her. They come into our yard, around back of the house. I get on the phone. It rings where my mom was; my mom is now at church. My aunts Willow and Sherry Redding are at the place where the phone is ringing. One of them picks it up. I'm going to hang up because I didn't intend to call them. But I don't hang up because they may know it is I calling, or I don't want to alarm them. I quickly tell them the problem of the people arguing in our yard, and tell them I'm going to call 911. I run back and lock the old wood back door. It has two locks. The couple argues near the door. My sister Ramona wakes up. I see her scurry across the back yard in fear. I turn the light to the back yard on. Ramona comes into the garage from the outside door. The huge wooden garage door is on the east side of the garage. I try to lock the inside garage door that leads into the kitchen after I take all the keys that are hanging in the garage. The woman who was arguing doesn't want me to call the police, which I am about to do as soon as I get the inside garage door locked. She comes towards me; she is outside the big wooden garage door. She tells me not to call the police, and she says my name. It's tough to get the inside door locked. I pull it tight, slamming it, and it locks. Ramona is ready to go. I run upstairs with the cordless phone, call 911, and grab my boots. A man answers. I tell him people are in our yard fighting, and they're going to the Nodes Of Ranvier. He says calmly that he's dispatching the police now."

The character Barney from the television show The Simpsons and an old woman are there. They may be involved in the attempted suicide. We chase someone on the motorcycle, and then stop at the suicide scene, which had something to do with metal barrels and holes in the ground."

"1166"	"(09/28/1997)"	"Vicious Chipmunk I'm hunting in a house. The house is like a church. My friend Jack Thigpen is there, also hunting. He yells for me to hurry over to him so we can hunt: he wants me to back him up. I hurry over to him and we hunt. He shoots and maims a chipmunk. I point my gun at it, and it squirms. I don't shoot it because Jack wants to shoot it, so I refrain from doing so while keeping the chipmunk in the sight of my handgun. The chipmunk jumps on my shin and bites me, drawing blood. I grab hold of it and pull it off my leg. I throw it against a wall, killing it. My leg is bloody. I yell for Jack or my roommate Stephen Ramos to get me some hydrogen peroxide, fast! Jack is going to call his mother, who is a nurse, to see what I should do about the bite."
"1167"	"(09/29/1997)"	"Attempted Blackmail I see my ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter. She says to me, ""Hey, weren't you chasing after me for a week at the beginning of last year?"" Something may be said or implied regarding the letter I wrote to her ending our relationship, how it was broken off, and something may be said or implied about my roommate Stephen Ramos. I'm taken back when she says this, and feel that I need to clarify or assert that yes, I did pursue her last year (it was actually the end not the beginning of the school year), but I am not going to this year. She says this with a bit of cunningness and manipulation, as if it is a blackmail or threat to get me to change my ways."
"1168"	"(09/30/1997)"	"A Dream Interpreted I leave home abruptly. I've had an argument with my mom and am mad at her. I'm in a place that seems to be near my friends the Puffy's house in Oak Valley. They are serving spaghetti or pizza there. My classmate from Brimson Leslie Shell, my former boss Mike Hollow, and my coworker Carol Flanders are there. Carol tries to get me to stay. I get mad and belligerent and punch people. I throw Carol aside and leave. I either didn't get any food or did get food and didn't want it. I'm outside the building, and it is snowing: a blizzard. I think Mike may follow me and bring me back, so I run away. I have my long striped hat with me and I think my green coat. Two older men are jogging out in the snow. They may be wearing shorts or tee shirts: they are under-dressed. I worry about Mike recognizing me. There are six to eight inches of fresh snow, and it's accumulating fast. I walk towards the lumber store. The snow is drifting. A vehicle approaches going fast in the deep snow. I get out of the way. I don't know if the driver sees me. If the driver didn't and then suddenly did, they might hit the brakes and skid, hitting me. Another vehicle approaches from the south from the other side of the railroad tracks. I walk in snow four or five feet deep, engulfed in snow. I hope the vehicle goes by and doesn't recognize me. I think of walking down by the railroad tracks but I don't want to go. I get by the intersection of Home Avenue and Main Street. There is much less snow there, but it is still snowing hard. As I walk, I remember I had a dream, and I interpret it as I walk. It has manifest symbols of death and garbage. In interpret it to be about me changing. I make some sense out of it: make some good connections. I walk home though the alley. The snow is gone, and the ground is saturated, sloppy wet. I walk in the back door at home. Mom and my sister Ramona are baking cookies. My brother Wally is staying at the Holiday Inn for one night and then leaving town. Ramona reprimands me a bit sarcastically. She tells me that I look like a little boy. I say to her that, ""I can do anything I want"". My mom is not in the kitchen. I haven't seen her yet. I'm nervous about seeing her because I'm not sure how she'll react to seeing me. It's 8:44pm and is still light outside. It is all wet out."
"1169"	"(09/30/1997)"	"Infant Series The penalty for ""Sugi"", which is something that I am familiar with though the spelling or pronunciation of the word may be different from the word I know, is being raised from 60 to 80. This is for forced sexual acts, phallic acts. I'm in a scene where there is a big pile of lumber, including 1.5 inch by 4-inch boards, with cards in the pile or in the boards. Something is being built. I pull out some lumber halfway from the stack. The ends of these boards will serve to hold other boards while they're being cut. A man asks how to cut the boards. I understand how. There is a sexual scene that may be a rape. There is a lot of sex in this scene and it may be a crime. The police are there and they this man questions. The man says he is innocent, and wants to convince others of his innocence. This scene may be associated with Wonkers Hall at Brimson. I'm working in the recycling room at Brimson. There is a man working in the room. I write a note with a blue highlighter that says I'll be here to work two shifts, and I write the days down. I tell the man working I'll be back within the hour, and I leave, leaving the note, and take a gray recycling barrel. My coworkers Trevor Adams and another supervisor are there working. I walk towards Tea Hall on the sidewalk. There is a man working for the recycling organization picking up recyclables down by the 77 Brimson House. There are full recycling bins outside the dorms that are ready to be picked up. I walk up the steps to Tea Hall. My classmate Annette Trantor is on the steps with her boyfriend. I say something like, ""It's the birthday girl."" I'm flirting with her. She greets me unenthusiastically. This couple is dressed up in Halloween costumes that are supposed to be scary. I walk inside the dorm and turn left to the stairs. There is an infant, a toddler, a baby, and other small children to age four or five. They may be watching television. I scare them inadvertently as I walk by with my barrel. I walk up many old stairs, like I'm in Wonkers Hall, dragging my barrel. I get to the second or third floor and there is a lot of recycling in the stairwell area. There is a garbage can full of glass and a cardboard box of glass. I'm going to try to fit it all in my barrel. There is a small cat there. It is dark in color, thin, and furry. It is very soft and tender. It is roaming around, jumping up at times like it is trying to get out of something. I'm scared of being bitten or scratched by the cat. I want to befriend it because it is cute. I pick it up and put it down after a short time, repeatedly. Two custodial women walk by. They ask something or I say something, and we start talking about my roommate Stephen Ramos. I say he works for the recycling organization. They remember who he is and say, no, that he works for the custodial department. I say okay. I tell them he's my roommate and sometimes I get mixed up because we see each other when we work. I'm covering something up, as if I lied and had to recover."
"1170"	"(10/01/1997)"	"Hammer War My former coworkers Amy Rancher and Jenny, and a sibling of theirs (they seem to be sisters) are flying back to Hawaii, which may be where they're from. Their father is going too, but he isn't present. It's early morning in the winter, and is dark out, about 2:00 or 3:00am. I drive in my mom's car with Amy and their siblings as if we are getting ready to go to the airport. I drive by the Baseball Pub and then go home. Jenny is not out of bed. She is at a different house than mine. I was supposed to get her but she wasn't awake. They're not leaving yet: not flying out for a day or two. Their father is not with us. I'm at home talking to my mom about arrangements for getting them to the airport. I say to her that I should go and get Jenny, who seems to be in an apartment over by Smith School. This is so she is with us in case they need to leave for Hawaii in a hurry. My mom agrees. I suggest that they all stay at our house tonight, and she again agrees. My motive, which undermines these suggestions, is to have a sexual encounter with Amy. I think Jenny and the siblings can sleep in the living room, head to toe in a square shape, but I want Amy to sleep in my room. She stayed in my room the night before. Their father is there. He has a white and gray beard that is neatly trimmed. He is about 5'8"", and is a sturdy man. Someone is giving dance lessons. This man, my mom, and a small boy are dancing in the kitchen at home. I'm in my Religions In America class. Amy and Jenny are in the class, and are black. The teacher doesn't like them talking, and she reprimands them. Class gets out early. I stay after to talk with the teacher: I am unhappy with her. She is having her photograph taken posing with some items. My friends Fran Susse and Anna Woods are there. It may be the spring semester of 1998, after I have gotten back from my study abroad and Fran is back from her semester off. They ask for my phone number. I give it to them, and say it's the only one they'll ever need. I realize how pretentious that sounds, even though I was just joking. I'm canoeing with a person in the Big Resort Area. The person may be Ken Blast, my schoolmate at Brimson. He has never been here before. We're on Eagle Lake, but it seems to be a different lake that is more open. We're supposed to meet others, but it is not clear where they will meet us. They are coming later. We come to an area with a brick wall surrounding a swimming pool. I say to him that this isn't what the Big Resort Area is like. I'm in a garage. I see my friend Kevin Simpson's canoe overhead in the rafters with the paddles stuck in between the seats and cross bars. I think of calling Fishing Haven and asking them to call the place where the others are, to tell them where to meet us. It's Friday the 13th. I'm at some sort of a camp or cabin area with others. Army soldiers come to protect us from bugs. When I first see the soldiers I chuckle: they are here to protect us by killing bugs! We are in a vacation area where there are many couples. Amy and Jenny are there. I know people are going to be killed because it's Friday the 13th. Someone will be killing people one by one, like in the movie. I hope Amy is the last person alive so we can have a sexual encounter. She might be the first person killed. A boy gets killed or mauled from a lawn mower. I'm in shallow water on a beach that is at a considerable incline. It's dark out. Soldiers are near the top of the beach shining lights down towards me. My classmate Eric Dole is among them. I evade their lights. It is then light outside. There is a sign language interpreter there, a group leader, the soldiers, and myself. They all see me. There is some sort of interaction, specifically involving the signer. There is an older man and woman. Something happens with some sort of collar or synthetic strip that may have Velcro. The strip is on the side of a tree, and when it is closed to form a circle like a bracelet some sort of poison is released. By pressing or having this collar-like strip against their neck, the old man and woman die: they're poisoned. The woman's face turns blue, orange, and brown. A boy has a dream of who will be killed next: the third person. The dream predicts that the boy's mother will be killed. His mother stifles the expression of that dream. A large group of soldiers shoot automatic rifles at her. I see a small white figure, which is the mother, and many black dots around her, which are the bullets. One bullet hits her right in the center of the chest. The people retaliate against the killing, and there is a war with the soldiers. I am with the people that are retaliating. One of us throws two red grenade-like objects at the soldiers. An Asian man in a purple suit picks up one grenade and throws it into the water. The second grenade is going to explode, so I take cover from the flames that I know will soon be around my by stepping into a shed. I know the shed will catch fire, and I can go out of it later: I just need to be away from the initial blast. There are a lot of hammers hanging inside the shed. Some of them have nail removers and others have ball heads. I grab them and give my friend Bill Hanson, my mom, and others hammers to fight with. We battle the soldiers. Our opponents also have hammers. I duel with a man: we lock hammers and spar. I hit him repeatedly in the head with a hammer. I think where the most effective place to hit him would be: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, etc. I hit him 15 or 20 times. I feel that he must be in extreme pain. I can't imagine how painful it would be to have your head beat in with a hammer. This man has light colored short hair. Bill fixes the screen and takes the gray plastic tubing off. We laugh: what an odd thing to do in a time of war! At some point I'm taking off the magnetic disk on my compact disc changer while Amy and Jenny look on."
"1171"	"(10/01/1997)"	"Immature Cheer For Beer I'm attending an Honor Society meeting in a church. I'm there alone, outside a room. I feel hesitant, like a dork, since I'm there alone. I go in. There are many young people there. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there sitting next to our other classmate Eric Stoner. My junior high classmate Tara Gosling is there. There is food and Grain Belt Premium Beer. People are all sitting around on the floor and on chairs. The Premium looks to be gone. I find a bottle of it. I open the bottle and it starts to foam over, so I suck the foam up. I can't suck all the foam, and some overflows onto a white plastic bag. Two younger men are hiding beers in their pockets. I scold them: there is not enough to go around. They seem immature and overly ambitious to drink. I sit on the floor in front of the chairs. My friends from Brimson Emerald Reinhold, Holly Lapson, and Terry Foss walk by. I say hi to them, with my usual degree of discomfort in their presence. The meeting starts. The president of the Honor Society is a nutty man! He is a physically small man with long straight brown hair. He tells bad jokes. He talks bout hanging black hair. Three black men who are in the audience mock the president for what he says, as if he knows nothing. The president says something about black hair being a mole's vagina. There is a white woman with blond hair in the back of the room. I know she is there. She is a leader of some sort: someone with power. I try to look mature when she can see me. I don't want to seem immature in front of her. I have lost my beer. It may be somewhere but I can't find it, or I decide which one it is from the others on the table. A couple of people run up to the front of the room with beer. As they hold a box, a tear it open and grab a beer. It is a big can of Heineken. I crack it open and drink a lot, though I don't slam it. There is an Asian man there who wants me to share my beer with him. I let out a loud cheer for the beer, and feel immature for doing so."

The man there is out of cooked bratwurst, so I wait for two to be cooked. They are cooking in oil. I tell the man I'm going shopping and I'll come back for the bratwurst when they're done, even though I've already paid for them. He says okay. He has a water pump that squirts a thin stream of fluid. I ask if it's okay to leave my backpack there while I shop. He says okay. But I realize I'm leery of leaving my back because I have my dream journal in it. I also see my Paleontology notebook in my stuff. I walk towards the entrance. I see my dad in the parking lot pushing a boat with a wheel on the front. He has a beard. When I get near the door there are two huge white vehicles with huge open spaces, which are beds, in them. I ask the man what they are for, and he says they are leaf carriers for the city. I go inside. I need a grocery cart. An old lady wants Cinnamon Bran cereal. I point out it to her where it is. She pulls a whole pallet out with Kix cereal on it. I push the pallet back. Small boxes of Kix are only $1.39. I buy some, as well as some laundry detergent. A man who works for Grocery Getto is standing around the items for sale. He's wearing a white shirt and maybe a tie. I see some Big Resort Area food packs, gear, and equipment packs for sale. There is also rain gear and a tarp. I think I should buy some of it. I know that Drummonds Incorporated runs a lot of covert pornography, and that I could expose them and absolutely ruin their business."

We talk about Bob Mould. The woman, who is Annette at this point, says there is a selected dance/ska band playing after Bob Mould. My friend Tim Zelling wants a Bosstones ticket for this coming Tuesday's show. There are bunk beds there with six inches of space between the mattress and the frame, and nothing in between. A man from Brimson we call Death Boy walks up some stairs. He sits down across the table from me. I'm scared. I tell him my friends call him Death Boy and he laughs. I feel more at ease then. Two men who are 30 or 40 years old come in. One starts to tell a dream of eating green and brown spinach in different proportions. The other man interrupts with a dream of his own, and doesn't listen to his friend's dream. Virginia writes down 10 phone numbers that someone, either Death Boy or one of the men, says. She leaves. The men stay and talk."

There is a cooler outside the store with neon signs that flickers on. Two younger men are rummaging through the cooler. They find an empty 2-liter bottle of Mountain Dew and a cake. I think they're dumb for rummaging through the cooler. I walk home to the Whitman house. I cough up phlegm and blood. I cough really hard. I'm sick. I walk through the inside of a gas station on the west side of Brighton Avenue and go out the other side of it. There is a cute woman with short dark brown hair working at the counter. I walk outside the station. A man from Brimson crosses my path."

He is telling me the details. I ask him what he is referring to. He says his father died. I'm at the Whitman house. There is a message on the answering machine from Tiny and Matt Combs and their mother. It says that their father and husband has died. The funeral is at 9:00am tomorrow. My mom says I can borrow her car to drive to Wilmerton; I'm in Woodland now. My mom may go with, as well as Wally. I'm outside a building with my dad. We're gathering before the funeral. My dad makes very sexual comments, including one about me being with virgins. This seems indecent and it makes me uncomfortable. We wait for my cousins Anna and Bertha Strange to arrive. They do. I'm inside a building, which may be a church, at a funeral. People march in, carrying the coffin, and everyone files into pews. I sit in a pew with the Redding family, including grandma, Sherry and Joanne Redding, and others. It's very crowded so I move back one pew and sit by myself. The funeral service that takes place is a Jewish service, and it is happening before the service that I am there to attend, for the Comb's father. Grandma Redding offers me some hallucinogenic mushrooms. I decline them. Sherry speaks: she is slow and shaky, like Grandma. My dad is sitting next to me. People walk up and take hosts for communion from a basket. My dad takes many hosts, and gives me one, which looks egg-like because it seems to have a yolk."

We swing at each other many times, maybe slicing each other. I do not notice cuts if I get them. We are both more concerned with fatal injuries. I drop my knife so we can fight with our hands. I punch everyone, hitting them and moving on. I walk back to an area that enters into my uncle Gary Redding's farm. There are many kids outside, like recess. My classmate from Brimson, Kyle Mendelson, is there. Two boys throw a baseball. It's dangerous for them to do this, I think: the ball could hit some of the kids that are around. I walk up to the porch of the farmhouse. Gary comes down the stairs, and I go in. He doesn't recognize me, though he got a phone call saying I was coming. I say that I'm Natalie's son Kenneth. There are fish mounted on the walls that aren't as big as the ones Grandpa Redding had mounted when he was living there. Some of the fish look made up and fake: all colorful and plastic. There is a large piece of paper on the wall with sleeping arrangements written on it by grandpa Redding. It seems there is going to be a family reunion or gathering. I'm sleeping in the living room with my siblings. Gary's wife Carla Redding is there. She has short dark brown hair and looks very middle aged and plump."

We share the food that we get. Crows are our main food source. I hear a crow. We walk towards it. I see a black mass that I think is a crow. It is between a ""Y"" fork in the branches of a tree. I throw a snowball at it, and hit it. I stand there with the woman looking up into the tree. There is an Asian woman standing in the fork of the tree branches. She is dressed in a black cape that buttons down her chest and drapes over her shoulders. She is about 15 or 20 feet up in the tree. Her eyes are closed. She stands or sits there, very content, in the middle of the forest. I speak to her, trying to get her to come down. She does not need or want my help. Her long narrow eyes open slightly, like I have disturbed her. I speak to her, questioning and encouraging her. I'm a little afraid of her: she seems unpredictable, like she could do anything at any moment because she does nothing. I'm afraid she may descend from the tree in an instant and kill or hurt me. I may say something about evangelicalism. It seems the woman is a nun, for lack of a better description. She is peaceful, content, poised, calm, wise, serene, and enlightened."

My mom and sister Heather walk down the sidewalk of Home Avenue in front of Sand's and Roman's houses going towards First Street. There is wet and sticky snow on the ground. I make a snowball and throw it at the snowman that is near the front yard of the white house across the street from Roman's house. I hit it in the head. I go home where I wait. There is snow in the boat. It must be the first snow of the year. I think of getting a tarp from the garage and covering the boat. I walk in the garage and it is very warm there. I think keeping the garage this warm is wasting heat: it's like we're heating the garage! I look in the pile of wood for a tarp. I find lots of old torn up rain gear but no tarp. At the bottom of the pile is my green Nike duffle bag, containing my brown hat, brown leather mittens, maroon University of Montana sweatshirt, and blue USA sweatshirt. I take the whole bag and bring it inside with me. A man is with me."

I pump the gun a lot and shoot, knocking the squirrel several feet in the air, but not killing it. I'm aiming the gun at Randy Menders, my classmate at Brimson, and I fire once or twice. The shots are very weak. I'd have to fire many many times to kill him. I don't have the heart to kill him: I can't bring myself to do it. Two dead children are lying in the grass between the chicken coop and the plum trees. I look at the kids. They look dead, and have been shot, by me, I think. The kids look like animals of some sort, and seem to be half alive, still breathing a little bit. There is an older woman who is in charge of things. She speaks to me and another person about what to do with the two dead kids. She says we have to keep one of the kids out, maybe because someone like his parents are coming to see him. So we have to give the kid orange juice, since the ascorbic acid in it will prevent oxidation and decay, and we have to pick the feces out of his anus, since a dead person's bowels relax."

There are large cartons of flavored yogurt for 92 cents. A man wants some meat that costs $27 per pound. His wife or I don't want to get the meat unless he pays for it, which he does."
"1185"	"(10/06/1997)"	"The Change An abrupt change occurs. Something or someone goes in, a big change happens, and that thing or person then goes out of whatever it went in to earlier. This is a major change. It seems to be all cluttered and jumbled. It is a decisive change that happens all at once: hard and fast. I think I kind of like the change. (I forgot the specifics of this dream.)"
"1186"	"(10/07/1997)"	"Blue Boat Woman I'm in the Big Resort Area with four people, including my friends Beth Mock and Tim Zelling. We have scuba gear and may be scuba diving. There is a woman in a sky blue motorboat. She lives in the boat. One of the men we are with wants to go slow on our trip. The weather is nice. I say okay: it's a nice day, we'll go at a leisurely pace. My uncle Rusty Redding's canoe starts to leak. There are two others in it with me. I flip off the end of it and tell Tim to start bailing. The front of the canoe bends, and Tim tries to collect the water and bail it quickly."
"1187"	"(10/07/1997)"	"Bald Hair Cut I'm in a barbershop, which may or may not be the one I've gone to in Oak Valley. My hair is short, but I get it cut with a hair clippers that has an extension on it. The barber starts to cut my hair right above my forehead. The clippers cuts really close to my scalp, almost shaving all the hair off! I tell him that it is cutting too short, so he changes the clippers to a longer setting and finishes cutting. He trims my neck too. There is a patch of near-baldness in front where he began to cut with the first setting. I need to pay for this haircut, which seems absurd: Why the fuck would I pay someone to cut my hair?"

"1189"	"(10/09/1997)"	"Seeing Tammy Jostens There are octopi eating other dead octopi on or near the shore of the ocean. I'm swimming in the ocean in the shallow water near shore. Several small octopi eat a larger dead one. In another situation, they don't eat a dead octopus, though they are all around it. I swim with others towards shore. There are many round wood pillars submerged in the water. I swim above them touching their tops as I swim over them. I avoid something, which may be an octopus, as I go to shore, and climb out of the water quickly. I walk up to a restaurant or building while I dry off with a towel. My high school friend Tammy Jostens walks out of the building on her way to a parked car. I recognize her though I haven't seen her in years, and I say, ""Tammy"". She turns and knows it is I. She says hi but continues on with her life, not interested in talking to me. She goes into a care with other black people. I think she is more comfortable with them, and doesn't want to see me."
"1190"	"(10/09/1997)"	"Marianne Stash's Party I'm walking to a party with my coworker Leon Mack, who plays basketball, another male basketball player, and two women. The women are attracted to and court Leon because he plays basketball. I think, and almost say, that I used to play basketball. We talk about jobs. There is a job in Powerton, which is 50 minutes drive one-way. It pays $30,000 every two weeks, or every two pay periods. I talk with the other man, who has light brown hair and is a year or two younger than I. He says something to me about my roommates and I passing the Whitman house down to someone else in five years. I tell him it will be in four years, and I hint at the possibility of passing it down to him, which would make me seem ""cool"" because he is ""cool"". We arrive at a party at my professor Marianne Stash's house. She is operating the barbeque and asks if I want something. I say I'll have one. She's cooking burger and bratwurst. The house seems to be located by the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley on a street just to the west of the mall. I get a plate. I see a person dip their plate into a frying pan filled with potato chips that are being heated up. I can't get any chips by dipping my plate so I grab a handful and put them on my plate. I grab some onion slices too. I see my family. I go up to them and hug them two at a time. My mom, sisters Heather and Ramona, and brother Wally are all there. My aunt Willow Redding is there, as well as my aunt and uncle Sheila and Rusty Redding and their kids Melvin, Rich, and Melissa. We all sit down at a picnic table and eat. It seems at first that the Redding's are the Ryan family. The Ryan's have brought fresh cucumbers, long and red tomatoes, and onions. I make a burger and put onion on it. Then I squeeze out the inside of an onion onto the burger, like the onion is squeezable jelly. It may be a rotten onion. Melvin has gotten something removed from his neck and he says something like, ""How could I have ever known it was there with my head?!"" We are eating in a porch-like area that is enclosed in glass. I see my friend Bubba Hacker and his sister Roberta arrive. They get something to eat. They are wearing matching cowboy-like outfits with sheathed knives on their belts. I knock on the window to get their attention, but they don't hear me. I go over to see Bubba. I walk in the Uptown mall parking lot, going from the north/northwest corner by the photography studio to the west side of the north lot, past the break in the wood fence where the bicycle path comes in. I yell ""Sluuu"" to Bubba. He is at a picnic table with others. I walk up and my high school classmates Jack Miller and John Glint. I greet them and we shake hands. Jack is still playing football. I tell them all I just came over to say hi, and I'll come back when I'm finished eating. I walk back and am in a casino-type area. I pick up quarters off a pink carpet. I keep seeing more quarters, and pick them up. People around me aren't picking them up. A woman who works at the casino comes up to me and says that the quarters aren't real and are for graduates only. She comes with a tray to take all the coins back that I've picked up. I clandestinely dump out a partial handful by my right shoe so that she may not see them and I'll get to keep them. I dump the rest in her tray. She tells me there are only three real quarters that she has added to all these coins, the rest are not real. I'm belligerent, and I go right up next to her face. She is a small woman. I use my size to my advantage. She deals with me, briefly explaining, and I go away saying that she has no sense of humor. I walk in an office area back to the place where my family was eating. I go into a room where they are. The casino woman is working right next door in an adjacent room. She says I don't have a sense of humor. I brush her off, but I know she is right. I was mean when I acted belligerent over the coins. The Redding's have left. My mom is there with some of my siblings."
"1191"	"(10/09/1997)"	"Leaky Shit My classmates Becky Happs and a woman from my Consciousness Seminar named Linda are staying at my house. Becky is my classmate Virginia Hamms. She goes down to the car and waits for Linda and I to come out. Linda wants to get ready and take a shower before we go. I direct her to the attic upstairs, which is where the attic is. I think very sexual thoughts about Linda. She arranges the space in the attic for a shower. She and I are then near the kitchen sink. I'm standing behind her with my arms around her. I tell her I'm attracted to her. I put my hands on her stomach and lick her ear. She says we could be intimate. I go to the bathroom to defecate and tell her I'll come up to the shower later (so we can have sex). I go the bathroom and the door won't close. Finally I get it to close. I have to defecate very urgently, and some feces leak out of my butt before I get to the toilet, and drop in two pieces on the floor. I pick them up and put them in the toilet and scrub the floor. I hear a yell outside and go out to see what's going on. I hurriedly open the door and see that Virginia is mad that she has been waiting. I'm annoyed because that isn't important to me, and I would like to defecate in peace. I go back to the bathroom. The toilet is about to overflow. I turn off the water and am going to plunge the toilet. I'm on campus at Brimson. I see people. Everyone knows something I don't know. I talk to Linda. She tells me Virginia was so mad at us! It turns out that Linda was having sex with my family's friend Mike Bautsch, when Virginia came in with Mike's son Jeff Bautsch. Virginia was also having sex with Mike on occasion, which means she was cheated on! She was really mad! I walk with Linda, who is then white and has blond hair. Then Linda is Becky. I tell her I would still have sex with her. She replies that she wouldn't have sex with me, but starts to talk as if she knows someone who would. I tell her I won't do that. I walk by a man I work with at Brimson named Josh Trodden, who asks me why I wouldn't have sex with this other person. I keep walking and don't reply. I walk through a gate at a place that is like a bus depot. There is confusion about which is the entrance and which is the exit."
"1192"	"(10/10/1997)"	"Lemont's Pork Chop I ask my roommate Norman Noman if we can eat his chicken that is in the freezer for our barbeque. He says yes, and I take it out of the freezer to thaw. In the freezer there is a pork chop in a glad lock bag with a green dot on the bag. I take the bag out to get rid of the pork chop because it has been there a long time. I'm told it is Lemont's pork chop. I ask who Lemont is, and am told that it is Arnold, a guy who used to live in our house last year. I don't care whom the pork chop belongs to: I'm getting rid of it."
"1193"	"(10/10/1997)"	"Rock Slide In Australia I'm in a sparsely vegetated desert-like cliff area. I have photographs in my wallet of me showing kids around (in Australia?). I show the photographs to my sister Ramona. There is a brick or stone wall or cliff in the photographs. A man looks on as I show them to Ramona. There is a rumbling noise that gets louder. We're near the bottom of a cliff. I know the noise is a rockslide. I wonder if I should run towards the very base of the cliff so that the rocks will tumble over my head, or if I should run away from the bottom of the cliff, trying to outrun the rocks as they roll off the edge of the cliff. I run away from the cliff out onto a flat area. I look back up at the top of the cliff and see rocks tumble off it and hit the ground below. People and vehicles with people in them are fleeing and get corned between the oncoming rocks and the cliff. The people fall or get pushed off the cliff. Vehicles are smashed into and pushed off the cliff by other vehicles and rocks. They tumble down the cliff and explode. It is a tragedy. I feel sad. The people that are with me at the bottom of the cliff have run away safely. We walk in a group, saddened by the loss of lives. We are in Australia at an airport that is near the cliff. There is snow on the ground and we trudge through it, consoling each other. A plane with words written on it arrives, maybe to help. There is a train tunnel that has a bomb in it. Bomb detectors arrive, maybe on a plane. A woman and a small yellow box-like organism are two bomb detectors. They go in the tunnel. A bomb explodes and they ""die"", but aren't really dead. The box and the woman have sex and regenerate themselves. The woman seems mechanical. A very attractive naked man and woman come out of the tunnel. They are bomb detectors that have defused the bomb. I have sex with a woman, and it seems I'm in the tunnel. She squirms and wiggles to the point of an ecstatic orgasm. I'm receiving fellatio, first by a woman, and then by a man. There is white stuff that may be semen, on his mouth and face. It's messy. I position my body so that I have the best angle to penetrate his throat. He tilts his head back."

I come to a point in the stream where my brother Wally and his friend Mryle Madden are, among others. They have a floatation device. I say something about myself having urinated in the river. Myrle says something about having five of his used condoms in the river, like he has ejaculated in the river. I think that he has outdone me, hands down. I think he has had sex so much because he just got married."

I was going to go to Dairy Queen but I change my course and park my bicycle at Byerly's. I see a young woman as I walk in who looks very familiar to me. I'm back by the ice cream freezer, trying to decide what to buy. I'm going to buy a box of ice cream bars. It is hot out, and many people are buying these. I see my high school classmate Carol Stilten as I walk and she sees me, but I don't look at or talk to her: I keep going."

There were three kegs and many cases of beer. People help the police haul the beer outside, for the police to take. My high school friend Nelson Eastman is there. As we help carry the beer out I say to Nelson that we should stash this beer: hide it for us later. We're in the basement of the house with a police officer. There are metal fragments, shavings around the room, which is made of cinder blocks and sand."
"1197"	"(10/12/1997)"	"""Tomorrow's Always The Night"" I'm in a bad neighborhood with many black drug dealers and few police. It seems to be overridden with evil. I think a good way to move drugs safely is to use a police car. I am in, or I am, a police car. I move on the ground when other cars and people can see me, and we no one can see me I jump and fly, using my feet for steering by pointing my toes up or down. I land on a roof and am then in a room. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. A man named ____ Johnson is there, as well as a tall redheaded woman named Annette. She is very skinny and stiff. Kevin is sleeping. I use my hand to stroke Kevin's erection while he is sleeping. He awakens just as he ejaculates, saying, ""Wait a minute..."", because he doesn't want to ejaculate, but wants to keep the control and stamina he has always had. There is a puddle of his semen on the floor. I go up to Annette, who is standing against a wall. I feel her small breasts and kiss her. She walks out the door saying tomorrow will be the night. I say to her, ""Tomorrow is always the night!"" She may come back in the room. She and ____Johnson may know each other."

I reluctantly get into a group that is based on sex. My classmate from Brimson Annette Trantor may be in the group. I think my sexual dreams are very revealing of me, which is why I'm reluctant to be in the group."
"1200"	"(10/12/1997)"	"Secret Recipe Of Loon I'm in a room of an apartment watching television with my mom and my siblings. My mom is on the phone. A second phone rings. My mom answers it. People come to the door and ring the doorbell. I get the door. I go outside and see what two men at the door want. One of the men is the owner of the apartment on the second floor next door. He has a sidekick with him. They are like gang/mobsters, dressed in suits. The owner tells me that they can't have the owner of our apartment standing out in front of our apartment all the time. I ask the men if they mean to tell me that the owner of our apartment can't stand on his own property! They say yes! I tell them that we're moving out tomorrow, but that I'll call the owner and give him the message. They thank me and give me a message for him written on the top piece of a small blue pad of paper. The man gives me the whole pad of paper and they leave. I drop some coins that are inside of the blue pad. The coins are a tip from the men for calling the owner. They want me to give him the message. I look inside the pad and see a $10 bill. I pick up the dropped coins and go inside. I have a recipe for soup on something like the back of a paper plate. This is the important message. I show everyone my tip, which I see upon opening is a $10 and $5 bill. The recipe is a valuable secret. I'm going to copy it down so I don't somehow lose it. I sit naked on the floor of the main room and start writing the recipe. I want to be more secret and protective of the recipe, so I go in the bathroom and lock the door. The recipe calls for #1 Loon or 1# Loon, other ingredients, and finally celery and onions."

There is a long line of people, including many women dressed in red, gold, and glitter that are considered pretty. The people seem like cowboys. There are wagons in the line. The line marches and the end of the line goes in front of the front of the line, so it is a huge circle. There is a song playing. Someone calls us different groups, one by one. There are six different groups. One gets called Jimmy, which is my friend's name, and another is called Kenneth. When one's group is called they march out to the group across from them and exchange members. Only three groups are called out since all six groups will have exchanged members by then."

I'm acting childish. He has me put the rice and brown sauce in a new pot. I don't like what he is planning with the food, and I think he doesn't do or get it right."
"1207"	"(10/13/1997)"	"Crystal Meth Climber I'm sitting with my mom and siblings at a table. My brother Wally talks about crystal meth and some other drugs. He says he is taking these drugs, just like that rock climber is, and he motions to his left where through a fishbowl lens I see a scene of a man climbing up a rock cliff. The table where I'm sitting with my family is near the cliff, at the height of the climber, who is about 50 feet from the top of the gray rock cliff. It's as if we are floating there viewing the climber. The climber swings along the cliff, pounding in stakes and pulling out other stakes. He takes a test by tugging on a rope and the rock that the stack was in crumbles. The climber hangs from a single stake, and lowers himself down slowly to get hold of the other stake. I'm afraid that he'll fall and die, because the one stake that is pounded in isn't in place securely. It seems that this stake may be attached to a single small shrub, which could pull out."

We pick up and look at rocks, trying to define what they are like. There is a two-inch thick sheet of ice on the lake. The water is cold. My uncle Gary Redding, who has short light brown hair, arrives with a medium sized shorthaired light brown colored dog. He may be with others."

A foul ball is hit, and I grab it. I want to look like I can make a good throw. I throw the ball back to my classmate Adam Heffen, between some trees. I'm on a team then, and realize we have one we can have one more player on the field than we actually have. My classmate Lance Drift is playing second base. I run out to try to help by filling the empty position and playing in the field. I think Lance may move to shortstop and I'll play second base. I run back off the field, feeling self conscious of my actions. The people on my team scold me. Suddenly I am up to bat. My team is losing. It's the bottom half of the last inning with two outs and the bases are loaded! What pressure! I think: I can hit a home run. It's a fairly simple thought, and I know I can hit a home run. My friend Melvin Dahlheimer is after me in the batting order."

I walk across the roof to the room of my neighbor Erica Lange. I knock on the window. I want to say hi; to talk and flirt. The people inside won't let me in because I shoot squirrels and chipmunks. I wander down and go by my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, who is working at the front desk of what seems like Moat Hall. I go outside of the dorm and come back around the front of Tea Hall, which his facing south. I don't have my door key so I have to follow someone in. I follow my classmate Nellie Hammer and her father inside. We walk by a person on a couch. I see it is my brother Wally. He is sleeping with a blanket on his head. I eat pizza with a group of people. Wally and my friend Nat Miller are there. I say that I got invited to play ultimate Frisbee but they wouldn't let me play because I shoot squirrels and chipmunks. This is not the truth, and Nat challenges my statement. I know the real reason they won't let me play is that I didn't eat what I shot."
"1212"	"(10/15/1997)"	"Cheap Liquor I'm in College Liquor with my friend Niles Zelling and my housemate Stephen Ramos. I decide to splurge and stock up on alcohol. I pick out four bottles of liquor, two of which are a 1.75 and a one-liter bottle of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. Then I ask a man working there if he'll get me three cases of Horse Hoof returnable bottles from the cooler. Niles wants one of the cases, so I get three instead of two. The total price comes to about $30, which I think is a good deal."

I go up to one in particular who has blond hair, and invite them over to a barbecue that I say we're having. There isn't going to be many people there, I know, and don't say anything. I walk over, they are going down a staircase to a lower level of the store. I write down the address of our house and give it to them. I feel like I may be showing off to Marianne: I'm inviting them over to show her what a ""cool"" guy I am. I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in Australia. We're at a gas station filling up his truck. We're putting gas in his spare tire. He says to just set the latch down on the handle and it will pop up when it's full. I do this but it doesn't work correctly. The tire is full, about to burst, and the pump keeps pumping. Gas starts to come out the other parts of the truck. It spouts out where the radiator cap would be. I stop filling. Kevin disagrees with this and says I should keep filling it up. I ask him if he has a tire pressure gauge. He pulls one out and checks the pressure in the tire. It is 55 pounds per square inch: full! I'm very leery of the tire: I think it will blow up. The women from the liquor store show up in a vehicle. I don't want to see or be around them. They seem to like being around me. I wish I wouldn't have encouraged them in the first place."

There is a second funeral, with a second group of directors. I'm pushed around and not respected: I'm the rookie. I walk up with one or tow other men to take the casket from the stage. This requires one to be graceful, solemn, and surefooted, among other things. We walk up on the stage and pick up the coffin. I carry one end of it and two men carry the other end. I back down the steps first and they follow with the other end. I carry the bulk of the weight. We get down on the cement. The men carrying the other end of the casket let go, and I strain to support the entire weight of the casket by holding on to one end. The end of the wooden casket cracks. After the ceremony I walk and talk with a man who seems to be the leader of the second group of directors I worked with. I tell him that things didn't work out well for me: that I was mistreated and I don't want to work with his group anymore."

I'm on top of a trailer that is connected to the Suburban. A sheet of plywood is laid across the trailer and I'm on the plywood, about a foot off the ground. I have my sleeping bag and I use it to get more comfortable on the plywood. There is potting soil on the plywood. I move it around using my credit card, using it like a trowel. My high school classmates Dan and Doug Boyle come along at separate times. They leave plants, which I hide in the dirt. They are going to come back and get the plants at about 10:00pm. There is a canoe and life vests there, on the plywood. My dad arrives. He is due here at 10:00. It's 9:52, and is quitting time. I'm working for Fishing Haven. My former boss Mike Hollow is there. My dad is talking to him. I'm going to quit this job."
"1216"	"(10/16/1997)"	"I Am Bambi Bambi survives the winter. Bambi then sees other fawns grow, or grows himself. He goes down a path in the forest, downhill. The secret to the path is stealth: one has to see others before they see you. Bambi is on a rock cliff above a lake with a dock. I'm on the cliff. I am Bambi. There is a timber wolf on the dock. I howl, to see if the wolf will howl back. The wolf howls, and other wolves howl in the distance. I loose my footing and slip on the wood, and then climb back up. There are two Japanese tourists there. There are ducks there, and they may howl. I point emphatically to the tourists to photograph the wolf! The wolf jumps off the dock into the water and grabs a loon in its mouth. There are three or four other loons swimming there. There is a diver/cameraman, who may be the Japanese tourists. He clicks photographs of the wolf and the loon, one after another, without stopping. I wonder if there will be enough photographs to make a film: if the frames were all shot in a close enough time span. But this probably isn't the case. I think he took 24 photographs."

My classmates Lance Drift and Sherman Andrews and professor Everett Klanter are part of the cheerleading squad, and run out with us. We give each other high fives. There is a basketball game. Rival has two players who are 6'11"". One man was on hormones because he is fat. There is a woman who coordinates all that is going on here. She talks. I'm wearing a cheerleading outfit. I don't agree with the woman: she has nothing good to say. She puts players and families on television. Armstrong won the conference basketball title with Shooter Jackson coaching. The team got a bad seed, first or second. I don't want to be on television. I walk away with a shot glass taped upside down to the bottom of my shoe."
"1218"	"(10/16/1997)"	"Grandma Redding Is Dying Grandma Redding comes up to me and starts to sit down next to me. She falls forward. She is weak and can't sit on the ground easily. I catch her and we talk. She tells me she is 41 years old. It's clear to me that she is dying. She is old, weak, and frail. She tells me she is going on vacation to the Bahamas. I think this is suspicious because of her weak condition. We're in a swimming pool. Grandma can't swim alone: she sinks if she tries to do this. My sisters Heather and Ramona and I help her stay afloat and swim. I climb the ladder out of the swimming pool supporting Grandma in front of me. This is difficult to do because she is heavy. I'm proud to do this myself. She reaches for a towel from someone in the pool and falls in. My brother Wally and I lift her out of the water. She is short: her body is at most three feet high. We lift her up onto the deck of the pool. She is like a baby: weak and helpless. This is a Redding family gathering, so the family is here."
"1219"	"(10/16/1997)"	"The M&S Bathrooms I'm in the southwest United States. I see mountains, valleys, rock formations, the Grand Canyon, the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and some structure named ___nine, which may be a depression of some sort. My brother Wally is with me. He tells one man, who is a total bullshitter and who knows nothing, all about this place because he knows about it. I stand on a polished rock-type flat area with a University of Montana emblem on it. There are two bathrooms, one with an ""M"" above the door, and the other with an ""S"" above the door, which at first I think might be an ""F"". A fire truck arrives. A woman comes up from the truck. She is okay but seems stunned: is recovering. Everyone takes photographs of her. I try to get out of the way: I don't want to be in the limelight with this woman, or even in the background."
"1220"	"(10/16/1997)"	"Joke Shopping I'm in a grocery store shopping with my dad and sister Ramona. People shop in pairs here. My dad's friend Josh Hemming is there. My dad gets one 12-pack of 7-Up and of Sunkist. We split up. I go to get a cart. My dad says to meet here tomorrow in the produce section. I want to play a joke on him. I need to get my wallet back. I gave my whole wallet to someone, maybe a cashier, and have no way of getting it back. I should have just given them a form of identification or a credit card. I have a till that is being used. I want it back. I don't want to buy anything. The till is in the express lane."
"1221"	"(10/16/1997)"	"It's The 15th I'm in a dimly lit bar. My high school classmate Cory Black is sitting next to me. He asks me what the date is. I tell him it's the 15th. I get some things for free. I have my choice of items on a table or shelf. Among the items are mugs and playing cards. There is a list to sign up on to play softball. I think I'd like to play, and wonder if my friends Tim and Niles Zelling singed up."
"1222"	"(10/17/1997)"	"Romeo and Juliet I'm in a room with my housemate Stephen Ramos and a salesman that seems to be working there. There is a huge television screen, about 10' by 20'. The man shows up clips from the movie Romeo and Juliet. The perspective shown on the screen is really close up, so close that it's fuzzy. The digital projection isn't good at such a close range. The screen is very bright, white, and I squint: I can barely look at it. In one scene Romeo talks with red, slobbering lips, saying ""Sweetest dreams"". Later, he says ""I said 18,000 goodbyes and they let you go."" He is sad about this, and Juliet comforts him. Later, Juliet says to Romeo, ""You collapsed."""

"1224"	"(10/19/1997)"	"The Elite Dream Group I'm having a dream group meeting. We seem to be on the east side of the garage at my home, but it also seems we may be near the intersection of 3rd Street and Oak Avenue. My friends Bill Hanson and Hank Anderson are there, with my housemate's friend Matt, my grade school classmate Misty Ryan, and one other woman. We talk. My grade school classmates Eric Stoner and Patrick Bergman come up to us: they're in the dream group too. They both have blond hair. Eric's hair is shaved and braided in a checkered pattern. They don't fit in with the group. Something happens and I ask of tell Eric and Patrick to leave. They leave, and the group finishes the meeting, which seems like the last meeting. I shake Bill's hand and hug him. We all walk and talk. I feel most connected to, appreciated by, and appreciate Bill. I feel I may be ignoring Misty, especially, but also the other members of the group."
"1225"	"(10/19/1997)"	"Diving Loon Something happens with a loon diving straight downward from the top of a tree. My dad is there. We are in a wooded area. We get a carp that kind of looks like a smallmouth bass. It is decent sized. We are ready to leave, and walk out of the wooded area. I yell, ""Gassy!"" to get my sister Ramona. She and my brother Wally both come out of the woods in different places."
"1226"	"(10/19/1997)"	"Baby White Seal My deer-hunting license gets torn up and run over in a parking lot. It isn't authentic, then, and I'll need to get another copy made. It will cost about $15 to duplicate. I am in a store looking at shotgun shells. I'm in a swimming pool, though I feel no water around me. There are two big white seals or sea lions that are very friendly, and a baby white seal as well. A woman takes a photograph of me with them. They are cute, friendly animals."
"1227"	"(10/19/1997)"	"Toilet Paper Shotguns I'm walking down Park Avenue in Oak Valley to the Dirty River with my housemate Stephen Ramos, and maybe his father Franco, to shoot shotguns. I see two Brimson Geology vans in the parking lot of the Hill Lodge. My stepbrother Nan Lawson is with us. He wants and needs to learn how to shoot a shotgun. I show Nan a shotgun, and point out the safety and the pumping mechanism. In one of the guns there is a compartment filled with several rolls of toilet paper. This chamber, once compressed, seems to be the force that propels the bullet. I help Stephen compress his chamber: we squeeze down the sides until it seems to latch. When the compartment is closed there is a piece of paper on it with the signatures of Faye and Glenn Klump, my high school friend's mother and step-father's, on the paper. We all load and shoot shotguns. Stephen and Nan go first. I shoot a gun with a score that has been removed from the top and attached below the trigger. Stephen sees a police car at the intersection of 3rd Street and Home Avenue and points it out to me. I move quickly to try to fire two shots before the police officer gets there, so we can pack up and be gone and not get into trouble. My ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter is standing on the road facing me. I am on the south side of the road that runs by the river. I try to be cool and slick and fire two shots effortlessly in front of her, but there is a toilet paper tube stuck in the gun, and when I go to pump the gun it jams. I take the tube out quickly and fire two shots over Jackie's head, which is dangerous. I wasn't thinking when I fired those shots. We pack up quickly. The shotguns didn't seem to be very loud or have that much power. The police car drives by and we see that it's not actually a police officer. I know there is a softball game tonight, and my knees are sore. I go into a room. As I go to the door there is a trench dug in the dirt on my left side. In the room there is a black and white drawing on the wall. The drawing looks very Christ-like, and it may be of my dad. My dad and sister Ramona are in the room with me. I know that my brother's friend Mryle Madden's wedding took place next door to this room. There are many boxes of wine and beer on a pallet. My dad asks me about going to liquor stores, and uses the word ""noctus"" or ""nuktos"" or something. I say I go to Big Red's Liquor. Then he asks me about a torpedo. I say that my friend Kevin Simpson uses them for fishing. My dad says no, a torpedo is a drink of bourbon that one swirls around. French fries are cooking in the oven."
"1228"	"(10/20/1997)"	"Australia With Allie Crater I'm in Australia with a group of people. We hurry to get on a train that will take us to the plane that we're flying home on. I get on the train. Others squeeze in as we pull away. All 15 or 17 of us make it on the train. My classmate Allie Crater is among the people there. We ride the train and it seems to be like a roller coaster. I'm in the front, and I sit alone. We ride outdoors, away from the station. We seem to go in water, and it feels like I get splashed, but I don't get wet. It's like the log ride at the amusement park in Forkville."
"1229"	"(10/20/1997)"	"Serving Christmas Mass I'm in Wilmerton standing outside the donut shop on the corner of Main Street and Friends Ave. My uncle Rusty Redding and cousins Rich and Melissa Redding are there. I talk about fermenting wine in bottles, but I say something isn't right. Rich and Melissa correct me, and I say that what they say is correct, about oxygen and carbon dioxide. Rusty tells me that I'm the number three mass server (altar boy) for church, at Christmas I think! He is the number four server. I Think this is fucked up, and I don't' want to participate in a mass as a server. I want nothing to do with it, but it seems I am obligated to serve because they have me scheduled to serve. John and I have lines to say: we may have to talk during the service, like in a pageant."
"1230"	"(10/20/1997)"	"Plastic Toilet I'm at my friend Kevin Simpson's old apartment in Wilmerton. Kevin and his roommate George Packer are moving. I look around at things on the table, including mail and papers. George gets mad at me for snooping around. I think he's mad because I'm looking at his stuff, but he seems to be madder that I'm not helping them move. I start to help them move. I'm in the bathroom. I need to urinate. There is a toilet, and a urinal is to the right of it. I go to the urinal. The urinal is then a small movable plastic toilet. I urinate partially in a shower curtain-type thing, which is cloth and not plastic, and it gets wet. I urinate all over, and urine gets on the floor. When I'm finished I set the small toilet back and put a white plastic chair behind it. I wipe up all the urine on the floor and start to walk out of the bathroom. I man walks in the bathroom. He has long, straight stringy dark hair. I say that he must be Lowell, another roommate, to which he says yes. I go to shake his hand and then realize I should wash my hands first. When I go out of the bathroom there are more people there. Kevin is there with his girlfriend. I joke about having butt sex with him. My friend Tiny Combs is there with his girlfriend. A single woman with blond hair is there, as well as a woman with brown hair who has a baby. The blond woman is not really attractive. I talk to Tiny about the Detroit Lions game. I ask him if he saw the game. He says yes. I compare him to Barry Sanders because in the commentary of the game John Madden said Barry Sanders squatted 580 pounds, and I know Tiny can squat that much! I ask Tiny how class is. He says he is failing two classes. I ask him if his scored are really that low. His classes must be hard."
"1231"	"(10/20/1997)"	"University of Springfield Restaurant I walk away from a house where I am. I hang onto a string and let it out as I walk. I go down a block looking for a Hungarian restaurant that I have been told is there. I don't find it, but I see another restaurant. It is the University of Springfield restaurant and bookstore. I'm inside. The place reeks of upper-middle class pretentiousness, an uptight hangout hotspot. I don't like it. The people here don't know the meaning of life. Then I'm working at the place cleaning and waiting tables. I take orders from a short fat lady that I have no respect for. I don't listen to her. I hate her. I steal tip money. I take a deer antler that was on a table even though she tells me not to. I don't listen to her. There are four, five, or six gallons of milk left on a table by the women that were at the table. They only had a sip of the milk, with cookies."
"1232"	"(10/21/1997)"	"Two Dreams Confused I'm outside a church with one man, who may be my housemate Stephen Ramos, and two women, one of whom may be my friend Melanie McDyss. There is a funeral taking place at the church. A white limousine comes. It seems powerful. We sit on the street curb across from the church. The funeral procession leaves. I back up from the curb to the boulevard. I have a feeling of being near my neighbors the Shipp's house in Oak Valley. I'm in a small room in the Uptown Mall. It seems to be kind of where the gold chain stand is. I'm in a hammock. My friend Melanie, and a woman I'm dating named Stephanie Peterson, and Stephen are there. We're talking and doing homework. I remember two dreams that I had. One involved Melanie in a department store setting. It had a sexual feeling. The other dream involved Stephanie. I confuse what woman was in each dream. I talk about he dreams and make more sense of them. I get Melanie and Stephanie mixed up in the dreams. Melanie asks me how I feel about the dreams. I think she is expecting me to say that I'm embarrassed because in the dream my sexual feelings towards her were revealed. She is kind of taunting me very slightly: it's as if she has control in our relationship and wants to get more by encouraging me to admit my attraction to her in real life. I honestly say that I feel pretty good about the dreams. For me, knowing how the dream symbolism fits, how the images in the dream relate to their referents is more important than the actual latent content of the dream. My professor Carly Sweet enters the room. She tells us we have to leave because she is giving a mid term exam to her second group of Educational Psychology students at 10:00pm. The first group was at 7:00pm. I recognize one of the men as we leave: he is a football player for Brimson. We leave and walk in the mall. My friend Nate Nelling is there. I say that we can probably go to my house, which is somewhere near the radio station in the mall. My friend's father and brother, Walt and Ryan Nelling, are walking in the mall, hand in hand. Ryan is younger, about five or six years old. As we walk in the open mall space by Target, my old classmate Tara Stevens is there. She is a manager working at Target. She throws something like a piece of licorice over my head, a long ways."
"1233"	"(10/21/1997)"	"Lying About Licorice I walk into a Target store with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling. I take a bite of red licorice, which may taste bad, and toss the rest of the stick of licorice on the floor. It slides up next to a cash register. The man at the register angrily asks the people in his line who put the licorice there. We walk behind his register through a different checkout lane. As we pass he asks us loudly if we put it there. I walk back and look down, as if I didn't' know there was licorice there, and then say no. I see my junior high crush Erin Jacobs, who may have braces, as I walk by the checkout. I look at her and smile cockily, like I am somehow better than her: superior in my thinking. We walk to an aisle with licorice on the right side. Niles picks up a small bag of black licorice. I want a flavored licorice, like apple. There are big 20-pound bags of licorice, like bags of charcoal. A manager woman comes up to us. She is mad! She asks us about the licorice on the floor, and I deny it, as does Niles. I yell at Tim and ask him about it, and he says he didn't put it here. I'm lying. The woman threatens to question us at the checkout when we leave. I ignore her, asking myself how they'd know it was I. The licorice may be a starburst when I go look at it."

I find the boat on the side of the road. I must have driven carelessly without the strap on back of the boat to hold it down to the trailer. The bow of the boat is smashed in and the motor is broken. A rope on the boat, maybe the motor chord, got wrapped around another smaller rope on or near the road."
"1235"	"(10/21/1997)"	"Not as Good Solo I have a song by Robert Plant and Jimmy Page stuck in my head. I may talk to them. Their music is not as good when they play solo as it was when they were in Led Zeppelin."

We talk about the classes that we had in high school that would prepare us for cellular/molecular biology in college. I say that I had no biology, but more importantly no physics! Allie acts a bit surprised: I get fleeting sympathy. We are on some train tracks or in or around a trail tunnel. A train is coming and we need to move. I hop out of the way. Allie and the others take longer to move. I encourage them to move, and they finally do. I'm in a room sitting on a bed. My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson is there, with others. She says to me that she won't stay over at my house on Saturday or Sunday. This is her way of saying she is going to restrain herself on these days and see how things look on Monday, in terms of our relationship."
"1239"	"(10/23/1997)"	"Stephanie At Carter Church I walk with my mom and my siblings on the sidewalk in front of the white house at the intersection of 1st Street and Holy Avenue in Oak Valley. We're going up to the house. There is a short metal fence around the house, and its gate may be locked. My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson and her friend are sitting in the back yard by the garage. She yells for us to come over. We go and say hi and talk I'm in a group of people standing outside Carter Church. Stephanie is there, and is planning to come over to my house after church for an hour before going somewhere else. She asks if she can bring a friend, and I say that's fine. She points him out: a black man in a hat. I go over and meet him. He has a light brown goatee beard called an a_____. He may be white then, or be black with a light brown beard. I shake his hand as we meet and pass by; we don't talk much. Stephanie says she didn't know if it would be okay that he came. I say it's okay just as long as there is no one else. I'm hesitant to have people over. We go into church. Stephanie and her friend sit in the balcony, having full view of me. I sit at the end of a pew with people I don't know and try to sing/mumble a few words. I see a red-haired woman, whom I think might be my grade school classmate Annette Smith. We leave the church and get on a school bus for the ride home. I sit behind Stephanie and her friend. I'm solemn the whole ride. I feel out of place with them: like they are a couple and I'm chopped liver. I physically balance myself during the ride. They ask me, friendlily, if all is well. I reply that I'm fine. The bus goes straight to my house and drops my siblings and I off. I don't think Stephanie or her friend get off the bus. I go up to the front door. My mom is home, and she unlocks the door."
"1240"	"(10/23/1997)"	"Spinnerbait Masturbate I'm in a hallway talking with a woman I seem to know about another man. She is familiar with him. I get the impression that he is a weird man: he works in odd ways. He's not psychotic or dangerous, but is not a normal guy. We talk about the possible meaning of some of the symbolic objects the man has left. I go into my bedroom alone. In the corner are a spinnerbait and a buzzbait, both large One is pink and one is fluorescent yellow. I put a yellow spinnerbait on my penis, so that the blades are on one side and the hook and skirt on the other side, while my penis is through or at the middle/joint. (See drawing in notebook.) I'm wearing a fluorescent yellow protective cup, and I start to pull a pair of fluorescent yellow stretchy underwear over the cup. It's a tight fit, as if there are plastic containers on the sides of my hips too. My classmate Annette Gollum walks in as I'm pulling up my underwear. I stop. We seem to have a connection. We flirt. She comes onto me and starts to pull off my underwear. We intentionally fall onto a mattress on the floor that has no sheets on it. I have my retainer, as well as another object, in my mouth, which makes my mouth feel big and clunky. She lays her stomach next to me. I want to have a sexual encounter with her. She talks about how her hair gets in the way a lot. I want to put my hand down her pants."
"1241"	"(10/23/1997)"	"Fake Sex With Jackie Hunter I go to the Brimson library to work. I get tired and decide to leave. I sit down in a chair by the stairs. My ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter, her roommate Erin, and another woman come up the stairs. We make eye contact and say a weak hello as they hang their coats up. They go to do work. Jackie pauses as they walk by, and then sits down on my lap. I lean back and say that I'm tired and need a nap. I have my arms around her. She leans back on me and we start to have a sexual encounter. I rub my hand on her crotch. I can tell she isn't used to this aggression. We take our clothes off. She gives me fellatio and we have sex. There is an open door, and we are in a room. I feel like I'm imagining being with her: like it's not real. I have my erection stuck behind my left leg, and I imagine Jackie sitting on top of me and us having sex. It is good sex. She has never had sex before, and is strong, sturdy, and aggressive. She likes the hard physical contact and penetration. The door closes and I notice a person in blue leaving the doorway. This startles me. My state of mind changes: this seems dream-like, and waking-like. I roll or crawl over to the door and holler/moan. It was my housemate Norman Noman at the door. I think: If I was dreaming, I couldn't have been masturbating because of muscular atonia in REM. I ask Norman if I was dreaming of masturbating of if I really was masturbating. He says I really was masturbating: he saw me."
"1242"	"(10/23/1997)"	"Supple Woman Turned Angst I'm with my friend Hilary Nano and one or two men. I know later that one of the men is my friend Nat Miller and the other man's identity is unclear. A woman is in the place where we are. There is something wrong with her: she is disturbed or upset. She is upstairs. Nat and I think it would be a good idea to give this woman drugs to calm her down. There is a small dental floss-like container of aspirin that we could use. It is on a shelf with other items. Nat grabs a big bottle of aspirin. I tell him not to open it because I've got a big bottle back in my room that's already opened. But he has already opened it and broke the seal. I go back to my room to get the aspirin. I want to flirt with Hilary, and possibly have a sexual encounter: I'm horny. It looks as if she could be under my blankets, but I pull them away to see that she is not. She is in the next bedroom under the blankets. I want to have sex with her. We flirt. I go back to Nat. The woman is still upstairs. We fill a small pink or purple plastic egg with aspirin to give to the woman. I think to myself that I wouldn't have a sexual encounter with Hilary when she was seeing my housemate Stephen Ramos. The woman starts to come down the stairs. We hear her and hide. I go into the next room. There are two mirrors positioned so that I can see the bottom of the stairs from behind the wall. I think, then, that if I can see her using the mirrors she'll be able to see me. I move, and as I do the woman walks across a different room, adjacent to the one I'm in. She sees me as I try to hide, so I come out and go into the kitchen where she is. She is wearing a bathrobe. She is very beautiful. She has short dark hair. She is fairly short, about 5'6"", and looks a bit like my high school classmate Rachel Hardy, but is much cuter. It seems that I know her somewhat. I pick her up and lay her down on top of the table, opening her robe. She has very nice breasts. We talk very briefly. I understand that she is 22 years old, and has a 12 year-old daughter. It seems that she had a sexual encounter with a man, who I imagine to be a large, tall red neck: a jerk who mistreats women, and has mistreated her. She is very beautiful, with clear, clean, soft, supple skin. I'm very attracted to her. We start to have a sexual encounter. I start to give her cunnilingus. She mocks me subtly, saying I'm not doing a good job: that I don't hit the clitoris. I lick and rub her clitoris area, but don't find the clitoris. She is experienced with sex, and just wants a good, hard, satisfying fuck. She isn't beautiful or graceful like the woman I put on the table, but still, they are the same woman. I rub her g-spot with one, then two fingers. I think of putting three fingers in, but don't. I do this with considerable pressure. She starts to orgasm. She moves my fingers to where her clitoris is, and I can feel it with my tongue: a little ball of rough, raised, firm flesh. I keep licking her clitoris and rubbing her vagina. I awaken and open my eyes for a fraction of a second, and then close them and remain in a dream. [I'm not sure if this happens in the dream or in real life.] I know I'm on a single mattress on the floor of my room dreaming of having sex. I want to ejaculate. I keep licking and rubbing her, and am thrusting my pelvis. She comes close to orgasm, as do I. I don't ejaculate."

My friend Tom Napper explains to me that I was unhappy and always complained about flies and spoiled fruit because of the bad screens we've had. So new screens are being put on: my mom bought them. There is some cherry pie on the stove. There was a big piece that is smaller now, that I eat. My sister Heather eats some too."

They talk about ordering sandwiches from McDonalds as a class event. Mary is downwind from me and says she smelly my body odor. I tell everyone that I really take pride in my filth, and that I was going to take a shower, but just didn't. I walk towards my home. I walk by a church-like ceremony where men are pushing boats on trailers: one per person. I go down a grassy step-like hill into a dormitory area. One man walking near me turns left and goes through some glass doors to do his laundry. I go straight to, my room, and see Peter Crater outside my door. I then realize I have forgotten my key. The door is open, I see, so I go in. Peter follows me when I invite him in. My classmate Allie Crater opens the door to her bedroom. She is sitting on her bed inside the room. She has a white blanket covering part of her body and doesn't seem to be doing anything but sitting. Her bedroom is entirely white. It's pretty. I think we may have interrupted her masturbating because she doesn't look like she's doing anything. I go upstairs to my bedroom. Peter and Allie are going to a bookstore. They ask me where it is. I don't know. We decide it's probably over by the campus store."

I slip off it, but catch myself and pull myself up. I see a deer down below me. It looks like a white tail buck with a decent-sized set of antlers. There are many deer there. The ones with antlers have antlers that curve back in a semicircle, to a point. Someone says they are Wisconsin Caribou. Grandpa Redding is there talking of hunting. I walk though the building to get out, with some family. We go through a shop that sells gifts from Australia. There is the leaning Tower of Pisa, and a photograph of the family is taken on it."

[She is my friend Beth Mock's friend from the second floor of Wonkers Hall when we were sophomores. I also saw a photograph of this woman from this past summer in which she was at the Whitman house with my old roommate Jens Nils and others. The photograph was in the back of my roommate Jack Thigpen's car at the beginning of the year.] She says something to the effect that she hears I'm withdrawing, not being social, and not being interested in people. She says she wants me to let her into my life. I humor her, and allow her to walk with me. I'm barefoot. I see my classmate Chad Wheat and his father. His father looks much cleaner and more ""normal"" than Chad. I want to be alone. People can't need me. The woman is odd. She wants to be with me, and thinks she can change me to be more social. I find her annoying. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan walks by the woman and I. We walk by railroad tracks on campus. Garages are there. There is glass on the floor. We are in a tunnel to the dorms. Students from Brimson are there. We go downstairs. We have some trouble finding the tunnel, but then find it. I hear one of my high school basketball rival's names, Sam Henry, in conversation as I walk in the tunnel."
"1248"	"(10/25/1997)"	"Strong Administration I'm in the presence of stern administrators, including my grade school principal Candy Bevner, my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, and others. They are having a big meeting. I try not to distract them very much. I'm off to one side. My high school friend Elise Rooks is there. We talk a little bit. She expresses interest in spending time with others and I tonight. I think this is strange because she doesn't express interest in being with me often. I'm very attracted to her. I don't respond too enthusiastically to her. A woman comes in as I leave. She says she has had a dream. I offer advice in passing regarding it, though I think I may be invading the administrators place. As I walk out some younger teenage boys are walking next to each other. One says to another that Elise invited them to spend time together tonight. He says Kenneth Hanson and other people Kenneth's age will be there. He must not recognize me, because I'm right next to him. It seems, that to him, myself and older men like myself are ""cool""."
"1249"	"(10/25/1997)"	"Beavis Gets Rooks Beavis and Butthead are in Armstrong High School. Beavis has a sexual interaction with a woman, and describes it to Butthead. My friend Kevin Simpson and housemate Stephen Ramos take a photograph of an administrator. There is a female administrator with really good film. They get in trouble. There is a dance-like activity between the junior and sophomore lockers, and many Armstrong graduates are there. It's a small party. My high school classmate Jack Miller is there. I'm in a house that is very dirty: paper and garbage are everywhere, junk. There are plastic garbage bags by an over that are melting. There is a big wood structure with long horizontal wooden pillars that move. It's a king-like structure: it seems to be made for a king."
"1250"	"(10/25/1997)"	"A Frozen Lake There is a frozen lake. Others and I go down to it, or go down and back. When we do this, timing is important. We go to different areas."
"1251"	"(10/25/1997)"	"Being Tested I'm traveling on train tracks. I'm riding a huge thick (4"" in diameter) black, cable-like structure. I'm bringing my power source with me to get far enough, as if I'm dragging an endless supercharged extension cord. An electric cable is my main power source. I ride up and down on this huge cable, in a sine-wave path. There is some rebound, some slack, when I go off the top of the peaks of the cable. This is not good, I know. It results in a ripple-like effect as I descend into the downward portion of the wave. It would be easy to get off the track, and all the loose track-like wooden structures would pile up like in a rear-end car accident. I realize I'm going to be late. I worry about getting all my reading done. I'm going to be tested at 3:22pm, on the article I'm reading. It is written on a long, white piece of calculator-like paper. I skim the article, not retaining its contents. I go to the end of it, which is page 103, and see that I have finished it. I think maybe I should go back and read it over. I need to hurry to make the test. I go to a house. They give me a ride from the house to the place where I think I'll be tested, which is a town 11 miles away. We drive. The house I'm looking for is three down from the one I went to. It is number _ _ 23 (maybe 4223). I get out of the car and ring the doorbell. I man answers the door. His teeth are clamped together. He had surgery and has braces. He got drunk last night, and he's sick. They have a dog. The man is expecting all the people to be tested. I say I've come alone."
"1252"	"(10/26/1997)"	"My Dad's Trophy Walleye I'm fishing in a river with my friend Matt Yams, my dad, and another man. We've never fished in this area. It is a pretty river, with a few small rapids, some deeper pools, and some weeds on the bottom in deeper places. I cast a sucker minnow with a hook through its lips. We seem to be on a dock or floatation device. I cast downstream towards the rapids and slowly crank the minnow in. I'm using a bait-casting reel that has two handles and looks like a Zebco 33. Matt is in the water, very close to my bait. He is looking at my bait, like it is in a good spot to catch a fish. He watches it. I can't really cast off to the right because there are other lines out there. My dad is fishing with a gray square bobber. The bobber goes under a bit and moves across the surface: he has a bite! We watch his bobber. I'm in the water on the left side of the dock. I see a big northern pike, heavier than five pounds. It is the one with my dad's lure in its mouth. Very slowly and calmly I tell him to take up the slack line and set the hook. I see the treble hook is on the right side of the pike's mouth. I motion with three fingers, on the side of my mouth, trying to communicate with them that now is the time to set the hook! My dad takes up the slack line. The fish is lifted out of the water: Matt is lifting it up. They didn't set the hook, so I'm worried the fish will shake the hook loose. The fish seems to be paralyzed as they lift it up. They lift it by the line, and the fish hangs there. When it is out of the water, Matt grabs it. I look and see it is a huge walleye, seven or eight pounds! I grab a net and hold it under the fish in case the fish shakes the hook free. I tell dad that this fish would be considered a trophy to some people. My dad wants to let it go. I grab my camera to take a photograph."
"1253"	"(10/27/1997)"	"I'm On Offense The Minnesota Vikings and the Green Bay Packers are playing football. The score is tied at zero. It is a very defensive game. My friends Gino Teavor, Bubba Hacker, and I are playing on the offense. Our defensive team is doing a great job. Our team missed a field goal in the first half, and there have been no other scoring attempts. My sister Heather and my high school crush Harmony Allure are there for lunch, which seems to be near the alley at home, at the bottom of the hill. People are having burgers from The Greasepit for lunch."
"1254"	"(10/27/1997)"	"Paying for Burgers I'm with my friend Matt Yams. We pull into the Greasepit drive-in in Oak Valley. It isn't how it looks in real life. Jasper Yams is slow to come to the drive thru window. He comes up from the basement, it seems. We order burgers and fries. Jasper is going to make us pay for them. The library is open 12-6pm."
"1255"	"(10/27/1997)"	"The Quiet Cabin I go to the Quiet Cabin with my housemate Stephen Ramos. As we walk in it is like a garden, with some trees and flowers. Some of the flowers are light purple. Lori Handler doesn't recognize me. Other people are there. I talk with a woman who also works at the place. She talks to me about a book, trying to sell it to me. I'm not really interested in buying it because it's too expensive, but I listen attentively. Stephen and I go into our room. There are two sheets for the bed, which is like two double beds side by side. Something may happen with the sheets and masturbating."
"1256"	"(10/27/1997)"	"Stephen's Smelly Masturbation I'm in a basement with my housemate Stephen Ramos and another man. The man and I help Stephen masturbate. Stephen has a really bad smell coming from his body. It smells like feces and body odor. A woman comes down the stairs. Either she tells Stephen that he has to shower because he smells, or Stephen decides to shower because she's there. Stephen masturbated with a flat hand or with his forearm. The man and I were right there."
"1257"	"(10/28/1997)"	"Once Bitten I'm at Teen Variety Night gathering. There are two gymnasiums with the lights on, but the lights of one will soon be darkened for dancing. My sister Ramona is there. My friend Melanie McDyss is there with some friends. It is a Halloween-type party. Others and I dance. I do the splits, like a scissors. Melanie is short and has a big butt. Her dark blue jeans are pulled up high. I'm standing on the edge of a gravel-like sand pit filled partially with water. My friend Tim Zelling is in the water. There is a snake by him in the water. I encourage him to move. Then there are several snakes right around him. I don't know if they are poisonous. I know he could get bitten if he moves suddenly, but I tell him to get the fuck out of there! He does get out, and doesn't get bitten. I feel a sting, like a bug bite. I look down and see snakes coming up the side of the bit: I've been bitten! The bite doesn't hurt much but I'm really afraid of what will happen now that I'm bitten. I go sit down and start squeezing out the venom. The bite is on the arch of my right foot: a really tender area. A woman is there, and show throws rocks at the snakes, and maybe at me."
"1258"	"(10/28/1997)"	"Good Facial Hair I see myself in a mirror. I don't focus on my face: I know it is I. I have a lot of facial hair. It is thick and dark, about _ to _ of an inch long. It is not really thick, but more so than I'm used to. I think of trimming parts of it to have a good style of facial hair. It looks good, I think."
"1259"	"(10/30/1997)"	"Hercules' Capture and Escape There is a knight, like Hercules. Evil men dressed in armor on horses capture him. The group has a leader. Hercules gets off his horse and picks up a small blue metal bow with a short white arrow. He is very casual about this, and does it slowly. This seems like it is in an area very similar to the pit-room at home. The arrow for the bow has a drawstring wrapped tightly around the notched end. He draws back the arrow with everyone standing around, and fires it into the throat of one of the guards, who also has a bow. As he does this, I feel his motions, as if I am he, shooting the arrow. The arrow was drawn slowly, with all the evil men around. The men didn't do anything about it. I run out of the front door of my home. It's as if I have done the shooting and the men will be chasing me. I'm gasping for air because I have just been shot in the throat. My mom is out near the front sidewalk doing some work, like pulling weeds. I know the leader and men will follow me. I run. I think of hiding underneath the foundation of the house Mike Bautsch is putting up on the corner of Home Avenue and 2nd Street. It's dark under the house, which is lofted off the ground by huge wooden pillars. I run on. The leader of the group seemed so confident he was ignorant."
"1260"	"(10/30/1997)"	"Sex With Mya Rousing I'm at a stoplight, driving my friend Bubba Hacker's car, the Nova. I'm fooling around in the car, and I look over and see my friend from high school Mya Rousing in the car next to me. We signal each other to pull over. We seem to be on the road in Wilmerton near the livestock auction station and the small fire station. The light turns green and we drive. I bump or shift the Nova into second gear. The engine squeals and grinds. I shift back into drive, and the engine still squeals a bit. We pull off the road and onto a frontage road; Mya drives first. I think that she's beaten me by turning first, and no one beats me! She pulls into a parking space in front of a building. I pull in very close to her vehicle, so I can hardly open the door. I then move the car so there is more space between our vehicles. She is driving a mini van. We get out and go around back of the car. We exchange a big hug, and I pick her up off the ground while we hug. She weights a lot. It's not that she is fat by any means; she is just big. We fall on the ground. I'm feeling very sexual. I tell her that she really looks great, and that she is so beautiful. She has some scars on her face: red spots from acne. I hug and kiss her on the ground. We kiss. It's not that I'm attracted to her, per se, but rather that I'm horny, she's there, and she is fairly attractive. She rubs my penis and I put my hand down her pants. Her crotch feels very skinny, like there isn't a lot of flesh in her lower abdomen or thighs. Her vagina is like a big hole, that is about one and a half inches in diameter, with all the flesh in her crotch stretched very tight to her skeleton: she is very skinny. We're going to have sex. I want to go behind the building and have sex in the grass. The building we're next to is her dentist. She has to go to the dentist's office. She suggests we go in and have sex in the bathroom, and then have sex outside later. I say that good because I'll only last two minutes the first time anyways! Mya is naked, and I'm really aroused: I want to have sex! We go inside the office. There are several female receptionists at the desk. Mya isn't there: she may have gone back to her appointment. I introduce myself to the receptionists. They know who I am because they know my mom, Natalie Redding. I'm sitting down when one of the women dials up a radio show and hands the phone to me to make a song request. I take the phone, feeling flustered, and a female radio show host is on the line. I start to say the name of the office I'm calling from, and the women I'm with cue me in on the name of the place. But the host already knows from where I'm calling. She plays a recording of the name of the office that we're at over the phone for me to hear. I ask her to play Saturday Night Fever, and she says maybe I should listen to that by myself! So then I suggest Billie Jean. She says she won't play that either. I tell her that those are the only two songs I would want to hear, and I hang up. I'm sitting around with the women, and they tell me that I'm responsible for looking after these two small blond-haired boys that are running around by us. I don't know what that entails. I know that the boys don't like to be left alone. There are two men there in their late 20's. It seems they are having a barbeque. They are the fathers of the two boys, and are rednecks. They aren't paying much attention to the boys. I try to keep track of the boys while they run around."
"1261"	"(10/30/1997)"	"In Carter Church I go into Carter Church. It is empty. I walk back to sit down. Then people are there. I sit midway back on the left side of the church. A service starts, but it doesn't seem to be a mass. There aren't many people there. The people that are there have been going to Carter for a long time. They're old. The Schmelzer family is there. I sing a little bit with the people there."
"1262"	"(10/30/1997)"	"Desperate To Go I am leaving Nimen, and I drive down the main road to Superhighway 100. I'm followed by a carload of people that are going to a Minnesota Vikings Game. They are really excited. I find them annoying and don't want to be around them. I turn left onto the ""on"" ramp for Superhighway 100 going east. The car of people is behind me. I'm driving a trike: a motorcycle with three wheels. I merge onto the highway and am really glad to be moving: I'll be home in a couple of hours. I get stopped in traffic. There is a tunnel ahead of us. I see the solid lanes of cars backed up to the tunnel, where the road ends. People are turning around and going the other way on the highway. I get up to the scene that is causing the delay, and see that there is a crater-like hole in the highway for about _ mile, and then the highway starts up again. There is a golf course on the right side of the freeway. Others and I think we should just drive along the edge of the course to where the highway picks up again. There are some streams and swampy areas, but some people have four-wheel-drive trucks and they can help out. There are three tall buildings behind me on the right side of the freeway. I'm in a room with some men. I'm anxious to get moving. One man is a father. He is older and he doesn't do much. There is a younger man there sitting on the floor directing things. This man has one regular leg and one very short leg, that extends about to the knee of the regular leg. This man says that he is keeping Sean Williams, my old roommate from Fishing Haven, and I, to go slow with us because we have caused trouble and he wants no problems. I'm enraged! I want to go now! We have to go up to the top floor of the middle of the three buildings. I'm currently in the building on the right. I go in and race up to the top via the stairs, while the little man takes the elevator. We're in a room where a drug deal is taking place. I realize now why he wanted me to go slowly: because the drugs are illegal. There are several people there doing the drug deal. The drugs are packaged securely. The drug dealers are minorities: either black or Hispanic. I'm afraid of them. Different drug dealers put colors on me, from different substances. I get red, yellow, and blue on me. I get angry and react, but am scared of retaliating against these people because they are black and because they are drug dealers. I fight with them."

"1265"	"(10/31/1997)"	"Choosing Restaurants I'm with a group of people who go to Brimson in Oak Valley. We're going out to eat. We go by my friend Gino Teavor's house and come to the intersection of Holy Avenue and Main Street. A man in our group is driving a black Suburban. My friend Tom Napper owns the Suburban, and is with the man in it. The man scratches the side of the Suburban while pulling up to the light, and then backing up next to some cement posts. Tom is angry that this happened. I'm worried that the man won't cross Main Street without being hit by a car. There is a lot of cross-traffic. I don't trust him, and I wish I were driving. I'm on a bicycle next to the Suburban. I balance on the bicycle, not moving, but not touching my feet to the ground. My friend Norman Noman and ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter are there. They talk about the name of a cell. We all cross the street. I'm the only person on a bicycle. My bicycle is an old 10-speed. There are two restaurants to choose from: The Greasepit, or ____, which has a name similar to the Copper Lantern, but is a fast food place by the locksmith on Main Street. I ask people where they want to go. My classmate Fred Potter says the Copper Lantern-like place. We all turn right and go to this place. They serve turkey sandwiches. I go up to order. I see an order being served: it is turkey on two pieces of white bread with mayonnaise and some little trimmings. I ask the man serving it if that's all they have. He says it comes cut in half. I see on the price board that the cost of the sandwich is $4.76. I think to myself that I'm hungry, and would want three or four sandwiches. This is too expensive for me. I get on the bicycle and go to the Greasepit. People yell for me as I go. I go through the trailer park, breaking open a gate as I ride. I ride through a forest. The ground is soft with leaves and needles on it. My housemate Stephen Ramos is behind me in the distance, following me. I hear him singing. I wish he wouldn't follow me. I don't want him to try to persuade me to go back. I just want to just be, and in this case to be without him. The tune he sings is a kind of uplifting, mid 1980's, cheesy, see-the-light song. It goes, ""...and through..."". The pitch is high. I think my friend Matt Yams may be working at the Greasepit."

"1268"	"(11/02/1997)"	"Running Over People My sister Ramona and I are in a boat fishing. We drift into shallow water. I'm going to pull up the 25 horsepower motor and put down the trolling motor. We move, and are in a very rocky area that goes from very shallow to very deep. It's quarry-like, and the water has a reddish tint. We go through a narrow channel. I use the trolling motor. I see a tree ahead of us with bald eagles in it. There are three larger figures on the tree. They move as if to capture or kill the eagles. They have a huge red flag on a pole about 20 feet long. We get closer. One man is standing in front of the other man on the water. The man speaks to us. He has a weapon and tries to make us stop. I won't stop: I start the 25 horsepower motor and go full throttle, steering straight for them. They say they need help. I run them over, and they dart out of the way. I turn and go back again. The man who was alone grabs the side of the boat as I speed past. He climbs in the boat. I use a fishing net to hit him in the glasses to get him to fall out of the boat."

The crowd is a lot older than us: in their late 20's. Kristy gets something to eat. I'm hungry. I'm not sure what the process is to order a food or a drink. I want to go back out and get Melanie to come in, but I don't want to seem like I'm ignoring Kristy. My friends Holly Lapson and Jill Banks, housemate Stephen Ramos, and lady-friend Stephanie Peterson are there. I'm uncomfortable."

I go into my brother Wally's old room, where there is a television and a VCR, and start putting in different movies. One of the movies is Pretty In Pink. In the movie, the scene is a large grocery store. There is a man and a woman, both in their 20's. They are both going to a party. They man gets large containers of jelly, peanut butter, and honey for the party. The man wants to have some type of interaction with another man there: maybe to meet him. I wonder if the man is gay. I'm at the deli in the store in the movie, waiting in line. When I am first in line, after waiting a bit, two people cut in front of me, one by one. I don't say anything. Then a third person, a woman, cuts in front of me. I tell her I was here first and I'm in a hurry. I ask the man behind the counter for _ pound of smoked turkey and _ pound of ham, and then change my order to be just the turkey. My classmate Yolanda Ginsburg walks by. We say our usually meek hello. The woman who cut in front of me gets mad. She threatens to talk to the manager. The deli man says something about a discount for her, clearly implying that he supports her. I'm annoyed because I know I'm right and this stupid wench-of-a-woman is wrong."
"1271"	"(11/02/1997)"	"Temporary Cement Slab I'm on a big cement slab that is out a couple hundred feet from shore in a swimming area. My friend Bubba Hacker and others are there. We're fishing. Bubba is using a bobber and a worm. He casts it out and reels it in. I think that is a bad way to fish: it won't catch many fish. Bubba gets a bite and starts to reel the fish in. It appears that he has snagged a decent-sized northern pike by the dorsal fin! He brings the fish in close and I net it by hanging my arm over the side of the platform. The fish is a big trout or salmon. I net a smaller fish that is floundering on the surface. Huge shark-like fish start surfacing all around the platform. We see their black outlines in the water. They are feeding on the type of fish that I netted. I yell for a man to get some boats so we can get off the slab. Though the slab offers some protection from the sharks, I feel as though I won't be safe for long."

I put some sausage that is wrapped in plastic, and about _ pound of hamburger into a microwave to thaw out on defrost for 16 minutes. I drive in a van. It seems to be a white van.

I check is again because my friend Melanie McDyss is there. I have a crush on her, and am nervous about approaching her. I skirt around her, avoiding her, getting my mail, and not going to talk with her. I have a lot of mail, surprisingly. In my mail is a Jurassic Park book in a yellow on-campus envelope. I get a letter for which the return address is my former boss Mike Hollow. It seems to be a business advertisement. I open it and see it is from my dad. It's a birthday card with several condoms on the outside cover."

My brother's friend Brian Rappaport is in the house on the corner, and his big blue truck is there. Brian's friend Jeff Bautsch lives in the house, and Brian is visiting. I don't want to talk to them. I hope they don't see me as I walk by. I turn left onto Home Avenue. One or two houses down, I go past and look in. I see my friends Niles Zelling and Trevor Peterson. I go in. Trevor and I hug each other. His fiance is there. She is fair-skinned with shoulder-length straight dark hair. There is beer in the refrigerator, but I can't have one because it's Trevor's. Trevor looks very strong. Niles says something about a party in Meyers Dorm. I tell them how drunk my classmate Sharon Lincoln was last night my friend Bill Hanson's party. We drive. I ask Trevor how long he's been in the Air Force. He says he gets out at the end of May and Air Force is paying for a six-week paid vacation to Florida, just before he gets out. We arrive at a small, open, hick-town bar, but leave. There is a lion mounted, but it's a cast of a real lion: a big, beautiful, and rare animal. The cast was made on the east coast somewhere."

There are three of us; I'm a partner with Ramona. I look at my cards. I almost have a straight flush in low spades. I bid nine spades. I get the joker, an ace, and a low spade in the kitty. I have a straight flush, then, luckily. There are two of some cards. I lead the joker, and draw out two low spades. I then lead a low spade. Wally plays the left bower, and Ramona plays the right bower. Ramona then takes the lead in an off suit. I play the ace of that suit, and Wally trumps it. He is short-suited. Wally has the next remaining highest trump, including the ace and king of spades. I have low trump, but they won't take tricks in this case. Wally sets us, because I don't have high enough trump, even though I have lots of low trump. We switch partners: I'm going to play against them. It seems to be spring, and we seem to be waiting for someone or something."

There is a blurred message from my high school classmate Aaron Stevens. My housemate's girlfriend Sunny Pile is there. She is sitting on a bed in white underwear and a shirt. I think this is very open of her. I put some of my socks in a drawer. They are ankle-high socks with red stripes."

I think he has sprained his ankle, and I have him elevate it. His father drives around the rink area in a station wagon. He pulls up near us. I tell him what is wrong with his son, telling him it's just a sprain, and it will be okay. I help the boy over to the car. When we get there my high school classmate Nicole Peterson gets out of the car! I am surprised and happy to see her. We talk briefly and I offer her a ride home since the man and boy are leaving. She accepts. I offer her a ride because she's my friend and I haven't seen her in a while, but also because I'm attracted to her. We walk to my truck, which is parked on the curved turn-off lane from where Roundabout Way and the Thru Highway intersect, going towards Yardville. We get in and I start the truck. Nicole climbs in the passenger side window. I notice she is fat. I try to shift into first gear and the transmission doesn't seem to grab. I go very slow, as if I'm in third gear going five miles per hour, and the engine sputters and chokes. I pull out onto the highway in front of a lot of fast moving traffic. I'm going much slower than the traffic. I try to speed up but am still going slow. There is a clicking and knocking sound coming from the engine. I go slow, and then stop on the side of the road. Something is wrong. I look to see what it is. There is a branch dragging from the left rear tire. The right rear tire has some hose or metal pipe-like structure attached to it, extending out from the truck. The tire is torn and ripped to shreds: way past the bald stage, exposing what the tire is made of. I see that the tire is flat. All the tires are flat. The front of the truck slants down, at an angle. Nicole has to be at a wedding at 8:30, and it's 7:52 now! I think of my options. I could run back to my dad's house and have him give us a ride to Nicole's house, or we could just walk on to her house. We're pulled off to the side of the road just south of the bridge. I talk and flirt with Nicole. I tell her I would want a date with her tonight. She says she would want a date with me too. In saying that I expose my long withheld feelings of attraction towards her. I'm going to back the truck up so it's way off the shoulder of the road. I put it in reverse but there isn't enough power to back up. The truck rolls forward and I try to ease off the clutch and let reverse kick in, but it doesn't. There are some white trash beer-drinking men on the side of the road. I feel protective of Nicole, from them. I want to back up, so I try to stop and brake, and then back up. I step as hard as I can on the brake pedal but I keep rolling. So I put the truck in first gear and pull out into the ditch-type median, to get back to where I was. I'm driving on the rims. The traffic is going fast both ways."
"1280"	"(11/04/1997)"	"Walk and Talk I walk and talk with my friend Melanie McDyss. I walk with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas down a sidewalk on the Brimson campus. I tell her that I was in very bad mood, feeling extremely anxious, petty, grumpy, and crabby."
"1281"	"(11/04/1997)"	"Preserved Heads I walk in a very large old house. Many people live there, like a huge extended family. I'm near the top floor. There are many old things being stored there. There are preserved heads and other parts of dead people. Some of these are painted. Some are in jars. I see one or two heads that are mounted, like they were heads of a deer that were mounted. From the neck up the head is there, and it looks real."
"1282"	"(11/04/1997)"	"Floating Man There is a man who floats down a river with many rapids. He is wearing a protective suit that is filled with air to cushion him. There is a tunnel that he began from, maybe on the top floor of a house (maybe the house from the previous dream)."
"1283"	"(11/04/1997)"	"Old Redding Farm I am at, or I see, the Redding farm. It looks like a time in the 1970's. Some of the buildings are incomplete: without roofs. There are people there. I see my uncle Donnie Redding when he is younger."
"1284"	"(11/04/1997)"	"Magma Explosion I say to my classmate Zack Simmons that I would bet him that magma will flow out of the earth's crust, and will overflow. I think it will. He says he doesn't think so. It could be an explosion: a catastrophe!"
"1285"	"(11/05/1997)"	"Washing Machine Torture My friend Kevin Simpson or my housemate Jack Thigpen drives me home to Oak Valley. He pulls up on the stretch of boulevard that lies between my neighbors the Robbins' and the Christianson's houses, on Next Ave. We are returning from the Big Resort Area. We're on the grass of what seems to be somewhere near by, maybe the Otis' house on the southeast corner of 2nd Street and Next Avenue. We're packing up our stuff: a pack and a tent or tarp. We do this packing secretly. A police car is coming. We hurry with our packing. As the male police officer pulls up we are putting our stuff in a bag. He asks us some questions, and we respond. He doesn't have any idea what we are doing. He has blue tarp. There is a game of throwing marbles or tiny balls at a pillar or target circle. The officer wants to try this. I've been good at this in the past, but I throw once and miss by a lot. I'm in recreation room. My sister Ramona is throwing a marble at a square support pillar in the room. The marble bounces back to her. She does this repeatedly. It doesn't appear that she'll make a mistake any time soon. I want to try this. I'm in a room watching a pornographic video. My dad and sister Heather are there. There is a woman hooked up to a washing machine in the video. He legs are bound and something is putting pressure on her vagina. The machine bends and stretches her, putting pressure on and squeezing her legs and body. This is erotic. We seem to take turns masturbating, sitting or laying on some sort of trunk or box. The lady in the video is being tortured. Baseball is on television. Someone hit a foul ball. There are several bunk beds in the room. Joe Girardi is up to bat, and he hits a home run. I ejaculate when he does this. My high school classmate Binky Ahmed asks me why the Minnesota Twins didn't win the World Series. It seems that we've been watching the 1987 National League Championship Series. I say, and he says, that it's the little things that count: like the turning of a double play or having people on the disabled list."
"1286"	"(11/05/1997)"	"Fast Growing Rabbits White rabbits are all over. They grow up in seconds or minutes, right before one's eyes! One may turn into or be a carrot. There are many small white wolves. They howl, and I howl at them through a fence. There is a drug given to the rabbits to keep them from growing too big or too fast."
"1287"	"(11/05/1997)"	"Cold Fishing I'm at my friends the Ramos' house. My housemate Stephen Ramos is on the phone with his father Franco. Stephen asks me if I want to go walleye fishing tomorrow, which is Saturday. I ask him if it's ice fishing. He says no, but it's hard-core cold open water fishing, on Rock Lake. I say, ""Yeah, okay!"""
"1288"	"(11/05/1997)"	"Three $100 Bills My family's friends Murielle Long and some of her daughters are going to Madison, Wisconsin. My mom and I are planning on going with. Longs have gotten a light brown station wagon. They also have a new maroon colored truck. My mom and I decide not to go. I'm speaking with Murielle. She is sitting in the driver's seat of her car. She gives me three $100 bills. I'm very surprised! We talk about her son and my friend, Mark Long. The money seems to have come from him. I think of Mark. I tell Murielle that I pray to or for Mark when I do pray. I'm at home. There are five messages on the answering machine. The first message is from Mr. Peterson, who got my number because he thinks my sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson is or was at my house. My sister Heather left three angry messages, telling me to get down to where she is so we can go to Madison. I'm not going to call her back, and I'm not going to Madison, because I don't want to. I talk on the phone with Becky Long, and I get her confused with my cousin Anna Strange."
"1289"	"(11/05/1997)"	"Blind Olie Kecker I'm with a blind man. I ask him about the experiment I saw involving him, where a video camera focused on an image or object stimulated the movement of pins on his back to help him ""see"". We walk in his home. We go into a room, which may be my brother Wally's room. We stay in the room for a while. The man can drive. I drive a vehicle down 3rd Street in Oak Valley. He follows me. I turn to go home. He goes around back to the driveway, and I park in the front. The man is my high school basketball teammate Olie Kecker. Olie pulls into the driveway, only slightly brushing the lilac bushes by the garbage cans. I think that he has really memorized every detail of the route he just drove. He drives his red Chevrolet Cavalier."
"1290"	"(11/05/1997)"	"Suicide Remembered There is a man who committed suicide. He stood on a ledge with a thick yellow rope wrapped around him and his neck and he jumped. He jumped, and landed on a ladder that was upright. The ladder gorged him more than anything else. I am there. The man is on the ledge, going to jump with thick yellow rope around him and his neck. The noose is loose: it hangs down on his chest and stomach. The event of his death is reenacted, but we keep the man from jumping. People from the anthropology department at Brimson are there. I see my old professor Harold Gunther. I take up the slack rope lying on the ground so the man can't jump."
"1291"	"(11/05/1997)"	"Cow Slaughter House I walk with my dad and several friends. We go by the end of a building where slaughtered cows are hanging. It smells terrible! We can see a bloody mess inside the building. We go around the side of the building and into a door. We walk through several rooms, in succession. We are going to order food. I get two bottles of Leinenkugels beer, and my dad gets a maple flavored Leinenkugels. The man asks to see my identification. I show it to him. He tries to sell me parts of fake ID's for underage people to use. We sit down. Our food is really fried and greasy. The atmosphere is dark. We're close to the room with the slaughtered cows in it. My brother Wally may be there."
"1292"	"(11/06/1997)"	"I'm Playing Football I'm going to play football for Brimson. I sit down in a room with my classmate Will Brant and another man. I stretch my legs, sitting on the floor. I have several pairs of exercise-like pants on, which restrict my stretching movements, so I unzip the bottom of the pants and pull the legs up. I sit with my legs at a right angle, stretching my groin and hamstrings. The second man asks if I've ever done squats. I say not really. He says that strip sets are the most difficult. I understand that this is when weight is removed after each set and the person keeps doing repetitions. Football players are doing different things. I'm on a rehabilitation program, which makes my routine pretty lax. There is a lot of therapy, massage, baths, and such, and not too much work. I like this: I'm getting off easy."
"1293"	"(11/06/1997)"	"Default High School I'm in a school with my high school friend Gino Teavor. Gino's mother Eleanor is there. Gino and I make up and interpret dreams. This is kind of fun. I have a knack, it seems, for understanding, or coming up with something plausible. A woman walks by us. She is looking for the neuroscience secretary. I direct her through a door, down a long room, and to her left. I'm outside. It's cold. A woman with a baby carriage walks on the frozen, icy roads. I'm walking to Default High School. The woman and I are over near the intersection of Brimson Street and Old Avenue, near the frontage road. I walk west down the frontage road towards Default High School. I don't have a hat. I don't have a lunch ticket: I forgot it, and then realize it has run out and I need to pick up a new one. I can't get a new one at Default High School. I don't have a lunch token, and I wonder how I should pay for my lunch. Pizza pockets are being served. I walk around what seems to be the new dormitory at Brimson. There are businesses there. It is cold and bleak outside. I walk east on High Avenue. I don't' really know where I'm supposed to go. I walk by a small restaurant, then go back when I decide I'll avoid the school lunch hassle by eating at the restaurant. I go into the place, which is a Sandwich Heaven. Daphne and Sara Booker, acquaintances, are sitting at a table next to the door when I enter. I walk farther in. My dad and Grandpa Redding are there. I'm surprised because I was just thinking of when I would see them together. Grandpa is smoking. He has an old wrinkled face. I go over to them and shake their hands. There is a crowd of people I know here, which strikes me as odd, but fortunate. My sister Ramona, cousins Rich, Melvin and Melissa Redding, uncle Rusty Redding, and others are there. My dad is playing pool on a small table: like bumper pool without the bumpers. I ask Melvin and Rich how they're doing. Rich's back is better. He has been running with no shirt and his back and shoulders are very tan, but are sun burnt and peeling. I'm on Main Street in Oak Valley between Bill's Deli and the intersection of Main Street and the Thru Highway. I'm on the north side of the road or on the median. Rusty is with me. He talks about different angles of a suntan, particularly on one's back and neck. There is a billboard advertisement for a flavor of Grolsch beer."
"1294"	"(11/06/1997)"	"Sushi With Melanie I'm with my friend Melanie McDyss. We've parked outside a building, maybe a restaurant. We're inside a porch-like area. She tells me her friend Erica Lange won't be able to make it on Friday, but that there is a sushi restaurant we could go to. She says I'd have to set my briefcase on beer in bottles made of fish (and sit on it?). This seems erotic. I'm interested. We walk out the door to leave as a man, woman, and their child walk in. We get in my housemate Jack Thigpen's car. I'm driving. I see a parking ticket in a big orange-yellow envelope under the passenger side windshield wiper. I get out and remove the ticket. I'm annoyed and agitated. There is a man who is attending to the building, and I ask him, in my thickest Australian accent, where the ""no parking"" sign is that resulted in me getting this ticket. He tells me that the band-aid fell off the sign. The band-aid is the sign. I get angry and I protest that I got a ticket despite there being no sign posted. He says it's still illegal if you take longer than you normally would. I'm mad! I get in the car. Melanie supports me, as if she is my girlfriend. There is a long line of cars behind me. The area by the building has very sandy, dry soil. There are rows of trees or bushes planted: an orchard or vineyard. I start to drive slowly, with all the cars behind me. I want to lay rubber but I don't because if I stall the vehicle I'll look like a fool trying to be ""cool"" in front of Melanie. I give the engine fuel and slowly release the clutch."
"1295"	"(11/06/1997)"	"Jose Ramos' Buck With A Bow I hear that my friend Jose Ramos has shot a four point buck with his bow. I'm outside a house talking with people about this. I ask if Jose saw other deer. I'm inside the house at a small gathering at a table. Many people suddenly arrive, including my friends Elise Rooks, Nate Nelling, and other old friends from High School. We all hug each other, talk, and drink beer. In the refrigerator are a small cake and some liquor that someone has brought for me, for my birthday. My family is staying the night in this place. It seems we're the guests of a couple, who are my mom's friends the Lapmans, but don't look like the Lapmans. I argue with George Lapman about dreams. I vehemently say he is wrong! We need to leave early the next morning to drive somewhere. We need to have left by 8:00am, and I know it will take 1.5 hours to get ready, so I set the alarm for 6:30am."
"1296"	"(11/06/1997)"	"Erica Lange Drives There is a group of people that are traveling in a minivan. I want to take a turn driving. We get ready to leave, and my classmate Erica Lange gets in the driver's seat. I'm mad: she knew I wanted to drive, and I thought she had agreed to this."
"1297"	"(11/06/1997)"	"Explosive Fire Mountain I'm at a mountain where skiing takes place. I'm with a group of people at the base of the mountain at a picnic-like park area. It's autumn, and the leaves on the trees are brilliant yellow, orange, and red. My friend Jimmy Youngman, his father, and his younger sister are among the group. People in our group watch for fire on the mountainside, which can spread like lava. It's hard to see if any flames are there with all the colorful leaves. I watch the mountainside for a bit, and then someone else takes a turn watching. A man winds up a fluorescent orange fire hose. A person things they see smoke! Everyone starts running away. There are three carloads of people in our group. Two of these carloads of people leave. I yell to Jimmy, his father, and his sister, who are walking closed to the base of the mountain. I wave my hand in the air, like I'm waving a handkerchief in the circle as a motion to ""round 'em up"", because there is about to be a fire. They run away from the mountain as fast as they can, fearing for their lives. It seems as if the fire is an eruption: an enormously powerful event that will raze everything in its path. My housemate Stephen Ramos and I run back up to the parking area, via a road. We move swiftly. This doesn't pose a life threat to me. I think we'll have time to get away. Stephen tosses me the keys. I go to get our minivan, and then will go pick him up with Jimmy and his family at the road to leave."

Matt and I are going to pick out a movie. There is one we're planning on getting, but then he wants to get a different movie, Primal Fear, so we get it. We go to the counter to pay. Matt gets a plastic bottle of soda and I tell the man I want one of the two quart bottles of orange juice that are in the cooler. He tells me the total is $29.95! This man is a trickster: a swindler. He's trying to be sneaky and take my money. I give him a $5 bill. He takes the bill, which is in an envelope. He has no right to do this. I take the envelope and open it, knowing it's a federal crime to open mail that isn't yours. The man follows me to the car, pestering me. He is very skinny. I brush him away. I don't want to exert any strong physical force, though I know I could beat his sorry ass in a second. I try to open the door to my car and the key breaks off. I'm man, and unlucky because I just want to get away from this man. I get into the car the key breaks off in the ignition! I yell at my sister Ramona, who is in the car smoking. I tell her to come and get me to leave."
"1299"	"(11/07/1997)"	"Get Out I'm at my friend Hilary Nano's apartment on High Avenue. I may have been drinking alcohol. She and I have just arrived. She walks back to a bedroom. I follow, tentatively. In the last bedroom are Hilary, her friend Annette Gollum, and Annette's boyfriend Travis Hampton. Travis is crying. He has short light brown hair. The mood is somber: someone has died, it seems. I'm in a flirtatious mood as I walk back to the room. Travis greets me somberly. Annette is distraught. I'm outside the room. Hilary is inside, next to a bed. She looks at me and firmly says, ""Get out."" I hang my head, turn, and go out. I feel hurt and ignored. Hilary doesn't follow me, though I want her to so we can have a sexual encounter."
"1300"	"(11/07/1997)"	"Beast In My Closet I'm naked in my bed under the blankets at the Whitman house in the morning. [I'm conscious that the morning in the dream is the same morning that I actually had the dream.] My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson comes into my room eating graham crackers. She goes into a room to the south of mine and to the east of my housemate Stephen's room. I grab some socks and a pair of white underwear that are lying on the floor next to my bed. I toss them over to my laundry bag because they are damp from semen from my masturbation. I don't Stephanie to see them so I toss them away. She comes over to my bed. We start to kiss. I am now wearing pants, but no underwear. She puts her hand down my pants. She suddenly yells in a loud and startled manner, ""Oh my god!"" She is looking up at my closet area. There is something there that is very frightening. She thinks it's like a spider. There is a sheet covering the closet space. Poking out against the sheet are two horn-like objects, like ram horns. The horns are on the head of a creature that was Jabba The Hut's assistant in the movie Return of the Jedi. I think of punching this creature right on the horns. It is throbbing. This creature is a swarm. Someone takes a green laundry bag/mosquito head net to use to contain the swarm."
"1301"	"(11/10/1997)"	"Nicole Peterson Naked My friend Nicole Peterson is in a bathroom, which may be the bathroom at the Whitman house. She is standing naked. I see her through a partially opened door. She has a very attractive body. My housemate Stephen has to go to the bathroom. She allows him to urinate through the doorway into the toilet, while the door is partially closed. She walks around naked without being embarrassed about doing so. She is incredibly attractive."

The professor says maybe I could take his car and drive her to the airport. We could take Circle Highway. Traffic would be normal workday traffic, but that would be okay. I'm in the vehicle with the woman. It seems to be a jeep. She is in the passenger seat. I'm standing in the legroom area of the passenger seat facing her. I thought she was driving. We're now in a situation where we're very close and facing each other, and there is a sexual feeling. I'm in the driver's seat then. I back out of the parking space with a boat attached to the vehicle, which is risky because I almost hit the neighboring cars. The vehicle is a stick shift. I pull out of the parking lot recklessly. I may be driving my housemate Jack Thigpen's Isuzu Trooper."
"1304"	"(11/10/1997)"	"Naked Drunk Flirting Melanie I think my friend Melanie McDyss is sick so I go to her room. She's not there, and I leave her a note. I go out and she is coming out of the bathroom wrapped in an orange towel. She seems aloof and absentminded. She goes into another person's room, but quickly backs out when she realizes it's not her room. She walks across the hallway to her room. I'm sitting on a couch. Someone is sitting on a crumpled up blanket on my left, and Melanie is on my right. Melanie is naked, and sits with her legs bent, knees up towards her chest, and her arms folded across her chest. I see the top of her breasts. She is leaning up against me pressing really hard, flirting. I feel awkward: not sure of how I should react to this. Then I realize Melanie is drunk! She giggles as I say this to her: she is very flirtatious. My housemate Stephen and I and another man poke fun at Melanie for being drunk. We dance around her in a triangle. I think it's odd that she is drunk when I thought she was sick."

When I get to the corner of Holy Avenue and 1st Street Wally is there with the Carter principal Candy Bevner and my third grade teacher Liza Minikel. There are leaving, and Wally is done early so he is going with them. I talk with Candy and Liza about studying at the University of Wellington. They ask me questions about it, and I explain. We may talk about financial aid information."
"1306"	"(11/10/1997)"	"That's Not Right I'm in a class where the professor is my professor Jerry Rice. I have told one of my dreams, and the class is discussing it. Jerry asks me a direct question about the content of a dream and its meaning, saying, ""...isn't that right?"" as he is one of his long tangents. I firmly say, ""No! That's not right!"" I then go on to explain why it isn't right and point out a flow in the method Jerry is using. I say people may propose interpretations or ideas for the dreamer, but it is entirely up to the dreamer to evaluate each and take the concepts that he or she finds useful. One should not pose a direct question to the dreamer, by saying, ""Isn't that right?"". My firm and clear knowledge of what I'm saying impress Emilia, the woman that sits in front of me in my Brain, Mind and Behavior class. She says she wants to work with me. There are caramel rolls there. Jerry comes up to me and apologizes. He explains his error, his reasoning, and fault. We talk. December 10th is the due date for the Laird Addis stuff. The mail of one person is being distributed to the people there. I get some stamps form Publishers Clearing House. The Playboy stamp is among them."
"1307"	"(11/10/1997)"	"Two Latinos and a PINE I'm traveling on an L-train with my classmate Fred Potter, my classmate Matt, and others. They all live above the Red Rooster Shop. I see the building they live in. It is small and may have a glass front like the Rax Restaurant in Wilmerton had. There is a gathering at our Whitman house. A window breaks because Fred throws a brick through it. I walk out on the roof to fix the window. There is a large open space with lawn chairs, and a very steep part of the roof that forms a ""V"", in which there is a completely rusted old 10-speed bicycle. I think this is why my housemates Stephen and Norman wanted the large rooms: they get their own patio, one out back and one out front. I'm downstairs. Someone tells me two men have showed up and want to speak with the people who live in the house. I walk over to the two men as they start to walk down a set of stairs, and I say to them, ""Can I help you guys?"" They come up to me and I go with them into the kitchen. They are in their mid-twenties, have accents and darker skin: they seem like Latino men. They tell me that they want their PINE, which has been thrown into a garbage can, and they want it back. I'm a bit confused. I think they're talking about a small green tree. Then I realize PINE is a computer program that they copied without permission, and it's on a disk. They will use force to get it if we don't provide it: they'll beat us up. We start looking for the disk, though I know we don't have it. My friends Holly Lapson, Jill Banks, and others are there at a table. They know of our plight: that we are in trouble if we don't come up with the disk, and that we don't have it! I ask them, knowing full well the answer, if they have the disk or know where it is. I do this to stall, and keep from getting beaten up. Norman gets on the phone to call for help. One of the men realizes what he is doing, and picks up the other phone to listen to Norman talk, while he tells the other man to turn up the music so Norman won't hear him listening. I run up to my room and grab the wooden baseball bat I have there, and find a second bat, which I toss to Norman. We'll use these to beat the men and protect ourselves. One man is on the phone in Stephen's room. I push the door partially open and swing the bat at his head. I miss. This doesn't faze me: I'll get him."

He is sitting in the big brown armchair in front of the wooden shelf and mirror that has many religious artifacts on it. Nat's hair is wet from sweat. He says that I have caused him to sweat, and that now because of his wet head he is getting sick."
"1309"	"(11/11/1997)"	"Jack's Heater Confrontation I argue with my housemate Jack Thigpen about the heater in his room. I sit down at the kitchen table at home in Oak Valley. I am overbearing and firm. Jack says he doesn't want to look me in the eyes. Then he does. I look right at him and tell him he can't leave his heater on when he's not in his room, or else he has to give us $45 for the electricity he'll use by doing so."

I leave really early and say good luck to a younger basketball player from my high school, Ryan Barnes, as I go out of the locker room. Ryan, who I think is playing in the game that is going on now, then follows me up the stairs. I sit among people and watch the game. I have a broomstick. I sit and stretch. I reprimand a younger kid who is sitting there for his foolish talk. The team that is playing is really bad."

He tried to unlock the door, but it is during business hours so the door is open, and by trying to do so he actually locks it. He then tries to open the door and realizes what he's done, so he unlocks the door and goes inside. I'm at the bar of the restaurant with my friend Niles Zelling. I tell him he has to call me when his is coming to the bar so I can came and spend time with him. The man who locked and unlocked the door is there."

I buy it and go back out to the truck where we discover that one of the bottles is missing a cap. The caps are small and white. I go back in to get a new case. They are all out of cases of 40's, so I try to just get one bottle to replace the one without the cap. The man can't find the key to the refrigerator or cabinet where the 40's, so he gives me the spare key. I can't find the place where the 40's are kept, though I look. I go out to the truck to get Kevin, because I know he has the main key to where the 40's are. I ask him where the key is. He shows me it's on his key chain. I tell him to come back in and return the key! We go in. The man is preparing a cooler and a box of beer to appease us. It is filled with large 20 or 30-ounce cans of beer. There is a hole in the wall, where the concrete is broken to see if there were any 40's, but there are none, only other beer. Kevin and I take the cooler and the box of beer and put it in the bed of the truck. Kevin has a flat spare tire in the bed. At first when I see the tire I think it's great that he has finally gotten a spare tire, but it doesn't do much good when it is flat. We are on a road trip. I am in a car with my friend Matt Yams, his brother Jasper, and Kevin. We drive by a large building with large stone walls. This is the Great Wall, and is a landmark and sight seeing destination, which seems to be in the vicinity of Quarryville. Kevin wants to turn in and visit since we're on a road trip, and we're supposed to have fun. Jasper is going to college and tells us that when he leaves for college he will be picked up next to Superhighway 100. he has to go by the side of the highway and wait."
"1313"	"(11/11/1997)"	"Lucid Grade School Guys I'm near Granger Field at Brimson. I'm sweeping and cleaning dirt, sand, soil, and leafs off benches. It's a groundskeeper-like job that I find degrading. A man is there who says there is a party at the Whitman house. I go up to him and tell him to uninvite all of his friends because the party is invitation only. My grade school classmates Gino Teavor, Eric Stoner, Jerry Kasper, Patrick Bergman, and Matt Yams come up to me one by one, until we're standing in a group. There is another man there. I greet three of them, which includes Gino and Matt, by shaking their hand, and to the others I give a half-hearted ""Hi"". I don't' respect the others, and though I respect the first three, we have no real connection. I see my mom and my family. I realize that because all these people are here I must be dreaming. I see a short kid with light brown hair and I turn him into a woman. She is also short and has shorter light brown hair. I walk towards her and she smiles at me. I get near her and she has turned a bit to her left as if to walk off. I touch her arm to get her attention. We kiss and fall to the ground. We have sex, with most of her clothes on. She is on top. Then she is naked, and we roll over. I rub her chest, which is slippery with moisture. I rub her clitoris and realize that the flesh I feel is my foreskin. We flip over and have sex on her side."
"1314"	"(11/12/1997)"	"The Gas Chamber An upper-class woman and others are being chased. She runs from men because she has no freedom. She runs through a hotel-like place where she has come to stay. I'm running through the hotel. I go through many rooms, which are part of her huge suite. There are many bedrooms, bathrooms, and living areas. One room has a pitcher of milk and a small table. I run through these chambers, going up and down stairs, hiding. I run outside. I'm running with my high school classmate Sara Cushing. People throw grenades at us. We throw back vitamins, which are bombs. We shoot guns and kill many of the murderers. We run, and enter a place where there are bowling alleys to the left. Sara goes to hide in back of the lanes. I run into a room. From this room I go to a door that won't open all the way. Someone is above the door holding it closed because they don't want me to go in: it isn't safe. I enter a room on my left and close the door behind me. The door has a two-pronged latch to fit into an eyelet. I don't lock the door. I quickly go into a room and close and close the door behind me. The door immediately locks: I hear it click. As soon as the latch locks a small black machine with one large and two small tubes begins pumping poisonous gas into the room. I realize I'm going to die. There are metal bars enclosing me in the room, separating me from the gas machine. I shudder when I see a cold naked dying person curled up on the floor. I cover my mouth and nose. I know I'm dreaming."
"1315"	"(11/12/1997)"	"The Key I'm scuba diving alone. Ice covers the surface of the water. I slide through a small hole on my mission. I sink down into the dark and realize I forgot the light. I swim back up to the hole and remove the hole cover to get a light. But no one gives me a light. I create a light in my hand. I make it through a chicken coop-like area. I can't breath well at first, but this gets easier. I think of how hard it would be to share a mouthpiece underwater. I see the key that is my goal to obtain. Cautiously I move the key towards me: I don't want to just walk in the room where the key hangs. I get the key and run! My friends Nate Nelling, Tom Napper, Emily Zates, and others are there. We run in a chicken coop-like area. The floor is dust, dirt, cobs and chips. The ceiling is very low. There are pool tables in this subterranean-like area. We move quickly. The ceiling becomes lower: we crawl. We get to an ""out"" door for August. I've gone too far: I was supposed to exit at July. I exit here. I follow Nate out, squeezing through a small square space. As I emerge a woman is there. We're in a workplace area. She asks and I tell her about my disability: I have come back just to look, not to work. My mom and my brother Wally are there. We're going to leave. I pack up my dirty laundry. There is a woman with colored stamp pads. I put on my Redson basketball shirt and my red checkered shorts. I turn my shorts around, because they're on backwards. My grade school principal, Candy Bevner, sees this."
"1316"	"(11/12/1197)"	"Backwards Underwear I'm in a place with several connected rooms, like it is one big long room. My grade school classmates Misty Ryan and Sonya Nittles are there at the opposite end of the room than I. My white brief underwear are on backwards."
"1317"	"(11/13/1997)"	"Jeff Bautsch's Car I'm at home in Oak Valley in the kitchen with some friends, including Tim Zelling, Jeff Bautsch, Nat Miller, and others. Some of the guys have been drinking. Someone needs to go and get Jeff's car. I 'm the one to do this because I'm sober. I ask my mom if I can use her car for a half hour. I go into her bedroom, where she is, to ask her this. She says I can use the car. I need anther person to drive with me so they can drive the other car back. Tim can go. I ask him if he would do this, otherwise it will have to be Nat or Jeff, if they're not drunk. Jeff's car is over by the Hancock Center."
"1318"	"(11/13/1997)"	"OJ Recipe Book I'm in my sister Heather's apartment with her and her boyfriend. He is reading a huge 700-page novel. I look through a huge book of recipes with orange juice in them."
"1319"	"(11/14/1997)"	"Tornadoes Coming I wrestle with my friend Nat Miller: we fight. He is aggravated because I've made fun of him regarding something to do with women. We see a map of Montana. Tornadoes are coming, many of them: all over! I return home. On the way I stop a middle-aged man who is jogging and tell him about the tornadoes."
"1320"	"(11/14/1997)"	"Stealing Phone Numbers It's Halloween. I open the doors to a place where a big party is going on. People dressed in black rush out and bombard and surround me. Someone steals a piece of paper from my back right pocket, amidst the crowd. I feel this and turn around as the person runs away. I chase them. It is my housemate Norman's girlfriend Sunny Pile. She and Norman are looking for a phone number that they think I have. They thought I took a yellow piece of paper with a number on it, but I didn't. I react violently. I severely verbally reprimand them both, saying, ""What the fuck were you doing? What did you think you'd find?"" Norman mumbles, ""I knew we wouldn't find anything."" I move about the party and pick up my two pieces of yellow paper with phone numbers on them, to ensure that they don't find the number that I have. I do have what they are looking for. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is standing at the party. I see her as I pick up the papers. There is a tiny dead northern pike on the ground. My brother Wally is suddenly there, in town on business. I'm happy to see him and I suggest we go to a bar. Norman has lost his ID, which is fine with me because I don't want to be with him. Wally suggests we go somewhere where Norman can come with. I don't want to do this, but I agree to do so."
"1321"	"(11/14/1997)"	"Police Woman Arrested I am at home. There is a female police officer there. She is arrested for murder. I have blaze orange clothing in the garage. I say it will be gone by Sunday: I will move it. I have a small silver colored handgun: a pistol."
"1322"	"(11/14/1997)"	"Looking For A Good Bicycle I am on a bicycle in the early morning. I am near a car wash reading a book. My sister Ramona may be there with a broken down car. I look for a good bicycle."
"1323"	"(11/14/1997)"	"My Job Is To Bring Peace A pay phone is ringing. I walk over and answer it. It's my dad. He says, ""Hello Kenneth Marshall..."" He has called to tell me his life story, essentially. There is a battle going on between archery and firearm people. I wear a blaze-orange coat. A voice tells me that I have to find the middle ground between the groups. I say I sure do like snakes, not elk. Something happens with a mirror and a booger. Something may also happen with shit, which may be a figure of speech. I am an archer. I look for gloves. My job is to bring peace between the two groups. It's cold and snowy."
"1324"	"(11/17/1997)"	"The Answering Pen I'm in my Brain, Mind, and Behavior class. It is in one of the large quad rooms in Wonkers Hall. My friends Melanie McDyss and Erica Lange are in the class. We're going over a test that was just returned to us. I got a 54 on the test, which was the highest score. Melanie got a 53. This is the first time I've ever scored higher than Melanie. We are all asked the question, ""How do we know... (something)?"" I answer something about the bipolar spatial map in the brain. There is another question that one got credit for if they put their name, as if that is proof for their being. My answer was about driving by the Powerton power plant, where I remember something about learning a special lesson on color. When one is responding one holds a pen: the answering pen. I give the answering pen to Melanie."
"1325"	"(11/17/1997)"	"Big Bellied Black Boys I walk through an old playground. There are several rundown basketball courts there. Some little fat black kids with big bellies play basketballs on the courts. I walk by. I go onto a dock by a house. A small black boy and his friends have been catching bullheads. They have a whole metal barrel full of bullheads, swimming around in the water. The fish are three or four inches long. The kid's father yells for them to bring the bullheads in to eat. One kid is dumping the bullheads out: they are too small to eat, he says."
"1326"	"(11/17/1997)"	"Hydraulic Car I'm with a black man. The man is trying to look nondescript, to not draw attention to him. He wants to go somewhere, to leave the place where he is, and this may be escaping. I drive the car and he sits in the passenger seat. He has my push a button to use the hydraulics in the car. I do, the front and back ends of the car go up and down. It seems to be a high roller."
"1327"	"(11/17/1997)"	"Abrupt Speed Sex I'm near a cash register in a small store. There is a man younger than me working there. A man named Tom who was in my Cellular/Molecular Biology class comes up to the register. A man is having sex with a woman. They are both on their stomachs. He is lying on top of her, and she is on the floor. He is thrusting hard and very fast. She is lying there moaning. He looks at his watch while he's having sex, and then gets up and leaves with his pants partially down. The woman sits up on all fours and stretches, rotating her pelvis. I'd like to have sex with her."
"1328"	"(11/17/1997)"	"Liza Simpson's Toy Pile I ride a bicycle over the railroad tracks on Friends Ave in Wilmerton, going southbound. I'm glad to be leaving something that is behind me. The bicycle I'm riding is old and shaky, with really thin tires that could pop when I cross the tracks. I'm at Liza Simpson's (the character from the television show) toy pile. It seems to be in a trench-like area near the end of the tan colored strip mall, between the mall and the tracks. Liza or I put a bicycle with the items in the pile. It is a small three-sided sheltered area with things stacked up and covered with sheets. My friend Emerald Reinhold, housemate Stephen Ramos, and coworker Megan Hughes are there. We all hug, and are really close together. For no apparent reason I try to kiss Megan. I'm not particularly attracted to her, I'm just feeling amorous. I feel dumb and embarrassed for doing this, and I leave, feeling silly."
"1329"	"(11/17/1997)"	"Dark Urine I urinate. My urine is very dark in color, like apple cider or tea: brown. I may be urinating in a bathtub."
"1330"	"(11/17/1997)"	"Hippie House I'm in a big old house in Metropolis. I walk up flights of stairs, heading for the attic. The house has a hippie-esque quality to it, with pastel tie-dyed items displayed. My aunt Willow Redding lives here. My sister Heather has come her to get something, maybe help or advice, from Willow. In the attic my mom is working on the floorboards. I sit down. The boards are not nailed in place. Some boards flip up. My mom and I put them back in order as best we can. There is a space underneath the floorboards."
"1331"	"(11/17/1997)"	"Class Party I'm in a store in the Uptown Mall. I leave and pass my classmate Robyn Masters on the way out. I go out to a vehicle parked in the Dayton's parking lot. I'm having a party for a class in my home. All my classmates are invited. My friend Kathy Branch, her mother, and younger sister arrive. Her younger sister has a fat face. Kathy and her mother look very much alike, and I comment to her on this. My aunt and uncle Rusty and Sheila Redding and their kids Rich, Melvin, and Melissa arrive. Grandma and grandpa Redding are there, though I don't see them. My aunt Elaine Grains is there. My childhood friend Tim Robbins arrives through the front door. Robyn Masters isn't at the gathering, though she is in the class. Two women from Europe can't make it to the party either. We all start to sing Edelweiss, like we do at normal family gatherings. I sing, but I feel uncomfortable because there are people here in my class who aren't used to this type of singing."
"1332"	"(11/17/1997)"	"My Horny Harem I'm in a room with a table. My housemate Stephen Ramos and I leave and walk down a hallway. I realize that I've left my keys on the table. Stephen is being a jerk. I go back to get the keys. I get one key from a man who is near the table. That key has a green top (the part that one holds). The man tells me that my classmate Arlete has the rest of my keys. I'm in a dorm room. He points me in the general direction of her room. I look for her room, but don't know which one it is and can't find it. I knock at a room where the door is partially open and I walk in a bit. There are several women in the room that tell me that Arlete has moved out. The room is larger then: it seems like a quad room in Wonkers hall. It has bunk beds, desks, clothes, and makeup all over. There are five or six women there that are in their first year in college. One woman is in front of me. She pulls up and takes off her red sundress. She is naked underneath it, and has a very attractive body. I quickly say, ""Pardon me!"" and turn away, so as not to look at her. A tall blond women wearing moderately heavy makeup says to me, ""Do you want to fuck her?"" and indicates the naked woman. I say no, and I act surprised. I'm most surprised that the blond woman asked such a forward question. After the initial surprise, I would have had sex with the naked woman. The idea didn't cross my mind until the blond woman suggested it. All of the women in the room are very horny. One of them says my name when talking to me. I ask her how she knows my name, because we've never met. She says, ""I am a woman...(I forget the exact wording, but it involves the word 'cotton', the idea of maxi pads and menstruation, and the idea of getting her sexual and reproductive needs satisfied by being on the lookout for men). This is how she knows who I am: I'm a potential sexual partner. I take this to mean she has an interest in me, because she knows something about me. I ask all the women if one of them could lend me a door key for the dorms. Six or seven women scramble to get me a key! I really enjoy the attention and admiration, but I play it down and try to act ""mature"". I leave, and a shorter woman follows me. She has a big crush on me. I'm near the door and there are stairs behind me. I push the woman away from me, down the stairs, and then I grab her arm at the last minute before she hits the steps and let her down easy. She seems to be hopelessly infatuated with me. I ask her name, and she says, ""Europe"". I say, ""That's a pretty name."" I walk out on campus. I needed a door key to get back in the dorm. I am walking by a big psychology barbeque. Many bratwursts are being cooked. I wander over to it carrying a box of potato chips. My high school classmates Gino Teavor and Binky Ahmed are at the barbeque. I talk to them about a poker game. My mom is there. I talk to her about where to sit. She tells me there is a table with a small red cooler at hit over in the corner. This is where I should sit because the person with that cooler is with me, in my group. My dead friend Mark Long is there, with a small red cooler as well. He seems very happy and free, and is having a good time. The group of first-year women is there. I don't want to be too forward with them, but I do desire their attention and affection."
"1333"	"(11/18/1997)"	"Darth Vader's Ba Ba Boey I'm lifting weights with my friend Tiny Combs. He plays Ba Ba Boey's song ""Ether Can Eat A Big Fat Dick"". There is a line in the song that I have not heard before. Darth Vader speaks this line. I am about to do bench press, but I don't feel very strong. I haven't lifted weights in a long time and am very out of shape."
"1334"	"(11/18/1997)"	"Robyn Masters Hunting I'm near a CD player, which is between the tennis courts and the biology pontoon parked next to the courts at Brimson. My classmate Robyn Masters walks by wearing blaze orange. She has been deer hunting. I kind of want to talk to her, and ask her about her hunt: to be social again. She walks by and I say nothing. I gave two CD's to my brother Wally. The CD's belong to my classmate Lexi Mondragon. I have three or four CD's to listen to, but nothing really good. There is a white plastic pipe underground that my housemate Stephen Ramos has drilled through. He stands and talks with some guys. I tell him he won't be able to fit through the hole he drilled."
"1335"	"(11/18/1997)"	"Dirty Blankets I'm in my room with my friends Holly Lapson, Emerald Reinhold, and Terry Foss. They comment on how dirty my blankets are."
"1336"	"(11/19/1997)"	"Poor Grocery Shopping I'm going grocery shopping. I hurry and buy the items I need. I get two gallons of milk. I have trouble finding the fat free gallons with the pink cap and label. There are some gallons of condom milk. This milk has something to do with putting a condom-like apparatus on the cow's udder. I may pick some condom milk up, but I put it back. I get three loaves of white bread. I go to the cash register. My friend's sister Roberta Hacker is the cashier. She gives me a blank check and signs it. The bill comes to $19.18. I'm going to use the check to pay for the groceries. When I start to write in the amount I make a mistake writing, so I can't use the check. I get out a $20 bill and pay. My mom is in the parking lot. She has come to get me: to visit or something. I'm out in the parking lot near the back of a truck. My groceries are in another truck. Another man is there. He is either my housemate Stephen Ramos or Norman Noman. I see that he has bought wheat bread; I bought white bread. I didn't buy any meat. The absence of wheat bread and meat makes me feel like my shopping is incomplete, and poorly done. There is a sewing machine in the parking lot. A man and woman take the sewing machine and start carrying it to their truck. It belongs to my mom. My mom goes over to the people to get the sewing machine back."
"1337"	"(11/19/1997)"	"The Impressive Man I'm on a college basketball team playing with my friend Jimmy Youngman and others. Jimmy gets a slam-dunk. I get in the game at the end of the first half. The team we're playing is comprised of all black players, including my classmate Chuck. I say we should match up on defense. I want to match up with a heavier, more muscular man, who isn't one of the tallest guys on the team. It is tough to play the game: I'm rusty. I travel and the referee makes the call late, right at the end of the half. There are a lot of turnovers. The ball is thrown out of bounds a lot. Our coach yells at the referee for making the late call. The referee calls a technical foul on the coach. I jog into the locker room, and in doing so run on 1st Street and Home Avenue in Oak Valley. I go back and stop of the northwest corner of that intersection, where my neighbor Donald Branson used to live. I don't know the new people who live there. I knock on the door and a man answers it wearing a bathrobe. I say I just wanted to stop by because we haven't met. He says he has to urinate. He tells me we have met when I was walking down the alley behind our neighbors the Knife's house. I don't remember because I was drunk. I feel dumb because of this. I say I remember meeting him. He uses karate or tai chi to throw me up against a wall using his hand and the energy from it. I'm amazed by this power. My professor Jerry Rice is there. The three of us talk. Jerry tells us about a dream he had. I say, ""One of those dreams..."", meaning a big dream. Jerry had a dream before with a character of Harvey Gunner, the son of a hunting partner I have. The other man may be gay. He impresses me greatly. He asks me where I've heard of him, saying, ""Newsweek?"" I say yes, but I'm lying. I don't' remember. I was drunk, and embarrassed to say so."
"1338"	"(11/20/1997)"	"Lucid Shooting A Rhino I see a rhinoceros and shoot at it with my shotgun using slugs. I hit it in the body or hindquarters and it keeps running. It runs through the streets and alleys at home. I shoot at it when I can. My shots are poor: hasty. My housemate Stephen Ramos is on the stairs at home. I'm there, near the door to my room. He tells me something about where the rhinoceros came from: either it did or didn't come from the nucleus. I think it did come from the nucleus. I say this because I saw it. I tell Stephen he doesn't know what he is talking about, and that he is I because he is in my dream. He disappears."
"1339"	"(11/20/1997)"	"Hurried and Stringy Sex My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson and I go into a room and close the door. She has to be leaving soon, but I want to give her cunnilingus. I don't if she'll let me because she needs to go soon. We close the door to the room and start to kiss. I take off her pants and start to give her cunnilingus. She is above me, spreading her legs. I lick and suck her clitoris. Her clitoris is long and stringy."
"1340"	"(11/20/1997)"	"Immigrant Conditions Some immigrants that seem almost like slaves arrive at a place off a boat or plane or some transportation. There is an old wooden building there that is creaky and dank. Dirt sacks must be hauled. There is a male who shirks this job of hauling sacks until the sacks are nearly gone, and then he hauls the last one. Food is rationed and is sparse."
"1341"	"(11/21/1997)"	"Sex With Scully I'm watching an episode of the X-Files that is supposed to be scarier and have more sexual content than the other episodes. I see these events occurring, but am not there. Three men are at a baseball stadium that may be Walker Stadium in Forkville. They walk through halls that lead to a covert place. I see faces of men, with bars, cages and walls in and around them, flashed before my eyes. It is as if the men are trapped in this area. Someone is hidden or captured in the stadium. They have good seats. There are three black men with orange dreadlocks and orange hats sitting in the seats. These men are ""bad"", and have forged the ticket process so it appears they have rights to the seats. When the three good men arrive and down the crowded row to their seats one of the bad men pulls out a gun. Agent Fox Moulder from the X-Files is one of the three good men. He has a gun. He is poised, and doesn't show his gun. The three good mean are angry, and leave. Agents Dana Scully and Moulder ride on a wind boat and look for a man. Scully holds a piece of dynamite with the fuse lit, and throws it. Moulder may be an ugly and distorted alien-like being. The agents are in a room looking for a man. There is a man sleeping on a bed next to them. He may be the bad guy. Both Scully and Moulder are dying. They have sex. I am Moulder, and I have sex with Scully. We have sex in many different positions. Her disease causes her some pain. As we have sex I put my penis into a hole in the bow-like portion of a watercraft that seems to be Scully or be attached to her. This is her vagina. We have sex with her on top, I on top, both sitting, and from behind. When we fornicate doggy style my penis penetrates through her and I see it out in front of her. The man rolls over, and I think me may be sleeping. We see his brains are falling out: he's dead. Other police officers arrive. Scully and I must look elsewhere for the man. I take her clothes off as she tries to get dressed, saying that we hardly have any time left together so we should have sex. We have sex from behind, and I then slowly penetrate her anus. She says no: that it is painful. I go slowly and coax her. Her anus is really tight."

"1343"	"(11/24/1997)"	"Harvesting Hay I'm riding in a mini van with my mom that my aunt, I think Carla Redding, is driving. There is food in the front of the van. I am in back. I ask if I can have a piece of apple, which is cut up. My mom says the apples have holes in them. I say I don't care about that. Carla says, ""Good"": she is glad I don't care about the holes in the apples. We drive very close to other vehicles. The lanes are narrow and the cars are packed tight, one next to the other. It is stop-and-go traffic. We go through an area where some farmer men are harvesting hay. We drive through a field area where hay has been cut. Farmers with pitchforks move the hay. Hay bales are being made. I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and his father Franco in a large barn that the Ramos' own. We have to move hay bales. Stephen and I use a wooden cart to move the bales. I suggest we start at the near end and take the bales from that side, rather than haul bales from farther down through the narrow space along the near bales. Stephen doesn't agree with my suggestion. We move the bales in his way."
"1344"	"(11/24/1997)"	"Terry's Red Panties I'm at a party. I talk a lot with my friend Terry Foss. There is a VCR there, as well as an Atari with the game ""First Defense"". A man is there who has also played that game. He may be my friend Niles Zelling. I'm going to disconnect the VCR and hook it up downstairs. Terry comes up as I'm about to do this. I feel guilty for trying to move the VCR. My friend Yvette Ullman is downstairs, so I don't move the VCR: I abandon those plans with Terry standing next to me. I feel thwarted and embarrassed. There are some onion chips and dip there. I throw an onion chip to my classmate Jim Brown. I have a really thick, huge, tasty sandwich. Terry asks me to go on a walk with her. I agree. We go outside. Snow is on the ground. I have bare feet. I think about getting shoes, but I don't do this. My friend Kevin Simpson is standing in the front yard. He looks cold. He has a cup of beer, and says he is keeping beer cold for women. He comes with us on the walk. Terry walks ahead of us. She starts taking off her clothes while walking. She has shiny smooth red panties on. A car approaches in the distance. It's dark out. Terry quickly puts her clothes back on. We walk up a hill, and my pants fall down. Terry holds my thick sandwich. Some of the meat falls out of it. I hold it in my mouth, trying to pull my pants up. She takes the meat that I have, which is several layers thick, and holds that too. She takes a bite out of the meat sandwich."

There is a lull in the firing, and I get up and walk towards the other group. I'm in some danger of being shot, but not extreme danger. There is no reason for me to have been shot at earlier. In the other group is my friend Jose Ramos. I get to the group, and it is light out. We fire guns at a man to use the rounds of ammunition up. We don't try to hit him, or we try not to hit him. There is a belt-like pattern that I see. It is a target, and I shoot to add holes to the belt. There is a bill, from or to Brimson, that I see and show Jose."
"1346"	"(11/24/1997)"	"Freed From Fishing Haven I'm driving in my truck with my friend Amy Rancher. We're going east on 3rd Street in Oak Valley. We go past Jefferson School. I want to stop to pick up a baseball at the baseball diamond there. The Brimson men's baseball team is practicing there so I don't stop. I recognize my classmate Cory Sader among the players. We continue to drive to the Milk Stop. Someone who may be my old coworker Tom Olson drives by in a light blue truck. Both Amy and I are thirsty. We stop at the Milk Stop and go in to get something to drink. I have two $1 bills. I get a big bottle of Dr. Pepper and put it on the counter, which his facing out from the north side of the building. My former employers Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills own the Milk Stop. They both walk up by the counter. I pay for the soda, and Phoebe says, ""Thanks, son."" I am repulsed by her caustic words. I don't say anything, and turn to leave. Mike says to me, ""Looks like you've got 20,000 miles on those shorts there. How often do you wear them?"" He says this in a condescending manner. I look down at the light tan khaki colored shorts that I wore a lot when I worked for them at Fishing Haven. They are dirty and stained. I reply, ""Pretty much every day in the summer, but does it matter?"" I then say to Phoebe, ""I'm not your son, and I never will be!"" Amy, I, and a woman walk out of the store. Phoebe follows us out, preaching, saying if I return to their property I'll be trespassing: I'm not welcome. We walk over to the truck. I toss my backpack in the truck and we get in. My friend Melanie McDyss' blue backpack is near my feet, near the pedals. It is dark out. I start the truck and we drive away. Phoebe is still lecturing to us as I we drive off. I feel good revving up the engine as I pull away. I say, ""Damn! Now I can't even return to the Milk Stop to get milk!"" We come to an abrupt stop at the corner of 3rd Street and Home Avenue and turn left. There are painted demolition derby cars on the right side of the road. I think of making little notes on my keys so I remember not to trespass! It's such a habit that I'll have to make an effort to remember not to go to the Milk Stop, or I'll be inadvertently caught!"
"1347"	"(11/24/1997)"	"Jackson's Brown House I'm riding a bicycle down the hill of Bauer Avenue on the east side of Jefferson School in Oak Valley. My neighbors Luke and Wanda Stalk walk near the brown corner house at the corner of Bauer Avenue and 3rd Street. Luke wants a steak and a six-pack of ___ Red. He gives Wanda $5 to get this. I ride down the sidewalk and cut the corner on the lawn of Jackson's brown house as I turn."
"1348"	"(11/25/1997)"	"Dead Flaming Robin I'm hunting squirrels on the Brimson Campus lawn using my friends the Ramos' banana-clip .22 rifle. I see a squirrel in the distance. It runs across the tops of the tall trees. I watch it. It goes onto a high branch in front of me. It's light colored, like a baby, and kind of looks like a baby too. I aim my rifle imprecisely and fire. The animal bursts into flames and falls to the ground. I walk towards it and see that it is a robin. It is long, like it has a three-foot long stick inside it. It may still be flaming. I feel bad, guilty, about killing it, and I hurry away."
"1349"	"(11/25/1997)"	"Misty Ryan's House I'm driving down Last Avenue in Oak Valley going towards my grade school classmate Misty Ryan's house. We may be going to my friend Matt Yams' house as well. I am with others. Something may happen with the president."
"1350"	"(11/25/1997)"	"Huge Snow Trucks I'm in a snowy field area. Two people are with me. We're in a semi truck, and we disconnect the back of the truck to make it up a steep snowy hill. There is a huge snowplow and even bigger trucks than what we're in. The plow is scraping snow and corn off the top of a field. There seems to be something wrong with what they are doing."
"1351"	"(11/25/1997)"	"Snake Sex I'm with my dad at a hotel. He seems to be on disability of some sort. I may be talking with him on the phone, trying to give him directions so he won't get lost, and he'll make it here okay. We're in the hotel. There are beds and cupboards. This may be my dad's rest and relaxation time. We're in a garage area where cars are being repaired. We may be picking up our car. My dad asks to speak with one man. There is a very large man, and he may be my dad. A small snake emerges from the top of the head of this man, leaving the body as if the body were only a shell. This may happen to a woman too. The snakes seem to wrap around each other in a sexual way: lustful, sensual, and slimy. Two people have sex. I am one of the people. The woman says I may penetrate her too far. I give her cunnilingus. She is bent over so her breasts hang by her clitoris. I lick the inner edges of her vagina. She may be my ex-girlfriend Annie. She says this is smelly, and I think she may mean that my butt smells, when I am bent over giving her cunnilingus."
"1352"	"(11/25/1997)"	"Protection From Fear I'm in a bedroom that seems to be my friend Kevin Simpson's new room at his house. It's night and the house is dark. I hear a door close downstairs: someone has entered. My high school classmate Wyatt Belzer has entered despite the door being locked with a dead bolt. I know this and I yell out loud to him. We communicate. He has broken in. I want to protect myself. I have a blank handgun and there are two bullets on the floor next to the bed. The door to the bedroom is open. I groggily take the gun, load it with a bullet, and point it at the door for protection. I fall asleep. I wake up and person seems to be there in the darkness. I struggle to open my eyes and move. My slight movements are slow and weak like a baby's, even though I try with all my energy to kick the man in the room and move. I am essentially paralyzed. The person that is in the room is a black man with long dread locks. I can distinguish the outline of his head in the darkness. I try with all my might to move, but cannot. I am scared and want protection. I don't feel safe with the man here. (I may realize just prior to awakening that the profile of the head of the man is the outline of my hand. I realize this either as I awaken, or just before I awaken)"
"1353"	"(11/27/1997)"	"Backwards Hunting I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and his brother Jose by Scott Junior High in Wilmerton. We're shooting our shotguns down toward a corner of the building. We're sighting in our guns and taking practice shots. My gun is pointed backwards. I aim by looking down the stock, while the barrel is pointed back at Stephen and Jose. It is difficult to pump because I have to use the reverse motion and the gun is upside down. We shoot around people, not at them. Our bullets ricochet. This is dangerous: we hear the shots whiz through the air. I say I'm going to stop shooting now because I'm using up all of my good slugs."
"1354"	"(11/27/1997)"	"Bodybuilding Competition I'm on stage for a bodybuilding competition. I don't flex my muscles really hard when I'm on stage, but I do try to look strong and defined as I walk off the stage."
"1355"	"(11/29/1997)"	"Expensive Strawberries I'm at a deli. My high school classmate Mary Rogers works at the deli. I buy some strawberries for $1.05 per pound. Mary puts some strawberries in a plastic container until it weighs a pound. There is very much in the container, it looks like only a few ounces! My friend Bubba Hacker is there. I pay, and the bill is $2.56. I think that this is too much to pay, and I ask if they are not $1.05 per pound."
"1356"	"(11/29/1997)"	"Weak Basketball Team I'm playing basketball with my old classmates Jared Hill, Pat Stang, Jim Harris, and a man from Brimson named Steve. We have to hurry and finish the game. My teak is weak. To win, I'll need to take charge and pick up the pace."
"1357"	"(11/30/1997)"	"Shooting Electrons I'm at a swimming pool. There is a long and thin device that floats on the surface of the pool. I jump in the pool, catching the device as I submerge, and dragging part of it under water. I swim underwater, collecting the ribbon-like floating device as I float up. The device may be a NADH molecule. I shoot electrons at my neighbors Gary and Wilma Stein who are on the deck of the pool. The electrons are part of the floatation device that I have gathered in my arms. I emerge from the surface and throw the electrons at them, and then swim down and away. My brother Wally is there. I swim away, coming up for air like a dolphin or a fish jumping, and then go back down. Gary and Wilma are throwing something at me. I dive down in the aqua pool water. There is a scale of depth. I go 14-20 feet down. There is a beer cap on the bottom of the pool. The top of the cap is facing down."
"1358"	"(11/30/1997)"	"Bill Thomas At A Resort I'm in a resort area. There is a swimming pool. I put clear gel sun block on my upper body and my head. Other people are there. My ex-girlfriend's father Bill Thomas is in a second story porch reading. There are several rooms in the area. I know the people that are in each room. It is a fancy resort area that I am not totally comfortable in, though it is kind of nice."
"1359"	"(11/30/1997)"	"Big Resort Area Scooters I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson and my housemate Jack Thigpen. We're on Eagle Lake near the short Evergreen Lake portage where the river flows. We walk in the water, which goes from hip, to waist, to chest, to neck deep. It's time to get into our canoes. We have two canoes. I climb upon a floating diving raft. Kevin capsizes one canoe. He hangs onto it with his feet and goes underwater, then he emerges explosively from the water and thrusts the canoe up out of the water, flipping it over in the air. I hop in the canoe and start paddling towards Picnic Point. There is a group of women camping at the picnic point campsite, and they're playing in the water. I paddle towards the women, leaving Jack and Kevin behind, but I want them to hurry and start after me. I lose my paddle and I ask some of the women to grab it for me, which they do. We start to paddle. One of the women, who has red hair and braces, says to me, ""You don't recognize me do you?"" I realize that she is my friend from high school Holly Ball. She says I should stop over some time. I nod, but say nothing because I don't really want to stop over, and I know I won't. Three motorized scooter-like vehicles being ridden by handicapped men come down a waterfall and out onto Eagle Lake from Evergreen River. Someone says that there are a lot of there around the Big Resort Area now. I'm on some sort of scooter in the water, moving towards Round Island. My scooter loses power first, it has a low battery, and I may paddle. I don't know how it stays afloat: it is big and heavy and seems to be moving slowly. We are in a Big Resort Area museum in a city. We run through the museum laughing and joking. We go to leave. My hat, mittens, and keys are on a small table in the lobby."
"1360"	"(12/01/1997)"	"Backwards Bicycle Man I'm at the Uptown mall. There is a man on a bicycle, with a baby and some books in a basket mounted on the front of the handlebars. The man is sitting backwards on the bicycle, and is not holding onto the handlebars with his hands. He coasts across the mall towards a stand that is set up outside of Smith's Sports. He is going to crash into the stand, and he tries to brake. He can't find the brake, and then his foot hits the brake, which is a hand brake: he is lucky! Jack Krane, one of my old bosses, rides by me on a bicycle in the mall. He comes very close to hitting me. I jump back as he rides by, and he says, ""Excuse me."" I say, ""No problem"", and continue on. I see my friends Holly Lapson and Terry Foss walking. I way hi to them, particularly to Terry because I talked to her a bit last week. I move slowly. I have trouble moving when I'm nervous: it's like slow motion. I move normally when I'm relaxed. I recognize what I have to do is relax. I go to the Nordstrom's house in Oak Valley on Home Avenue to play poker with my friends Brittany Johnson and Jana Green."
"1361"	"(12/01/1997)"	"Straight Edge Lecture I go into a small neat lecture room with a group of people. We are going to hear a man give a speech. The man is a really clean-cut, straightedge type of man, and he seems religious. I go in and sit down in a chair next to a person I know. I masturbate briefly, and then stop, realize that I was just masturbating in a room full of people. I'm sitting on the floor on one end of the room next to two women I know from Brimson, but whom I'm not really friends with. The group of people is all straightedge: they don't use any drugs. People start to say their names and a bit about themselves. It goes randomly, different people speak. I share my name and that I'm interested in dream interpretation and analysis. The speaker says that at the last two meetings I have said the same thing: that I'm interested in dream interpretation and analysis. One man there, who may be the speaker, says that he is familiar with my two past lives, or that he knows I had past lives."
"1362"	"(12/01/1997)"	"Filthy Anal Masturbation I'm in my bedroom at home. I have a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey. I am masturbating. I rub the square end of the bottle on my anus. A television is on. I know that reform Jews do this type of masturbation. I look for something to put in my anus. At the foot of the bed there is a bottle of toilet bowl cleaner, which I don't use. There is a plastic bottle of cleaner, like the swan-shaped bottle of bubble bath that my mom used to have in the bathroom. It has a smooth tip, so I use it for masturbation. I have a mouthful of mouthwash. I pull the garbage over and spit the mouthwash into it. What comes out of my mouth is runny brown feces. I think this is nasty, and I smell the garbage can to see if it smells. I don't smell it, but that may be because my nose is stuffed up. I look for something to ejaculate onto. I'm worried that the room smells. I have my hand on my anus, which is wet and inflamed. I wipe my hand on my maroon shorts, which are already dirty."
"1363"	"(12/02/1997)"	"Carter Dance I'm in Carter School. I'm walking down the upstairs hallway. There seems to be a dance going on. I walk by the third grade classroom door and say hi to my old teacher Liza Minikel, who is at her desk. I may have been at the dance. I walk down near my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's door, which is open."
"1364"	"(12/02/1997)"	"Curls With Cognitive Man I'm with or near a man who is applying for the Cognitive Psychologist position at Brimson. I see my friend Nat Miller. He goes and shakes this man's hand. I go, then, too, and say my name is Kenneth, and shake hands. I'm in a hotel room where this man is staying. He rolls out an orange-red one-person dome tent structure onto one of the two double beds in the room. He is going to sleep in this tent. Other people are in the room with he and I. The tent is such that you crawl in at the foot of the bed and lay down. There isn't much room to move. At one point I'm in it and I feel claustrophobic because my head is so far from the opening at the foot of the bed. People start to do dumbbell curls with some dumbbells that are in the room. I grab some light dumbbells and move to heavier ones after I'm done with the light ones. I feel the blood pumping into my arms. I feel strong. We curl metal plates that are used for barbells. I'm outside in front of my house on the lawn. There are two older people there: a man and a woman. I do curls with barbell plates. My left hand is weaker and is spotted by my right hand. My friend Niles Zelling is there."
"1365"	"(12/02/1997)"	"I Am Pregnant I am pregnant, very pregnant. I am with my housemate Jack Thigpen. We're going to a party. I will need to go somewhere away from the party to have the baby. We meet two women who are virgins. Jack has just lost his virginity. Something involving work happens with my old coworker Lauren, from Fishing Haven, and her family."
"1366"	"(12/02/1997)"	"Swept Away There is a young black boy that flies. He is swept off the ground by the wind. I feel this: I am the boy. I float in the air, being held up by the wind. I don't want to fly. The boy doesn't want to fly. The boy wants to be on the ground! He is able to pay the bills now, and because he now has the money, he should be on the ground. The boy is up high, over a fenced-in area. I am he. I don't want to land in the fenced-in area! I'm glad when the wind blows me away from it. I turn my body so as to reduce the wind resistance so I'll fall to earth. The boy meets a black girl who is dressed in orange and is riding an orange bicycle."
"1367"	"(12/03/1997)"	"I Am Security! I'm at a party. I meet my friend Melanie McDyss' boyfriend Ben. It seems we have a connection because we start to joke, very subtly and seriously. He comes up to me and stands right in my face, and doesn't move. I'm lying on a beanbag chair. I do a mock kiss, to jokingly tell him to kiss off, or joke that I'm gay. There is a boxing glove near me. Ben talks to another man about the (harmful?) effects of eating a food with five ounces or five grams of O___ M___ (I forget). There are a lot of people at the party; many from high school. One man gets in my face. He is mad about his girlfriend and what she has been doing. He pulls me up to him by my head, dragging my lax body across the floor. I'm pretty drunk, and am jovial. I make up a rhyme of three words, something like, ""Flab, Blab, ____"", which indicates that his girlfriend has been cheating on him. The man confronting me is angry about this. He storms away. I say that my life now is college in the United States: I like the USA. But it seems I'm in Australia. I talk with people and later say that the man's girlfriend didn't really cheat on him. People laugh because of this and my non-caring attitude. Some young men laugh and call me dumb, making fun of me. I go over to them and yell that I'm kicking them out of the party. I pick up one of them and throw him over my shoulder. He doesn't resist. They yell out for someone to call security. I let out a righteous yell saying, ""I am security!"" I live here! I pick up the man and carry him outside. The whole time I do this I'm drunk. I worry about falling or faltering and doing something dumb. The atmosphere is relaxed."
"1368"	"(12/03/1997)"	"A Water Goodbye I go by the outside of a library, where my friend Melanie McDyss is talking to another person. There is a sculpture there: a piece of art that consists of different kinds of chairs lined up in a row. I see a train bridge, over the Main River. A woman is in the water swimming to her father to say goodbye. The father is leaving for one and a half weeks. When he gets back the woman will be gone ( I think on a study abroad program). I think it would be hard to say goodbye in the water."
"1369"	"(12/03/1997)"	"No Bucks And No Bulls I see some deer, including big does with fawns. I see many deer, about 10. I see some moose, including big cow moose with twin and triplet calves. I don't see any bucks or bulls. I seem to be near Carter School, near Delivery Avenue on the east side of the school. A cow moose and some calves walk right by us in the alley! An Asian man with three small children walks by. The children are the moose calves, and the Asian man may be the cow moose. There is a white goat that wanders over near me. It has curled gray horns. It has a five-gallon bucket of feed that it eats. It may have grabbed the bucket itself, or a man may have grabbed the bucket for the goat. The man is from Regions College. Two Australian kick boxers walk by in the alley. One has pads on, and the other is practicing on the padded man. The man from Regions says to me, ""You don't see that (the Australian kick boxers) much."" I agree, but there have been more in recent years."
"1370"	"(12/03/1997)"	"Against Ivory's Will I'm with my friend Ivory Alshire in her room. I want to kiss her. We carry on a lively conversation. She says she wants to hug me. I know this is a friendly, lovable-type hug. I tell her I don't want to hug her, and I don't want to hug a lot of people. I don't tell her why, but my reason is that if I hug her I'll want to kiss her more than I already do. I kiss her. We aggressively kiss and embrace each other. I move my hand down and rub her crotch on the outside of her pants. She moves my hand away. I move my hand back to touch her again. She gets mad and reprimands me, saying I don't listen. I feel guilty: I've done wrong. I wasn't taking Ivory's words and actions literally, directly, or seriously, which is how she meant them. I change from my hiking boots to my snow boots to leave and walk home. I tie the right boot before I put it on my foot, and have to untie it to put it on, and then retie it."
"1371"	"(12/03/1997)"	"Snubbed By Annie I'm with a group of people in a bedroom. My friends Bubba Hacker, Elise Rooks, Stephen Ramos, and Annie Thomas are there, among others. I'm lying with Annie on the floor, with my arm around her. We haven't seen each other in a long time. There is a sleeping bag that we use to cover up. It becomes unzipped. Bubba falls out of a top bunk onto his head. He is unhurt. I'm showing Bubba and Annie sketches of my dreams. We're downstairs. My drawings and sketchbook are big, colorful nylon flags that I flip through. I can't find some of the sketches I like the most. Bubba isn't very impressed: he doesn't appreciate them. Annie seems to appreciate them more. Bubba jokingly starts to grope my butt. I yell at him, seriously, and I tell him I'm not comfortable with him groping me. Annie is in the bathroom taking a shower. Bubba is in the bathroom with her. I am wary of how Bubba can be overly persistent and assertive at times. I'm in the kitchen. I quickly eat a Bavarian cream-filled Bismarck with chocolate frosting. I go into the bathroom. I startle Annie by opening the door, and she cuts herself shaving her legs. I feel bad, and go to give her a petty consoling. I kiss her, but my mouth is full of the donut, so I pull back. She's sitting in a bathtub with sides that are only a couple inches high. She's naked, and I see she has shaved her pubic hair. I wonder if she did this because of her girlfriend at Prancy. It is a big turn-on for me. I take off my clothes. I gather up the note cards that are on the sink that may be for my Judaism presentation. On the sink are Annie's bra, an unused, unrolled white condom, and the backing to a maxi pad, which Annie didn't use because her period is over. I really want to have a sexual encounter with Annie. I start to get an erection as I am standing near the sink as she gets out of the shower. She puts on a pair of clean white underwear and a long sleeved shirt, which she leaves open and loose. I am very aroused, and I kiss her. She starts to kiss me back, but stops and starts to talk about what other people will think. I'm disheartened because this is totally not in line with my philosophy. She gets out a notebook in which she has written down characteristics of me. She starts reading the characteristics, and says several words that start with the letter 'z', which I have not heard before. She says I am ""overly ____ (I forget)"". I don't know what all the words mean, but I know they have negative connotations. She seems to think I'm too radical, aloof, one-sided, ill sighted, or too dedicated on the wrong track. She doesn't want to have a sexual encounter with me. I walk away to get something, feeling disheartened. I still want to go back later and see if she wants to have a sexual encounter then. I'm crushed by her rejection, but I still have hope. At some point we discuss our friend Tiny Combs and Middleton College. Annie asks me if anyone else from our high school friends applied to Middleton. I say that Stephen did. Later I realize what she was asking, and that I too applied to Middleton, but I don't say anything."
"1372"	"(12/03/1997)"	"Lightweight Blaze Orange Facemask I'm at a store, which later seems to be Country Store. I buy some things, and ask a man working there if they carry a lightweight blaze orange facemask. There are large tables of blaze orange hats, and red hats and gloves. I ask for a lightweight mask because I think that the thick kind that I borrowed would cost $20, which is more than I want to spend. The man goes to look for me. I don't think he finds it. I pay for my items at the register. The register takes a long time to ring up everything I have. I have some cash, my Prime Option MasterCard, and some lottery tickets. The bill is $16, and I pay with cash and lottery tickets. I also pay $6 for six more lottery tickets, and turn in a winning ticket for two more tickets, so I get eight more tickets, some of which are silver. I leave. I scratch off the tickets, but don't understand how to play or what designates a winning ticket. There are three columns on the ticket with words in each column, and a title for each column. I don't understand how to play."
"1373"	"(12/04/1997)"	"Kidnapped Allie Crater I'm talking with my classmate Allie Crater about biology. She leaves abruptly and gets into a turquoise colored truck, which speeds away. It's a very shiny truck with shiny chrome hubcaps and a lowered back end. I'm on the northeast side of the tennis courts at Brimson. The truck pulls out of the lot between the courts and Science Hall, and speeds down the road towards Whitman Avenue. I think Allie may be driving, but I also think she may be kidnapped, because I saw someone else in the truck and it doesn't seem like her to speed away."
"1374"	"(12/04/1997)"	"Snowblower Thieves I'm sitting on a ledge of a wall or building in downtown Wilmerton. The ledge overlooks the main parking lot next to the movie theatre, with Perkins on my left side. The ledge is about 20-30 feet off the ground. The parking lot is empty and the sun is rising. A teacher is on my left, and my brother Wally and another man are on my right. Two men come out of a first floor door of some apartments and jump down to the ground unscathed! I'm amazed at this, because it is a 25-foot drop, and neither man so much as flinches. They immediately rush into a store with guns to rob it. They may have ski masks on. One of the robbers brings a man out of the store at gunpoint. The robber then goes back into the store. The man from the store has an Oozy machine gun that he holds behind his back. The robber emerges from the sore and goes towards the man. The robber takes the man's gun. The second robber brings two young women out of the store. Each woman is pushing a snowblower. The snowblowers are being stolen. The snowblowers are put into the bed of a small gray truck and the two women and the man are put in the passenger seat: all three are taken captive. One of the robbers gets in the truck and speeds over towards us to pick up the other robber. He skids to a stop very close to us and the second robber gets in the truck. Those I am with and I have guns. I have a huge black M-16 assault rifle. It's a mammoth gun and could really do some damage. The truck has stopped right around the corner of the building ledge we're sitting on. I whirl around and aim my rifle at the driver's seat where the two robbers are sitting, as they drive away. I'm shaky with the gun: I've never worked it before, and it's all I can handle. I don't fire any shots, and the truck pulls away. One of the men I'm with thinks I pointed the gun at his head when I spun around and took aim. I thought the safety of the gun was off, and it was ready to fire, but I see now it was on the whole time. I'm in a truck. I have two arrows stuck in my left forearm. I pull them out. A third arrow has been shot in my arm, and I pull it out too. I bleed a very small bit, and the wound on the surface is small. I'm on a big swing with others. I still have my gun. I lose my shoe: it lies on the ground. I try to pick it up when we swing over it. We are done swinging then. I have books of matches that I keep in my socks."

"1377"	"(12/05/1997)"	"Seducing Tara Grendvig I'm chasing a man around shooting at him with a 6-shooter, a pistol. The gun shoots shotgun slugs. I hit him all over, and he doesn't die. I reload and keep firing. My shots don't seem to effect him. I'm with my coworker from Brimson Tara Grendvig. I try to convince her to divide the land up in a way that will favor me. I try to use my charm and physical attractiveness to persuade her. She is fat, and is wearing gray tights. I sit down and she sits on my lap with her legs on either die of my in a very sexual position. I say to her, ""85/15: 85% for me, 15% for her."" She laughs. She lies back down on the floor, saying she has lost weight. I rub her thighs and crotch, and lay on her, trying to seduce her so I'll get more land. I'm not attracted to her, but I think I can take advantage of her and get more land."

I have one beer opened, and I don't want to drink the other two for breakfast, so I'm going to take them with me when I leave. My dead friend Mark Long is there. He has a three-page movie script that he has written. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. She reads Mark's script. The script is vague, with scenes prescribing action, but with the actions and words not specified. It's a very rough outline of a plot, very broad and general. There is a telephone near the kitchen sink, and this may be at the Whitman house."
"1379"	"(12/07/1997)"	"The Invaders I'm in a parking ramp going to pay and leave. My bill is $1.00. I pay with a $10.00 bill. The black woman gives me a $20 and $1 bill as change. I drive out of the dark and dreary cement ramp. I'm very thirsty. There are a bunch of soda machines lined up to my right. I think of stopping, but don't. There is a man on the run. Police are pursuing him. He is in Boston. Police officers are lined up with guns on both sides of a street. There is trash piled up like banks on both sides of the street, where police hide. A metal cord runs from a power source in this razed area. The man attempts to access this power by drilling into the cord. Later the police arrive. The power source has been altered so that it has created a magnet, which a pry-bar and other metal tools stick to. I may be taking part in this scene at the power center. I'm at home. Men dressed in gray, who are invaders look in the windows and see me. I'm afraid. I have no privacy. I don't want to be seen. I don't want people to look in. I run upstairs and lie underneath the window facing south in my sister Ramona's room. I'm afraid men might still look in. They don't. I go into my room. There is a yellow grade school-nametag-like piece of paper that says 'Kathy' on it. I move it to a different place. I decide that I'll just walk downstairs whether or not the invaders are there. When I get to the kitchen my mom is there. This pleasantly surprises me. Ramona is home. The invaders aren't here. I may eat a plum."
"1380"	"(12/07/1997)"	"A Church Transformed I'm in a church. My dad and grandpa and grandma Redding show up. I notice grandma, and hug her to greet her. My mom and my brother Wally are there. We walk from the main church area to the back trough a mundane, secular area with stairs and some day care items. There are several attractive young women on my right as I walk by. My family starts to rearrange the day care area into church pews for the mass. Toy and bookshelves fold in such a way as to form pews. There is a young man next to me who says he wants to play cards with the family and I. I say after the mass that will be fine with me if the others want to play."
"1381"	"(12/07/1997)"	"Rich People's Jackalopes I'm driving in a carload of people who seem to be like my family. We drive on a dirt road through a wooded area with sparse houses. The houses are large, but not tall. The people who live in the houses are very rich. There are many species of animals, which I've never seen before, grazing and sitting in groups on different parts of these lawns. Among the animals, which are all mixed and interbred species, are jackalopes. We arrive at a sandy area where we'll take a ferry across some water with our vehicle. There is another vehicle there. We are divided into two groups to go on the ferry. One group is called Apollo____, and the other that I'm in is called ___ ___ ___ (I forget these names). There is then snow on the ground. Something happens with a mother and son in an old, big house."
"1382"	"(12/07/1997)"	"Computer Gambling I'm at a desk in a bedroom next to a computer lab. I have a $5 and $10 bill. The door to the bedroom is open a few inches. In the hallway there is a computer/slot machine with a screen saver on it that has two words that read, ""Win Big"", or something similar. I take the $10 bill to go gamble. I hear soft noise in the next room, which is my sister Ramona's room. I hurriedly go back to my room. It's 4:30am. I was going to gamble before I went to sleep. Ramona has awakened. I may talk to her."
"1383"	"(12/07/1997)"	"Wendy's Restaurant I'm at the old Wendy's restaurant by the Uptown Mall. I'm waiting in a truck in the parking lot on the north side of the restaurant. My housemate's mother Isabelle Ramos has gotten out of the truck and gone inside. There is a man in another maroon truck nearby. A second man goes over to the passenger side of the truck and may get in. The truck drives over to the far east part of the parking lot. I pull my truck around the south side of the restaurant, where there are no vehicles parked. I go inside. Isabelle is talking to another woman, and asks where the truck with the two men inside went. I point eastward, and the woman communicates this with Isabelle. I'm in line to order. My mom and my sister Ramona are there. My mom is paying with a check, so I order a lot. I get a burrito meal: a roast beef and Swiss, with spices. We get our food, and there is some confusion, about which burrito is which, but the one with mushrooms must be my mom's I say. My roast beef and Swiss is a patty, and there is no bun on top of it. It comes in a clear plastic container."

"1386"	"(12/08/1997)"	"The New Dream Group I'm at the Hill Park in Oak Valley for a dream group meeting. I drive my truck, and tow my boat behind the truck. I park on the north side of the pavilion in the dirt lot with my truck facing the pavilion. It's early morning and the sun is rising, shining. I go sit at a table on the southeast side of the shelter. People show up on roller blades. My grade school classmates Jerry Kasper, Eric Stoner, Patrick Bergman, Misty Ryan, and Sonya Nittles all arrive within a minute or two of each other. Two of them have cameras. I have a camera, too. Jerry has reddish hair: he has dyed it. I'm surprised that they all have come. They are a new group, all of which are unfamiliar with dream work. I will have to teach them, explain to them, and train them. I'm willing and eager to do this. Another classmate, Jim Granger, has a lot to do or he would have come, too. He is currently serving as altar boy for a funeral. A truck with a boat drives by on Park Avenue."
"1387"	"(12/08/1997)"	"Nettleson, Australia I'm in Australia on a bus with people I know. We go by moose, which I point out. We are coming up to a small town. The bus goes up a steep dirt hill. I'm not sure if we'll make it up, but we do. Terry, the bus driver we had in Australia, is the bus driver. He says we're making a stop. The town we're in is small. It's called Nettleson. I have been there before, with Niles and Tim Zelling, on our road trip. The area we stop at is very scenic: green, hilly, and lush. There is a small pond that has bass and carp in it that I start to feed blue chunks of something, maybe gum. I realize I don't have deodorant or a toothbrush. I'm at home, about to leave for Australia. My sister Ramona, brother Wally, and my mom are there. I eat breakfast. I ask my mom if she'll pick the plums on my tree in two days. Something happens with big airplanes, Ramona, and the long trip. I'm in an old store. I try on two pairs of jeans. One pair costs $11.--, and I forget the price of the other. One is size 34x33, the other 32x34. I'm on a school bus. Either I or another person catches a model rocket in their hand as it shoots towards the bus. Kids are launching model rockets."
"1388"	"(12/09/1997)"	"The Orange Suit I arrive at Washington University with my sister Ramona. We're both taking a (different) class there. She pulls the car up the curb on the left side of the road. I'm wearing orange pants and a tight orange shirt. We get out of the car. She follows me as I look at the name of the building to see if it's where I need to go. The name of the building is ____ ( I forget). I see my classmate Bryan Beard, and he says we're in the same class. He is wearing a white shirt and black tie. We walk down into the building, which is not unlike McNeely Hall at the University of Springfield. I sit down in a chair in the classroom #100. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor comes in with roses. He is in a hurry to leave. I ask the people there if this is an Introduction to Psychology class. I slur my speech because my retainer is in, and I sound stupid. The woman professor says they call the class by a different name, maybe Cognitive Psychology. There are about 10 people in the class; almost all are women. I have a hair binder and an old beat up prickly black comb wrapped around my right pinky finger. One of the women behind me talks to me about this, and other things. I don't encourage her conversation, but reply briefly."

"1390"	"(12/10/1997)"	"Roller Rink Tickets I'm at the Roller Rink in Wilmerton, on the rink. People are playing the number game, and I think of hiding alone by the inside of the orange wall by one of the numbers, so the person by the disc jockey pit can't see me. I'm in a smaller group of people, including my lab professor Shane Diamond. We seem to be over near the rental desk by the bathrooms. We're in a circle, and we seem to spin or move in a circle. This is a game, like a give away. I'm lying on my side. The circle turns clockwise, and I knock my skate wheels up against the metal railings that are on the outside of the circle. The circle of people stop moving. I end up next to Shane, so I'm the winner and he gives me a bunch of scratch off lottery tickets. I give four or five tickets each to two people near me. I think with all the rest I've got to have winners. I walk away, with my skates off, and then go back and put my skates on the rental counter. I have an hour to use up before we leave."
"1391"	"(12/10/1997)"	"The Round Kid There is a boy about 12 or 13 years old. He is round: not fat, but pudgy. I talk to him and encourage him not to think of himself as fat, and to do what he can to change the way he looks. He plays basketball, and I tell him to work out; not like his father and brother who are big and round as well. He stands on a ladder, holding his hands up over a basketball rim that is lower than normal."
"1392"	"(12/10/1997)"	"Rich's Psychosomatic Illness I'm with my cousin Melvin Redding flying along Main Street. He is hanging onto me, with his arms around my neck. He may be sick. We fly, going towards my friend Kevin Simpson's house. The wind is really strong, and we can't fly. I yell for Melvin to grab hold of a tree trunk, and I do this too. We cling to a tree and the wind blows furiously, lifting our bodies off the ground so they are horizontal! It seems I'm at or near my neighbor Alvin Broud's house. My cousin Rich Redding is sick. His mother Sheila brings him some noodle-like food that usually makes him feel better. She walks down Hill Avenue, from an area near Broud's, across 2nd Street. Something is done with waffles. I bring Melvin to his home, and Rich to my home. This may be a dream within a dream. I'm on the back of a car with Rich. The rear windshield is covered with dirt and dust. I scrape some off, and suggest to Rich that he clean it, because this may benefit him. We ride outside this car to my home. I suggest to Rich that his illness may be psychosomatic. We arrive home. Rich and Melvin are there, sitting at opposite sides of a huge wooden table that is covered with a white tablecloth, in the kitchen. I start to tell my mom and Sheila about the great dream I had (which is a portion of this dream). There is a huge sheet of beef jerky, about 2'x2', that we have received form people we know that my mom is friends with. The sheet is against or partially wrapped in white cloth. The outside layers of the jerky are dry, and the inside is juicy."
"1393"	"(12/10/1997)"	"My Girlfriend Julie I'm at Carter Church sitting with people I know on the north side of the church in the left front section of pews. More people start to walk in. By the pew, I see a person who is grandma Redding, and seems also to be my dad. Later, she is my dad. When he gets near me I leave my pew and sit with him in a different pew. A girl I recognize from Brimson, but don't know, is standing up on the pew where I was just sitting, and I point her out as being Julie, my girlfriend. She seems to be wearing blue or yellow skirt with a blue or yellow top. She looks casual, and pretty. She has blond hair and may have glasses. My dad comments on Julie, in his joking manner. A person in the pew in front of me comments on her as well. I overhear them saying she seems to like men who are tall and hunt."
"1394"	"(12/10/1997)"	"Jake Meyer's Beard I'm sitting on the south side of Carter Church in the front right section of pews. It is second grade graduation, and all the Carter School classes are there. The second graders rise and sit, rise and sit, shouting out words as they stand. They are all happy to graduate and emotions run high. I see a kid who I know to be Jake Meyer, the younger brother of my grade school classmate Jana Meyer. He has a full, thick, dark goatee. He is 10 or 12 years old. There is a preacher who talks. His front teeth are a bit crooked and pressed backwards."
"1395"	"(12/10/1997)"	"Black Elk's People I'm with Black Elk and his people, when they're in the rocky, cliff-like area with many rounded crevices, ready to surrender to the soldiers. The people are tired and hungry. They have a few guns and spear-like sticks. The approaching soldiers are shot. I'm sitting with some people, and it is pointed out that my arm turns black when I flex the muscles in it. I have a stick that is a spear with a sharp point. Some people walk close to us and go up on the rocks above us, as if they walk up a rocky ledge of stairs. One of three people is like my friend Bill Hanson, but is also my friend Melanie McDyss' boyfriend. Like Bill, he has long thick biceps. These three people are not our people. They are like soldiers. I stab the man who is like Bill with my spear. It goes deep into his pelvis, his loins. I think I may be in trouble because I haven't killed this man: he may be able to retaliate. I stab all three people. I stab one man in the temple, and another in the chest. There may be a woman in the group. When I stab the people my spear sticks in the white wall and I break it off and stab then with the other end."
"1396"	"(12/10/1997)"	"Textbook Buyback I am at a textbook buyback with my friend Niles Zelling. There are many tables with yellow signs. I bring my Introductory to Psychology textbook, but I decide not to sell it, and leave."
"1397"	"(12/10/1997)"	"Writing Time I'm with my housemate Norman Noman, his girlfriend Sunny Pile, and my dad. We seem to be near Golden Acres or Goldenshire Golf Course in Oak Valley. My dad gives us four of five pages of white paper to write on for a half hour while he is gone. I'm excited to do this. Norman has taken a lot of coins from my green ceramic change jar to buy alcohol. Something happens with Sunny and her friend. I may do something with them. I don't use the time for writing, but I have a good time."
"1398"	"(12/11/1997)"	"Only Plowing In Summer I'm in a big house. It seems to be an old party-type house near Brimson, near Antique Avenue. I'm in a large empty room. A man comes in with a small brown rental refrigerator. The refrigerator is full, and I know it is stocked every Friday. I seem to be by myself. In the refrigerator are cans of Horses Hoof beer and Barqs Root Beer. I drink one and put the empty can on a shelf, which seems to be the second shelf from the bottom of a bookcase under the phone at the Whitman house. I think of drinking a lot more, but I want to see if anyone is around. I see a stairs to the basement, and close the door. I go from the door to the living room, to another room where there are stairs leading up. I go up the stairs and notice there are several people sitting on a couch that I didn't know were there. They were in the next room. When I get upstairs I'm with my friend Niles Zelling, who lives in the house. We're sitting on a bed. There are two couples there. We all talk. I let out a long, loud fart. Niles doesn't flinch when I do this. The men there are jock-types. There is a man there who asks us if we have anything to present. I want to tell him that I have several things to present; that I'm working on factors that effect dream recall in people, and anxiety and personality, and two other projects involving dreams. I see the parking lot of Large Company that is across from Bob's Sports Arena. There is a man with a snowplow. The man says he will only plow snow in the summer. Others and I tell him to work in the winter, and that there will be snow soon. He refuses to work in the winter, and will work only in the summer. I see him in his snowplow when he is in the parking lot. The plow is yellow or orange, and the orange plow holder is in the middle of the parking lot. The man is Chuck Walters, the new paleontology professor at Brimson. I ride with Chuck and one or two other people. We may be in my truck. There is a bag of groceries in the bed of the truck. I feel like there are other bags that I've forgotten. We drive south on Home Avenue in Oak Valley, through the railroad area towards the intersection of Home Avenue and 3rd Street. Someone comments on how everyone gets one of those, meaning, my friend Melanie McDyss, when they arrive in a foreign country. Everyone thinks Melanie is cute. We drive up near my home. I'm on a bicycle, with others. I drive under a plum tree, which may be my plum tree, and try to grab a plum. I go past my house, through my yard, and start to go down the alley. I stop and turn around, and go back to my house to get my mail and talk to my mom and my sisters Ramona and Heather. I park my bicycle near the back door. It is 4:00 or 5:00pm on a warm, sunny summer evening. I smell bacon cooking. I go in, and my mom is happy to see me. They are eating BLT's. I have $1,000 to pick up at home."
"1399"	"(12/11/1997)"	"The Crazy Apartment I'm walking down a street from a place by Super America in Woodland. I walk down a couple blocks, go over two blocks, then walk back a few blocks. I end up near the Super America where I began. There is an apartment building attached or next to the back of Super America, but I have walked six blocks to get there, when I could have taken 50 steps and been where I wanted to go. I go into the apartment building where I live. My friend Sam Crimson is in the elevator, and he holds the door for me as I get in. We go up to the first floor. He gets out and goes to see or do something with our friend Jimmy Youngman. There are many buttons in the elevator. Some of the buttons have the same number on them: there are two rows of buttons for the numbers one through five. I'm going to apartment 18. I hold the door open on the first floor. Four or five young women enter the elevator. Sam enters too. We go up to the third floor where apartment 18 is. I get out, and two of the women follow me. One of them seems to have a crush on me. I try to fend her off by showing her I'm not really interested in her. I tell her I'm probably going out to a bar tonight, and so I can't spend time with her. I start to unlock the door, and two people in the apartment start shouting and moving around: they were having sex. I go and sit by a counter top-like place and talk to the two women while I wait for the two people inside the apartment to get decent. I meet the second woman, who is Asian. The landlord comes out of the apartment. He is old and has white hair. He's wearing a white button-down shirt with a green cardigan sweater over it. My friend Melanie McDyss comes out of the apartment with a shorter Asian man, who is her boyfriend. She is wearing boxer shorts and a t-shirt. She and her boyfriend were having sex. She is aloof, and wanders in and out of the doorway, not really sure of what she's doing. The landlord takes a cat and puts it on the couch, which is in the large, wide hallway that all the apartment doors branch out from. He puts the cat on a bunch of toilet paper that stretches to the door of apartment 18. He wants the cat to urinate on the toilet paper on the couch. He thinks the toilet paper will soak up the urine. He is on the phone at the same time he does this, and he says that this urination is a positive thing, whereas defecation would be negative. The landlord is old and senile. He pushes or shoves one of the men around. The man pushes his back, but he is too senile to notice this. I'm inside the apartment. There is a Christmas tree and an orange road construction sawhorse there. There is a note that says the landlord wants to meet with us at two or two-thirty this afternoon. The other three men that live in the apartment have written on the note messages to the rest of us about what they're doing and how the landlord's meeting will fit into their schedule. I haven't written anything, and didn't know about the meeting: I just got home. I go into my room, which has a large bed. The bathroom door adjacent to my room is closed. The door to the other bathroom out in the main room is also closed. I think Melanie and her boyfriend are taking a shower. There is a clock on the wall with a beer logo on it."
"1400"	"(12/12/1997)"	"Heather's Uterus Destroyed I seem to be near the church across from Social Science Hall at Brimson. Two men with guns are robbing a man in a car. One of the robbers is holding a gun inches from the victim's head, pointing it at his head. The other robber stands about 15 feet in back of the car pointing his gun at the victim, who is the driver. I'm walking with several guys, including my classmate Doug Thompson. I'm not sure how to react when I see the robbery. I move cautiously. The man being robbed tells us to keep walking, past the car. I do. The man drives away. The robbers fire their guns when the man is at a distance, and don't hit him. The others that were with me are still back near the robbers, while I slowly and anxiously keep walking. The robbers rob the other men I was with. I start to run and get away. I'm running down 1st Street in Oak Valley, going from where it intersects Bauer Avenue to where the white house is on the corner of it intersection with Holy Avenue. I see a black woman outside the house and I yell to her from a distance to call 911. When I get to the house I enter through the front door. I go through the dimly lit living room where there is a huge television with many dull colors showing on it. I enter the kitchen where the lights are brighter, and see the woman talking on the phone to the 911 operator. I tell the woman what I know about the two robbers: one is white, about 5'11"", with shaggy brown hair that sticks out from under his winter-type cap, and he had a gun, which was like a six-shooter, that seemed silver, gray, or blue. The other four men I was with, including Doug, have escaped the robbers, and they arrive at the house. The others are younger than Doug. I ask one of them, who is a young black boy, about the second robber. The boy says the second robber was white. I talk on a cellular phone. The 911 operator asks me to hang up, because she can't talk to the woman and I at the same time: there is an electrical or communication problem. I hang up. There is a loud wail in the basement. I go downstairs to see what it is. My sister Heather is there. She has been sexually touched or hurt. Her uterus is sterile, and it is destroyed. She is kneeling on the floor sobbing. There is blood on the floor, walks, and pipes to the sink: essentially everywhere. She kneels and wails while she scoops up bits of bloody intestine-like tissue. These are bits of her uterus. She scrapes them into a pile on the blood-covered floor."
"1401"	"(12/12/1997)"	"Tyrannosaurus Rex Man I'm near the yard of the white house on the northwest corner of Bauer Avenue and 1st Street in Oak Valley. The deck area of the house isn't there: it's a dirt area. I'm with a woman I know. There are several dinosaur eggs that have hatched, and we find two eggs that haven't hatched, but are warm. We each pick up an egg. My egg hatches, and a balloon dinosaur emerges. The other egg hatches, but neither last long. I'm near the overpass of Main Street over the railroad tracks. There is a fight on a ledge between animals and others. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and others are tempted, and are fighting to keep from going to the other side. They realize what they're fighting for while the fighting is occurring. This is an episode of the television sitcom Seinfeld. I'm in a ditch that seems to be down by the tracks. There is a lot of food and drink in the ditch, including appetizers and champagne. The champagne bottles are used to kill something, which may be swan-like birds. The corks of the bottles shoot towards the animals to kill them. Others and I try to run down birds. We chase them over by Main Street. A car hits one bird and I grab it. We start to walk back, and are near the white house on the south side of the railroad tracks on the west side of Delivery Avenue. I sense a Tyrannosaurus Rex ahead of us in the distance behind a tree. We all start to run, going north. We get near Carter School. I'm looking for a place to hide that is strong enough to protect me from the dinosaur. I think of hiding underneath the recess stairs, but the others don't think this is a good idea, so we all walk down the alley, going north. There is a small house on the north side of the school with a fence around it. I climb on the fence, to look for shelter. We end up going into an area that is all tiles, like a huge bathroom. The Tyrannosaurus Rex comes; it is following us. We hide and evade it. One man suggests that gingerbread man Olympics be held. The dinosaur follows us closely, and is a man. It is hungry. The man is huge. Someone hits him on the head with a plate. Something happens with food: the dinosaur may sense food. We are all hiding. I run and hide, trying to escape."

"1403"	"(12/14/1997)"	"The Crazy Soldier There is German war taking place. A large building containing soldiers and their commanding officers is being heavily bombed. The leader with cracked teeth is shot in the chest, but continues to fight. There is a small pumpkin or photograph of a pumpkin that he is biting onto in the corner of his mouth, with gritted teeth and a wicked grin. He is a crazy soldier. He has a gun that he keeps on firing nonstop after he is shot. He is insane! My housemate Norman Noman and I watch this. We drive or move around the razed building. It is completely destroyed. We figure the building must be dug very deep down into the earth, for the soldiers to survive there. We drive on. The dead are poorly buried in a cemetery. I see a dead black squirrel hanging by a string from a tree. It has been skinned. Its flesh is visible. It seems to be grabbing onto or attached to a dead gray squirrel, which has its fur. I'm with Dana Scully and Fox Moulder from the X-Files. We're in the baby room at the Redding Farm. Scully has been held up with a girl. There is a skinned human being in the room that is visible. I can touch part of it, and I try to grasp it, to see it fully. The body is Scully. I know she was sexually harassed when she was younger. I sit at a piano on the west wall of the room. There is a ghost-like presence in the room. I'm scared. I try to grasp and see the person. I touch what I think is the quadriceps muscle of the person, but I don't see what I touch. Then I see part of figure in a close doorway, which is quickly gone. The figure(s) are in the other doorway by the kitchen, then."
"1404"	"(12/14/1997)"	"Swimming at the YMCA I'm going swimming with others at something like the YMCA. I leave my house and realize I've forgotten a pair of shorts to wear as swimming trunks, other than the ones I'm wearing. I have on my red and black-checkered shorts, and decide they'll suffice. I walk into the swimming pool area and around the pool. My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles is in the pool. I'm naked. I'm somewhat embarrassed, but not very much. A dozen other people are in the pool. I go into the locker room and start looking for a small locker to put my belonging into. There is a boy who steals easily from soda vending machines by sticking his skinny arm up into the machine. I bump into a locker, which opens inward. The locker is like a toilet stall, and there is man in it defecating. I look in a vending machine and grab some candy that is left in the bottom of it. I try to find a locker that I think my stuff will be safe in: I don't have a lock. There are many lockers available, but I want one that is secluded so it's not likely it will be bothered."

Greg thinks Jenn is attractive. I go into the chapel with my friend Gino Teavor. Gino's mother Eleanor and my mom wait outside the chapel. The preacher gives a sermon involving clapping and singing. It's a terrible sermon. He talks about my old classmate Tim Spade's article on the IP, which he doesn't like. The preacher is a dictator: very authoritative. Two young men arrive late and approach the preacher, explaining they've come late because they handed in their paper to a recycling bin, and had to print it out again. The preacher is unforgiving. I think this whole scene with the preacher is a worthless hoax. I get up and leave, squeezing by a fat woman as I exit the pew. When outside, I start walking towards someone who I think is my mom, but who is Marj Grant. I shake my head indicating what is occurring in the chapel is not a good scene. I walk towards the student union. There are some female professors and students doing Kung Fu outside it. I walk in, and I see my high school friends Mya Rousing and Sarah Reed sitting on bar stools at a high table. I walk to get my mail, not stopping. I can't walk normally: my movements are slow, and I realize I've experienced this before. Mya and my classmates from Brimson Sharon and Shelly Lincoln come running up to me like a bunch of adolescent girls. Mya is squealing, ""No!"" They're going to tell me that Mya has a crush on me. Finally, Mya asks me, ""How do you feel about me?"""
"1406"	"(12/15/1997)"	"Cancun Fellow I walk into a store like Sears on my way to a movie with my mom and my sister Ramona. I see a young man my age. He calls me over and starts talking to me. He recognizes me from a trip I went on, which is the Cancun trip, I think. We talk a little while. He seems more interested in the conversation than I. I leave to go to the movie with my mom and Ramona."
"1407"	"(12/15/1997)"	"On The Casino Floor I'm at a casino. I have many $1,000 bills, arranged in stacks with bands around them. I put coins into a machine, and they come out at the bottom. Some of the coins get stuck. I'm on the floor, and my housemate Norman Noman helps me up."
"1408"	"(12/15/1997)"	"Australian Grocery Shopping I fly into Australia, and the plane lands. I drive by my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, who is working. I stop for groceries, and spend a lot of money. I get brown sugar, eggs, toilet paper, and Kleenexes for my stay. The bill is about $20. I pull out my wallet. The man takes what I think is a $20, but it may be a $50 bill. He tricks me, and owes me money. He tells me to go look at ____ (maybe clothes racks or clothes trees). I go over to them. They are young fruit trees in my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard with only a few buds on them."
"1409"	"(12/17/1997)"	"The New World Order I walk down towards the yellow house on the corner of 2nd Street and Hill Avenue in Oak Valley. I go to the back door of the house and knock. One of the women inside signals for me to enter, and I do. There is a huge kitchen with a high ceiling on the right. Two black women are in the kitchen. One comes towards me to see what I want. I ask her meagerly, in a soft and high-pitched voice, if she sells shirts. I want to buy a shirt. She says yes and I go into the shirt room, which his like a living room. There is another woman sitting in a rocking chair. She says, ""Hark!"" in a firm voice. I think she is saying her name, so I reply, ""Kenneth"", in a firm voice. Then I realize her word was a greeting, and I feel dumb for having said my name. I look at the shirts, which are on two walls. Some are embroidered, and others are prints. I want to buy a shirt for my sister Heather's dog. The shirts are homemade, and are expensive. I leave without buying a shirt, saying something about having to get some information about what to put on the shirt before I order it. I'm outside. Above me I see a huge black oval-shaped NASA spaceship. I stand with people on the southeast corner of the intersection. Many small UFO's appear in the sky. They are white, and light colored. I see a few at first, and then many, and then they are everywhere! They're the size of a Frisbee, and are flat and razor sharp. They fly down near the earth's surface. One of them sticks six inches deep into a concrete block near me! They fly over my head. I crouch down, lower and lower. They keep flying over me, and I'm afraid they'll cleanly slice off the top of my head! I know I need to seek cover in a place where there are cement walls on all four sides of me, so I'm protected. Everyone, including me, flees. I run around back of the yellow house and turn right into a cement stairwell. I get down and cover my head with my hands. My ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter appears, walking northward on the east side of Hill Avenue in front of the yellow house. I know she has been taken over, mentally and/or physically. I run towards her, away from the cement walls. I jump and kick her in the face, knocking her unconscious. I pick her up and carry her body back to the cement stairwell. I protect her, putting my hand on her head to keep hear head down. I know the world has been taken over. I'm the leader of the people that are left in the world, as opposed to the leader of those who have taken over. I tell Jackie that I want to help. She is then my friend Melanie McDyss. I lay on hard cement with her. She has a scratched face, and is wearing a black tank top. I lick and suck her left breast."
"1410"	"(12/17/1997)"	"Dodging Tornadoes I am in my back yard/alley area at home in Oak Valley. There are many tornadoes around. I see the tornadoes, and dodge them, running away from the funnel clouds so I don't get sucked up into them."
"1411"	"(12/17/1997)"	"Heather Doesn't Feed Lunch I'm riding in a car with my sister Heather, who is driving the car. We talk about her dog, and she says that she doesn't like to feed him lunch! I'm appalled and demand to know why. I say to her, ""You feed yourself lunch, what about your dog?"" She says feeding a dog is different, and it's okay not to feed a dog lunch. I consider dogs and humans to have an equal need for lunch. We pull up next to a liquor store and go inside. When I go in the store a man gets right up in my face and talks to me. I have trouble walking, and I walk slowly. My left knee and leg drags along. A man may touch my knee, and there seems to be nothing functionally wrong with it. There is a meat-and-cheese party. Many upper-class people are there. They are ignorant people. I think the party is very foolish."
"1412"	"(12/17/1997)"	"Will's Wrong Shirt I see my classmate Will Dunks. He is wearing a turquoise colored shirt. It is a new shirt, but it is not what Will wanted. This is an error: something is wrong with the shirt."
"1413"	"(12/17/1997)"	"Two Teams Merge Two basketball teams start to practice together. One of the teams is made up of all white players. The other team is all black players. I'm familiar with the team of white players, but I'm not a player. We all walk into a gym, which is where the white team usually practices. It's a really nice hardwood basketball court with new hoops, and a nice gym. There is a gathering with parents: a program. Several of the white players put different sheets together to assemble the program. I hand a few of these sheets out, though I'm uncomfortable with this because I'm not a team player anymore. I shake hands with several of the black players and say their names, which I don't understand because I've never heard names like that before."
"1414"	"(12/17/1997)"	"Convinced of UFO's I am outside with other people. I try to convince the others that the UFO's I saw [In an earlier dream this same night] are real. I point and look up in the sky, where plane-like objects begin to appear all over, darting across the sky."
"1415"	"(12/18/1997)"	"Blowing Kevin's Head Off I see an army base. There is a civilian man, an army general, and another soldier there. They test a cannon before leaving on a flight. I watch. A fence encloses the army base. They prepare the cannon. One of the soldiers places a big blue and white plastic cooler in the corner of the fenced-in area. It seems to have some power, like a battery, but it's name starts with 'H': H____. The cannon is set on automatic. It is black, about three feet long, with a three-inch wide barrel that shoots cannon balls the size of a softball. It's a mini cannon. I sit on the barrel of the cannon, straddling it. It turns and points at my friend Kevin Simpson, who is in the corner of the fenced-in area. The cannon will fire twice. The first time it will blow Kevin's head off, and then his head will be re-sewn on. Then the cannon will fire again. I sit on the cannon as it rolls up to Kevin and the barrel presses up against his upper neck and lower chin area. I have my hand on his neck below the barrel. I know this is going to be gruesome: his head is going to be blown to pieces. I don't want to see it. I turn my head to the right and squint my eyes. I imagine the cannon firing and blowing off the fingers on my left hand. I see my hand after the shot will be fired. I see a paper printout with lines on it. The lines get shorter on the printout to reflect the missing parts of my fingers."
"1416"	"(12/19/1997)"	"The User Teacher I'm with others in a group. There is a man about 55-60 years old with grayish white hair and a beard with us. He has a blue Geo Metro that he lives in. He is an outdoors type of person. He takes a paddle and a lump of cotton, and starts pulling and stretching the cotton until there is a washcloth on the paddle. Two regular nails and one two-pronged nail for electrical wiring attach the washcloth to the paddle. This is what the old man has to teach us. We are going to work so we learn how to do this. He wants us to haul 20-30 garbage cans full of water up a sandy hill. The man has a young man as an apprentice. The apprentice shows us how to lift a plastic canoe using a paddle for leverage, like a yoke. He wants or instructs us to use the paddles as levers to haul barrels up the hill. He wants us to fill the barrels with dirt and sand. I grab a 20-gallon garbage can and start walking down a sandy hill. I use a hose to spray some of the sand off my garbage can. As I walk down the hill I want to tell the two guys who are at the top of the hill to fuck off, and to leave their can there. It is going to be so heavy and painful to carry these huge cans of water and sand using a paddle on our neck as a lever! Ouch! Then I realize the old man is a fake. His trick with the cotton and the washcloth was a hoax: there was a washcloth nailed to the paddle in the first place, and all he had to do was rub away some loose cotton that was covering the washcloth up. I explain this to my sister Ramona and her friend Barb Mohs while we're standing on metal bed frames, stood on end, at the bottom of the hill. I won't haul the garbage cans. The man was going to use us to haul his water up the hill."
"1417"	"(12/19/1997)"	"The Farmer's Daughter I'm with a fat old man who is wearing blue overalls. He is stern, rigid, and abusive. His daughter is moving into our house. My housemate Stephen Ramos is there. I write out a check to the man for $240, and then it is $235. I write on the check: ""Two Hundred Thirty Filthy [Five] "". I'm concerned the man won't cash my check soon. I tell him this. Stephen just wants me to pay him: he is excited, and doesn't care about the financial aspects of this deal. I'm concerned with looking out for myself, and I tell Stephen to calm down. Then I tell the man to cash the check the next time he's at the bank. The man is unreliable, but I say this firmly and give him the check. Then that part of the deal is over, and I turn to the girl. I am happy and excited to have her living with us. I ask her if she wants to see her room and take a look around."
"1418"	"(12/19/1997)"	"The Fugitive A young man is running away from police officers. Others may be running away. He runs through a yard, over a tall wooden fence, through the back yard, over bushes, and through more yards. Television news crews are covering the story. There is as much speculation that he is innocent as guilty. There are interviews with the running man's friends. One of his friends, a tall man with medium length dark brown hair, questions the man's innocence. The interviewer is a scrubbed clean upper middle class frat-boy-esque man. There is a remake of the scene. The fugitive may have hurt his back flipping over the fence. He may have a broken leg; police don't know. The fugitive could have gone between sparse hedges rather than jumping over them. I see the path he ran. I may be him. He outruns the others. Police may have calculated the man's running speed, in centimeters per second, from the remake of the scene. From this they can project how far he could be. The man is a fugitive! He runs through yards and streets. People chase him, and fall behind as he outruns them. He runs on a street. I see through his eyes. I may be he. There is a wooded area to my left. People come out of the area and point in the opposite direction, indicating the police have infiltrated the wooded area already looking for him, and that he would find no safety in the woods. Some people shake scolding fingers at the man. He (I) questions whether to keep running. It seems futile: the police are everywhere. I wonder if I should hide in a tree in the woods. The police dogs will small me and go nuts, but it may work."
"1419"	"(12/19/1997)"	"Melanie The Teacher I'm on the very top floor of a building that seems to be Old Main at Brimson. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. She is teaching others and I the names of things, as in school, and she is the teacher. We stand on boards. There is a slant to the ceiling or wall. I lick and suck Melanie's fingers. She is not expecting this; I do it randomly. After I do this there is an awkward feeling, and I start laughing to ease the tension. There is a fire drill, a man tells us. We all walk down the stairs. People have dogs, we see, on the way down."
"1420"	"(12/19/1997)"	"Accidental Kill I'm with my friends Stephen and Jose Ramos. Stephen has long thick tightly curled hair. Some of his hair is orange, and the rest is dark. Jose may have orange hair too, but it is shorter. They joke about butt sex. I have a partial erection. Jose asks me if I have a broken leg. I say no. I learn that they are going hunting with our friend Bubba Hacker. I'm going too. I hurry to prepare. The hunt will be video taped. Many others are participating in the hunt. Bubba is already ready. I hurry to get ready. I get dressed. Female teachers and staff from Carter School are outside with guns. One gun looks like a big double-barreled over-and-under shotgun. It is gray with a blunt end. It looks powerful. I'm uneasy about having a huge hunting party like this. Bubba and others chase birds as part of the hunt. A bird flies by me. I try to kick and hit it. By accident, I kill the bird by sticking my foot out. I feel guilty, because the bird is very beautiful and colorful. I didn't mean to kill it, I was just joking around, I say to my mom. I go inside a different building. My advisor Mary Monroe, sister Heather, friends Tim and Niles Zelling, and others are there. There is a basketball tournament occurring. There are many younger people there. I'm playing on Tim and Niles' team. We play 2-on-2 with a substitute. They won their first game, for which I was absent. We now play Utah. We should win in the tournament. I get a drink and bump into an acquaintance, Bill Dinks. Then I see another acquaintance, Ben Reynolds, in the bathroom. There are many kids their age around."
"1421"	"(12/19/1997)"	"Annie's Disease I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. She may not look like Annie, but I know it is she. She gives me fellatio. Something is then wrong with her. She has a sickness. I ask her what it is and she says she has ____ ____ disease ( I forget the name). She tells me that blood will trickle out of her mouth and she will sleep for six to eight hours. I panic! I'm scared of her disease! What can I do to help, if anything? I think there is nothing I can do. I want to call Annie's mother Tamara to see what I should do. Then Annie communicates that she is joking: she doesn't really have a disease."
"1422"	"(12/21/1997)"	"The Elusive Buck I'm deer hunting with my friends Stephen, Jose, and Franco Ramos, my classmate Harry Melner, and others. We're in an open area with few trees. We see some deer, which are mostly does. I have some problems with my ammunition. The shells are sliced in two, the end is off-center, or they are deformed. They don't fit into the shotgun well. It's hard to discharge the shells intact without firing them. I walk with Stephen and others in a cornfield-like area. I was going to use the shotgun with the magnifying scope, but Stephen doesn't want me to. I end up with the black shotgun. We hear something run through the corn near us. I quickly sidestep into the rows to see if the deer is still there. It's not. We're on a road. A deer runs in front of us into the corn on the left. I don't see it: I was looking backwards. It's a big buck. I get really excited, and have buck fever. I see it run on the left side of the road, and try to get my sights on it. I see it on a hill, with its rear facing me. I get a bead on it and pull the trigger, but my gun doesn't fire. I think later that I didn't have a shell in the chamber. Stephen prods me about not shooting the deer. I defend myself, saying even if he would have seen it cross in front of us he wouldn't have had enough time to get off a good shot. I'm back near a shelter, which is my deer stand. Many people are around. Hunters are pushing the corn, which is like wheat with hard top stalks, so one can walk on it."
"1423"	"(12/21/1997)"	"My Birthday Party Overshadowed I'm at home at a birthday party for myself and two other people. I go outside where other people are. I'm really looking to see if my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there. I don't see her. I participate in the party, and am served cake. Then I see Annie. She is with several other people in the front driveway on the north side of the lilac bushes. She's wearing a swimsuit, and may have dark hair. She and the others, who are both men and women, seem to be sun tanning. She doesn't speak to me or give me more than a nonchalant glance: she snubs me. I don't approach her."
"1424"	"(12/22/1997)"	"Punching Arrogant Stephen I'm in a building that seems to be like the Middle Mall building in Wilmerton. I am working, it seems. I see my friend Melanie McDyss near a door. She has just entered. I go over to her to say hi. I'm happy to see her. She leaves very quickly, out the glass doors, and doesn't speak to or acknowledge me. My housemate Stephen is there. He starts laughing at me, talking about her ignoring me, and repeating this. I'm not facing him, but I turn around after he makes four or five of the same comments. I punch him on his left cheek with my right hand. He is surprised, and in shock, and keeps saying something like, ""Oh my god, I can't believe you just did that."" He is arrogant and righteous in his talk. I am sick of his righteous holier-than-thou attitude. (He may punch me back; I'm not sure.)I leave. I go into a bathroom. I feel guilty for punching him. I wash my face and blot it dry with a towel. I have a puffy lower lip, like I have been struck. I'm the manager of the pizza-like place in this mall. Stephen and my friend Kristy Puffy may also be managers. I open a door from the bathroom that goes into a natatorium with a huge swimming pool. I don't' want to go in there, so I go into another door. I'm in a hallway. There are other hallways and offices around. I follow the hallway and go past an office where a man is doing business on the phone. I'm then in the back stock room of Ace Hardware. I descend a blue metal staircase to get to the main floor. Other employees are around. No one is paying attention to me. I may be an employee. I look for, and find, a pen and piece of paper. I do this to steal goods, possibly a futon. People come back with their merchandise written on paper, and pick it up here. I can steal in this way. I start to walk away and faintly hear my name, ""Kenneth"". Someone is calling me. I walk on without turning around to see how it was, or if they were talking to me. I hear my name again, louder, ""Kenneth"", and I turn around. It is the manager talking. He has blond hair and a blue Ace Hardware vest on. He asks me what the paper and pen are for. He seems to know I was planning on stealing. I lie, saying I just needed a piece of paper. I don't have a good excuse and am anxious. A male employee comes over and interrupts us, asking the manager about a bolt, which he needs. I say I have a bolt, and pull one out of my right jeans pocket. It is about 1 and _ inch long, black, and is kind of like a screw. This will work for the employee. He takes it and leaves. I'm lucky the topic was changed. The manager doesn't suspect me of stealing any more. It is as if the interaction with the employee made me reliable, as if the employee vouched for my honesty. I walk away into the main part of the store and go past the cash registers near the exit. The store is like Country Store in Oak Valley. I turn left and walk behind the registers, past them all. People are lined up: it is busy. Kristy is a manager, and is helping the cashiers, one by one, and is on the second to last cashier, so I'll get to talk to her in a bit about the incident punching Stephen. I go outside into the parking lot. There is a semi truck or bus that carries eggs, which drives away. There is a trapezoidal-like-structure, which I think I can move. This is like the army. It is winter, with ice and snow. I go in the store. Kristy is almost done. I know I'm wrong for punching Stephen. Stephen and our friend Sam Kingsley walk in, after spending time together. Stephen starts talking to me sarcastically, mocking me nonchalantly, making fun of me, and looking down upon me. He says, ""Sorry my arm hit your head."" He's really making fun of me, saying, ""Sorry my head hit your fist."" I don't want to apologize. I did express my anger improperly. I want to explain why he was wrong, more than I want to admit I was wrong, because he doesn't understand that he was wrong."
"1425"	"(12/23/1997)"	"Punching Archie Weber I'm in a group of people, in my room at home. Two men my age fight with me. One of them is my cousin Archie Weber. The other person is a combination of my brother Wally, housemate Stephen Ramos, or uncle Gary Redding. I fight these two men at the same time, punching. We roll onto the floor, over a submarine sandwich from Subway. The sandwich is mine. People gang up on me and hold me down. Others people drop hot green peppers on me, and in my mouth. I spit them out. I struggle and thrash, trying to break free. I break free, and I beat the shit out of each of the two men, one by one. I punch each one repeatedly in the nose and face until they can't make sense and the world is groggy to them. Some women are in the room."
"1426"	"(12/23/1997)"	"I Babysit While I Go Out I'm in a hotel like area with my friend Niles Zelling. I walk by a swimming pool, squeezing by a man and a woman on the black slanting deck of the pool. I almost loose my balance, and the two people almost lose their balance as well. We regain balance, I apologize to them, and move on. I am a babysitter, while myself and others go and do _____ ( I forget). It is later then later that evening, and I'm at a party. My sister Heather is there. She and I want to eat. I want to make some grilled chicken and onions, and more."
"1427"	"(12/23/1997)"	"Tarzan Tarzan is in the jungle. There's a bad leader and a strong bad man there. A dirty and dusty, solid, white BMW-like car pulls up to the small clearing where Tarzan is. Two South American-looking men dressed in shorts, shirts, hats, and boots get out of the car and walk into jungle empty-handed. I'm surprised at this, but I think they'll survive because others, including myself, have and do survive. The car is crowded, still. Tarzan tells a man, who may be the bad leader, that he should go into the car and Tarzan will meet him at the edge of the jungle at night. He says there will be enough light for them to make it. Tarzan then goes to the top of a tall tree, at the very top of which there is a bald trunk, broken off, with no branches. He stands on the top of the trunk, with his arms spread wide, and lets out his characteristic Tarzan yell. He then swings down, leaping and catching branches in a strong, sure-gripped manner. On his way down some men are in the tree. The men try to club and beat Tarzan. Tarzan evades the blows and beats the men, injuring them. Tarzan, the strong man, and the leader/manager are in a prison. Tarzan's hands are cuffed behind his back, and his is chained up facing the strong man. Tarzan and the strong man fight. The man head butts Tarzan, and Tarzan's face becomes red from blood. Tarzan rams the other man into a wall repeatedly. The man is facing a wall. Tarzan smashes his head into the wall repeatedly until the man is senseless. The fighting happens in a hallway outside a door with an automatic timed lock. The leader/manager and the strong man are put in the room behind the door, which is the prison. The door closes and makes the initial latch. Tarzan is still connected to the bad man by chains. When the door closes, the chains break. The manager tries to open the door when it starts to close fully. Two of his fingers get caught and are severed in the closing door. This door seems indestructible, and unstoppable. The bad strong man and the manager are in prison, and Tarzan is not."

"1431"	"(12/25/1997)"	"Annie's Biology Test I'm studying Cellular/Molecular Biology with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I'm paging through the textbook asking her questions to help her prepare for a test. I ask what kind of filament is being used in each of the cell process, including locomotion, mitosis, and others. We look in the textbook for the panel 17-1, which outlines the steps of mitosis."
"1432"	"(12/25/1997)"	"The Spiral Flight I walk over near a line of people to get on a plane. My classmate from Brimson Anthony Holden is there. There are some people already in line for the flight. I try to find the right place to stand, because the line seems to branch off into two lines. I choose one of the lines and stand in the metal corral-like line. I'm then the first person in line. A woman calls out for anyone who is flying to Reinhorse, which I know is in Germany, to come to the front of the line. Several men walk by me and descend a staircase to talk to the woman. I hear the woman ask if any of them are willing to change flights, because the flight they're on is really full. The woman says they don't have to change, because they do all have a seat on the flight, but if they did change they would receive compensation. While they talk, we all start to move, and I realize we're going onto a plane flying to Los Angeles. We take off and immediately make a hard right turn. The plane keeps rolling, and we fly in a spiral, spinning like a top as we fly forward. One of the engines is out, and that is causing the spiral. The stewardess says the passengers need to pound on the inside of the walls to get the engine to start, as if it is just stuck. The emergency exit on the plane is open. The engine doesn't start. We spin and fly. People are yelling. I sit next to several men, including my housemate Stephen Ramos. I yell and laugh. We are in a pretty good mood considering we're probably going to die. I joke about how our plane crashing could make a great Fox television special, like ""World's Worse Plane Crashes"". We don't gain altitude, and must land. There is a train below us entering a train yard. If we could land on top of the fast train, we wouldn't crash, and the train could just slow down. We seem to be going in for a landing at the train yard. Then our plane is on the snow-covered ground on a street, sliding, not very fast. I think that since we're in the nose of the plane if the plane slides into the house at the end of the road we could get hurt. The plane stops on the road. I get out of the plane and talk to Stephen. I tell him this whole episode has been so amazing that I must be dreaming. I say this very nonchalantly. I turn and look back and the plane isn't there: I am dreaming! The street is empty: without any people or a plane."
"1433"	"(12/25/1997)"	"The Dream Date I'm driving my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas home in my truck. We drive across the bridge towards Riverside School and continue going straight, through the lights. She sits close to me on the seat. I lean over and kiss her on the cheek. I keep driving. She puts her hands down my pants, touching my penis. We kiss as I drive. It's pleasant and enjoyable to kiss her. She straddles me, and we kiss. It's difficult to drive as we do this, and we both chuckle. I feel that any moment I could ejaculate, and I want her to give me fellatio. I do ejaculate, because I'm very aroused. I wake up on a bed and realize that what just occurred was a dream. I'm sitting, half lying, on a bed. There are women in the room. I sit up, embarrassed that I've just ejaculated. I say something to the women, trusting that atonia had prevailed when I was in REM and I hadn't moved. My pants seemed to be pulled down enough to expose my genitals. I cover myself up as I pull up my pants. We were all in this room studying, and we fell asleep. The women woke up when I did. Their mother enters the room and is mad because she's been looking for them a long time."
"1434"	"(12/25/1997)"	"Autofellatio 12 I'm in my bedroom at home. I lay backwards on my bed, with my head at the far end of the bed near the attic. I give myself fellatio. At first I only suck the top half of my erection, and then I put it all the way into my mouth and throat, while I stroke it with my hand. I pull my legs towards me, crouching over. There are radios in the room: walkie-talkie like CB's that have small red lights on. I'm worried about people entering the room and seeing me."
"1435"	"(12/25/1997)"	"Class Ski Trip I'm skiing with my brother Wally and his roommates. We're about to go up a chairlift. I'm then on a class skiing trip. I go up the chairlift alone. There is a chair very close behind me. Several of my women classmates are in it. The chair lift goes through spaces between cement pillars. I duck so I don't hit my head. We see some bird-like animals near a patch of trees. There are several birds: one is a wild turkey, and another is a baby wild turkey. We get to the top of the hill. There's a very steep drop, rounded with hard-packed snow that leads down to a town at the bottom of the hill. I ride the lift off the steep hill face, over the edge, and it makes a U-turn back towards the hill. I'm not on the seat, and I hang onto a cable until I get back over the ground so I can jump down. I hop off. My skis are still on the chairlift: I'm not wearing them. I get them somehow. I think I should've gotten off the lift just as it reached the top before it made the U-turn. My skis slide down the hill as I watch despondently, annoyed. People help me by bring them back up to me. I lose my hat and my map, which fall down the hill. People help me with these too, bringing them back up. One of the people who help is my classmate Shawn or Ryan Bay. I am very clumsy at the top of the hill. I'm very excited and happy to be here, and to start skiing. It's a nice place. I see some people on the chairlift coming up that I know from high school. I want to tell them to get off before the U-turn. My classmate from Brimson Heather Beckers appears with the skiing group. I'm pleasantly surprised to see her. I think this is a good opportunity for me to get to know her, and court her."
"1436"	"(12/26/1997)"	"Four Pairs of Muddy Pants I'm at a tennis match. I walk very close to the courts as the matches begin. My friend Nat Miller, high school teammate Larry Rollie, and classmate Carol Derth are each playing. I sit on bleachers on one end of the courts and watch Nat and Carol play their matches. Carol is in the closest court. She is wearing dark bluish glasses and has braces. She looks at me. I try not to look at her encouragingly, but not show my disinterest in her openly. I think she thinks we're a couple. I watch the matches from a room in a house. The window I look out is on the second or third floor, and it is frosted up so it's hard to see out. There is a girl younger than I that I know there, and a woman who seems to be a teacher from Carter School, or Carol's mother. I walk out, down stairs, followed by the woman. We pass Sally Topp, a teacher I know from Carter School. The teacher that follows me says hi to Sally. I get outside and go up to Nat and hug him. His match is over and I can tell he won, even though I didn't see the end of the match, because he's happy. I start walking with Nat and my housemate Stephen Ramos. They get the back of my jeans all muddy somehow. I'm really mad at them, and I tell them angrily that because of the two of them I've ruined four pairs of pants in the past year. I go up to a house and wipe off my boots, which are very muddy. I'm at the front door, but I go to another secondary door. I blow the dirt off the key and open the door slightly. There are two cats inside that try to get out so I'm careful when entering. I enter, and know Nat is in the shower. There's one message on the answering machine that I play. The message is from Party Control in Wilmerton. A man says that they have heard about a party and he says the steps that Party Control is going to take to counteract the party. Nat's tennis evaluation form is on the table. He has given himself good marks with respect to the match he just played. There is a gate that extends the table to the countertop, with a release button on top. The cats climb this gate."
"1437"	"(12/26/1997)"	"Eating at Heplin's I'm riding in a car in Wilmerton that my sister Ramona is driving down 3rd Street going east. I look near Track Avenue to see if I happen to get a glimpse of my old classmates, the Allures. We drive near the reformatory. There are many prisoners outside lifting weights and doing other activities. We pull up to an apartment building that is right next to the reformatory, to pick up one of Ramona's friends. I go back to the car after ringing some doorbells and get in, along with my high school classmates Carolyn and Julie Heplin. Ramona is drunk, so I drive. I'm not as drunk as she. I give the Heplin's a ride home. I'm in their house, eating something. Ramona has gone out to our car. The Heplin sisters and a man are there. I feel out of place because this is the ""cool"" crowd and I'm less ""cool"", having less social status, less money, etc. We talk a bit, and I leave. I feel pressure to leave. I go out to our car."
"1438"	"(12/26/1997)"	"Working Two Jobs I'm working two jobs. It is Christmas break from school, and I'm at home. My brother Wally may work a job with me. One is a day job, and one is an evening job. My dad is there. I hurry to get from job to job at about 5:00pm. I feel good about working: I feel busy."
"1439"	"(12/27/1997)"	"Gee or Bee Beckers I'm in a cafeteria or grocery store that is like Mason Cafeteria at Brimson. I'm sitting a table with a man I know vaguely from class, his girlfriend, and another woman. My classmate Heather Beckers gets up at the other end of the large room. She walks over closer to us to go through the food line. The man comments on Heather being cute. I say I agree, and I ask Heather's name, pretending I don't know her. He says her name is Gee or Bee, and I think this is different than Heather, like I thought. The man also says that Heather is really friendly and has a lot of friends. He gets up and goes to the other end of the room where Heather is. He gets some food, nonchalantly. He may talk to her. I get up and walk to get some food. He passes me by and indicates He may have mentioned something to her about me."
"1440"	"(12/27/1997)"	"Blueberry Waffles I walk by a shelf of food at a grocery store to get a box of some kind of food mix, soup, or something generic. I start a waffle iron and put some shortening on it to grease it. I start to mix up blueberry muffin mix for the waffles. There is a lot of old, rotting cheese on a shelf, which I think is like the Whitman house. I add oil, eggs, and cheese to the mix. There are many generic mixes on the shelf, as well as yellow generic cans of blueberries."
"1441"	"(12/27/1997)"	"The Firm Blueberry Muffin Line I'm in a coffee shop eating blueberry muffins. The muffins are in the green photograph box I have at home. A few muffins are in a plastic bag in the box. A female employee comes up to me and inquires about my muffins. I tell her I'll draw a black line on the inside of the box or bag that the muffins are in, and I show her my receipt to appease her. I speak firmly and calmly, and am sure of myself. Some people carry signs from high school chemistry about a mol of food. There is one drawing of pizza that looks real. People sit near me. They say something about me eating a mol of food, which may be burgers, fries of pizza. I chuckle at this, knowing it's not something I'm interested in trying to do."
"1442"	"(12/27/1997)"	"The Absentminded Professor I'm in an academic building going to a classroom. I see the woman from my Cellular/Molecular Biology class, who is always promoting her homosexual/bisexual professor's views, at or in one of the elevators. I go into a second elevator. It drops fast, and I float off the floor and hover at the ceiling because we descend so fast. I walk to a huge auditorium that is divided into sections, which are classrooms. I go to room 105. There is a class there taking place. I sit at the side. There is a large movie screen with an introductory/informational movie playing. I know when my class meets in 10 or 15 minutes, we'll see the same movie. The male professor is Asian. He is absentminded, and doesn't think in the same time frame that other professors do. He is like Apu from the television show the Simpsons, or my anthropology professor Harold Gunther. He doesn't plan ahead, but deals curtly with problems as they arise."
"1443"	"(12/28/1997)"	"Helen Ralston's Wedding Album I walk into a video store. It's about 3:00am. I have permission to check out movies: I know someone who works here. The lights are on and other people are there who also have special access. I walk by some computers. There is a woman working there. I wonder what will happen if I don't check out the movie properly and the alarm sounds as I exit. I'll feel awkward trying to explain that someone gave me permission. There seems to be one man in charge of the store. He goes to the door when someone rings the bell. I walk on and start to look at photograph and wedding albums where there are many photographs of naked couples. The couples are covered in blankets or bubbles, their bodies partially obscured. I see my cousin Helen Ralston's wedding album. I look in it and can't decide which woman is Helen. There is a blond and a brunette woman. The brunette woman is much prettier and I hope it is she. I find more photographs that make me realize that Helen is the brunette. She is beautiful."
"1444"	"(12/28/1997)"	"The Black Snake I see some people plant a very large marijuana plant in the desert. They dig a hole for it and plant it carefully. I see a big bush with a black snake in it. It seems to be near, on a car, where others and I are. The head of the snake may or may not be poisonous. The tail looks like a head, with eye and mouth-shaped features. A man may get bitten on his nose. I don't think this is serious, or poisonous. There is a man who leaves his house with his teenage daughter and her boyfriend. I may be the man. The boyfriend drives. They are going to kill the snake. The man has a black handgun, loaded and cocked with the safety on. I sit on the left side of the boyfriend and shift gears. He is a beginning driver with a stick shift. It's dark out. We approach an intersection where we have a stop sign. The boyfriend doesn't stop. I look to see if there is cross traffic, and see none, so I don't do anything. We go through the stop sign. I tell him we just ran a stop sign, he's lucky there were no police, and that I looked for traffic."
"1445"	"(12/28/1997)"	"The Keg-Less Party I'm relaxing on a couch without a shirt on a warm summer evening. My classmate Erica Klein is there. We talk about the party. She says her dog knows about it, and means a lot of people know. I joke, ""Then where is your dog? He should be here!"" My housemate Stephen Ramos and our friend Jimmy Youngman arrive. It's a little bit after 10:00pm. I realize I forgot to get a keg for the party! Jimmy says all the liquor stores are closed. I wonder what I'm going to do. I think just by chance that Stephen may have gotten a keg, so I go downstairs to look. The basement is the basement at home. The keg is not there, but the old half-empty keg is there. I scramble to find beer, thinking of my options. My brother Wally says the outpost store may be open. My friend's father Dick Zates arrives with a couple pounds of ground venison. I greet him and take the venison from him. People are playing cards in the living room. I ask if I can play a hand quickly. They say no, but I still have cards. I have two Queens, two Aces, two Jokers, and some other cards. They seem to be playing a progressive poker game, and one has to have a full house to open the betting. I lay down my cards when they're done. I've got four Aces."
"1446"	"(12/28/1997)"	"My Ball And Chain Package I'm at Brimson walking out of the art building. I see my classmate Barb Fenster and others. I walk up the sidewalk towards the library, carrying two textbooks in my left hand. I see my classmate Tina Schredl sitting with others on the right side of the sidewalk. I look at her overtly and make eye contact. I give her a little halfhearted smile, like I always do, and keep walking. I walk past the library. My classmate Nellie Hammer walks next to me and says, ""Hi Kenneth."" I turn and say hi, feeling choked up, as we walk. She is wearing red tights. She slips on an icy spot, and makes a pretty good recovery before falling down. I chuckle jokingly at this. We talk and walk towards Courtyard Hall. She is much more agreeable than I would have guessed by looking at her. We part paths. I walk towards the student union. There are several bicycles in the bicycle rack, including my housemate Stephen's old red bicycle. There is a man on a skateboard that skates up and jumps onto the front fork of Stephen's bicycle. I think this is odd, and wonder why he's doing it. Stephen skates up on his skateboard, coming from the library. I walk into the student union. A group of women, including my acquaintances Pat, Gail, and Nora, exit as I enter. They say hi to me. Right as I walk in the door people are conducting a survey for which one is pressured to participate in. My friend Jill Banks is there, and says there is a party at our classmate Sean's house. The survey is about homosexuality, society, and service. I'm not interested in it, and walk on. I go to get my mail. I'm mellow, almost bored, and I feel a bit down: depressed. There are no locks on the mailboxes, which open like bulk food bins. I lift up the lid to my box and get my mail. I have three slips for packages. One of the slips says it is a ""Ball and Chain"" package. I have two skateboards with me, which are hard to carry with my other stuff. I look at my mail solemnly. My friend Melanie McDyss comes up to me and gives me a big hug. She seems to notice that I'm feeling down. Her hug is unexpected, but very nice, and I appreciate it. My classmate Rachel Tandor is there. I hear her talk about her homework problems. I start to give Rachel my sleep and dreams lecture, saying how they are more important than other work. Several of Rachel's friends listen, sitting at a table. I say people need to focus not on work, but more on sleep and dreams. Then I joke, ""Look at me: I focus on dreams, and look how smart I am!"" We all laugh. Rachel had interrupted my hug with Melanie, and I want to talk with Melanie. I hope I can get my three packages: it's almost 4:30pm, and the post office will close soon."
"1447"	"(12/28/1997)"	"Avoiding Conversation I'm sitting with my friends Kristy Puffy, Kevin Simpson, and Jackie Hunter in an apartment on the east side of Wilmerton. I eat an apple out of a small refrigerator. The door falls off the refrigerator. It is unattached, but will still stick to the refrigerator. I make conversation with Kristy, asking her a question about the party with her and Fred Slick. She answers. I say that Jackie was in a dream I had recently. I really want to talk with Jackie, but I feel uncomfortable, like the bad guy, because she never talks to me and is never friendly."
"1448"	"(12/30/1997)"	"Three Comedians There is an airport, and a bad cat-like woman. There are three comedians in an act. One of the comedians is outside. There are three lines in the sky, which seems to be dark. The lines are close together. One of the lines is traced in red crayon, while a comedian waits for the audience to get back. The comedian and the line in the sky are outside a house with people in it."
"1449"	"(12/30/1997)"	"The Renovated Church I'm at an old and run down building. I walk outside to get away from work. I walk up stairs to a balcony area on the roof. The roof is soft and mushy and the shingles seem to cave in. The building is a run down church. I slide down the rounded side of the barn-like roof. I'm cleaning in the building. Others and I tear off the outside covering of rolls of toilet paper that are stacked case by case into a wall. I clear shelves and desks, removing utensils and garbage from them. I scrub the shelves. Others question why I'm putting so much effort into scrubbing these filthy shelves. I say that anything worth doing is worth doing well."
"1450"	"(12/30/1997)"	"The Armed Party I'm having a party at home. Many people arrive in a short period of time. I shake my friend Tim Zelling's hand there. Three teams show up, with I think are the men's and women's basketball teams and the men's soccer team, from Brimson. I'm very worried, and try to keep the growing party under control, while still having a good time. A small bus arrives with my friend Emerald Reinhold and her friends. I see a woman who I know is a member of the Lawson family, and insist that she leave. I won't allow her to be here because she has a video camera. She reluctantly accepts my authority. There are some people with guns near the garage! I go up to them and ask them what they hell they're doing with rifles. One gun is a deer shotgun, another a rifle with a scope. I tell the people with the guns to leave! They are stubborn. These people are back from the dead. Two of the Peppercorn sisters are there, and say hi to me as I walk around. They seem to be having a good time. A woman comes up to me and asks for a corkscrew. I go in the house with her and get one. She needs it to open a yogurt-like container, which I open. She flirts and puts her arm around me, and I play this down. The people with guns, and with them everyone else, leave! I see a dream reenacted. I know about this dream I see. In it, my professor Grace Kurkowski and others are wearing sexy lingerie, and lying around the lawn. They awaken. This is a nightmare that is reenacted for, and in, my life."

"1452"	"(12/30/1997)"	"Raspberry French Toast I am with my brother Wally, sister Ramona, and Ramona's friend Stacey. I eat some bagel-like French toast with raspberry sauce that Stacey couldn't finish eating. I walk with my friend Niles Zelling to his car in the West Parking Lot at Brimson."
"1453"	"(01/02/1998)"	"Vail Trip I'm thinking about the trip to Vail with my friends Niles and Tim Zelling. My sister Ramona is coming. I say to her that she'll have to put up with all of our guy talk. Then I think: I don't really want Ramona to come along."
"1454"	"(01/02/1998)"	"Assisting in Spin Procedure I'm in the parking lot in back of the building where my friend Sarah Reed's mother works. I'm with Sarah and our friend Kari Otis. We're there for Sarah to get a procedure called a ____ (AFDS?), or something. It is a spin procedure, so Sarah will be spun around in a g-force machine really fast. This will be painful. Sarah is drugged. She is in a black sport utility vehicle, like a Chevrolet suburban or blazer. Kari gets out and puts on white latex gloves. Kari usually administers this procedure. I have short hair: about _ long. I'm wearing all white. This is the usual procedure. I will help this time."
"1455"	"(01/02/1998)"	"The Miniature Saber Tooth Bear I'm sitting on a bench, between Burger King and Daytons, with my backpack, in the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. The bench faces west, towards a store where a woman is working. The store is small, and the woman neatly dressed, and selling small, expensive items. I seem to be wearing gloves. I get a basketball out of my backpack. I sit on the edge of the bench, bouncing the ball. It gets away from me and rolls towards the small store. I get up and follow it, but not hurriedly. It rolls into the store, and I go pick it up, apologizing briefly to the woman. She is really mad, and gives me a deathly look. She says she's going to call security, and then does so. I go and sit down on the bench. I'm worried about what security will do when they arrive. I see the security guard that I know from high school. He struts over to the store in his characteristic way. After a brief interaction there he walks past me. He trips over my legs, which are outstretched. He sits down next to me on the bench. I think he's going to say something about the basketball rolling into the store, but instead he tells me he caught a two-pound bass! I ask if he caught it through the ice. He says yes! He says he and another man also caught a six-pound walleye and a small bear! He says he also shot a small bear. I cut my index finger on an object that one usually wouldn't get cut on: it seems to be a relatively flat sheet-like structure, like a piece of cardboard. The cut is about _ inch long, and very fine, like a paper cut. I put a band-aid on it, and instead of wrapping it around the tip of my finger, I apply it lengthwise, over the tip of my finger. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there. She meets a fat man. I hear her talking to him. She has doubts about our relationship, and I hear her talk negatively to him about me. The band-aid doesn't stick to my finger. I have a small black bear in my hands as I sit on the bench. It's about three inches high. It has a white stripe down its back and large fangs like a saber tooth tiger. People playfully put their finger in its mouth, poking its large teeth. I'm wary of this, even though it seems to be such a cute little playful animal. The bear is getting sleepy in my hand: it is drugged."
"1456"	"(01/02/1998)"	"The Type I/Type II Move I'm walking down 1st Street in Oak Valley, going east. There is a huge crowd of people ahead of me, going to the bars. I come up to the back of this crowd. My childhood neighbor, Tim Robbins, is 23, and is a bar bouncer. The people at the back of the crowd drink Type I: drink Busch Light. I want to move from this position, to the Type II crowd, where the drink is Randy Light. This is a difficult move to make. There is Banana Mush, which is a social/popularity knowledge slush drink. My friend Patrick Bergman is at the back of the crowd trying to recruit people for a bowling league. I see a league advertised on a board, two days per week, after school from 2-4pm, or 4-?pm. I see my neighbor Mary Robbins across the street."
"1457"	"(01/03/1998)"	"Brimson Boys State I arrive at Brimson for a week of Boys State. My mom is with me, dropping me off. We're in an old gymnasium with hardwood floors. Many people are there. I see some guys I recognize from my last stay at Boys State, and shake their hands. One of them may be named Eduardo. My classmate Monique Thorble is in the crowd, as well as a person who looks like my old classmate Mira Nader. Something happens, and people hurry to their rooms. I have just arrived, and so I go to get a packet and a homeroom assignment from a man and woman sitting at a table. I receive a foil helium balloon with a picture of the Wiley Coyote pressed up against one side, and another balloon. I tie the other balloon down, by accident, but when I leave it is cut and I take it. People exit the gymnasium. I kiss my mom goodbye and tell her I'll see her on Saturday. I'm not looking forward to this week, but I know it will pass. It's kind of a chore. I walk up stairs in a stairwell, and outside there is a group of kids, lined up, stepping in unison. They're in a courtyard between several old brown buildings. There are several inches of snow on the ground. The stepping they're doing seems to be almost a Nazi-like ritual. I'm going to room Jackson 2G. I stop on a floor and look in a bathroom, thinking it is the room, but it's not, and there are a lot of rowdy guys in the bathroom. It's very loud and crowded. I walk on and see a little number on the wall for my room. I enter. It is a stairway going up. I realize it goes to a quad room. I'm not excited about living with three other guys. I get to the top of the stairs, and see the room is a large single room: an attic. There are four beds. One bed seems to be neat and unoccupied, in the corner. I think it is mine. Three guys are sitting on a couch. I walk up to them and say halfheartedly that I guess I'm the fourth roommate. I shake their hands and we introduce ourselves. A man named Oldie is on the left, Orange is in the middle, and ____ (I forget) is on the right. The room is filthy, and their stuff is everywhere. There is a bed in a different corner, with their stuff piled on top of it, which is mine. I know there will be no privacy. I guess I'll have to put up with this for a week. They all smoke marijuana. I find a joint of marijuana on my bed. One of the guys says they cornered a mouse. I ask if he killed it, thinking to myself: what good is it to just corner a mouse? This is a Brimson dorm room, and it has hardwood floors, like Wonkers Hall."
"1458"	"(01/03/1998)"	"Super Power Engines I'm on a plane that is crashing, it is going down. It seems to spiral downwards. We get close to the ground and one or both engines fire explosively, blasting the plane up and averting the crash. The firepower of the engines at this point is unfathomable. The plane was crashing, and the boost from the engines was immense, like a rocket, and the plane blasted up into the sky. The plane may fly in spirals, because only one engine may fire. The plane crashes in a lake. It seems to crash relatively softly and horizontally. Many people, including myself, survive. Some people die. I'm on shore with survivors, and I tell some people to go gather up the dead bodies, which are in the lake. Others and I go with a man who informs us of a new type of power that was used in our plane, experimentally. I am surprised by the use of this new power, and want to learn more about it. The new power was being tested on that plane. I was very impressed by the power of the engines to avert the crash, initially."

They walk by me. Melanie says a short, halfhearted hi, and keeps walking. I see my classmate Megan Cunningham and two older men. She says something about her party that night. I express mild interest, to appease her, but am not interested in the party and won't go. I sit and read the letter. It is on several sheets of letter-sized white paper. As I read the letter, my classmate Bethany Hurwitz and a woman I know from high school bother me. Melanie sits at a distance from me, down near the garden, as I read. The letter is slightly odd, and somewhat sexual in parts. The woman from high school seems to be reading along with me. The letter is on the inside of a piece of a Fruit Loops cereal box. In the letter Melanie wrote a poem entitled ""Success"", and told me of a dream in which she and I nearly had sex. I'm lying back on the ground, and the woman is standing near me. I yell and sweat at her, telling her to go away. Melanie is closer to me then, sitting cross-legged in the grass. A bit later I turn and look and Melanie is very close to me. I quickly crawl over and jokingly tackle her, and we wrestle. She talks about a dream she had in which she and I almost had sex: we did everything but have sex. She has a name for sex, ____ ( I forget). She tells me how her dream happened, acting it out as we roll in the grass. She says, ""Like this"", and kisses me briefly. I kiss her back, more aggressively. She tells me not to kiss her because all the people are around. She has dyed her hair red and is wearing a red striped shirt. There are a couple tackle boxes there with slip bobbers in them. The tackle boxes are open. Melanie and I talk about the boxes. I may dampen the conversation by what I say."
"1460"	"(01/04/1998)"	"Trip Plans My friends Tim and Niles Zelling and I are about to make our trip to Vail. I talk to my friend Nat Miller on the phone and he wants us to try to make it to Iowa to watch the New York Knicks game with him. I talk to my brother Wally on the phone and tell him I'll bring a five-liter box of wine when we come, and that I can bring some Black Velvet whiskey and/or some Menthol 100 if he wants. He says he may pick up a case of beer."
"1461"	"(01/04/1998)"	"The Tri-Locked Gate There is a man in the bathroom at my neighbor the Jones' house. He tries to escape out a window, but he is very broad and large. The place is a school. The man is then a boy, and he flees down a hall and out a doorway where some administrators are. The administrators aren't happy that the boy is trying to get out. The area outside the school is fenced in. The boy runs up to a gate that is locked in three places: the bottom, middle, and top. A woman is at the gate with the keys. She is slow to open the locks: not swift and precise. There is pressure from behind the boy."
"1462"	"(01/07/1998)"	"A Tequila Keg There is a keg party. My friend Niles Zelling is involved, and he may buy the kegs. Something happens with Mickey Mantle. Something happens with a woman fighter, and the Simpson's Oscar night. There is a keg of Rolling Rock beer and a keg of tequila. The keg of Rolling Rock costs $150. I seem to be in a town, and may be driving. It is dark."
"1463"	"(01/07/1998)"	"Racial Integration I'm with several people. There is a fight between a black and a white man. I break up the fight. A boy is there with a cheese grater. He hits me, intentionally scraping me with the grater. I tell him firmly and calmly to stop. One of the men is belligerent. I'm in a cafeteria with my friend Matt Yams. Matt is going to eat. Normally I don't have access here, but I may try to eat this once with Matt. Matt mentions McDonalds across the road, and we decide to eat there. We walk across the street. My high school classmate Eric Spears and others walk across the road. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. I may beat up a white man. Something happens with guns. The guns are put aside in a fight. I walk outside at an intersection and use the discarded guns to get people's attention, by firing them into the air. I give a short speech, and then give the floor back to a black man who is with me. I talk about and promote the integration between black and white people. I walk inside and people start to form a group for which officers are needed. I am made president of this now society, and I get keys."
"1464"	"(01/07/1998)"	"Beating Mark Long I'm with others, and my dead friend Mark Long arrives. He is alive! I hug him. He doesn't want to hug me, and keeps his distance. I ask his sisters, Becky and Shannon, if he is alive. I ask him, ""Are you alive?"" I talk to him. Though it is good to see him, it is uncomfortable. I am angry with him. I yell at him, telling him he ditched out. He displays guilt and remorse. I beat him, smashing his head into a wall."
"1465"	"(01/07/1998)"	"Camping With Emily Zates I'm with my friend Emily Zates and another woman, who seems like our friend Esther Thurman, but isn't. We are at Fly Lake in the Big Resort Area. We're going to camp. They are swimming. I want to swim naked. I feel that I should be all natural here. We need to move our gear off the portage in case other people come. We're in a church-like building. I go pick up a load of our gear and move it, and go to tell the others. I walk into a very solemn, church-like ceremony. It seems like a performance."
"1466"	"(01/07/1998)"	"The Borrowed Canoe I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson. We seem to not have a canoe. There is a canoe with a long foam yoke in the water. We're going to use this canoe. It belongs to a man, and he will let us use it. It is an aluminum canoe with a dent, but it will work. The man takes a lot of photographs. The man seems to do some target shooting: there is a hole-filled target there. I am going to give him collateral for the canoe, so I look for my old Discover credit card that I've never used. I don't find it, but do find another credit card made of clear plastic. The man lives in Oak Valley, he says, and I tell him I'm also from there. He lives by MCI, which I know to be Roadside Company, down near the apartments next to the Dirty River. His last name is Aldger, and his middle name is Marshall. My middle name is Marshall too, I say. I consider not returning the canoe to him. There are chunks of ice on the water. Kevin and I are heavily packed. Kevin is trying to shovel snow with a plant holder. We're going to Oval Lake (which in real life is Fly Lake, I know)."
"1467"	"(01/08/1998)"	"Disrespecting Rachel Steiner I'm at a restaurant where my friend Nate Nelling is working as a cook. I see my friend Marge Drummond in a booth, and go sit with her. My friend Emily Zates is there, having a gin and tonic. I had a bloody nose earlier in the day and there is crusty dry toilet paper in the inside of my nose from this. My friend Mya Rousing is there. She may see the toilet paper. I eat a mushy onion and pepper-covered tortilla. I'm going into a place that is Grocery Getto, though it looks like a church. I see a man who appears to be the assistant manager of the store, Mike Johnson. He is on a four-wheeler. I think of writing a dream pamphlet for this church-like place. I walk into the building. Nothing is happening upstairs. I go downstairs, where I find my brother Wally watching a movie with my classmate Rachel Steiner, on the couch. When I see them I don't want to be there. I make the conversation terse, and say I'm tired, and leave. I disrespect Rachel. I don't want to see or talk to her."
"1468"	"(01/08/1998)"	"No Dogs My housemate Stephen Ramos calls me on the phone and talks to me about getting a dog at our house. I don't want a dog at our house, and I don't want to talk to Stephen about it."
"1469"	"(01/08/1998)"	"Chasing Melanie I'm in or around a big old house, which may be the Whitman house. Some men and boys are moving or changing something: altering cement pillars or metal rods, and carrying heavy bags of cement around. I'm willing to help, but no one seems to recognize me, so I don't. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. We kiss, and may start to have a sexual encounter. She then wanders through the house, and I follow her, wanting to have a sexual encounter. There are many rooms. I look in the attic, where I see my sister Heather."
"1470"	"(01/08/1998)"	"Coverless Dream Book An Australian class group photograph is being taken. I get pushed to the edge of the group in the crowded photograph. It's raining and dark outside. My friend Tom Napper and I are in a small shop. He buys candy. I have lent ""Bedside Guide To Dreams"" book to someone. That person returns it and the back cover is torn off."
"1471"	"(01/08/1998)"	"Stuck In A Toilet I'm at home in the bathroom. I sit down on the toilet and seem to sink in: my butt seems to get stuck! I pull by butt out of the toilet. I look through the window above the shower and see the man who lives in the neighbor's upstairs apartment. I watch him by looking at a mirror in which his image is reflected in, rather than directly at him, because otherwise I think he may know I'm watching him. The man me be masturbating or be about to defecate. I see him with his pants down. His penis is really big: about one-and-a-half inches wide and six or seven inches long, when half flaccid. He may put on false eyelashes and do other things that make me think he may be a transvestite."
"1472"	"(01/08/1998)"	"Niles! I'm in a mall-like area where there are some theatres of some kind. My high school classmate Paul Miller talks to me briefly, and then goes into a theatre. I go into a theatre with my friend Niles Zelling. It's a television show/movie/musical type theatre that has commercials. I have a deer antler. Niles and I sit down. A man behind me grabs the antler out of my hand. I turn around and grab his free hand and bend his fingers back, almost breaking them, to make him give me the antler back. He doesn't give it back. I stop behind his fingers. I'll kick his ass after the show. It's dark, and the usher comes down the aisle behind us. He says, ""Niles!"" in a loud voice, and I know that the usher has come because Niles' girlfriend Jessica or her mother has come for Niles. I don't have a good time at the show. There are a few distinct young teenagers that strike me as being less-than-bright."
"1473"	"(01/10/1998)"	"The Test Book I'm reading a book and am being tested on the material in the book. There is something called an air curare, which makes one's eyes burn, and produces toxic gas in decaying bodies. There is a war occurring. I see my classmate Megan Cunningham near the Wilmerton Hospital. There is a question of skiing in Vail, and a question on Valex, which is how to use a reference center. There is a question about how Judd Decker would take a ___ ( I forget) pill, and how to take drugs. I'm supposed to list the page number that I find the information on so even if I guess the correct answer it doesn't matter. There is a farmer who won't put grain into his anus through a funnel any more, at a National Guard Armory. There is a question on high altitude urination."
"1474"	"(01/11/1998)"	"A Half Hug I arrive at a gymnasium where an Armstrong alumni basketball game is going to take place. I walk in with my old teammate Ron Lind and another man. Our old coach, Jackson Shooter, is happy to see me. He looks different. My old classmate Todd Mahoney is there, as well as several older men in their 30's and 40's. Jackson comes over and we shake hands. I put my left hand on his back, as I lean in for a hug. He doesn't seem to want to hug me. It is a slightly uncomfortable, restrained, half-hug,."
"1475"	"(01/11/1998)"	"The Treasure Hunt I arrive in the Armstrong High School parking lot in the morning. My friend from Brimson Ivory Alshire is there. I walk in with her. I have on sweat pants and flip flop-like slippers on. I put a key or set of keys inside the bottom cuff of my sweat pants. It's winter. As I enter the building I see my friend from Brimson Beth Mock, who I know is my high school classmate Carol Derth. I go up to her to talk. I feel uncomfortable: we haven't seen each other in a while. Beth has short, dark hair. I realize she has cut and dyed her hair, because Carol had blond hair. She asks if I like it, and I say, ""No"", very bluntly, and walk away. My friends Sarah Reed, Mya Rousing, and many others are there. I go sit down for class. My old teammate Simon Naver is sitting at a table. Others I know are at a nearby table. I sit by myself at a table because I don't want to associate with many of the others. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas comes and sits with me. Our old teacher Phillip Hacker is teaching Pre-Calculus. We're in the commons-like area, with many tables. I forget my book, so I write a note to myself to get it. I also write a note to my friend Melvin Dahlheimer so that he remembers to get any books he'll need for a class. I'm in the driver's seat of a car with Annie and another woman. I give Annie a letter in an envelope that I've just written, but haven't yet put a stamp on. I give her the letter rather than mailing it to her, because she's there. We're on a class field trip. The car in front of me takes off. I hurry to catch up and almost get lost. We come to a freeway. People in the class are on bicycles. I get on a bicycle and start pedaling. I ride on the freeway, not sure of where those ahead of me have gone. I ride fast, leaving many people behind. I go through a tunnel and am in a house-like structure. I open several doors that have brick walls behind them, so one can't step through the door. It is as if the doors were mounted on the brick wall for decoration. I go downstairs carrying my 10-speed bicycle. I see my friend Melanie McDyss, who is on foot. We hug and laugh and joke. I go out of the house into a garden-like area. Some people, who may be students, are there, with a teacher, who may be Phillip. There is a moss-covered coffin there. I scrape away the moss from the top of it. I uncover a key hold on the middle of the side of the coffin. I'm happy because I think there is only one keyhole. It seems to me that this is a treasure hunt, and because I have uncovered the only keyhole, I'm the winner. The teacher seems to have the key. A second keyhole is uncovered at the head of the coffin. The top of the coffin slides off when it is pushed: no key is needed to remove it. I wonder if this could be a hoax, or if the coffin was robbed, because nothing in the coffin strikes me as important or valuable."
"1476"	"(01/11/1998)"	"Eight and Seven Dollar Bills I'm at a Dairy Queen with a male police chief to my left. I order a peanut buster parfait. A young girl makes it. It has strawberry Quik-like powder on top, which I am not impressed by. To pay, I take out the wad of bills in my wallet and give them all to the girl. She takes a $10 bill from the stack and I take the rest of the bills back. For my change she gives me a $10, $8, $7, and $5 bill. I look at them and wonder if I'm not aware of the new $7 and $8 bills. So I say to the chief, ""Look at this!"" From the look on his face I know the two bills are counterfeit. I tell the girl to take the bills back and give me real change. She gives me genuine bills, which are playing cards in a cardboard box. The counterfeit bills she gets by breaking cards off a strip of cards that are connected. There are fish in the box. I may dump or strain out some of the water in the box. The girl working casts a fishing rod, and the line goes out into the water around us. The police chief and I try to promote this: her fishing, as opposed to her counterfeiting. Her lure is a fly-like Mister Twister type jig."
"1477"	"(01/12/1998)"	"Flight Seating I'm boarding a Qantas flight for Australia. I'm in line in my kitchen at home. I grab a plate, cup, knife, and fork for the flight. I board the plane and find my seat. I sit next to the aisle of a section of three seats, on the side of the plane. Then my ticket says my seat is forward, so I move up to the second row, behind the cockpit. There are only two seats on this side, and they're bigger. I'm happy to have a larger seat for the long flight. I can see the pilot, the windows, and out the front of the plane. Someone tells me this isn't my seat, and I must move back a few rows. I then see my seat is in the middle of the middle section of seats: the one place where I was hoping it wouldn't be because I can't move due to lack of leg room."
"1478"	"(01/13/1998)"	"What Does Control Mean? I'm in a room with a male ski instructor. He talks about piano-type skiing, which is where someone drops in on a mountain from a helicopter. It's called piano skiing because the keys on a piano correspond to the depressions in the snow from where the person landed. My friend Nate Nelling and grade school classmate John Ryan are there. There are small brown paper bags of apples. I take an apple to eat. I'm in a motorboat driving down a road, with no water. The road seems to the one that goes past the police station and post office in downtown Wilmerton. We go westward, and are past the main turnoff for 3rd Street. Nate tells me a dream. John asks me, ""What does control mean?"" I think this is backwards because usually people ask what a symbol in a dream means, not what symbol corresponds to a topic like control. We're outside a house. Somehow Nate spills a garbage can there, and some of his own garbage. He rips his shorts. I'm annoyed, and start to clean up the garbage. There is an empty cigarette box and a lot of candy wrappers from small colorful gel-fruits. An old woman comes out of the house. She's mad that the garbage is spilled. An old man, her husband, is then there, to my left. Nate and I apologize for the mess, and say we're cleaning it up, but the couple says they want us to leave. I wonder if a fly could get into their house, sneaking in unnoticed, and survive. I think of this as if I am the fly, hiding under the table ."
"1479"	"(01/13/1998)"	"Autofellatio 13 I'm alone in a dark room that seems to be my bedroom at the Whitman house. I have a flyswatter handle inserted into my anus. I probe the handle for stimulation. At one point, I insert the handle so far that I feel it poking out on the inside of my right thigh. I am lying down, and then sit up to turn the light on. I flip the light switch, and a second switch next to it, but both light bulbs must be out. I find another switch lower on the wall and flip it, but that bulb doesn't work either. I have a huge erection: about 2 feet long, and rock hard. I grab it with both hands and bend it slightly towards me and suck it hard. I can detect the pulsating action that an erection has: how the ejaculate emerges in spurts. I can't give myself fellatio as well as others have given me fellatio. My erection is a big, hard, rigid object. I suck it roughly and forcefully, and feel my teeth bump into it. I try to deep-throat my erection. I want to ejaculate. The fellatio is pleasurable, but I don't feel close to ejaculating."
"1480"	"(01/13/1998)"	"Ellen's Light Is On I'm with my friend Ellen Sanders. We're upstairs in a house. It seems she has just moved in, and her room is in the basement. She tells me there is a light on in the basement that shouldn't be on. It is as if she shut it off and now it's back on. I get the feeling that someone or something may be responsible for the light being on. I go downstairs to check this out. I'm a bit afraid, like someone may be hiding there. I turn on all the lights in her room, which seems to be the basement bedroom at the Whitman house. There is a washer and dryer in her room. I walk out into the rest of the basement, which seems like the basement at home in Oak Valley. There is a washer and dryer where the old laundry chute would empty out. I look at that washer and dryer for a bit, and then notice that to my left, standing there, is Ted Matson, my high school classmate. He's standing very still, like he doesn't want me to see him. His head is between two boards in the ceiling. Other people come down the stairs. One of them is a man, and he says to Ted, ""You're gay."" Two people have a huge bag of red, blue, and silver Hershey Kisses. The blue kisses are icy cool, and some have nuts. Others have smaller kisses in them. Others and I eat some. I say to Ellen, as an explanation for the light, that maybe the noise of the washer in her room overpowered the noise of the other dryer out where the laundry chute used to be. My high school classmate Lori Stanoff may be there. She and Ted seem to sit behind me on a washing machine, which is part of a third washer and dryer set, located where the real washer and dryer are in the basement."
"1481"	"(01/14/1998)"	"Not Wanting To Fish My dad has just called me on the phone, wanting to go fishing. I have told him I didn't want to go. I'm trying to call him back because I do want to go. There is a metal minnow bucket with blue crappie minnows in it. I call 8479----F to contact my dad. I put a tackle box in the back of my truck. There is already one tackle box there. The cover to the box is not fastened tightly. The box opens but does not spill much. The number I dial reaches a hospital after four or six digits. I run out to my truck, which is parked in the main lane of Home Avenue, facing southward. Something happens with an income tax number."
"1482"	"(01/14/1998)"	"Alumni Baseball Game I'm at a baseball game for Armstrong High School Alumni basketball players. I arrived late, and the others probably didn't think I'd show up. My friends Nate Nelling and John Kulik and others are there. My mom and I are going to play on one of the teams. My friend Simon Naver is going to pitch for the other team because they seem to not have enough players. The other teams are Armstrong alumni as well. I see Simon pitch. He pitches fast, and I don't know if I can hit pitches like that."
"1483"	"(01/14/1998)"	"The Ill-Prepared Trip I'm with my friends Nate Nelling, Kevin Simpson, Tiny Combs, and Olie Kecker. We're going to the Big Resort Area. We pack our gear. Nate, Tiny, and Olie seem to over pack: they bring sleeping bags that are seven feet long and plan to carry them. The bags seem to be inflated, in the shape of hot dog buns. They are bulky. I tell Kevin I don't know if my sleeping back is waterproof. My bag is the new blue one I got from my mom for Christmas. I stuff all my gear in a pack. Kevin has a big brown suitcase. We put our snow boots into the suitcase. There may be three pairs of boots. I realize I've forgotten the stove, and we discuss what we should do about that. I ask someone where the food pack is. I wonder if the pack is complete, and if the pots and pans are in it. We sit in an area that seems like the pit room at home, and talk about our options. Olie smokes a pink birthday candle."
"1484"	"(01/14/1998)"	"Wine With Walt I'm at my friend Nate Nelling's house in the kitchen. I prepare a plate of food for myself that has green beans, mashed potatoes, and some kind of meat. I plan on taking my meal to the basement, where Nate and others are, it seems. Nate's father Walt is there. He has a plate of red pasta sauce. He offers me a glass of red wine, which I accept. There are three large glass jugs of wine for me to choose from, each holding about five gallons of a different kind of wine. I walk over to the jugs. I'd like a glass of lighter wine, and I pick out the lightest color of the three bottles. I see it is Elliot Hanson wine. It is not yet opened, so I don't open it, but take a different bottle that is already opened. I go over to the table, where I see there are already several glasses of wine poured, so I take one of these instead. Nate's mother comes out in a turquoise colored bathrobe to talk to Walt. She looks weak and frail."
"1485"	"(01/15/1998)"	"Killing A Loon I'm walking with my housemate Stephen Ramos and our classmate Harry Melner towards a swamp where there are a lot of duck hunters hunting. We're on a blacktop road. I see several hunting parties in the swamp wearing blaze orange. Someone in one of the parties yells, ""Sluuu"", and I realize this must be one of my friends Bubba Hacker or Jose Ramos, in a party in the swamp. We stop at the edge of the road and the swamp. There are many ducks flying overhead. There is a triangle in the sky that is lighter in color against they grayish background of clouds. The ducks swarm down. There are a lot of ducks on the water. Someone gives a yell, and the hunters rise up and fire. It seems like an unusual word that one of them yells. Ducks fly everywhere, but remain in the area surprisingly long, flying around. A loon flies directly at me, really low to the ground. I grab its feet and swing it around, smacking its head against the blacktop repeatedly. I think it must have been hit by one of the shots. I see blood on it: it appears to have been hit on the left rear side. I hope that I killed it by myself."
"1486"	"(01/15/1998)"	"Barefoot Tackle Football I'm on an airplane, either in Australia or flying to Australia. Everyone, including me, has his or her own large seat for sleeping and relaxing. I sit at the back of the plane. There are star NBA players on the plane. We're on the ground. There is a question about whether a gas or oil leak would be preferred. I say I'd rather have an oil leak. The oil filter at the rear of the plane needs to be changed before we take off. The filter is a white cylinder about five feet long and three inches in diameter. We seem to be in Sydney. The advisor will meet us at a place. We drive through a roundabout to get there. An ambulance drives past us with its lights and sirens on. I'm riding a bicycle with my friends Bubba Hacker and Stephen Ramos. We're going to a National Guard place that seems to be on the east side of Wilmerton. I ride behind Bubba. He has gas, and it smells. My handlebars are crooked and thin, and seem like they could fall apart. We arrive at the place to play football. A group of men are already playing tackle football, wearing pads and blue jerseys. I'm barefoot, and am wary about playing football with them. My high school classmate Wyatt Belzer, and other physically large men, are there. I don't have any shoes to protect me feet. We walk over to the group. There are many hornets buzzing around me. I don't want to get stung."
"1487"	"(01/15/1998)"	"Seeing Red I walk into a room where my mom is with our family friend Helen Lorenz, one of the Lorenz girls, and an infant baby daughter of the Lorenz family are. My mom is holding the baby. The baby is then four of five years old. She sprays me in the face with something that causes me to see all red or all black. I can't see well at all, and this fades when go away from there."
"1488"	"(01/16/1998)"	"The Little Blimp I'm driving in a mountainous region to go mountain climbing with my friend Kevin Simpson. There is a man in a Subaru wagon that is going west, camping. He has a tent in his car. We go east and turn right onto the second road. A sign says it is five miles to the place where we want to go, which seems to be a place where fossils can be found, and also a small bakery. The sign is for the first right, and I wonder if I'm going the wrong way; if I've gone past the road. I drive fast down a gravel, windy, hilly road. Kevin is in the car behind me following. It's difficult to keep my car on the road because I go so fast. We arrive at a beach area. There are people painting on a wall. There is a preacher-like person there. This seems to be a religious-musical cult. The atmosphere seems to captivate or suck Kevin into it. People try to make us stay: to detain us. We throw fruit and fight, as they do. My former supervisor Ron Fontana is a leader-type man. People throw large tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and berries. I hit Ron with one, and it knocks him back. He throws a green pepper-like fruit at me. I catch it. There is a large sand hill in this place, about 20 feet high, and a water hole that is like a miniature quarry, next to it. There is a key and a board near the water. It may be just above the water, hanging or hovering. I'm frantically trying to escape. I scurry up the sand hill and dive to get the key. I almost lose the key in the water because I have a poor grip on it. There is a very shaky wooden bridge running from the top of the sand hill to a place. This seems like an escape route. Kevin is there, in a blimp. The blimp is about three feet long, and dark in color. There are two teapots connected to the blimp. This is an escape. I grab onto the teapots and hang from the blimp as it rises. Another younger man wants to go too. I tell him to grab onto my foot. We rise, and I notice it seems like we are floating in my kitchen at home in Oak Valley. I think it will be tough to leave, if possible."
"1489"	"(01/19/1998)"	"The Disturbed Flight I'm on a plane that is going to take off for Australia. I sit in a small metal chair, like those in the basement of Carter Church. The plane starts to move. I turn my chair to face the front of the plane, and grab on to what seems to be a handrail at the side of the plane. There are no chairs on my left but the other rows in front of and behind me seem to be normal airplane seats. As the plane begins to move, a person or people in back of the plane begin to say the prayer of travelers that I know from my childhood, substituting the plane for the car in the prayer. Others and I repeat the prayer out loud after a leader recites each line. The plane starts to go fast, and then slows. I wonder if something is wrong; something seems to be wrong. The plane turns around and seems to go up a stairs or a ramp. Three men with joysticks are controlling the plane. I see them as the prayer is being recited: ""...alertness, good judgment, and quick decision..."" I think that these men must be pretty good at controlling the plane. I hope everything goes smoothly. I'm in an airport with a group of people, in Australia. My friend Matt Yams is there. I carry six sheet-like boards of yellow Styrofoam. I float up to the ceiling while holding them, bump my head, and then float back down. It is really fun to float around! I think some people in the group may be annoyed with my antics, so I stop and walk with the group. I talk with Matt. He says he saw a brown trout in a stream that is on our left. There is a young Australian man leading our group through the airport."
"1490"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Gary Stein's White Cadillac I get a ride to Grocery Getto with my neighbors Wilma and Glen Stein. I go into the store quickly to do my business and come out for them to pick me up. I walk down towards the north end of the store but don't see their car. There may be an entrance/exit on the north side of the store. I notice their car down near the gas station, and I walk there. I may be pushing two grocery carts, one inside the other. The Stein's are driving a big white car with a red felt interior. I park the carts and climb in the back seat on the passenger side. The front passenger seat is pushed all the way back. I don't have much legroom. The car is a Cadillac. The interior is very smooth. As we drive home Wilma says that my brother Wally and I will have to pay attention to the dog that is begin let out now, when we drive through the alley. We drive up the alley from the south and talk about driving on the different ends of the alley. Gary says his car bottoms-out when he goes down the hill at the north end. I say that usually ____ (my dad?) takes the flat, south stretch of the alley. We get near their house. We're driving really close to the house, not in the alley. I don't think Gary will be able to pull his car into the space in his driveway between two other cars that are parked there, but he does. I comment on their car: it must ride nice on the highway going 80 miles per hour. Gary talks about how he is glad he got the car because of his involvement in the gulf war. I get out of the car and notice the Wilma has lost a good amount of weight. We walk towards the alley and she tells me that it is the red house that has the dog to let out now, and it is a black lab puppy that weights 80 pounds."
"1491"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Prominent Reddings I'm looking at the front page of a very popular newspaper with a large circulation. The day of the paper is a big day, like New Year's Day or something. There are several large photographs on the front page. One of them, the largest, is a photograph of a crowd. There are many of the Redding extended family in the photograph. I look at it with others. I look, and point out my aunt Lucretia Ralston, and a man who may be her husband Jim Ralston. I see my aunt Joanne Redding, and a half-dozen other faces that I know to be Reddings, but can't put a name to. I see my uncle Adam Redding, and several men next to him that I know are his friends. One or some of these men may be gay, and may be Adam's current or former boyfriend. I think: I know a lot of Reddings that would come to be prominent in this society."
"1492"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Seemingly Harmless Gorillas I'm at home. A small black gorilla comes in through the back door, which is open, and starts to walk around the kitchen. I see this and am frightened. I clap and make loud noises, scaring the gorilla out the door. I look out near the back porch and steps and see there is a huge fat black mother gorilla and four smaller black young baby gorillas. They are loafing, lying, and sitting around, just hanging out. I'm scared because of the potential danger they present."
"1493"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Escaped Monkey There is a zoo with a large enclosed area for the monkeys and chimpanzees. A high concrete wall surrounds the area. The wall slants in places, and there is another wall or ledge next to it, which is not as tall. The monkeys can escape if they can figure out to jump from the ledge onto the lowest part of the slanting wall. A monkey walks along this ledge, close to the larger wall. It seems I am the monkey. I jump up onto the concrete wall and get out of the pen. I am a zookeeper and must catch the monkey that has escaped. I talk to two men, and say that I want big paws/feet so I'm able to hop, like a kangaroo, around and catch the big monkey that has escaped."
"1494"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Christmas Alone I'm at an area that seems to be a gas station. My mom is there, and I talk with her. It is a few weeks before Christmas time. My mom and my sister Ramona are going to Germany, my mom says. I know my dad will be gone as well, so my brother Wally and I will be alone for Christmas."
"1495"	"(01/19/1998)"	"The Thawing Dilemma I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona at home in the kitchen. My mom has a whole turkey that isn't thawed well enough to cook. It's getting to be late in the evening: about 7:00pm. It's going to take about three hours to cook the turkey. I talk about he turkey that I cooked in Salt Lake City: the temperature and the time, estimating how long it will take to cook this turkey. My mom gets out a broiler pan with an electric cord, to cook parts of a chicken as we wait. We don't want to eat the turkey too late."
"1496"	"(01/19/1998)"	"My Trinity I'm in my room at the Whitman House. My sister Ramona says I should pray more. I go to pray in my room. I pray and worship my three higher powers: mother earth, father above, and brothers and sisters that are plants and animals around me. This is my trinity. Ramona knocks on my door and enters my room. I stop praying. She is playing a Bare Naked Ladies CD in her room, which is next door, but seems to be at home. She hands me the CD case and I look at it."
"1497"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Highway To Windton I'm riding in my dad's gray car. My friend Niles Zelling is driving, and my friend Tim Zelling is in the back seat. We're going to Windton. Niles drives fast: over 90 miles per hour. We stop very abruptly at an intersection where we turn onto a highway. Tim and I comment on this stop, which was too jerky. I look at the map and try to figure out how long it will take to get there. There are mileage and time markers on the map between cities. They indicate the trip will be well over three hours. I don't think this is too accurate for us. By looking at the distances between cities that are familiar to me, I estimate it will take about one hour and 45 minutes. The first town we'll go through is named Norton or Horton. On the map, the road becomes a one-way highway to Windton. There is no returning road: it is Highway 15, in Montana."
"1498"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Covering Swimming Pools I'm in an expensive area that seems to be like Salt Lake City. My brother Wally lives here. The place seems to be high in elevation. I ride in a vehicle. It is a bright clear morning. I know Wally is used to driving in slippery and snowy conditions in this area, which often happens. I hear on the radio an advertisement for a buffet restaurant at which the bill for a dinner party often exceeds $1,000. I drive through a neighborhood of expensive houses. I see garbage and recycling on the curbside. I see a woman who has covered her swimming pool with a huge sheet of plastic for the winter. She is shoveling large rocks into the pool to hold the plastic in place. I'm kneeling next to a small swimming pool-like tub, a couple feet long. Another person, who I think is a woman and may be my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, is with me. There is a sheet of plastic that covers the pool. We take small rocks, about an inch in diameter, and place them on the plastic to hold it down. The plastic covers the bottom of the pool, with rocks along the edges, and the plastic curled up around the rocks at the edges. The plastic doesn't fully cover the bottom: the walls and some bottom edges of the pool are exposed."
"1499"	"(01/19/1998)"	"Angelica I sneak into a hockey game by going in the exit doors when a person leaves. I rush in, and am a bit off balance as I look for my friend Elise Rooks, who I know is there. Then Elise catches my attention. I go down to sit by her. She is sitting on the right of her boyfriend. On her right is an empty seat. To the right of the empty seat is a man they are with. The man has his left leg on the open seat, and when I approach whim about sitting in the seat I feel a bit odd because of all the open seats around us, and I'm asking to sit between he and Elise. He responds by moving into the open seat. I shrug this off and sit in this seat he was sitting in. We're watching a basketball game. The players file out onto the court. One of them looks very familiar. He is tall and pudgy with short blond hair. I ask if this is Division II basketball. They reply that it's County or Country League. The game ends. We were waiting for the game to end so we could cross the court and go into a door and up some stairs into the art studio. We get up to cross the court. My friend's father, Franco Ramos, is there. He has big sideburns and glasses, and seems to be a young man, about 30 years old. My friend Stephen Ramos is there too. Elise is dressed in tight black skimpy clothing. There is another woman with long curly golden blond hair, almost yellow. She is shorter than Elise. She is also wearing tight clothes, and has large breasts. I tell Elise I've been hanging out with her friend, and my ex-girlfriend, Annie Thomas this past weekend. We get up to the art department. I see a painting/drawing from my sister Ramona to me. I take it, as well as other construction-like paper, which is between five and seven feet long. I go to walk up more stairs to a place I can paint. I hold the paper over my head, bending the paper in a semicircle against my head. There are many tables on the left side of the stairs as I walk up. It is like a cafe/restaurant. All the tables are full. I recognize my friend Holly Lapson at one of the tables. Franco is also carrying paper up the stairs. He is carrying more, and longer, paper. I get to the top floor, which is light brown, varnished wood, very clean and beautiful. I'm happy and excited to be there. I look around and goof off. I walk by a woman, and she catches me eye. I catch her eye too. She is very cute! Stephen calls me over, saying his easel is a ways down. He warns me sternly, as if he knows better, saying, ""Don't be too confident."" He is talking about art, and my skills, and how the art community will view my artwork. He's warning me that others may not like my art. He implies that people don't like overconfidence. I tell him that I'm not here to produce a masterpiece; that I'm just here to have a good time. I grab a cracker from a plate of crackers that is sitting out, and go to follow Stephen. The cute woman is near me, and we look at each other again. I smile, and she flirtingly says, ""What?"" I wave hello to her as I follow Stephen. We get down near his easel. The woman has followed us to talk to me. I'm near the easel. She walks up to introduce herself. I quickly point to my mouth, indicating that I'm chewing a cracker and can't talk, and indicate for her to give me a minute until I'm done chewing. Stephen has a two-legged table, which is the easel. It is a flat table that stands on two diagonally slanted wooden legs. He sets up the table. My mouth is dry as I chew the cracker. I'm nervous about meeting this beautiful woman who is obviously interested in me. It takes me what seems like forever, several minutes, to chew the cracker. She has clear, clean skin and shorter brown hair. She is strong, but doesn't look overbearing. She is firm and very feminine. She introduces herself as Angelica."
"1500"	"(01/20/1998)"	"The Debt Consolidation Game There is a race. Many men from my old neighborhood are involved. There is a consolidation of debt, so that many familiar men all square up their debts. I know all these men from interactions in and around the Oak Valley community. Among the men are my acquaintances Walt Thompson and Mike Bautsch. Something may happen with dogs, and the race. I'm in the rafters of a dark garage with a person I know who is my age. We hide, and stay very still. A family looks for us. I have my legs hanging down, and think it will be easy for them to see me. They don't see me. I hold still for a bit, and then make a noise, calling out. They find where I am, with some difficulty. They pull a ladder over at my request, and I step onto it to get down. I then move the ladder so the person I'm with can get down. For me to reveal our location was defeating the purpose of our hiding. I say I was just tired of hiding. There is some kind of challenge with steps, and I have not undergone all the steps. I have one step or a portion of a step left. It is getting late, starting to be night. Something happens with men carrying guns. There is a house or houses that need to be secured. The men with guns pose a threat, and they are not checked. Something happens regarding leadership."
"1501"	"(01/21/1998)"	"Camouflage Overalls I'm at a store with others. I look at pants. I seem to have a pair of pants in this particular style. I may be looking at a different color pair of pants. They have some camouflage hunting clothes. I look at a pair of overalls. With a little coaxing from my friend Stephen Ramos, I buy them. The waist is really large: about 40 inches. I buy an arrow too."
"1502"	"(01/21/1998)"	"Passing Daryl Yeller I'm riding a bicycle on what seems to be part of Home Avenue that runs by the Roadside Company, then the Farm Store warehouse by the Dirty River Park. I may be pedaling at times, and not pedaling at other times. I go fast, and come up on my high school classmate Daryl Yeller, who is also on a bicycle. I try to pass him, and do. We're both moving fast. I ride through a coffee shop area. I seem to be following someone. Something happens with my friend Matt Yams. I'm with my childhood physician Mark Zadra, and another doctor. The other doctor talks about an important and popular book on dreams. I say that I have heard of it."
"1503"	"(01/21/1998)"	"Fishing Haven's Hillston Errand I'm working for Fishing Haven. I take a boat to a dock. Arriving there, I go to do the errand: whatever I came for. It is later. I'm in a grocery store. My grade school friend Tim Robbins and high school classmate Greg Solomon are stockers there. Tim's sister Terrie Robbins is a cashier. Tim and Terrie try to find each other, but they always miss each other closely. Terrie is in the bathroom. Tim peeks in to find her. Eventually, they find each other and talk. Someone, maybe I, washes dishes. I'm a stocker and a grocery store. I walk with a cart of toilet paper, with Tim, to where the toilet paper is on display. We cut up the boxes of the toilet paper for the display. I cut some of the packages of toilet paper, through the cardboard, with my cutters. There is a special on toilet paper. I'm back at the dock where I parked. A man tells me where my boat is. I find the boat, which is one of two at the end of the dock. It is a nice boat and motor with a steering wheel and throttle in the rear of the boat. There is a city on shore. The bridge makes me think the town is Hillston. I think that would be a ways away, but I don't know where else I'd see the bridge. I idle the motor. There seems to be some metal beams in the water, near the surface. I am afraid of damaging the prop."
"1504"	"(01/23/1998)"	"Lined Up Houses I'm in an area of newly constructed houses. They are lined up one after another, really close together or connected. I'm in a kitchen area and seem to be able to walk from house to house, seeing all of the kitchens. I see rough wood: none of the cabinets are finished off. A man is there, near or in one of the kitchen areas. He seems to live there, and may have items in the cupboard. The houses overlook a lake. They seem like townhouses, lined up."
"1505"	"(01/23/1998)"	"Lighting A Fire I'm in a group of people on the Carter School playground, east of the jungle-gym equipment in the open area. People get into smaller groups to make fires. It seems almost to be a competition for wood. I pick up some branches for a fire that I'm making with another man. There are two large fallen tree trunks, and we put twigs and branches around these trunks to get our fire started. We light it. In a short while it has gone out and is smoldering. I think some of the wood may be green. Someone lifts up one of the huge tree trunks and we find four or six cardboard boxes, which look like the Henry Weinhards boxes we have at the Whitman House, crushed underneath it. We try to get the fire started again using books of matches. I try to light it, but I run around the felled tree to light the fire after I have lit the matches. The matchbook flares up and goes out before I can light anything. There is a breeze, which makes things a lot more difficult. It is getting dark. A person tries to light some of the cardboard with a match. A group of us crowd around to block out the wind. I use my hands to cup around the match. It works, and we light a piece of cardboard right in its center, and a hold burns through the cardboard."
"1506"	"(01/23/1998)"	"Esther Thurman Gives Birth I'm with a group of people I know from high school. My friend Esther Thurman is there, and some of our mutual friends. We're in a gas station-like place. Someone mentions that Esther is having a baby! I look over: my view of her is partially obscured by an aisle. I see she is on the ground, fully clothed, in obvious discomfort. Someone makes a comment that makes Esther laugh. The laugh causes her to have the baby. It seems that something comes out of her birth canal though she is fully clothed. She makes painful noises, and writhes. She is then holding a baby that is five or six inches long, and very pale. It seems not fully formed or developed: an embryo. She holds it close to her head, bonding with it. I hold it. It isn't slimy like I thought it would be. It's like a doll, but more real. It shows no signs of life. There is a woman working in the gas station. I talk to her about getting something, like ice scrapers, as if we are entitled to them. I go outside with her and she takes two large plastic ice scraper-like objects from a vehicle, and gives them to me. I know she is stealing. I hurry to our vehicle, hoping the others come quickly. The others do come, but a man also comes claiming we have his ice scrapers. The scrapers are on the front passenger seat. We deny that we have them. I grab a hat or scarf and throw it on top of the scrapers near my feet. The man comes and looks, but leaves thinking we don't have them. We drive. Someone in our car is fleeing, maybe from that man."
"1507"	"(01/23/1998)"	"The Guitar-Like Violin I'm sitting in a bar or club with three others. We're listening to a woman play a violin like a guitar. She sings and people laugh. We sit on bar stools. The woman walks, moving out of our view. I don't move to see her, I just sit."
"1508"	"(01/24/1998)"	"Brian Vincent's Toilet I'm with my uncle Brian Vincent at his house. Other family members are there. I go into the bathroom to defecate. People outside the bathroom joke about breaking down the door while I'm defecating. They knock and pound on the door, and I jokingly yell, ""No!"". Someone outside fidgets with the handle on the door: they have the key. The door bursts open and Brian comes in. This surprises me a lot! I stand up from the toilet with my pants down and my hands up, as if he were pointing a gun at me. Part of the toilet is broken, and has fallen on the floor. Brian is mad this has happened, and he thinks I broke the toilet. I put the part back, and the toilet seems to be okay. Something happens with my aunt/and Brian's wife Janice Redding and other family members."
"1509"	"(01/25/1998)"	"The Young Actor There is a famous young actor: a handsome movie star. He is driving a 1950's sports car, driving 180 miles per hour on a highway. He is driving in northeast Australia, but I know this to be northwest Australia, going cross-country. He comes up to an intersection, and then seems to be driving a white camper, which may have a trailer. I'm behind the vehicle in a vehicle of my own, or I am a vehicle, which seems to be gray. The white camper goes off the road, though a ""T"" intersection, and up a hill into trees. The actor dies. I don't think that I'll make the right turn at the ""T"", but I do. I'm on a bicycle. I ride on cinder blocks over a stream. My bicycle falls into the muddy stream. I like the water. I feel spontaneous by enjoying the cool water. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are there, in the water too. My camera is there, and it gets wet in the water."
"1510"	"(01/26/1998)"	"Imaginary Hunting I am carrying two guns. I'm walking down by the baseball park and quarries, south of Main Street in Oak Valley. I am imagining deer hunting. I yell at a man. The man has either reprimanded me for hunting near kids, or reprimanded the kids."
"1511"	"(01/27/1998)"	"Shaving I'm shaving using my Schick razor. I cut myself on the right side of my upper lip and on my right cheek. There are many tiny nicks on my face, as if the blade weren't sharp or I didn't use enough shaving cream. Little pieces of skin stick out making the cut seem more like a bloody rash. I'm outside the field house at Brimson sitting in an elevated place, like a balcony or on a small hill. I prepare to shave, using a lot of shaving cream. I don't have a mirror. I start to shave by making one stroke on my lower neck. I'm at home in Oak Valley. I see myself shaving in the bathroom mirror. The first stroke I made without a mirror isn't bad. My mom calls me and says that a woman has just called for me. The woman's name is something like ""Jake"". Her message is that I don't need to bring Carlos Casteneda's book The Teachings of Don Juan to school tomorrow: she has finished reading it. I can't figure out whom this woman is that was calling. I think it may be my high school classmate Carmen Allure. I'm outside near the Brimson field house overlooking Granger Field. There is a boy and two men playing football there. The ground is partially covered with patches of melting snow, and is really wet. The boy throws the football. One of the men is running for the pass. He dives and gets soaking wet, as if it was his duty to expend the effort to dive since the boy was throwing it. I shave thick hair off my neck and start to shave my upper chest. The hair is thick but stringy, like hair on my head."
"1512"	"(01/27/1998)"	"Salsa and Chip Dinner I'm eating dinner in a group of people with two young women as guests. We eat chips and salsa. It is proper to put the chips on one's plate with a utensil before eating them, one by one. The chips seem to be covered in salsa. I shut off the music from a stereo. My mom and sister Ramona are there."
"1513"	"(01/27/1998)"	"Ramona Doesn't Love Jeff Grace I talk with my sister Ramona and other family members. I am forceful and assertive in my opinions. I say that I don't think Ramona loves her classmate Jeff Grace: I think she has flipped head-over-heels for him, but it's not love. I think Ramona is confused, and I speculate on her and Jeff's relationship. At some point Ramona leaves and goes to call Jeff."
"1514"	"(01/27/1998)"	"Seaplanes I see five or six duck hunters dressed in blaze orange on the side of a gently rolling hill near a small lake. Ducks fly by, sparsely. The hunters shoot one of two of them when they get close enough. I watch. I am in or on the water. I see several seaplanes that fly and land on the water. I am in the water with my cousins the King boys, and others. Planes land close to us. I'm with my sister Heather in the alley that runs between Oak Valley Bank and the pet food store. We're in two or three feet of water. There is a manhole cover near me. People seem to be approaching from the west. I'm on rollerblades near the Hardees at the Uptown Mall. I skate around the building. Heather is with me. We look for my mom, but don't see her right away. Then we're with my mom, and she points out her new car. It is parked nearby, and we go over to it. It is light gray/silver, and slants downward at the front, while the back is higher up. It is a Mazda. My mom opens up the doors for something. I ask about the trunk space. We're going to Hardees, it seems."
"1515"	"(01/28/1998)"	"The Dark Side I'm watching a movie in a theatre with two men. This may be the movie: There is a man. He is awful and terrible and destructive. He makes people witness all hell, all their pain in life, all the torture and suffering, and makes them endure it. I'm in what seems to be my back yard with this evil being and one or two other people. Each person seems to have a turn. One by one, if a person doesn't obey, the evil being will focus pain and suffering on them. It's a beating that comes in waves or pulses, as if numbers are counted out loud in a rhythmic fashion as the pain is administered, ""One!...Two!...Three!..."" It is very painful and fiery. There are cages that seem to be made of fire that break and disintegrate around the person. It is useless to resist. Resisting will only incur more pain and more of the wrath from this being. I get the wrath of the being because of a comment I made about a case or a 30-pack of beer, which was in a brown case. My body is lifted up into the air six to ten feet where I am hit with waves and bolts of pain and torture. There is no choice but to endure this. The man or being is so strong that any resistance or attempt to escape will only lead to greater pain and punishment. There is an intermission in the movie. I go to the bathroom. The bathroom is old and dirty. The floor is stained with dirty water. I defecate, and have dark and runny diarrhea. The toilet is so long that I stretch my legs out and my boot is in the front part of the toilet bowl. A man peeks into the stall as I am finishing and standing up. I see it is my high school classmate Gino Teavor. I say hi to him and we go to the sinks. There are two old metal hand soap containers that are empty and rusted, with their fronts hanging down. I manage to get some soap out of one and start to lather and wash my hands. Gino kneels down next to the sink he is at to drink. I know he is drunk. My old teammate Ron Lind enters and I say hi. Later, our old classmate Eric Spears enters, looking very out of it: drunk or stoned. A young Asian boy enters the bathroom and vomits what appears to be a McDonalds hamburger into a garbage can. I think he may be really drunk, and trying to keep some food down, which doesn't work. He has a bunch of his belongings spread out on the floor. He vomits again, on the floor. What comes up are what seem to be plastic milk jug caps. I step over and between his belongings on the floor and pull a brown bottle off the shelf. I think this is beer, but I then see that it is a kind of iced tea-like beverage from the boy's home country. I walk out of the bathroom into a hallway, which is the north end of the second floor hallway at Carter School. There is a dartboard on the east wall. I take the darts out of the board, and poke one without tail fins into the bulls eye. I'm alone. I stand across the hallway and throw five darts, one by one. I don't throw them too well. My first dart hits the wall. My second dart hits the dartboard, but on the very edge so it gets no points. My third dart hits a bit farther in. I fall on the floor, like I have tripped, and throw a dart while I'm falling, and one while I'm on the floor. I have two disposable orange and white plastic razors that I want to keep for later. There is a small shelf in the hallway with some items on it, including some orange and white razors that belong to others. I want to keep my razors separate from these. I go back to the movie and sit with the two men. I have a tub of buttered popcorn. The movie seems to go: I'm in my back yard and it is dark. My friend Tom Napper is lying on the ground with a compound fracture in his left leg. I think this is just the monster, but then I'm convinced it is real because the whole area is calm and quiet. When the monster (the evil being) was there, the scene was explosive, electrifying, and magnificent. The other person from the movie is there. I run in and grab some rags and two knives to make a splint for Tom. I come back out and realize I've forgotten to call 911. I go and pick up the phone, and find that it is dead: no dial tone. I run outside. It is barely getting light out, and is about 5:00am. A few of the neighbor's lights are flicking on in preparation for work. I yell out loud, and run over to my neighbor Steve Broud's house to use the phone. He has a dark brown moustache when I see him in the kitchen window. He comes to let me in. He is just getting up for work. I tell him it is an emergency, and that I need to use his phone to call 911. He says okay, but he has to record two messages on his phone first. He hits a few buttons on the phone as I wait. He is wearing very colorful short shorts, and his penis partially hangs out of the top of them. His son Ricky Broud is there, wearing a towel. While I'm waiting I watch television. A man comes on the television that looks and seems like an Egyptian King. He talks and gives speeches on a morning show. His face fills the screen as he talks strongly. He is regal and powerful. He makes a comment about people not thinking about the return of another for 600 years, and how naive this thinking is. I then realize that the evil being, the terror, is still strong, and is behind all this. This last episode has been a hoax."
"1516"	"(01/28/1998)"	"The 25 of Hearts I'm in a bagel store with my friends Bubba Hacker, Kevin Simpson, and later, Sam Kingsley. Some of the employees there are wearing orange aprons. People play cards, and are playing Double Deck Feffer. Someone plays the 25 of Hearts. I don't know any of the four or five people that are playing. I'm really interested in the game and would like to play. Diamonds seem to be trump at one point, with both five of diamonds being played, and the seven of diamonds taking the trick. Bubba and Kevin goof off behind the counter, even though they are customers."
"1517"	"(01/28/1998)"	"Kidnapping A Director Wench I'm at a play or a play rehearsal. It seems to be a dress rehearsal. It is similar to the Talent Show at Armstrong High School: there are several skits. There is a skit with Al Bundy eating a big blue fish, that is about five or six feet long. I may be in one skit, but maybe not. I thought I had a role in it with my friend Stephanie Peterson. As the rehearsal goes on I think I may not be doing the skit: there may be another person doing it. I sit on the very edge of the stage with others. At some point I move off the stage, but some to hang on to the carpeted edge of the stage, so I can see and so I'm not blocking anyone's view. The director is a short, fat old woman teacher. She is a bit like my fifth grade teacher Beth Clafton. I'm then sitting by myself on the front of the stage, as the rehearsal is taking place. The director woman asks me condescendingly what I'm doing (on the stage). I tell her I'm sitting there kind of laying on my side so others can see: if I sat in a seat the person behind me wouldn't be able to see. She frowns on me with disdain. I move down to the seats and sit in the front row with my bush hat on. I am angry with the director. The skit that I thought I would be in seems to be a religious sort of enacting Joseph and Mary. There is a skit where one character loses an eyelash at the Prom. The director lashes out at the students, questioning and criticizing their actions; the reason they pluck their eyebrows. People don't respond very much to her criticism. I speak up and talk back to her. I mock her nonchalantly, smarting off to her. Then I stand up, and am enraged! I yell furiously at her, ""Get the fuck out of here!"" I yell that she has an appointment in my office at 4:00, meaning that she is going to have to deal with me. I yell, enraged, that, ""I'm going to beat your ass!"" I'm furious with her, and I say this in front of all the students. I force the woman, half dragging and half pushing her, out the back sacristy door of Carter Church, where it now seems that we are. I force her to start walking west on 1st Street. I see a truck parked on the northwest corner of the intersection. I think in the truck are my classmate Kevin and another short black man from Brimson. I get close to the truck, pushing the woman along, and I see it's my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper driving. I tell him to help me get away. I think people from inside the building will follow, and I'm in a hurry to get away. I want to throw the woman in the bed of the truck and hop in, but Jerry drives away before I can. He stops near the house on the next corner, in the driveway. He is then driving a small black car. He opens the trunk of the car and I toss the woman in. I don't hear much struggle from her: she doesn't put up much of a fight. I get in the back of the car and tell Jerry to drive out near Superhighway 100 to get away. Our classmate Eric Stoner is in the passenger seat. The roads are snowy and icy, and the car slides. I tell Jerry not to get rear-ended because there's a person in the trunk. We drive past Home Avenue going west. I tell Jerry to take a left on Hill Avenue so we don't have to go down the hill at the bottom of 1st Street, because it's slippery. I look back and see that there are no cars behind us from the church, so no one is following. I am relieved."
"1518"	"(01/30/1998)"	"Talking With Rachel Steiner I'm in the Brimson Library near the desk where students check out items that are on reserve. I'm working on a computer there. It seems to not be working correctly. Hal Billings, the soccer coach, starts to set up a computer in the reading room on the first floor on the north side of the library. He sets up a computer monitor. I go to the same room and set up my own computer and get it running. I hear a voice behind me talking to me. I turn and see it's my classmate Rachel Steiner. She talks to me, asking me questions about the night we spent together, and about her. I don't want to talk to her, to see her, or be around her. I want her to leave me alone. She grills me with questions. I don't respond to most of the questions. I don't want to tell her outright that I think she's fat and ugly and she disgusts me. On the computer I seem to be using email and also seeing a weather forecast."
"1519"	"(01/30/1998)"	"The Annoying Woman There is a young woman and a young man in a house. A mutual friend of theirs, a man, has died. The woman and man are in an intimate relationship. She has blond hair, and is very annoying. I may be the man. She wants some of the dead man's belongings. I say no, and hold her back, telling her to let it go. I want to end the relationship, I want the man to end the relationship. The woman is an annoying pest. There is something in an upstairs office or bedroom that she wants."

"1521"	"(01/30/1998)"	"Stopping Traffic I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona in my mom's old maroon station wagon. The new car has broken down, so we're using the old one. We drive down the alley, turn left through our neighbor the Trammell's driveway and go out onto Home Avenue. There are a lot of cars driving. It is morning, and people are going to work. The police stop traffic on Home Avenue in front of Trammell's house and ask questions to the people around. One police officer is a woman, and she waves a blue bandana to stop cars. This stopping of traffic to survey people is illegal, and someone mentions the possibility of a civilian suing the police. I'm annoyed because of the traffic delay."
"1522"	"(02/01/1998)"	"Basketball Awards I'm at my dad's old house in the living room. There is a basketball awards ceremony taking place for my Armstrong High School team. One player is awarded a big award, a certificate. He is either my teammate Larry Rollie or Shawn Salzburg. The award is a certificate redeemable for $60 cash. Something has happened, and at this ceremony the award has been divided into three awards: three $20 certificates. I am called, as well as another player, to receive these. Basketball players and their parents are there."
"1523"	"(02/01/1998)"	"B.O. Jung I'm at a funeral home. I'm with a group of people. We get a tour. We see the embalming room. My friend Niles Zelling is in the group. We are led to a room with many books. Our classmate Pauline Davies is there. I look at a book by _ _ Jung, whose first initials may be B. O.. I think this is another author named Jung, or the same one using B instead of R as the first initial. I go up and down stairs and end up back in the entrance of the funeral home."
"1524"	"(02/01/1998)"	"My Ballerina I'm on a street that I know to be Gerald Avenue in Woodland, though in waking it is in a different vicinity, southwest of Brimson. I skip down the sidewalk going north. I take long strides, going fast, and seeing how much of the road I can leap over while I skip. I leap, and soar over the entire street. I cross Old Avenue, and am on Fish Street, coming from Brimson. I leap into the air, jumping ten feet or more, floating lightly, spinning, and twisting before landing softly and leaping again. On the northeast corner of Old Avenue and Fish Street is an old brick house. While I leap I land on the lawn of this house, on a small but steep hill that is in the front yard. A young girl rides by on a bicycle. She says something to me indicating that she's mad that I jumped on her grass; she lives in the brick house. She rides her bicycle around the back of the house to tell someone what I'm doing. I feel somewhat guilty, but not really, and I keep on leaping and twisting lightly as I make my way northward down Fish Street. I hope the people aren't so picky as to reprimand me for leaping on their grass."
"1525"	"(02/01/1998)"	"Ordering Pizza I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and our friend Bill Hanson. We enter a large study room filled with college students. Our friend Niles Zelling and many others are there. One man, who I recognize as a stereotypical loud-mouthed jock, yells out to the people in the room, asking if anyone wants to order pizza. There is an enthusiastic response by many of the students. I do not respond."
"1526"	"(02/01/1998)"	"The Easy Reward I'm in Australia with several people. We're in a shopping mall trying to get back to a place to leave. We move through a department store, getting into an elevator to go down. The door of the elevator closes. The elevator descends, and then ascends. There is a dinging bell as we reach the second floor again. We realize no one had pushed the button for our destination. Someone quickly pushes a button and the elevator starts to descend without stopping at the second floor. The elevator stops at the first floor and we get out. We walk through the electronics department. People are looking for an ugly woman who has something concealed in her hand or coat. The woman is in the store, very near or among us. Everyone starts looking for her, including us. There is an $80 reward for her capture. I see a man standing behind a rack of clothes. I start to walk towards him. He is the person that is sought after. Immediately another man comes and handcuffs him. I'm given the reward money, though others were involved in his capture. I give $39 or $35 to one man, $20 to another, and $15 each to my friend Niles Zelling and a woman, for their roles in the capture of this man. I say I didn't and couldn't have done it alone. We leave. We're outside the building. Someone says something about another search with the possibility of a reward. I don't want to participate: I'd rather leave. There are two large black dogs that come very close to me, snarling and barking. They are on leashes, which are attached to longer red leashes. The dogs nearly bite me, but are stopped short by these longer red leashes."
"1527"	"(02/01/1998)"	"Lucid Basketball Warm-up I'm on a basketball court with a team warming up for a game. I take long, strong strides. I run around the court by myself. The other team is warming up as well. I take off my outermost layer of clothing, and still have on a warm up top and a jersey. I feel smooth, strong, and confident: like I am a good player and I know it. At some point, I realize that I'm dreaming."
"1528"	"(02/01/1998)"	"Cheap Liquor I'm in a liquor store. I buy a case of beer, a couple bottles of hard cider, and a single bottle of Leinenkugel's beer. I carry this to College Liquor to pay for it. I hope that it's okay that I got the alcohol at one place and pay for it at another place: I feel uneasy doing this because I think the stores don't like or wouldn't allow this. I get all my items for less than $3.00! I go out to the car with my friend Bubba Hacker. There are some black straps holding the trunk closed. Bubba tells me to get in, when I try to tighten them. I get in the back seat and he tightens the straps form the inside by pulling on a strap inside the car."
"1529"	"(02/01/1998)"	"Sandal Scandal I'm in a gathering with what seems to be a family. There are two cute young women in the family. One of them says something to me about having her sandals. I'm surprised. I have a pair of sandals that I found somewhere, but I didn't think they belonged to her or anyone. I make a comment that asserts that she must be mistaken because I don't have her sandals, though now I know that I do have them. She backs off thinking she must be mistaken. I am called to get my plate of food."
"1530"	"(02/02/1998)"	"Late Night Barbeque I'm at my dad's old house with my brother Wally, friends Nat Miller, Sarah Reed, and another woman. It is nearly 2:00am. I'm watching television on the couch. I talk to Wally, who is on the porch. We exchange some odd glances and some short comments. We may have a cookout tonight. I talk to him about what we'll need for it. The television show ends at 2:00am. Nat and I get up from the couch. Sarah has left but may return later. The other woman may ask if we need to go to the store. I say Nat and I will go and get charcoal and food for a barbeque. Wally says that it's going to be difficult staying up until 3:00am for this barbeque and then waking up at 6:00am. I say I won't be getting up at six, but sleeping until 1:00pm! The others will have to get up. I walk outside. From the window, Nat says that it looks like a tornado/funnel cloud. I look westward. The sky is light colored, yellow and stormy. I think it would be a good idea to light the barbeque before we go to the store so it's ready when we return. I look for the grill. I find short small round grill next to the base of the tree near the shop. I pick up the square grill grate that is on the ground. I hear a voice in the shop, but notice no light is on there. I walk over to the shop door with the thick iron grate as a weapon. I kick the door, making a loud thud sound to scare the intruders. My dad and the other woman emerge. They're going to light the grill. I thought they were intruders."
"1531"	"(02/02/1998)"	"Sex With Wally I'm in Grandpa and Grandma Redding's house. My brother Wally gives me fellatio and strokes my erection. My erection goes through a portion of the back of the orange recliner that we have at the Whitman House. As he strokes it, I ejaculate bit by bit, in spurts. My erection extends out from my body, more than upward. I ejaculate onto Wally. My cousins Anna Strange, and either Bertha Strange or Archie Weber are there. They may laugh at this. It is later that night. I wake up at 4:30am. I want to masturbate, and to give Wally fellatio, to make him ejaculate. He is sleeping on a nearby couch. I am thirsty. I go to the kitchen to get water. All the lights are off. I wonder if the other relatives have arrived since I've been sleeping. I turn a light on. It is not a kitchen light, but a living room light. People in the living room stir and moan. I see that several people are on the couches: Anna, Bertha, my uncle Dannie Redding, and others. I try to shut the light off, fiddling with different switches. Anna gets mad at me. I say I hit the wrong switch. I'm glad I know that others are around. Now I know I can't masturbate or find Wally to make him ejaculate, because people are there. It's a good thing I know."
"1532"	"(02/02/1998)"	"Tracy Chapman's Budweiser I'm at a concert with my housemate Stephen Ramos and my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. There seems to be three bands playing. We sit on a small stage-like structure. There are black lights flashing, which bring out the color, especially red, around us. I move out of my seat. I seem to have a heavy load attached to my upper body, like a pack strapped on. It weighs a good amount, and I have to pay attention to my balance. I go back to sit down. My coworker Katie James is sitting a little ways away, off the stage-like structure. As the song ends, Stephen recognizes it as a remake of a Led Zeppelin song. It is a remake called Led ____ (I forget), in which the second word is shorter than Zeppelin. The song we hear is a remake of Stairway To Heaven. The band ends, and I go to the bathroom with others, including Annie. I feel exhausted, though I know I slept 13 hours last night. I tell Annie that I feel like crap: exhausted. She asks just how tired I am. I say I need at least a nap of four hours. I'm in the bathroom. I splash water on my face to refresh me. Annie enters the bathroom and tells me her mother is going to cook dinner, and implies I am invited. I'm a bit happy because I won't have to go to this dinner, using the excuse that the long nap I'm going to take will overlap the dinner hour. Back at the show, Tracy Chapman is playing next. I sit at the kitchen table at my home in Oak Valley with Stephen and our friend Kevin Simpson. They have or are getting submarine sandwiches, which look like Subway Spicy Italian sandwiches on white bread. I cut out holes in the layers of pepperoni and place pickles there. Stephen does not want tomatoes, but he does want lettuce, which I don't put on at first. My classmate Hanna Landers approaches me as I sit and says, ""I might consider paying."" She seems to be in charge of admission costs and implies that I should pay her here and now. I am guilty of not paying. I get out my wallet. I ask her how much. It is normally $5, and she tells me $8. I ask her plainly and accusingly if she raised the price. She replies flatly that she did. My friend Melanie McDyss is there, and seems to have some sympathy for me. She may toss me a few caps, a portion of a red roll of caps that are used for a cap gun. They fall next to me on the floor. Stephen says something about Tracy Chapman drinking Budweiser. I think: Why would Tracy Chapman drink Budweiser? I imagine she'd boycott it or something, but not drink it! So I bet Stephen $20 that she doesn't drink Budweiser. He and I shake hands. Tracy Chapman then comes over to the table, walking behind me, and sits on my left. As she does this, I ask her if she drinks Budweiser. She says yes, and sets a bottle of Budweiser on the table in front of her as she sits down. Stephen and Kevin laugh. I think Stephen must have seen her drinking this before the bed, so I don't intend to pay him, and I don't think he'll be too concerned about enforcing the bet he cheated somewhat by tricking me. Tracy Chapman, who seems like Tracy Bonham, is then white, and I think she's cute. She and Melanie are both sympathetic that I had to pay, and they both give me a portion of a roll of caps, which is a symbol that I've paid. Hanna knows I didn't pay because I didn't have my hand stamped. Others who haven't paid pay now. I get a beer. Tracy says I should ask her next time and she would get me a beer, and implies everything will go smooth with paying to get in. I get up, acting obnoxiously, and pretend that I'm giving Hanna my Budweiser beer. She grabs it and we get into a tug-of-war. I win, as she pulls the cap of the bottle. To spite her, I slam the beer, gulp by gulp, though it takes me a while to drink the whole beer. I show my contempt for her."
"1533"	"(02/02/1998)"	"Unacceptable Sex I'm at a house where my friend Stephen Ramos and I live, maybe with others. We're having a party. I'm upstairs in a bedroom with my old housemate Seth Karns. I start to give fellatio. I put his penis deep into my throat. His penis stays fairly limp, and he moans a lot. I move my finger down towards his anus, which is wet, but he doesn't want me to stimulate his anus, and declines this. I ask him to give me anal sex. He is going to, and I tell him to use a condom. My backpack, which has condoms in it, is on the door handle. I tell him to use a lot of lotion. He is about to penetrate me when the door opens. My high school classmate Elise Rooks walks in, as if the room we're in is a bathroom. I grab a towel as she enters, wrap it around me, and walk out of the room to the bathroom. Elise finds Seth naked with an erection, wearing a condom, and she knows what was happening. At that instant everyone seems to know. I go to the shower. A man is there with a baby in his arms. He pushes a door closed on my while I'm outside the bathroom on a small deck-like area. He tries to lock me out of the bathroom. He is mad at me for my homosexual acts. I push the door open and go inside. Downstairs, others are disgusted and angry with me for my homosexual acts. There is an upheaval of the family here, at what seems to be a family reunion. Many people react strongly, and are homophobic. One or two people say my behavior is okay. I tell everyone I called the police and everyone, including family, has ten minutes to leave. I'm out in front of the house. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there in a group. She tells me she found number two, implying this is her number two male partner. She does this to taunt me. She and her group, which includes my high school friend Holly Ball, start to walk away. They taunt me. I pick up bottles that are lying around and throw them into our yard to consolidate the mess. Two houses down, the yard is filled with heaps of empty plastic Pepsi bottles, and others bottles. There are two young black kids in this yard. One is between eight and ten years old, the other between 12 and 13. I tell them if the mess in their yard is from our party than I'll clean it up. They say it is from our party. I'm prepared to take care of it. Their reply is very shaky, and I question them again. They admit the mess is from a party held at their house by their father. I want to run over to the group leaving and tell Annie and those taunting me to eat a big fat dick: to fuck off! Then they walk beside me. I tell Annie I don't want to talk to her anymore. Holly and Annie walk and pester me. My academic advisor Mary Monroe is there. Our house is bluish-gray in color. In and around the house are many skulls and bloody, fleshy body parts and limbs of small dinosaurs scattered about. There are several old men in the house to assess the house. One of the men is a dinosaur specialist. I ask him how the place looks. He says it is littered with skulls. My friends Beth Mock, Brittany Johnson, and others that I don't want to see are there. I pick up glasses on and around the floor."
"1534"	"(02/02/1998)"	"Globe Lights Cigarettes I'm at a bank with my mom, my sister Ramona, and my friend Nat Miller. We stop here on our way out of Wilmerton. We're driving to Metropolis. I need to do some business at the bank, including getting traveler's checks. Nat gives me a $5 bill to get him a container of Globe Lights cigarettes. I hesitate briefly, wondering if he should smoke in the car with my mom and Ramona as we drive, and wondering why he doesn't get them himself. We seem to be driving a red car, like my friend Nate Nelling's family's car. I go in and wait in the bank line for a bit, and then decide to get the cigarettes first because the bank lines are long. The tag under the plastic container of Globe Lights says $3.88. I ask the man behind the counter for a bottle of Globe Lights. I feel a bit funny because I've never purchased cigarettes. Bat told me to keep some, but not all, of the change. The man gives me three small buckets with ice in them, three plastic cups, and a larger bucket. He says something to me along the lines of, ""Think before you drink and drive."" I don't hear him clearly, and I jokingly ask him if he said ""Mix your drinks before you drink them."" The total bill is $1.18. I give the man a $10 bill. He gives me over $15 in change, as if I've paid with a $20 bill. I'm a bit confused, because I'm sure I paid with a $10 bill, but I'm not going to say anything. I go back to the bank teller line. I have a white plastic bag with all the drink buckets and glasses in it. I get up to a teller after some confusion with others in line. My bag is now a cardboard box, about 12""x4""x8"" in dimension. I ask the male teller if I can get $200 in travelers' checks. He doesn't know about these, and has to ask someone else. He returns and tells me to go around the corner and ask Dee ___ (I forget). I go around the corner and ask a woman. She shows me to a door that enters into a room where a woman is sitting at a table. The woman at the table is Dee, and she asks if she can assist me in getting travelers checks. I say yes, and ask her how long it takes to order them. She replies that it takes two working days. I think about this: When I'd be able to get the checks, when I'm going back to Woodland, and how I'd coordinate it. It seems rushed, in a time crunch."
"1535"	"(02/04/1998)"	"Safe In Rome I seem to be at home in Oak Valley. Many people are expecting to go to war with shotguns, against aliens. The people seem to be looking forward to this. There is a large farm/garden area around the house. The family is at home. I see a large shadow of a low-flying plane on the ground. Looking up, I see many planes flying overhead. The planes drop bombs all around. I see the bombs falling and I flee, running back into the field. The place where the bombing occurs seems to be Yardville. The planes circle down and land very quickly. This is an invasion of the country by Nazi-like soldiers with small green fighter planes. I run, and my mom runs, following me. I want to escape the invaders. We run into the cornfield, going west to escape. We run away from roads, into the country, around lakes and ponds, and through some ponds. We jump in one of the ponds to cool off. Kids are playing near some of the water holes. It is getting dark. I am then with my brother Wally, not my mom. We come to a huge rock cliff that is covered with plastic, secured with tape. We walk around the edge of this rock that is at least a few hundred feet in circumference and a hundred feet tall. I find a spot and we slip underneath the tarp where there is an opening. We walk here in an open space, and come to a door. Looking through a small rectangular window in the door I see a large concrete bridge and know there is a town there. The town seems to have a ""saving"" quality to it: it will save or help us in some way. We walk out through the door, going from the rock and water country to the town, and into a city. We walk down stairs. The city we are in is Rome. We cross a rope bridge while two men walk the opposite way across it. We may not be fully clothed. The two men seem to be wearing towels. I'm in a building that seems to be like Brimson, and I realize I'm safe. I see my friend Nat Miller and my uncle Rusty Redding. I talk with Nat about the invasion. He tells me it was either Holland or Germany that invaded. His study abroad program ended early because of the invasion. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. He talks about his experience of the invasion. He was in bed masturbating when the invaders landed, and before he knew it they had captured him. They tell me that people have been looking for me since the invasion: I've been missing. I quietly take pride in my escaping the invasion. I am safe in Rome. I think of talking to some psychology professors about the invasion, since I'm here."
"1536"	"(02/09/1998)"	"Defending Grace Redding I'm with my cousin Grace Redding and another person, who may be one of her siblings. We're driving near what seems to be Wilmerton University. I see a wallaby and some kangaroos, and excitedly point them out. It is dusk. I see and point out other animals, including a gorilla. I have a drawing of a gorilla in my stack of drawings, which I flip through. I'm in an elevator with Grace. We seem to be on a floor where there is a bad man who wants to capture Grace. He thinks that I'm on his side: that since I'm with Grace that I've captured her. He asks me if I want to bring her back and take care of her, or if he should. I tell him I will, knowing that he has no idea I've duped him and have no intentions of capturing her. I try to catch the man off guard and kick him, to injure, kill, or disable him. My kick is short, and I try to change it into a smoother, more controlled motion so he'll think I'm just joking. I then attack him with all my strength. He has a can of some spray that does serious damage to a person, and a gun. I flight with him, avoiding the spray and kicking the gun out of his hand. Then I'm in an elevator as it closes. This is a terrible position to be in because Grace is outside with the man. He knows I'm in the elevator, and can corner me when I try to get out. There is a big tent in a white bag in the elevator. I dump it out and grab a long aluminum tent pole, which is bent, to use as a weapon. I emerge from the elevator on the same floor as the man, and he attacks. I fight him off. I'm fighting my classmate at Brimson, Arnold, and another short, thin blond haired man. I smash their heads together and smash them on the marble floor of what seems to be a church."
"1537"	"(02/11/1998)"	"Picking Up Australian Coins I'm in a room with my friend Jack Thigpen and a woman. She talks to Jack harshly, criticizing and reprimanding him. She turns to me and says something. I reply harshly, ""Get the fuck out!"" She leaves the house. I turn to Jack and ask if he is seeing this woman. He says yes and makes a comment about the first fight in a relationship. It seems he is not taking it too seriously. I am appalled by this woman's bitchy attitude, and am ready to kick her out. Jack perseveres: he'll continue to see her despite this. I need to buy some groceries. I want to go to a big store. Jack needs to pick up a few things as well. I think we should go together, but I think we want to go to different stores: I think he'll want to go to a smaller, convenient store. I'm in a convenience store with Jack and others. We may buy a few things. I don't know if I should buy there. I'm outside the store on a sidewalk with dirt around. I see many coins, and start picking them up off the ground. They are Australian coins. I find a huge handful, and there are many more. They are covered in dirt. I pick them out, getting soil under my fingernails and on my hand. Some of the coins are large $.50 coins, and some are the small, octagonal $2 coins. I don't want anyone to see me picking up all these coins. I pick a handful up and may come back for more."

Wally goes to grab some tennis rackets form inside. Then it seems I'm playing with my schoolmate Reed Maxwell. A fat man and his son come up to me before we start playing, before my partner has returned. They tell me they have an appointment to play at 6:30, to take up seven or ten courts for a big game. It's 6:15 now. I tell them I'm sorry, and I try to accommodate them at first so they can play and we can keep the court. They become rude and belligerent. I tell them to give me some respect. The son is big and fat and strong. He starts pushing me. I turn away, and I think and say, ""What are you doing?!?"" This guy is a big, dumb, ignorant, foolish idiot. My uncle Rusty Redding is in the background watching this guy push me. I don't push back because I think it is inane and uncivilized."

My statement doesn't have my itemized checks and deposits: they are all photocopied onto the back of the statement. The name on the statement is Eugene B Filse. I want an itemized statement, but my name doesn't seem to be on it, and everything is fuzzy. The woman says that I wrote too many checks in too little time, and that they are sloppy. My mom is there. I am angry! I ask the woman angrily if it is because I wrote too many checks in too little time, or if it because they are sloppy. I ask this knowing that the question is dumb, and that it really doesn't matter. The woman gets defensive and bluntly asks what she can do for me. I say loudly and sternly, ""I want some good answers!"" I sand up abruptly with contempt for her. I crumble up the paper with contempt. My mom is upset because of my behavior. She follows me out of the bank. I see my high school classmate Todd Warden as I walk away, and I think this is the first time I've seen him since his father died."

My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is leaving tomorrow to go to the airport. She may be going to Germany. Grandpa and grandma Redding, my aunt Joanne Redding, my neighbor Alvin Broud, and others arrive.

I ask if he also had sex for the first time on December 2nd. He says December 2nd wasn't the first time for him, but he did have sex that night, and the woman is now pregnant because of it. He talks nonsense. I can tell he is a typical white-trash man from Wilmerton. His logic is absent, while ignorance and stupidity are rampant."

One of these is a kayak that has a hole to sit in and a hole in front of that. I'm wearing black flippers on my feet. I sit in the kayak and it sinks. I swim with the kayak. We all gather in the water, holding onto a big steel pillar. This is our last portage, and then we're home free on Eagle Lake. We're going to have a difficult portage with three canoes. A person may have to carry a canoe and a pack. Kevin says he's going to take the 17-foot lightweight canoe, so I'm taking the kayak, but then I'm taking the Grumman. I put on several life jackets to pad my shoulders on the portage. I take the Grumman and go. I feel no pain. I walk fast, and a long ways without stopping. The Grumman feels light. I talk to the other people portaging, encouraging them and checking to see that they're okay. I'm strong, and I move deftly. I'm on the trail. I'm then on stairs, which I scamper down like I have no load at all. I go through doors, carrying the canoe is no problem."
"1549"	"(02/16/1998)"	"Armstrong Basketball Runts I walk into the Armstrong High School gymnasium for a basketball game. I'm with another man. He goes and sits in the bleachers. I see my friend's father, Dick Zates. The national anthem is playing. I turn and stand while it plays. The game is being played, and the teams are terrible. One of the teams is particularly bad, with small and tiny players! Clearly one team will win. The teams seem to be red and blue. There is a huge tall large man on one team who literally kicks around the person that is guarding him. The playing guarding him is one or two feet tall: a helpless little ball. I realize that Armstrong is the team that is terrible, that is small. I look over at the bench and see four or five very young, short, small boys. I know coach Jackson Shooter is giving everyone a chance to play, but this is ridiculous! These players are pre-pubescent runts!"
"1550"	"(02/17/1998)"	"Tim's Fast Driving I'm in a car with my friend Tim Zelling. The steering wheel is on the right side of the car. The car is a stick shift. I'm sitting on the left side. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is in the back seat of the car. I steer. Tim accelerates. I brake. We are going really fast through a quiet neighborhood. We arrive at a car dealership. I may be on a moped. The love between Annie and I is still there. We make out in the sports car as Tim drives. At the dealership we stop doing this. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. We are having a taco dinner at the Hacker's house. Bubba's mother Emily is on the couch resting. We wash up in the bathroom."
"1551"	"(02/17/1998)"	"Ant Inundation My friend Stephen Ramos has defecated in a toilet and not flushed the toilet. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas going to take a shower. I hear her thoughts as if she is speaking them. Something happens with her and keys. Some people are having dinner, which may be at my dad's house. I enter my room. There are small black pellets of ant feces covering my bed. There are ants everywhere! They are on my bed and on my bookshelf, which is the old wooden shelf grandpa Redding made for me. I'm disgusted and frightened by this. I'm going to go out and buy a lot of ant traps. I wrap my hand in some cloth to try to kill some of the insects by smashing them. There is a queen ant and a nest-like area. Upon awakening, I realize that the ants in my dream look like spiders look, but I know them as ants."
"1552"	"(02/18/1998)"	"Snow Sex I'm a Raden University student. I cook dinner with others, using frozen food. I'm outside my home in the snow. It is night. I am in front of my neighbors the Trammell's house. I'm with a small girl. I rape her from behind, maybe anally. She jerks and wriggles back and forth in pain, but it also seems strangely pleasurable. Then she is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I stop her movement by holding her and penetrate her vagina. We have consensual sex. She strokes my erect penis and gives me fellatio. I spurt pre-ejaculatory fluid in bursts. A snowplow is coming. It is in the distance down Home Avenue near Main Street: we see its lights. Annie covers her naked body with a blanket. We go inside the house. My mom is there. I want to finish having sex. My mom is an ominous presence."
"1553"	"(02/18/1998)"	"A Mountain Falls People are blasting a tunnel though a very deep portion of a rock mountain. They are very deep down, blasting to the other side. They are close to the other side, and are about to break through. There seems to be some question if the tunnel will line up correctly on the other side. The rock mountain crumbles a little bit, and is about to collapse. People flee out from under the mountain, out of the tunnel. I may be there, and I escape. There is a man with a radio talking to others about what is happening. Most people escape unscathed. The mountain collapses under its immense weight, crushing down and falling a short distance to the rock below. One man may get caught under a big chunk of rock, but he seems to be okay."
"1554"	"(02/18/1998)"	"Barfing Baked Beans I'm in a party-like atmosphere where people are performing skits. I try to mingle with the popular and famous people who are there. One of the famous people is the actor from the television sitcom Friends: the character of Joey. I manage to get a few words in because I smile and laugh. I am always smiling. I vomit up baked beans. There are people singing. I try to sing, echoing, shadowing, or singing along with a group of men. I don't sing too well. My classmate Pauline Davies is there. She is up higher, maybe on a table. She dances and sings. She has huge, well-defined, quadriceps muscles. [Note: I ate baked beans for dinner last night]"
"1555"	"(02/18/1998)"	"Clandestine Jasmine A man has captured a girl, and maybe others. I fire shots at a vehicle with a handgun that they are driving in. People are all around. I yell for someone to call 911! There is a young girl there. Being captured has hurt her, but she will be okay. Her name is Jasmine. She has dark skin and eyes. She is very innocent looking. Lots of other people are there to help. We sit the girl down on my backpack, as a cushion, and instruct her not to move so she'll be safe while we look for the man. He legs seem to have been sliced off and reattached, like in the movie Gattaca. The girl tries to move, and I tell her not to move! I know the man drives a light blue car, like a hatchback. He may have a hostage and is nearby. I yell this information out to the other people there. Jasmine hears me and yells back, ""Oh, thanks Kenneth!"", very sarcastically, implying that she doesn't want the man to be captured, that the capture of this man somehow has negative consequences for her, or that his escape is in her best interest, as if they are partners. I have my old classmate Jeff Grace stay with Jasmine."
"1556"	"(02/20/1998)"	"Delivering Papers Again I'm delivering papers for my morning paper route. I ride a bicycle with training wheels. The roads are slippery: icy. It's winter. I don't have a list of the houses so I try to remember which houses I delivered to on a regular basis. I deliver to several houses on Bauer, Holy, and Delivery Avenues in Oak Valley. I ride on Next Avenue, going southward on the east sidewalk. I ride into a fence that is between Dinks' old house and the white house to the north of it. I hit the fence and then restart and ride on. Mr. Dinks is out in his yard and sarcastically comments to me, ""Didn't see the fence, huh?"" I reply very bluntly, ""No, I didn't."" I really didn't see the fence."
"1557"	"(02/20/1998)"	"Winter Driving I'm with a man my age whom I know and seem to be friends with. We're in my truck. He is about to drive, and I think he has the truck in the wrong gear, either reverse or first gear. I grab the stick shifter, stopping him from driving. I am driving. I see that he had the truck in the correct gear. I drive with my sisters Heather and Ramona, and our acquaintances Julia and Erica Cobden, to Armstrong High School. It's winter. The roads are icy. The snowplow just came through and piled high banks of snow along the roadsides. One plow has plowed a car in, covering it."
"1558"	"(02/20/1998)"	"Sloppy Basketball I'm at an Armstrong High School basketball game. The men's team is playing the women's team. It's a sloppy game. The men easily overpower the women, but they try to show off, and they make many errors, turnovers. I sit behind the men's bench on a big track and field mattress. I shake hands with my old teammate Larry Rollie, who is in uniform on the bench. I think coach Shooter must be letting the others play, not putting Larry in yet because then it will be a blowout. I wonder where my old teammate Shawn Salzburg is, wonder if he's on the court. I laugh out loud and comment openly about the play of the teams. I then realize that my laughs and comments may not be appreciated because I'm an alumnus, and am frowned upon. There is a small crowd gathered for the game. Some of my aunts are among the people there. The game ends at the end of the first quarter because it is sloppy. The men's team is crushing the women's team, and it is pointless to play because it's such poor play."
"1559"	"(02/20/1998)"	"The Invisible Terror I'm in a bar with a friend and some men who work there. I flip a coin to try to get a free drink. On my first toss the coin lands on its side on my jeans, so I toss it again. One of the men says something about the correct direction to flip a coin. I get a heads on the second toss, which is what I had called. The coin looks like a penny, but has an entire body on it, instead of just a head. I wonder what kind of beer to get. The two men who work there aren't much help in figuring this out. They don't seem to want to give me a beer. One of them makes a comment about Busch Light and a case day. I have a shovel, which is like a spade with a flatter scoop. I point it at people, as if it were a gun, and jerk it back towards me, as if I had just fired it and it had recoil. There are some women in the bar. Several of them leave, and then come back in carrying crates of full milk jugs. There is a princess-like girl that is 14 years old. She has many suitors who come to have sex with her. There is a woman who watches over the princess, like a maid or attendant. This woman is cute. I'm standing outside the window of the princess' room. The maid is in the room, but the princess is not. There is a man in the room too. The maid says that it's okay for the princess to have suitors during the day, but not at night. I climb in through the window. The mother of the princess arrives in a car outside. I crouch down, to avoid being seen. A young man in a delivery truck pulls up right next to the room. He takes a pair of jeans and tosses them into the room at the maid. He is courting the maid and she snubs him: she doesn't like him. The delivery boy walks into the room. I approach him, somewhat out of protection for the maid, but I don't necessarily think she wants me to do this. The boy is short and skinny. I tower over him. I ask him to teach me to walk sideways on some narrow, beamlike structure outside. We go to the edge of the room, outside. There is an army man walking up a ramp to the room. He is fairly dangerous and belligerent. The boy pushes me out onto the beam and pulls the pen that I always carry out of my back pocket. The pan is what will allow me to walk or stand slanted or sideways. I regain my balance and push the delivery boy into the arms of the army man, who is behind him. This seems to be doom or death for the boy. I run! I go away from the army man. I run to my home, go inside, and lock all the doors. I go upstairs, and then go downstairs. The front door is then wide open and the piano is playing by itself, as if an invisible person is playing it. I don't see a person, but someone must be there. I lash out, but touch nothing. I run outside with fear, wondering who or what is there. I see a lamb, a whale, and other objects that appear before my eyes. I get near the back door, where there is a sign. It has writing on it, something like, ""What is chasing me?"", or ""What am I chasing?"" I stop and think: what am I scared of? What part of me am I running from?"
"1560"	"(02/22/1998)"	"My Dad Loves Me I'm eating a meal at my dad's little house. Others are there. We eat a lot, including cake, cheese curls, and sherbet made of three flavors. We're driving in a car: my dad, I, my sister Heather, Heather's friend Belinda Bark, and I think my sister Ramona. We drive to drop Belinda off, turning into an alley that is near Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. I'm home now, but will go back to Melbourne next Saturday, in ten days. I talk about leaving to go back and my dad seems sad. We get out of the car. As we approach home, my mom yells out the door that there is a phone call for Heather. I go and hug Heather goodbye. My dad is walking away in a dejected manner. I catch up with and stop him. We hug each other and cry. I tell him I love him. He says he loves me more than I love him. I want to get my phone number in Melbourne for him. I try to write it on my pocket notepad, but I have difficulty. The numbers I write are messy. I scribble them out. I get the number confused and write the wrong numbers, then scribble them out. I try hard to get correct numbers down clearly, but I can't. I lean the pad up against a wooden post and write the number 6884 9224, which is my number."
"1561"	"(02/23/1998)"	"The Five Suns I'm talking with my dad on the phone. He is talking about different authors who write about dreams, asking me if I've heard of them. I've heard vaguely of one or two; others I'm not familiar with. They are Saft, Ditzen or Dizy, and others. My dad is at a bookstore while we talk. He tells me there will be a reading of these authors at a bookstore on June 5th, 1998. At first I thought he had bought me some books, then he tells me they'll be reading. I'm in the basement pit room at home in Oak Valley talking on the phone. I have several eggs. One egg is cracked, with a blob of egg white hanging out. I tell my dad I'd like to go to the reading but I'll still be in Australia on June 5th. It seems like I haven't left the United States yet. Carl Jung will be there! I really want to go! My dad has reserved two tickets for the reading on his credit card. I tell him I'll try to change my schedule to make it home on June 2nd or 3rd. I remember that the Raden University packet warned against taking exams early. My dad says okay, and our conversation seems about to end. Because of this burst of excitement and enthusiasm I want to tell him the dream I had last night in which he and I told each other I love you. I'm in my mom's bedroom looking north out the east window. I'm about to tell my dad the dream when I see five suns out the window. They are larger than usual: about twice as large as normal, and they are glowing. I stop and look at them. They are brilliant! I tell him to quick look out of his window and I run outside to look. As I run outside I see a reflection in the glass that makes me think that the five suns were really just a tricky splitting of light rays, like a prism. But I feel I can't back down from what I've said, because I've made a big deal of it, so I go out to look. It is cloudy outside. I see the suns as if they were in front of the clouds, large and glowing, in the formation of the five dots on a die. My brother Wally is there with his friends Perry Glyde and Mryle Madden. Perry or Mryle has my pocket notebook. I get it from them and scramble to write, to capture the moment. I see letters, numbers, and symbols on the suns, including 18hr or 18rh. I try to write these down. I'm still on the phone with my dad this whole time. I'm talking loud and fast. I'm very excited about what I'm seeing, as if it is a vision or is prophetic."
"1562"	"(02/24/1998)"	"A Store Falling Apart I'm at a sporting goods store in a mall, which I also know to be on the hill heading down to the old hog house at the Redding farm. I'm there to buy some leg weights so I can do the leg exercises while I'm in New South Wales to alleviate my knee pain. I test the electrical wiring of an item by plugging in several connections. A bulb lights up so I know the wiring is okay. My junior high classmate Ben Kator is there. He says his name and says something to be about getting the store employee who is in the attic. I don't recognize him at first, but then I remember him. The employee comes down from the attic. I wander up to the counter to pay for my leg weights. I have looked at several different sizes and weights. The employee rings it up to a total of $14.80. I start pulling out $24.80, so I can get a $10 bill back. The man grabs a handful of my coins and counts out 80 cents: three quarters and a nickel. He then slides the 80 cents towards him with his left hand and slides another bunch of coins towards him with his right hand, also taking the paper bills. I confront him on this, and call him a thief because I caught him. I say that a few coins aren't a big deal, but he is stealing. I ask him if there is a manager I can talk to. He says yes, and points to an office where I see a blue collar somewhat white trash stressed out greasy alcoholic-type person talking business on the phone. I wait for the manager, standing at the counter with the employee/thief. We talk about hard financial times: stealing while grocery shopping. The employee says that everyone steals. I tell him honestly that I don't. I'm waiting outside the manager's door. The employee enters the office and puts a dollar bill on the desk while the manager is still on the phone, as a bribe. It is the excess money in the till from stealing. He then comes and offers me a $40, $10, and $1 bill to keep quiet. I yell out, ""Don't try to bribe me!"" The manager is off the phone, and is standing right behind me. The employee lost his job at that moment, and leaves. I look at the store, which is on the hill as I look up towards the big oak tree and machine shed at the farm. The store is a mess: very unorganized, and things are falling apart. Three customers approach. The manager will need to run the store. I wait for the manager, to ask him if he needs good help: a good employee. Looking at the mess I know I could be more organized, efficient, and clean. I seem to be around Brimson, and am thinking of this job as a weekend job."
"1563"	"(02/24/1998)"	"Fat and White I'm in a bed with my friend Melanie McDyss, one of her female friends, and my friend Stephen Ramos. We talk about being tan and having a good body. I look pasty white, soft, and flabby: fat. Melanie asks me, ""Don't you work out?"" I reply no, and indicate that it's not too important to me. I slur my speech because I have a retainer in."
"1564"	"(02/24/1998)"	"Ramona's Keys I'm at a bank with my sister Ramona. I sit in the car as she goes inside the bank. She drove here. I am in the passenger seat. I open the glove compartment, where I find her keys and wallet. She returns to the car, quickly. She must have her own set of keys."
"1565"	"(02/24/1998)"	"Flat Chairlift I am driving with my sister Ramona on a road. There is a chairlift on our right, on the side of the road. She says it is for Eagle Ridge Ski Area. It runs pretty much flat. I don't think it would be very good for skiing."
"1566"	"(02/24/1998)"	"Redding Meal I'm at the Redding farm eating a large meal with lots of people. My cousin Paul Ralston is there, and I talk to him. Lots of other people are there. I eat a dark chocolate cookie, and some type of meat."
"1567"	"(02/25/1998)"	"The McDyss Family I'm on a farm that seems to belong to my friend Melanie McDyss' father, Rob. There are sheep on the farm. I move around. There is at least one big, muddy, 4x4 truck there. Rob stops his truck. I'm there, and we shake hands. I introduce myself, saying I'm a friend of Melanie. He mentions that she came home earlier that day. We keep talking and he says that she went out with her uncle. Surprised, I say, ""Oh, is she home!?"" Then I think to myself: I know he mentioned this earlier, why didn't I comprehend it then and react? I'm in a room with the McDyss family. Melanie isn't there. Rob offers people a drink: a can of Busch Light. He offers me a drink last, and I say, ""Yeah, sure."" Melanie's mother April is reluctant to give me the beer. At some point she hands me a green can of Mountain Dew, with her hand completely covering the label of the can. I take it, and see it is a Mountain Dew. I don't say anything, but know that for some reason she doesn't want me to have a beer. I see Melanie with her uncle. The child, who I presume is Melanie, is a young boy, about 10 years old. They are in a jeep. The uncle is driving. There seems to be an assault or conflict, which may be sexual."
"1568"	"(02/25/1998)"	"Free Hotel Soap I'm with a man and a woman going to a hotel for one night. We must draw a map for our driver so he knows how to get to the airport in the morning so we can catch our flight to Australia. We have a city map of Melbourne. We take it out and give directions: Take highway 19 into Melbourne to the airport. Then we drive in a large limousine-like vehicle. We arrive at a large, fancy hotel. I am with my friend Matt Yams in the Grocery Getto parking lot in Oak Valley. We have driven a small car there and parked in the northeast corner of the lot near the bus stop. There is a van parked to our right, and a car to our left. Matt has gone in the store. I need to urinate. I look to do this by the car, shielding myself from view. The people driving the van return to their vehicle and drive away. Matt comes out of the store looking very clean. He has showered and is wearing a white shirt with a blue apron. We're in a hotel room bathroom. There are a few inches of dirty, soapy water draining out of the bathtub. I ask Matt if that was from his shower. He says yes. I pick up a nice washcloth and some large bars of soap to take with me. There are five or six bars of soap around; I take three or four of them. I ask Matt what time we're getting up in the morning. He says half past six. I say, ""6:30?"" He says yes. I figure that gives us one and a half hours to get to the airport, which is plenty of time. We seem to need to be there at 7:00 or 5:00am. I'm in the break room at Grocery Getto. I quit my job there, along with another man. The man has some stuff in his locker that belongs to another employee. A coworker, Todd Mohs, is there. It may be his stuff in the locker, or the stuff may be moved to his locker. A person named Jim seems to be there."
"1569"	"(02/25/1998)"	"The Cat Attack I'm at a hotel, where I see my psychology professor Jordan Clemens dressed in hi usual ""smart casual"" attire standing outside below my window. I seem to be on the rooftop area. My classmate Alan is there, with his friend who is really drunk. There are other psychology students at the hotel. There is a cat near me. I take my flannel shirt and snap it at the cat, to shoo it away or scare it. The cat jumps towards me. I duck, and it lands on my back. I feel it cling to my back near my neck. The cat may be going to the Dominican Republic. Alan's friend may be going there too. Something seems to happen in a farm-like setting, that involves blood or medical supplies."
"1570"	"(02/25/1998)"	"The Harmless Scare I'm at home, alone, in the bathroom. There are two toilets. One is normal, and the other is like a large blue plastic-like urinal, shaped like a satellite dish. I step into the bathtub and sit on this urinal, which is over the bathtub. The plastic is flimsy and it bends when I try to let it support my weight. I'm cautious, listening for intruders. I hear something in the other room and quickly get up to go see what it is. I'm scared of who it may be. I run blindly into the kitchen, knocking over a small blond boy holding a telephone book. There are several people there. I recognize them as my grade school mate Charlie Hander, who is still very blond but much larger in stature, my cousins Phil and Kyle Jessen, and another boy. When I see who it is, I do not feel threatened anymore. Confused, I ask them what they're doing. They say that their parents told them to come in and go to the bathroom. I look out the front window and see a large black truck and a huge white motor home parked in front of the house. I tell these kids to just knock, and to tell their parents just to have them knock next time!"

"1573"	"(03/03/1998)"	"An 8 Shooter There is a woman at or in a place that may be a playground. The number three appears somehow. My friend Matt Yams is driving my mom's maroon car. Another person and I are in the car. We drive on the grass of the Railroad Company softball fields in Oak Valley, going eastward on the north side of 3rd Street. Matt is speeding. A police car passes. I know we'll be pulled over. Matt speeds up, and we drive onto the blacktop. I encourage him to pull over, but he tries to escape. I'm in a group of five people, including several police officers and my friend Melvin Dahlheimer. Matt isn't there. I'm in a car. A person blasts the lock of the car using a handgun. This is an aggressive, tension-reducing act, releasing energy. At one point, I wrestle Matt's gun to the ground. There are eight shots in one gun. I fire off some rounds in the gun. I run through people's yards and get hung up on a clothesline."
"1574"	"(03/03/1998)"	"Backtracking I'm in a bar with my friend Emily Zates and others. We have a gun. We're going to shoot brown beer bottles. People are after me. I'm scared. A radio announcer says my name, and says watch out, people are trying to kill you! There is a drive-by shooting planned for 6:00pm to shoot me. Some of the people after me are a gang called ""Niggers With ATT's"". I camp out at Hill Park between Josephine Zirbes' house and the apartments. A car drives by. I see its lights, and I fire a shot at it, though no one shot at me. Oak Valley police chief Dan Hellman and another police chief are looking after me. One of these two men is black. Bill and Tamara Thomas drive south on Park Avenue in Oak Valley. I see their car. It seems they care about me in a removed manner. I'm fleeing in my truck going north on Park Avenue. There is a smaller car going in front of me for protection. It's dark and I'm pulling a trailer. The car in front of me slows and stops. I need to hurry, so I drive around the protective car, between it and another car on the right side of the road. I put the accelerator to the floor and smash through the two cars. I'm going to try to outrun and fool everyone. I turn east on 2nd Street, go up a few blocks to Hill Avenue, and then backtrack, turning right and going south. I do this because I think no one will think I've stayed in the area, and will search for me elsewhere. I see a parade of lights up near 1st Street, going east, to look for me. I'm on a bicycle, with a trailer. I go on side streets and alleys, and lie low, quiet in the darkness."
"1575"	"(03/03/1998)"	"The Forward Woman I'm in line at a grocery store. A woman that I've been talking to in line writes down her phone number for me. The people around me sort of congratulate me on getting this woman's number: they laugh and cheer softly and make comments about she and I. The woman is very attractive. She seems to be a cashier at this store. I think of getting a food discount because of this. We walk out of the store. She has a dog that is in a puddle, almost completely covered with water. We get separated in a place that seems to be around the block where my friend Gino Teavor's house is. I hope that she will follow me, but she doesn't."
"1576"	"(03/03/1998)"	"The Three Wrongdoers I'm in a grocery store. I talk with my friend Bubba Hacker and others. On the radio, an announcement has been made declaring that Bubba, I, and one other person as having done something wrong. We try to correct this negative image of us."
"1577"	"(03/03/1998)"	"Jerry Rice Dies I'm sitting with my friend Hilary Nano and a man and woman in their mid 20's. Hilary and I talk with them about sex using a piece of bacon and either a belt or broccoli, wrapping one of these items around the waist and inserting one into the vagina. The woman tells us she's done this. I ask her questions to determine if she did it correctly. I say to the man, ""...so you're from Canada..."". He says no, his wife is from Canada: I have misunderstood. The couple is not married: he isn't wearing a ring. The man explains about his wife and he, and while he's talking he says, in passing, ""...When Jerry died..."". I'm shocked to hear this: I'm thinking of my professor Jerry Rice. I look at Hilary, and she confirms my dismay: Jerry Rice died last night. The woman there had been an adviser to or had known Jerry somehow. I am deeply saddened, and roll to the floor on my knees, crying. I leave, walking north to Carter Church in Oak Valley, which is a short walk. I look for a funeral notice on the doors of the church, and seeing none, remember that Jerry is Jewish, so I'll call the Jewish funeral homes around. I walk into the church and notice that a young man with dark hair has followed me there to see that I made it okay. In the church are a half-dozen people who seem to be coordinating or running the church. I see my friend Sara Miller. She is very happy to see me, and is loquacious and smiley. I am somber, and say nothing. I leave with her out the sacristy door and walk home with her and my grade school classmate Brownie Bruny. There is ice and snow on the ground: it's winter. Someone mentions that if the cement of a sidewalk is exposed, uncovered from the snow and ice for at least 24 hours, then people have a right to dig there, with a ditch-digger or a backhoe! My family is staying elsewhere for a few days after the death. I go to the new residence. It is my old neighbor Donald Branson's old house. I kick the door open loudly because my hands are full. There are two dinner tables. I see a family that is like the Flanders family on the television show the Simpsons at one table, and my mom and my brother Wally at the other table. We are sharing with this family for now. I set my load down and tell everyone about Jerry's death. I say what Jerry meant to me: that he was a facilitator: he allowed me the extra freedom to do my own thing. We're all having homemade pasta and steak for dinner. Some of the boys from the other family come to introduce themselves to me. One of them is named Tod. Another boy tells me to say ""farmers"" and then he squeezes my cheeks together as I say the ""ers"" portion of the word, so his name sounds like ""Farmears"", but is spelled Farmers. They pick up small, arranged strands of colored pasta from my plate. This is a really artsy, fancy, finicky, almost childish way to prepare pasta, and I'm kind of annoyed by it. I think of my honors proposal, and if I should get in touch with someone else to write the recommendation for it."
"1578"	"(03/03/1998)"	"Kevin Down Under I'm at Brimson. My friend Tom Napper goes through a tunnel from Tea Hall to Harvard Hall, and is on the phone with my friend Melanie McDyss. I'm jealous of him talking to Melanie. She says, ""Hi Hank."", thinking that she is talking to our friend Hank Anderson, or mistaking the two. I wander into Harvard hall, thinking of where Melanie's room is. I'm attracted to Melanie. I go to check my email. It's closing time. The woman in the computer lab indicates this so I leave. I tell her all she had to do was tell me they were closing and I'd have left. My friends Kevin Simpson and Jose Ramos are there. I shake hands with Jose. Kevin and I get up and leave. It seems we're in Australia."
"1579"	"(03/03/1998)"	"Stephen's Ill Logic I am with my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson. I confront Stephen with his own inconsistencies, self-contradictions, and his ill logic. He largely ignores me, downplaying its importance. I have had enough of his crap, and I leave, frustrated and agitated."
"1580"	"(03/03/1998)"	"Hiding The Key I'm at Carter School. I have a key and I enter the south door near the gymnasium. I see that the gates in the halls are up. My friend Kevin Simpson is out in front of the school. I go to the north entrance, outside, near the daycare. I look in the door there. I'm going to enter. A man inside catches me looking in and notices I have a key. He asks me suspiciously what I'm doing there. He calls security, whom I know to be the principal Candy Bevner. I have a pair of turquoise rubber gloves for washing dishes. I put these on with the key inside them, but the man and another woman notice my actions of secrecy."
"1581"	"(03/03/1998)"	"Dressed Up For a Game I enter an Armstrong High School basketball game. I am dressed up, wearing long pants, a shirt, and a belt. I have on a light turquoise colored winter cap that extends over my ears. My dad is there. I walk past the coach Jackson Shooter. He doesn't notice me. I walk by him again near the end of the court. He comments on my appearance and says I look good. Someone may also comment on my facial hair. I give the coach a wink and a cocky point with my hand, as if it were a gun, with my thumb pointed up and my index finger extended. I sit with two good male friends. One of the Lorenz family girls takes the hat off my head, saying it is hers. This is the second time today that someone has taken my hat."
"1582"	"(03/04/1998)"	"The Simpson's Movie I'm in a movie theatre that seems like the Deer Theatre in Oak Valley. I look in several theatres, viewing a minute or two of the beginnings of each film. I go into a theatre and I see my friend Kevin Simpson sitting in the back row. I am supposed to meet Kevin. The theatre is really empty, and there is a large white woman sitting four or five seats down from Kevin. I see him, and I say, ""Hi Kevin!"" He says, ""Hi Kenneth."" I squeeze past the woman and sit by Kevin. I tell him I've been watching the beginnings of other movies. We are seeing a Simpson's movie."
"1583"	"(03/04/1998)"	"The Crafty Bum I'm working with three lower-middle or lower class Hispanic men. We're working at a fruit and vegetable stand. The day ends. I may ask the three bosses if I can take some of the produce to eat. They say okay, but I find that the boxes are all taped up so I can't get any fruit. A homeless man comes around, begging for change. I say to him, ""Tell you what: Why don't you come home for dinner with me?"" He agrees. I change clothes quickly as he waits. An attractive woman comes into the house where I am. I know her to be my roommate, though we've never met. As I'm leaving we meet and talk. I'm trying to find a light switch for the front of the house. She shows me where it is. I see that the homeless man has stolen my truck! I go to get him. He is then driving a bus that he has stolen. I try to get on the bus. I hang onto the back of the bus as he drives fast, and then stops abruptly. I smash into the back of the bus. He does this several times. I dupe him by hanging off the side of the bus. When he stops abruptly I'm flung up near the doors and I get on the bus. I have a gun. I point it at his head while he is driving. There's another man there also pointing a gun at the homeless man's head. I fire my gun repeatedly at the homeless man's head from point-blank range. The homeless man has taken the bullets out of our guns and we don't hurt him."
"1584"	"(03/04/1998)"	"Leaving A Woman Abruptly I'm in a group of people. A woman is in the group. We have just starting seeing each other. She may be a woman I'm now seeing in Melbourne: Jane Gracie. There are bicycles there. I say something about how we're in disagreement: I'm not going to budge, I simply need time for myself and am not willing to compromise. She gets angry and demands attention. I say a few short, blunt words and walk away. I see my friend Jill Banks as I leave. My friend Stephen Ramos may have been in the group."
"1585"	"(03/04/1998)"	"Bill Ruins A Drawing I'm with my friend Bill Hanson. Others are there. I do a sketch, a drawing in my book. It is of a face of a man with turquoise hair. I'm pleased when it is done: it's simple and descriptive. I think Bill likes it too. I say, ""Why don't I throw it in the microwave for a minute?"", which seems like the usual thing to do with a drawing. Bill says okay, and puts the whole sketchpad in a fake leather case and puts it in the microwave. I say, ""Maybe we shouldn't put the leather in there: it may melt."" He says it'll be okay, and he turns on the microwave for a minute. At the end of the minute I look over and see that the case is bubbling and curling: it's melting! A loud pop emanates from the microwave! I think it may explode, but it doesn't. I'm upset over the loss of the drawing. Bill feels guilty and apologizes to me. I tell him it's not a big deal: it's just one drawing. Then I remember that there was a drawing of the earth, sky, and sun in the sketchbook that I really liked. I am really disturbed and angry. The other drawing was inspired by the Five Suns dream. Other people are there. A German man and my friend Fiona Ulness come out of a college and sit on the grass with a blanket. They are about to have a sexual encounter."
"1586"	"(03/05/1998)"	"My Little Lamb I'm at Brimson. I'm caring for a lamb. It's like my pet, or my little baby. I try to make it move along in the right direction, but it won't walk where I want it to walk. I pick it up by its front two legs and carry it where I want it to go. It bites me, but has no bottom incisors or canine teeth so it doesn't hurt. I'm trying to contact my psychology professor Jordan Clemens. I talk to my advisor Mary Monroe. Jordan is in the lunch lounge, his office is empty. Mary says I can go get him. I'll just wait. She says something about the Broncos having 71 players and a number of them getting to play. I sit on a couch in a lounge-like area and watch television. I need something to keep the lamb occupied. I take a hat and mittens off the lamb and pet its furry head, as if it were a little blond child. The lamb gives me a small pouch of gold colored plastic filled with plasma. It seems to be a toy from a baby to the lamb, and I put it back next to a second pouch that we'll need for something later. I know Jordan received my messages: he had notes on his desk indicating that he talked to both my dad and sister Heather, trying to get in contact with me."
"1587"	"(03/06/1998)"	"The Dancing Bear I'm in a van with a group of people. We're driving to go hiking. There is a leading man driving, who is a bit older than the rest of us. I sit in the passenger seat, which is on the left side of the car. The man drives fast sometimes. We follow cars very closely. He slows and stops abruptly, and I am nervous about his driving. We're driving in hilly/mountainous country with windy roads. We arrive at the spot we're going to hike at, and I know I've hiked here before. We walk a little bit. A dog runs up to us barking and growling. I'm afraid to be bitten, and I seek shelter through a door. The dog is then a bear-like creature. It stands on its hind limbs and dances with my cousin Rich Redding, who is in the group. The bear seems to be friendly."
"1588"	"(03/06/1998)"	"The Bad Son I call my friend Tiny Combs' home to talk to Tiny. Tiny's father answers the phone. I ask for Tiny. His father refers to Tiny as ""the bad one"". I ask him to tell Tiny to write me an email."
"1589"	"(03/06/1998)"	"High With Binky I'm with my friend Binky Ahmed at home. We have smoked marijuana and are high: we're goofy. My mom is there with one of her sisters, who makes a comment about being high. I tell her that her description is how I thought being high would be until I actually smoked marijuana, when I found out that is not the case. We're all about to leave somewhere in a car. My sister Ramona is mad because there is no gas in the car. I was supposed to put some gas in the car because I drove it last and the gas tank was empty. I grab a couple snacks from the red basket under the countertop. Binky is high, and is lazy. There's a reward of some sort, of two items."
"1590"	"(03/08/1998)"	"The Deer Hunting Death I'm deer hunting in a park-like place with the Ramos'. The sun is five to ten degrees above the horizon. We are late getting out to our deer stands. I'm disoriented, and can't find my stand. There are other hunters around. I sit near a stadium field, where there is another hunter. I'm in a hurry, and I don't have a warm hat. I'm told to let the other hunter shoot does. I climb up a tree. The tree bends to the ground, so I am sitting atop of the trunk, which is bent in the shape of an upside-down U. I see a deer running. A shot is fired. Someone has hit it on the run. It doubles back and runs towards me. I fire, but no bullet comes out of the gun: it's like a misfire. The deer runs down towards another hunter, who fires and misses. The deer runs right towards me. I see two figures: a deer and what appears to be a person, running close together. I have a double-barrel shotgun. I aim the gun and fire. The deer falls dead on the spot, half blown apart. People come and look at it. I have shot a boy, maybe in addition to a deer. They may be separate, but the boy seems to have been wearing part of the deer on him as he ran. This is a terrible accident. Others and I feel guilty. I notice the safety on my shotgun is still off."
"1591"	"(03/11/1998)"	"Pork Linguini I'm eating dinner at a fancy restaurant. I order steak, but am served ground pork with linguini. I ask to see a man's menu to clarify the order. The waiter won't take this item off the bill, even though I didn't order it. I say, ""Then I'll eat it!"" I get a box to go. I go talk to a manager. The restaurant is expensive."
"1592"	"(03/11/1998)"	"A Narrow Tow Boat I'm working at Fishing Haven. It feels like my second summer there. I think of staying, or returning to work there. I load and prepare a towboat that is the width of a canoe. After I push the boat off the plug is not in, and water gets in the boat. Two men take rubber rafts into the Big Resort Area. There are some barrels that are used as floatation devices. I am waist deep in water. My old boss Phoebe Mills says I can't do the tow because I'll get the boat wet. So my old coworker Tom Olson does the tow. My other old boss Mike Hollow goes on the tow as well. The men have leeches."
"1593"	"(03/11/1998)"	"Giving A Sermon I'm in Carter Church. My mom reads both the readings and the Gospel reading. I am going to give the sermon. I wait for my mom to finish. I am nervous. I fidget, sitting on the steps next to the pulpit. Before I go up to the pulpit I whisper to her. For the sermon I talk about loved ones. It seems almost funeral-like. I say I'd rather leave this living world than lose a loved one. It turns out to be a decent sermon. I relax and talk okay."
"1594"	"(03/12/1998)"	"Walking A Sydney Beach I'm at a beach, walking. I use a map of Sydney. Some areas are rocky. I go through some shops. There is a woman fishing who gets a snag. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. He cuts the line for her. Other people are there. There is a photograph of the students in the Raden University group. There may be one black man in the photograph."
"1595"	"(03/12/1998)"	"On Thin Ice I'm on ice and snow with a snowmobile. The ice is a lake. I think I could fall through: the ice is thin. I'm worried. I move slowly and cautiously. I'm in the field to the west of my friend's, the Ramos', property where we deer hunt. I am not able to get up. My friends Norman Noman and Hank Anderson are there, walking along the fence line. I yell for help. They say it is just hard to get up. Norman has a small bow and some arrows. I shoot at something and come close, but don't hit it. I say if it were a deer, I'd have hit it. There are cows in a pasture near where Jose Ramos' deer stand is."
"1596"	"(03/13/1998)"	"My First Deer I have killed my first deer. It is a doe, which is very small. I talk to my mom on the phone and tell her that I got a deer. The deer is like nothing: like thin cloth or paper. I lay the deer on the floor. It may be cloth or paper."
"1597"	"(03/14/1998)"	"A Big Bull Moose I'm walking through a forested area. I see something move, pushing the brush apart. I think it must be a moose because it is so big. It comes out from the brush and I see it's a large bull moose with a big rack of antlers! It is the first bull moose I've seen with a big rack of antlers. I don't have my camera, but I'm not far from the place where my camera is, and seeing how moose usually move slowly, I can probably come back and take a photograph of it. I walk on, into a museum-like area with stuffed animals. I see a sow bear and two cubs. They move, and I realize they're alive! I hurry away from them: they may be dangerous. I make it back to a group where I talk with the others about the animals I just saw. Some of them have seen the animals too."
"1598"	"(03/14/1998)"	"Two Men and Two Sons There is a man with a sickly son. The man says that he has to work so he has money to support and help his son. Another man hears him say this, and instructs the first man. He says that the first man is going about it all wrong: what the sick son really needs is his father to be with him. I'm on a bus with the two men. We ride around a lake to a grocery store, which seems to be very Flanders-esque, from the television show the Simpson's. A son of the second man gets off the bus as it stops. He pushes a button at the bus stop, signaling the driver that we want to get off the bus. The second man and his (healthy) son seem to be Flanders-esque, unlike the first man and his sick son, who do not."
"1599"	"(03/14/1998)"	"The Confrontation Meeting I'm crawling on the floor of an office building, going to a meeting at Armstrong High School. I enter a hallway. There are photocopies on the wall of some pictures of maps of a brain that are in a book. The book is there. It is black and has to do with the brain, mind, and maybe dreams. A teacher at the school is reading it. I pick it up briefly and look at it: It looks interesting, new. I go to the meeting. I'm ten minutes late. I'm the first student there. There are three teachers or administrators there waiting, one of whom is my religion professor Grace Kurkowski. I walk in and sit down directly across from these three, although there are other seats available. I sit firmly, plainly, and directly across from them, like I'm confronting them and mean business. It is obvious that no students care about the meeting."
"1600"	"(03/14/1998)"	"Skywalker Defeats Vader There is a meeting between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Luke is in water that is enclosed by glass. He seems to be able to breath or to function by holding his breath. The two are civil towards each other at first, talking very seriously. They fight five battles, each with a different weapon. Darth Vader is overpowering in the first two battles. Luke Skywalker uses his skills to win the next three battles and defeats Darth Vader, winning the best of five battles."
"1601"	"(03/14/1998)"	"Imposter Siblings I'm playing the card game Euchre with my sisters Heather, Ramona and another female at home. Heather gets up to go to the bathroom. Ramona bids four and takes the kitty prematurely. I stop her, saying no! I have a good hand, and will overbid her and anyone else, since I have the last bid. I tell Ramona to wait for Heather, because I want to play the hand. I'm going to bid six spades. I'm eating a pear. I walk to turn off a light, which may be in my mom's room. I go to the back porch to close the door, and the light is on. I see a person get out of my mom's car. It's Heather. She is sneaking around somewhere. She seems to have sneaked out from my mom's bedroom window, outside, to do something covert, and then was going to sneak back into my mom's window. My brother Wally is then with Heather. They are dangerous. They may be imposters: are not my real siblings."
"1602"	"(03/15/1998)"	"Tent Space I'm with my housemates Glen Ryan and Bittie Marton in a tent. There is more space in the tent than I would have expected."
"1603"	"(03/15/1998)"	"Conversation With the Dead I'm with my friend Mark Long, who is dead. We're talking with a woman who is drunk."
"1604"	"(03/15/1998)"	"Haunting Need I'm being haunted by an invisible presence that has something which I need. This presence leaves a trail, which I pursue."
"1605"	"(03/16/1998)"	"The Condom Captain I'm on a big white boat. The captain has steered us into a dead-end area where the water is blocked by ice, snow, or land. A male worker on the boat talks to us passengers, saying that the boat won't be turned around unless someone gives him or the captain a small condom. Several people make comments or have condoms. One man, who may be my friend Reed Maxwell, says he as an extra-large condom. I have lots of condoms, I know, in a drawer under my bed. I have one condom with me that I unwrap: it is small. The boat eventually backs out of the dead end. It spins in circles, with the propeller turned 90 degrees. The prop hits rocks, weeds, and the bottom. We spin around the long, narrow inlet. It doesn't seem like we're making it out too fast."
"1606"	"(03/16/1998)"	"Trout Fishing I come to a stream where my friend Paul Jones is trout fishing. He gives me a rod and reel. I'm fishing with a white fly. The trout are all over the stream, and many bite at the fly. I'm using a fly rod. I set the hook on several fish but they easily spit the hook out. Some of these fish are large: two or three pounds! I land a small trout on the fly rod. We continue down the stream. I'm then using a spinning reel with a white fly. I catch another trout. We move with our flies as they float down the stream. There is a woman there. I think she wants to fish as well. There are three of us and only two rods. I don't want to give up my rod. The stream is the alley behind my home in Oak Valley. Down near my neighbors the Knife's house the stream turns into disconnected, muddy puddles that aren't good for fishing."
"1607"	"(03/16/1998)"	"The Spinning Pirate Ship There is a large wooden pirate-like ship with large sails. The captain sees a problem with the ropes for the sails, from a distance, and he yells and quickly goes to correct the sail problem. The sails are lifted up all the way, and then let swing down, all in a plane, attached to a rope. The problem is caught and people try to fix it, but it takes some time. The captain says the last six ships with this problem sank! The boat spins in circles and gets out of the predicament."
"1608"	"(03/16/1998)"	"Rowing Rookies I'm in a crew boat rowing with others. I'm at the back of the boat, so I can see everyone. We come very close to another boat and a dock, and may hit them. At some point the boat begins to go in the other direction, so I'm at the front of the boat. We back out of a place. We seem to have a captain who wants to go to a race of some sort or to get certified. We are all new rowers, and this seems premature. At some point I am urinating outside. I have trouble sitting straight in the boat, and I dangle my legs outside and try to get the position and stroke down."
"1609"	"(03/17/1998)"	"The Invincible Red Head I'm in a church that seems to be Carter Church. My uncle Rusty Redding and friend Kevin Simpson are there. My aunt Shelia Redding is worried that Rusty won't come home: Rusty is packed to go to the Big Resort Area. I wrestle with Kevin aggressively. I have two light sabers. I'm either guarding a group of people in the church, or trying to get at the group. At first I think I'm guarding them. There is a man with red hair there, who keeps me from getting at the people. I strike him with one and then both light sabers, but nothing happens to him: the sabers don't harm him. He won't go away. An Asian man escapes from the church. I say he better have yelled for help. My classmates Vince Washington and Rebecca try to escape from the building. They run off, maybe to rock climb, or parachute off a cliff. I run after them. I run past Rebecca: she is slow, and I know I can catch her later. I run after Vince, who goes westward from the church. I catch him, and call him Sal Watson, the name of a classmate from high school. He is like my grade school classmate Patrick Bergman, and sounds like my friend Reed Maxwell. Patrick weakly punches me twice in the groin. I'm not really affected by this. I punch him but it doesn't hurt him. I don't seem to be able to punch with full force. I really want to beat him up!"
"1610"	"(03/19/1998)"	"No Ticket I'm at the airport with my advisor Mary Monroe and a group of students. I don't have a plane ticket to fly on Qantas airlines to Australia. I have to wait and fly the next day to Sydney."
"1611"	"(03/19/1998)"	"Airport Bar I'm at an airport bar with my friend Paul Jones. I call my mom, and say that Paul flies out in one hour, so I'll be home in two hours. At the bar we get a pitcher of juice with vodka in it."
"1612"	"(03/19/1998)"	"Duping Bullies I'm at Scott Junior High School in Wilmerton. I jog around the athletic field. There are men in their late twenties playing football there. I play a game of three-on-three with them. My teammates are physically small, and we get beaten badly by the other team. I fight one of the big men. Three bullies bother me at grade school. A woman helps me dupe the bullies. We offend the principal."
"1613"	"(03/19/1998)"	"A Second Bathroom I'm at home in Oak Valley. I urinate in a second bathroom. There is a lot of alcohol around in the house."
"1614"	"(03/20/1998)"	"Ray Jackson's Invasion I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas in a room. We're having a sexual encounter. I rip her clothes off and we have sex. Her knees are bent, and her legs are up against her chest. At one point she gives me fellatio. Another time I say to her, ""Suck my dick, so I can get hard and we can fuck."" She does this. The sex is good: it feels great. At one point I realize that this isn't real: that I'm imagining it. But I keep imagining it because it's great. Annie has a few pimples on her back, and a scratch with a chunk of skin missing, which doesn't seem like her. She has on white boxer-brief underwear. It's later in the night, then. I awaken and Annie isn't there. Ray Jackson, an acquaintance, is sitting on the floor. I'm shocked and extremely surprised to see someone there! I am hostile at first, saying to him, ""What the fuck are you doing here?"" Then I calm down. I think this must be a dream. I grab Ray's shoe, with his foot in it. It is solid, and I conclude that this isn't a dream. I wonder, and ask where he came from. I am baffled that he is in my room. He seems surprised and confused that he's there, as if he doesn't know how he got there. He tells me he came to see my sister Heather the other day. I believe him. This is his reason for being here. I had grabbed a knife, believing that he was an intruder: someone in the form of him, but not actually him. I put the knife, which is my army knife, down. The attic door, which is in my bedroom at home, is open. There is a picture on the wall that is tilted or fallen of an angel or spirit woman, like the picture that my dad gave Heather a while back. I look down at my clock on the floor, spilling a cup of water near my bed as the blankets fall on the floor. It's about 6:30am. The blankets on my bed are those from my flat on Ocean Avenue. I'm wearing underwear, and I cover up with a sheet, sitting or standing to deal with Ray. I may grab the knife again."
"1615"	"(03/20/1998)"	"Mark Long Can't Breath I'm at home. My friend Mark Long is there, alive. He can't breath. I enter a room where my mom and another woman are attending to him. I dial 000, which is the emergency number in New South Wales, and talk to my dad. I get him on the phone, and we talk quickly: I tell him Mark can't breath right, and he asks me questions about what is happening. I ask the others, and Mark answers a couple questions about his critical condition. My brother Wally is there. Wally may have to perform a tracheotomy on Mark, so Mark can breath. Then Mark starts to breath okay. I talk to my mom and the other woman. I tell them about my back pain the last three days, and the sharp, stinging chest pain I just experienced a little while ago this night. There seems to be many similarities."
"1616"	"(03/20/1998)"	"In Mountains With Wally I'm in a mountainous area with my friend Gretchen Warwick and my brother Wally. I may want to do some activity with Wally."
"1617"	"(03/20/1998)"	"Nighttime Walk I'm walking down Beach Avenue in Melbourne late at night. I'm headed towards Hugh's Pub, but am not going there specifically. I'm going to do a more wholesome activity than drink alcohol."
"1618"	"(03/20/1998)"	"Boat By UPS I'm at home in Oak Valley. The UPS man pulls up in the back driveway, towing my boat. He has come to drop off the boat and a package in the boat. The rest of the boat is filled with junk. I sign a slip with my initials. The man makes a comment to the effect that I'm trying to be sneaky, and to re-sign the slip. I apologize to him: I had no intention of duping him, and I sign my name on a longer line."
"1619"	"(03/20/1998)"	"Talking Basketball I walk into the front door at home in Oak Valley. Several of my sister's black male friends are there. They are about my age. One of them asks what position I played when I played high school basketball. I tell him I played center because we had a small team. I talk to the guys about basketball. They are all basketball players. They tell me there is a tournament taking place in Wilmerton."
"1620"	"(03/22/1998)"	"Range Rover I'm driving a red Range Rover through a narrow area of buildings, and into a garage, where I park it."
"1621"	"(03/22/1998)"	"In An Empty Bus I'm in a bus, which is one of two busses. One bus is full, and the other is empty. I'm the only person in the empty bus. Two women come and sit with me in the bus. I know them. Later, one of them is my friend Ellen Sanders"
"1622"	"(03/23/1998)"	"Escape From A Train A family friend, Steve Lorenz, makes fun of my friend Matt Yams. His mocking is relentless tormenting: childish joking. They are then grown up, and Steve is too big for Matt to beat up. I'm by the overpass on Main Street where the railroad tracks are in Oak Valley. I'm on a bicycle. It's dark out and I'm not wearing a helmet. I ride very fast, weaving around cars. I ride east down Main Street. It's a fast and dangerous ride. I come near train tracks and skid to a stop. I fall off the bicycle and onto the tracks. A train is coming! I quickly roll out of the way, and the train booms right over/next to my head! I write the names of Elaine and Christopher ____ (I forget) Kraemer from the television show Seinfeld. There are some large three-kilogram buckets of tar. There is a reading room where an article is. I wait in line with a woman. She says that it's good to get the article early."
"1623"	"(03/23/1998)"	"The Human Pike There is an alligator carrying a chunk of a log in its mouth. The log is then a frog in a gulp of water. The alligator filters out the water and eats the frog. I hold a huge fish, either a muskellunge or a northern pike that is about 20 pounds, partially in the water. It has a covering on its teeth that may be green. It has human teeth, and very powerful jaws. I have my hand inserted fully into its mouth. I slowly remove my hand. I anxious about being bitten! I let the fish go in the water, where I see trout and bass frantically swimming away from this huge fish. I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We're about to watch a movie. We go to McDonalds, or eat food from McDonalds. I eat two large fries and two Big Macs. I'm really full! We start to have a sexual encounter, and she stops and says she may be getting her period today or tomorrow and that maybe we shouldn't have sex, but maybe not. She says she has to go to the store. I think this is to get something for her period. I'm not too concerned about the sex, but I do want to be with her. I ask if I can go along to the store. She says no. I eat the rest of my McDonalds food, feeling fat and gorged, like I might soon need to defecate."
"1624"	"(03/23/1998)"	"Parking The Land Rover I'm in the bush, the country. There is a farmer looking for a place to park his Land Rover. There are several shacks or sheds on his farm that will serve the purpose of a garage."
"1625"	"(03/23/1998)"	"Hank Anderson Returns There is a funeral for one of my friend Reed Maxwell's family members. Others and I are riding in a vehicle to the funeral. Some people ride in another car because there isn't enough room in the vehicle I'm driving. There is only a small place in the cab of my truck-like vehicle, and some space in the bed. My mom is there. At the gathering, my friend Hank Anderson arrives back from his study abroad experience. He seems a bit aloof or standoffish at first. Then we hug each other. He may be with a woman."
"1626"	"(03/25/1998)"	"Killing Wally Prematurely I'm in a submarine with Colonel Clink from the television show Hogan's Heros. One of the officers goes into the bathroom on board. Schulz, from the same show, and the short French man are also there. Schulz is guarding people in his usual obtuse manner. People dupe him. I'm there. I sit on the ground hunched over, covered with a cloak. Schulz doesn't know I'm a person. I jump up, and am in the living room at the Redding farm. I shoot three unsuspecting people. I'm in the baby room at the farm. My brother Wally bursts in, firing a gun at me. I seek cover in the kitchen, behind a wall. I have a shotgun that shoots hand grenades. I cock it several times, and then cautiously lean around the corner of the doorway and fire three shots. Wally is near the back left corner of the room. The grenades shoot crooked out of my gun, in a straight path but to the left of where I aimed. I cock my shotgun again and fire, adjusting for the crooked trajectory. My fourth or fifth shot hits Wally directly in the chest. There is hole in his chest, and a pause. His body is then ripped apart, blown to pieces in fire, ashes, and explosions, with blood and fire mixed, spread out like sunrays in all directions. He blows up, burning and bleeding. I see his form, his shape, as it explodes. He asks me, ""What did you do that for?"", in such a tone that I feel guilty for shooting him with a grenade. He is alive shortly. I run away. I feel terrible that I have killed him. It is a premature killing. I run past the garage, plum trees, chicken coops, and into the cornfield. I take a silver handgun out of my pocket and carry it with me. I am scared of being confronted by Wally. I think he may still be alive."
"1627"	"(03/25/1998)"	"The Small Basketball Court I arrive at Carter School with my sister Heather. This is a new school for us. We're about our age now, but may be younger, in our teens. I'm in a sports club with my brother Wally, Heather, and a white man. We're in a small room. The man is a basketball player. We go to a small gymnasium. There are a group of black and white men gathering to play basketball. I have on my white, new-looking Nike basketball shoes to play. The hoops are small: about eight inches wide, and about seven feet high. The game starts. There are two referees. I want to get in the game and see how I'll play. I think that I'll play okay."
"1628"	"(03/25/1998)"	"Melvin Dahlheimer's Incident I'm in a room working on a dream with someone I know. I grade school classmate Jerry Kasper enters the room and sits down, which doesn't seem to affect our work. I'm with others in a field playing softball. There are two soccer players there, with a soccer ball. One of them may be my classmate Jim Suds. I ask them if they want to play softball, since we're going to take up the whole field. They say no, and leave somewhat angrily. I'm near the corner of Home Avenue and Main Street in Oak Valley. I get a mixed drink from a field that is staying there, but I leave to go do some kind of sports activity. I'm at home relaxing. A crowd of familiar people arrives. They inform me that my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer got into an ambulance, and they interrogate me accusingly as to what I said to him to affect his condition. I react strongly, saying that I said and did nothing to him. I'm appalled to be suspect in this incident, and I tell this very firmly to everyone."
"1629"	"(03/25/1998)"	"The Fool In Love There is a man who pursues a woman who has broken up with him. She makes a fool out of him. He hounds her like a blubbering fool. He is a sucker. She eventually gives in to him. They have a sexual encounter that involves spaghetti. She lives with her mother. Lotion is on the floor at some point. She may be very tall."
"1630"	"(03/27/1998)"	"Can't Make It Up There is a new light blue car in our driveway at home in Oak Valley. A man tries it out and says it will or should sell for $26,009.00. He notes the fluorescent lights and the plastic pieces on the interior. I don't' think the car is that nice: not with 26 thousand dollars! I'm in a car with my dad and my sister Ramona. We're going fishing. We're driving down Home Avenue going south towards Main Street. I realize that I forgot my fishing rod, and I don't have a tackle box. We're not pulling a boat. My dad says he has his rod. We don't' turn back to get mine, though we're only a block away. My dad drives through the stop sign at the railroad tracks and through another near 1st or 2nd Street south. He is going fast, accelerating. The car leaves the ground when going over the railroad tracks, and we bounce around. I verbally reprimand him for speeding and not stopping at the stop signs. It reminds me of the big black man who gave a talk at Armstrong High School about ""cruising along"" at 80 miles per hour. I think of the speaker's friend who died in a car crash. My dad doesn't take me seriously. I tell him I don't want him or I to get hurt. He accepts my concern more when I express it this way. He says okay, but still drives fast on a narrow road. I feel drunk. I know I couldn't control the car at this speed if I were driving this fast on these roads. I have my fishing rod. There is a bell sinker tied to the end of the line. I pull on the line, which is old and nicked up. The line snaps. I take the rod apart and pull the line off the spool. We are at a park shelter-like area. There are many wooden artifacts that seem to be antiques. We walk through this place. There is a very tall large man there in a brown cloak with big scruffy hair. He is very frightening looking. He speaks a few words, neutrally and informatively, which give me a different impression of him. I have a ring made of wood, about ten inches in diameter, with the wood about two inches in diameter. We come upon a field where there is a wooded hill on our right in front of us. My dad yells crazily at a man named Pete or Pat, who is playing ultimate Frisbee with a group of men. There are one or two small swimming pools on our left, and a steep hill in front of us. We start walking up the hill, climbing and grabbing the grass for a grip. The grass rips out, and it is very difficult to climb. I slip and fall back down. At the top are Rita Fosters, an acquaintance, her sister, and others. They are sitting on towels because they just went swimming. It is cold outside. My friend Stephanie Peterson is at the top of the hill. I try to climb up, but the grass rips out and I slide down. My old landlord Bill Miller is approaching a house, which may be our house, at the top of the hill. I really want to get to the house to see what he wants. I try to run up the hill, and fail. Stephanie slips and flips down the hill. I deftly catch her and set up upright. I want to see what Bill needs or wants, but I can't make it up the hill."
"1631"	"(03/27/1998)"	"The Broken Doors I'm in Carter School with my friend Stephen Ramos and my acquaintance Eve Nichols. Eve wants to go up to the roof. Stephen and I walk down several flights of stairs to a door. We walk by some people from Brimson. At the bottom the doors are propped open: they are being worked on. There is a yellow caution ribbon hanging across the hall before the doors. We're not supposed to touch the doors. We leave. Eve catches up with us. She didn't go to the roof, but the roof door was open, she says. I sit in the snow with Stephen and Eve near the entrance of the school. A suburban slowly drives by. I think my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is in it. I pretend not to see her, pretend I don't recognize her. In the end, I don't think it is Annie."
"1632"	"(03/27/1998)"	"New Church Parishioners I'm near the south entrance of Carter Church. I'm working with another man my age. We hang up or stack jackets of little kids. My mom says we have to wear onion-like sacks with the number nine on them, so that what we're doing is legal. We seem to have something to do with beer. There are many new parishioners coming into the church. There are people from Rival High School who arrive in their high school apparel. I'm dressed in my pale green outfit with Doc Martins on my feet. I'm performing a trick or feat for a group of kids. A woman from my psychology class is among the kids. There is an electric door to the living room, and a big light switch."
"1633"	"(03/27/1998)"	"The Yellow Garage Door I'm at home in Oak Valley in the kitchen with my brother Wally, my mom, and others. Wally says something about masturbating. I'm surprised he is so open talking about this. I drink out of a pitcher of lemonade. We go out and do something with the old big yellow garage door."
"1634"	"(03/27/1998)"	"Illusion I'm in a swimming pool with others. I'm masturbating. I lie down in six to eight inches of water. I stop masturbating and fall asleep. I awake later and everyone is gone. The lights are off and the pool is empty. I have been left behind. There is a shower knob. I reach for it, but my hand goes through it. I'm not really in the place that I am seeing."
"1635"	"(03/27/1998)"	"Irony Water There is red, irony water around. I run away from people that are pursuing me. I lock myself at home to escape them. I am tired of being chased."
"1636"	"(03/30/1998)"	"Catching A Shad Rap I'm fishing on a pontoon-like raft with another person, who may be my friend Matt Yams. I'm using two fishing rods. It's difficult to cast and reel with both rods: holding one in my arm while using another. I get a fish on. My line goes taut and the fish jumps. It's a good-sized ocean fish, about ten pounds. I seem to have hooked it in the back, or by a metal ring that is attached to its back, like a Shad Rap fishing lure. We land the fish. I have a metal stringer. Later, I'm fishing with my friend's father Mike Reed."
"1637"	"(03/30/1998)"	"Ernie Els I'm catching chickens that are running around the back yards of the block to the north of the block I live on at home in Oak Valley. There is a large open space behind the houses on Home Avenue. It seems that I have just caught chickens and removed them from a house on Home Avenue. Now it's dark outside. I run and collect three chickens, and one really small chicken, almost a peeper. I do this in an area that is off-limits, so I have to be sneaky: it is in other people's yards. It seems there is some sort of exchange for the chickens: either getting something for removing them from the house, or for bringing them to the house. I go to the house with four chickens. People I know are watching television. Ernie Els (the golfer) is a short bald man. He is playing basketball against Kareem Abdul-Jabaar. Ernie makes a shot and is going to win. This constitutes a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game on television. I see a very long, birch-bark looking canoe being pushed across the basketball court."
"1638"	"(03/30/1998)"	"Striking Out I'm playing in a baseball game. My team is fielding. I play second base. We make several bad throws in a row, some of which are my errors. The inning ends. I think there are only two outs. We're up to bat. My friend Gino Teavor is leading off, followed by my friend Norman Noman, then myself. There are many short, light bats. I look for one to use. I find the old black and gray bat that my brother Wally and I used to have as kids: I really like it. Gino may get on base. Norman hits a two-run homerun over the left field fence, down the third baseline. There is a large metal structure in left field that Gino makes a catch by jumping over. He may have caught a fly ball that he hit. There is a large net stretched across the inner outfield, from left to right field. It effectively prevents any homerun balls. I come up to bat and take two balls. I foul one pitch off to the right, then foul one off to the left. I chase bad pitches that are too fast for me with the intention of crushing one for a homerun. I swing and miss, and think it's the second strike, not remembering one of the foul balls. The catcher points out that I struck out. I realize this, and step away from home plate. I feel humbled, like I know I shouldn't be thinking about hitting a homerun, but that is a dream: a fantasy that captivates me."
"1639"	"(03/31/1998)"	"The Frazzled Garage Sale There is a garage sale occurring at home in Oak Valley on the front lawn. I'm in charge of running the sale. I scramble around, getting things setup. I notice two women are having garage sales of their own on the sidewalk in front of our yard. At first I think hostilely towards them, but then realize they were invited to be there by my mom. They may bring more business to our sale."
"1640"	"(03/31/1998)"	"Pizza Hut Play I'm in a play that is about to take place or has just taken place. I'm in a store-like area. I pick out three pairs of pants to buy. They are all size 32x34, but are different colors. A woman tells me the pants are normally $59. I get a 50% discount because I'm in the play. I think that I need to get some new pants anyway. I'm in a Pizza Hut after the play. My mom and the family are there. My sister Heather may be sitting all by herself. We move to a large table."
"1641"	"(03/31/1998)"	"Throat Slitting Slew I'm in a building which seems to be like Carter School. Ice blocks crumble from a neatly stacked pile. People are killing other people, defending themselves from others who are deranged. The stab of a knife has affected these deranged people. To kill a person, people cut the throat and cut the head off the person. People go around killing the affected people. I'm the last of the unaffected people who hasn't been stabbed by the knife. I'm in a parked car that seems to be near the basketball hoops outside Carter School, with two people, one of whom has been stabbed. I'm in the back seat on the passenger side. I reach up and cut the throat of the stabbed, but seemingly okay, person in the front passenger seat. At some point, I kill the other person in the car too. I am in my friend Gino Teavor's back yard in Oak Valley. I imagine the last being: the final all-powerful cause of this affliction. He is not there. I imagine he is there, and that we fight. I spin, and with my back towards him, I ring his neck under my right arm and slit his throat, killing him."
"1642"	"(04/06/1998)"	"Being McGyver There is a sandy island with rock cliffs. There is a secret entrance to the island through the rocks. Three pirate ships are there: they are a distraction. There are some refugee-like people escaping with the aid of an undercover man. I'm with my friend Stephen Ramos and the main character from the television show McGyver. Later, I am the main character of McGyver. There are guns and shooting takes place. I kill five or six people, but not my grade school's secretary, Angie Sacks. Some girls there fake an injury."
"1643"	"(04/07/1998)"	"New Alcohol Tolerance I'm at a keg party in the United States. It is relatively early in the evening. I am ready to drink beer with a friend of mine, to demonstrate my new New South Wales tolerance for alcohol."
"1644"	"(04/08/1998)"	"Choking Jessie Sanders I'm on a pogo stick wading through water, bounding, looking for a moose. I have seen four moose in the last day on this trip/car ride. My dad and friend Reed Maxwell are there. I'm trying to catch an eel. I am then deeper in the water, scuba diving, looking for a big eel to catch. Two divers come up from the bottom and say they saw a huge eel. We're at the surface. I'm mad I missed the eel, but I know it was the bait I was using that attracted it, so I'll just go back down with the bait. Another diver is with me-maybe Reed. I'm trying to catch the big eel on a rubber cord with a bit of food attached to the end of it. I dive back down. The eel eats the food. The eel is my study abroad coordinator Jessie Sanders. I wonder how I will catch her if there is no hook on the cord: if I pull on the cord it will just come out of the eel's mouth. She eats the food, partially swallowing the cord. I grab her body by the waist and hips and spin her around so the cord wraps tightly around her neck. She resists but is weak compared to my strength. I easily wrap the cord around her neck tightly a few times. The cord is like wire. She chokes."
"1645"	"(04/08/1998)"	"Stealing A Donut I'm walking through a shopping mall looking for a waffle house. There are many breakfast food shops. I walk by a bunch of places that are open for business and are well lighted. I enter an area that is darker and deserted, the lights are off. There is a lot of food left sitting out on a table, with plates. It appears that people, including employees, just got up and left. It's late morning/early afternoon. These places must only be open for breakfast or brunch, I think. I see a deserted fancy restaurant, with some donuts left sitting out. I creep over in the dimly lit room and take a donut with red filling. I then creep over towards a piano that is near a wall, out of view from the restaurant entrance, just in case someone comes along. I sit down on a chair next to the piano and start eating the stolen donut. An alarm above my head goes off a few seconds after I sit down. It blares loudly. I get up and run away. I slip and slide, having no good traction. A man sees me running. I realize he knows it is I that is the culprit because I'm running. I try to change his mind by talking to him. I say, ""Excuse me..."" but I slur my speech and am in such a frenzy I can't talk, and I run away. The man runs to alert police about me. At some point I hear a Deep Breakfast song."
"1646"	"(04/08/1998)"	"Seeing Double I wake p in an apartment room with an erection. I start to masturbate. I ejaculate quickly, but have no sensation of orgasm, so I keep masturbating. The semen forms a gooey white ball that I masturbate with. My green wool hat is pulled over my eyes a bit, partially obscuring my view. The room appears to be double, as if one wall is a mirror and there is a large reflection. I notice the door is open about ten inches. I get up and close the door. The hallway outside is dark. I continue to masturbate with the ball of semen. I hear a voice from the next room, which I recognize as my sister Heather. She says, ""Kenneth, what are you doing?"", in such a way that she implies that she suspects or knows that I'm masturbating. This surprises and embarrasses me. I notice the window and shades are open. I get up and close them. Still embarrassed and surprised, I pretend I'm sleep talking, mumbling words out loud. I'm scared of seeing things (in double) that aren't real in the room. I'm frightened and caught off guard by the open door and window."
"1647"	"(04/08/1998)"	"In Neutral I'm in the back of a car with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. My friend Jack Miller and others are in the front. Annie leaves so I can have time with the boys. I don't necessarily want this: I'm enjoying being with her. We drive. The driver is a woman, maybe Annie. The driver revs the engine as we drive, confused as to why the car won't accelerate. I point out that the car is in neutral. We drive past a carnival at Hill Park in Oak Valley. There are people there, but no lights are on, even though the rides are operating."
"1648"	"(04/08/1998)"	"Playing Rugby I'm going out for a Rugby team. I practice with the team at Carter School. We do tackling drills. I dive, trying to tackle people. We do scrum drills. I'm in the middle of the scrum. I'm strong in the scrum, pushing others. I have a good time playing, but decide that I'm not going to keep playing because the season conflicts with deer hunting season, and I would never give up deer hunting. The rest of the team goes to do exercises. I strip down to fluorescent yellow spandex shorts and job around the field while they exercise. My friend Reed Maxwell is there. I would like to shower, but there are none here. Reed is going somewhere else to shower. Someone talks to me about B___, which is a place held in high regard to Buddhists. The person seems to imply I should go to this place. I have a mouthful of a white pasty substance that I spit out onto the ground."
"1649"	"(04/08/1998)"	"Grandparents Old Car I'm at home. We seem to be hosting a party or gathering. Grandma and Grandpa Redding and two of my mom's aunts or uncles arrive in an old-fashioned Model-T-like car. They enter, and we greet them. They have driven all the way from Farmington in the cold in this car! Grandma is unstable: she nearly falls over when I greet and kiss her. I feel guilty because I almost knocked her over."
"1650"	"(04/15/1998)"	"Violent Ejaculation I'm having sex with a person that seems to be my friend Niles Zelling, and is then a woman. I ejaculate violently."
"1651"	"(04/16/1998)"	"Hiking Party A party is being planned. There are decisions to be made, involving the huts on the Backcountry Trail, who to invite, where to have the party, and which path to be involved."
"1652"	"(04/16/1998)"	"Trail Junction I'm on the Backcountry Trail at the junction of three paths. I don't know which way to go. There is a time deadline, and I want to find a solution to this problem."
"1653"	"(04/16/1998)"	"Baby Talk A baby language is spoken by an infant. Adults can't understand the language, but other infants can understand it. There are cases of Mountain Dew on pallets."
"1654"	"(04/16/1998)"	"Mundane Photographs I get a roll of film developed. I pick up the photographs, and am at a post office. The photographs are not great: they are mundane."
"1655"	"(04/16/1998)"	"Three J's I'm in a quad room where my friend Tom Napper is living. He is just moving in. Also living there are people I know named EJ, from Brimson, TJ, from Brimson, and BJ who I know is my grade schoolmate Ben Gordon."
"1656"	"(04/17/1998)"	"On the Verge I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas at home in Oak Valley. We're having sex in the living room. My mom is there and she sees us. She is waiting for me to help her clean the house. Annie and I go in the bathroom. The tub is half full of water. She gives me fellatio and I give her cunnilingus. We have anal sex. I put my fingers in her anus and my fist in her vagina. I feel very close to ejaculating: on the verge, but not quite. We have sex all over the bathroom in many different positions."
"1657"	"(04/19/1998)"	"Fat Fish I'm fly fishing in a stream. Other fishermen are there fishing too. Soon after I arrive a catch a trout. I think it is a decent-sized fish. Some of the other fishermen catch many fish, some of which are large. One man catches a trout that is 20 or 30 pounds: a fat fish!"
"1658"	"(04/19/1998)"	"Shitty Seats I'm at a concert at the Franklin Arena with two people. We go to our seats. The band Portishead is playing. The singer is a man. We're late, and have missed the two opening bands. That doesn't matter because we just wanted to see the main band. We move from the left side near the stage to the far side in the B section. These are our seats, and they're poor, cheap seats. T-shirts are for sale. I don't want to sit in our shitty seats. An usher woman asks us if we're in section B. I try to avoid her, to avoid moving seats."
"1659"	"(04/19/1998)"	"Huge Birds I see some very large birds that look like some kind of eagle. They are black in color, with a white head. Their wingspan is 16 to 18 feet: they are huge! I run to get a camera to take a photograph of them. I have my friend Reed Maxwell's camera, which he is letting me use, and another camera. There are several birds."
"1660"	"(04/19/1998)"	"The Rocky Waterfall I'm in a rocky area with a waterfall with my friends Paul Jones and his roommate Cordero. Cordero talks about places one should see. There are rays of light beaming down. I try to climb up a little rock structure. At the top of the structure is a clock or a calendar that shines. It is a smooth, flat circular structure, somewhat goldish-tannish-brown in color. There is a platform there at the top of the structure where this item is."
"1661"	"(04/20/1998)"	"Racism I'm in a home that I live in talking with a man. It's early morning. One very big, strong man in his mid-twenties comes home from a night of drinking alcohol and partying. He's still drunk; it's around 6:00am. I'm afraid of this ominous drunken man. I try to be as quiet and politely friendly as I can. Other people are moving: both coming home from a night of partying and waking up from sleeping on the floor. An acquaintance of mine named Gordie is there. He lets out a loud yelp as he gets something to eat. There is a family there: a mother, daughter in her early twenties or late teens, a baby boy, and maybe others. They're all dark-skinned. I talk to them, commenting on how cute the baby is. Then I'm not sure it's a boy, but am relieved when I realize that it is. My sister Heather is there and says something to me about the dishwater. I realize I've left the water funning in the sink: I've been washing dishes. I rush back to the sink feeling guilty for wasting all the water. The sinks are nearly drained. I pick up many lids from tin soup-like cans that have been washed and laid out to dry. I collect them and put them all in a tiny soup-like can, squeezing it so that all the lids fit in. I'm back talking with the family. I have cuts on my hands that I think must be from the tin can lids. The cuts bleed or leak a clear liquid. I talk with the daughter. We are and have been at my home in Oak Valley. We talk about racism. There is a scuffle occurring in the street involving the police, sheriff, and a black man. I apologize to her, saying it happens quite a bit. She sarcastically replies that she knows it does. I say no, and try to explain how ""white"" Wilmerton actually is. She asks me about being a hypocrite. I feel put on the spot. I tell her I try to give all the strangers I meet a fair shake. I have an uneasy feeling, as if I'm not telling the truth."
"1662"	"(04/20/1998)"	"In The First Grade I'm talking with my friend Tony Kramer outside of Carter School. He tells me he's failing his classes in college: not doing well. I walk into school in my underwear, which are briefs. I'm beginning to get an erection and am self-conscious about my nearly naked state. I go in to get my green warm up pants. I get them and feel less embarrassed when I'm clothed. I'm in a first grade classroom. I come in late. We have to pick partners. My friend Matt Yams is there, among many others. I'm one of the last people to get a partner. I'm a partner with the short happy woman from the library at the University of Wellington."
"1663"	"(04/20/1998)"	"Will To Control I'm flying. I jump and soar high and far. I want to slow down and stop. It's difficult for me to control my actions. I will myself to stop, thinking that I will stop. I do slow, close to the ground, where I grab a telephone pole to help stabilize me."
"1664"	"(04/21/1998)"	"Sawing The Curtain I'm in a large room with several people, including my friend Kim. Kim holds a chain saw. A white movie screen falls over and the saw cuts through it. Rita Fosters, an acquaintance, is there. There has been some kind of gathering. Others and I are sweeping and cleaning up. I see that a woman has my pocket notebook and is reading it. I confront and physically restrain her, taking my notebook. She is a shorter woman. To me, her having my notebook is completely unacceptable and I feel 100% justified in using force to take it. She says she has my wallet too. I restrain her physically, until I realize my wallet is in my back pocket. Women are mad at me because I used physical force towards this woman. I argue that it was justified. My voice cracks as I talk. My friend Jill Clayton is there. We argue. I yell at her, ""I don't have to do anything, which is where your problem is!"" We yell and argue about the Dean of Students."
"1665"	"(04/21/1998)"	"One Paper Short I'm delivering newspapers in the early morning. I don't know if I'll have enough newspapers to deliver to all the houses. It is the Metropolis newspaper. I try to remember the correct houses: which houses cancelled subscriptions and which started subscriptions. I may be one newspaper short, for Mike Cherry's house."
"1666"	"(04/22/1998)"	"Hiking Mount Lusa I'm on a walking trail like the Backcountry Trail. I see a map, and debate how far we can walk. I think we may be in a position where we won't make it to the end of the trail in time if we don't do several very long days. I see the trail and the huts on the map: around Windy Ridge the trail curves in a big loop. I'm on the trail near a fork that leads to Mount Lusa, which I would kind of like to climb. I walk on the trail with others. We go by a National Park woman that is fixing the trail. We come to the area on the map where there are two huts: an old hut and a new one. I walk across the railroad tracks at Carter School, from the south to the north side by the playground. I'm spray, misted, with water from behind. I walk near the front of the school. I'm hot and sweaty. I see a woman in a minivan that I know. My ex-girlfriend's family suburban is parked there as well, and is dirty. I think of washing it but don't because the woman in the van is there and I feel self-conscious. I walk into the school. There are two stairways going upwards. I want to find a bathroom. My old teacher Helen Hunter is there. She greets me. I smell bad: I'm sweaty. I'm directed upstairs to my day care center. I already know to go there. When I get to the top of the stairs there is a line of kids waiting to see a woman. The kids seem to be sick, or say they are and complain of illness. I know they're not really ill. They have some kind of ""Birds and Bees"" illness. I'm wearing my gray wool socks, a yellow long-sleeved shirt, and my light purple bandana. I put my head under the water faucet and run cold water to cool off my hot skin. I see in the mirror that my bandana partially covers a patch or bandage on my forehead. There is one boy in particular in the line complaining of Birds and Bees illness. He has a patch on his head, covering a sore or bruised area. I am my age. I have a son who calls me his old man. I hear my son talk outside the bathroom. I am being implicated in the boy's wound, and in the Birds and Bees illness of the kids. I'm innocent. I couldn't have punched the boy: if I did his whole face would be a mess! Also, why would I do such a thing? I will need to vindicate myself to those outside the bathroom when I come out of the bathroom."
"1667"	"(04/22/1998)"	"Releasing Fish I am fishing. I have caught five or six small northern pike. I try to release them. Some of them can't be revived. I know they will die and float on the surface of the water. I think this is okay because birds or turtles will eat them: they won't be wasted."
"1668"	"(04/23/1998)"	"Tommy Boy's Party I see a party scene where Tommy, the main character from the movie Tommy Boy, is host. Police come to break up the scene, or just to check things out. Tommy confronts them, tossing them two cups for beer, so they let the party continue. Tommy then jumps in the police vehicle, which is a white truck with a big cargo area, and people pile into it. They drive away leaving the policemen without a vehicle."
"1669"	"(04/24/1998)"	"Fleeing The Matchmaker I'm at an ACDC concert. The band is on stage singing a song entitled ""Burning The House Down"". I'm one of several people that have extension flags: long poles that extend and have orange triangular flags attached to the end. We tap and wave our flags according to the Yankee Doodle song. Then, Julie Nichols, an acquaintance, is the matchmaker. She comes on stage to try to match people up. I know she's going to involve me, and I don't want to be a part of this publicity. I flee out the back. I'm the bass player for the band. I leave even though the band will be without a bass player. I run away in the rain."
"1670"	"(04/24/1998)"	"Cylindrical Spelunking I arrive at a cave to go spelunking with a young woman who is a bit older than I, and a man my age. The woman seems to have experience spelunking. I prepare myself, putting on my boots. I have some indecision about which pair of boots to wear, knowing my feet will get wet. I bring a backpack containing my turquoise sweater, a camera, and some food. The cave is long, deep, and perfectly cylindrical. There seems to be a light at the end of the cave. Two young men emerge from the cave. The cave has been carved by water: a stream or a river that I hear. I ask the woman what kind of rock the cave is made of. She says, ""Whitman"", but she is unsure. I interact with some people near the front of a store there. They give me Zima sandwiches, which are turkey, for free. I'm happy to have free food. I get in the drivers seat of a white truck. It is a stick shift. There is another truck there that is black. My dad is in the truck, but at first I know this person to be someone different. We begin to drive, going a short distance. My dad is in front of us on a golf cart. We're driving by what seems to be Railroad Company softball parks. My dad tips his golf cart, turning while going too fast. We stop. My dad has injured his shoulder in the fall. There is a brace on his shoulder. He may have aggravated a previous injury. He decides not to spelunk with us. He has had 31 hours of sleep in some period of time and decides to rest his shoulder."
"1671"	"(04/24/1998)"	"Ray Jackson's Guns I walk east on 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I think I see my friend Gino Teavor near the Partridge's house. I get closer as I walk by and see it is my high school classmate Emilio Kluck. He is hiding in a cornfield-like area. I don't pursue him. I come to the Jefferson School tennis courts. I meet my friend Stephen Ramos. We hug. I have missed him. We jokingly have fake sex. I am cautious to retain my personal space. My grade schoolmates Ray and Hal Jackson are there. Ray has a red sports car with door that open upwards. The car has only 50,000 miles on it. Ray has some handguns there, for him. I think this is inappropriate: what will he need a gun for? We begin to walk. Ray urinates in front of cars as we walk. This embarrasses me. I'm at a building that is for a Preppy Printers. There are stacks of pallets being moved around. The number of pallets is implied by someone to be the number of kids that a couple has. This number is greater than the number of times the couple has had sex, the person says! I argue that isn't possible. Henry Jackson produces a double-barreled shotgun that is a handgun with a scope! It is high-tech. Others, including Ray, have guns hidden, in cases. I ask why they need all the guns. They reply that their own family has shot them at: relatives! I haul in grocery carts that are sunk completely in mud. It is a cold, cloudy day. The ground is muddy brown. There is a man overseeing work. Henry and the man want to get as many carts stored away in different places as possible, to save space in the main room for a stock of carts. I talk with Ray about my wages, being critical of what I earn. Ray says we're all paid well. While this is true when we were young, it was because we were young: grunt workers. I know Ray and Hal get paid very well by their father, so Ray is biased in his opinion of the wages. I'm working odds and ends, like at Preppy Printers: shit jobs. I move and organize shoes, cleaning up."
"1672"	"(04/27/1998)"	"Martial Law Declared I'm riding in the front seat of a car someone is driving. Bill Clinton is on the radio. He is talking about the state of things in New York. He says or implies that it's not something he wants to do, but as a last resort he declares Martial Law in the country. He may declare this just in New York. It affects me where I am. Martial Law means that, for the time, there are no laws! All the regular laws are suspended. It is, to some degree, a state of crisis. I'm excited and scared by this. There is potential for extensive damage, destruction, and suffering. Clinton recommends that we form civil squads, which I know are groups of civilians that have banded together for protection and other reasons. We pull into a McDonalds parking lot. Three of my Redding family aunts are sitting in the lot. I wave at them. It then seems I'm driving. I look for a place to park. I drive past a parking space, then backup and try to park there. As I do this, another car driven by a woman nears the space. I stick my middle finger up at the woman driving, to rudely let her know not to take my space. It is later. The man I'm with says we should look into getting more burgers for the night since Martial Law has been declared. I'm with my sister Heather and her friend at home. I tell Heather what Martial Law means. She is surprised and shocked. At one point I'm worried for my own safety and the security of my house and room. I'm on the phone with my mom. I'm talking while standing near a large body of water with a high tower or platform area that my brother Wally and my cousin Archie Weber jump off. My mom is then there. It's a bright sunny morning. Martial Law ended this morning at 6:00 or 7:00 am. My mom says that her sister Elaine Grains went to commit suicide this morning, but didn't go through with it. My dad is there, as is a man operating a boat. We all haul items, at one time carrots and fresh vegetables, across water in a slow and careful process. It takes a while because of the outboard motors and the shallow water. Later, the cargo is two baking pans. I'm in a wood shack near the water. It is a bathroom, but doesn't have the features of a bathroom, like a toilet or sink. I look in the rafters of this shack. I'm in a cottage with a group of people cleaning up after guests. There are moldy bagels there. The guests have left a lot of food in the refrigerator. I want to keep it and eat it. I'm in a hair salon. I see my grade school classmate Karen Kipp. I'm in a place where I see a mother and her two daughters eating sub sandwiches from Subway. At some point I seem to be in a donut shop as well. There is a storage room that I am shown, with others, where I try to fit myself with an appropriate length walking cane. There are televisions around the outer room. A group is gathering. Video games are connected to the televisions."
"1673"	"(04/28/1998)"	"Flying To Boston I'm in a small plane with others. We take off from a dirt or grass runway and immediately turn to the 12 or 1 o'clock position, which is a very steep, nearly upside down, turn. We all hang on. We are flying to Boston, which is four hours and twenty ___ minutes away (I forget the exact number of minutes). We get up in the air high and can see the town of Boston in the distance, with all its suburbs. We fly over a suburb that extends to a point on a narrow peninsula. There is one private house on the peninsula surrounded by clear turquoise water. The house is obviously owned by wealthy people. It has a swimming pool and a meticulously kept lush green lawn. This is a place or suburb called Owen, and it is Cape Cod, a very nice, posh place to live. I see gourmet snack food delights laid out along the poolside. It is a beautiful place, with blue water and a clear sky. My housemate Glen Ryan is with me. I'm inside the house flipping through the television channels with the remote control. I see images of cartoon characters on the screen of each channel I change to. I realize at some point that the reason for the flight taking over four hours is because, even though we're close to the city, we're making several stops."
"1674"	"(04/28/1998)"	"A Shaky Flight I'm with my friend Fiona Ulness, a man my age, and a flight instructor. We're going to fly a small plane. We stand behind it and run with it. When we reach a certain point the instructor flips a switch and the cockpit opens. The two people running in front get in the cockpit as the people in the rear continue to run along the back of the plane. When the front two people are in the plane, then the back two get in. The plane then takes off. All this happens over a very short distance, in tight areas where the plane is being steered through trees and buildings. I'm on the front left side of the plane. We begin to run and Fiona hops in. I climb up to get in but have trouble and see an ominous pillar in front of us that is just at my level, stretched across the makeshift runway. I hop up onto the pillar as we get near it, and the plane goes underneath it. The flight instructor looks back and sees me standing atop the pillar. He gives me a look as if I should have hopped down the other side of the pillar and landed in the plane as it came out from underneath the pillar. But, the plane is turned around and we try again. It's later. I'm in a room with the people I flew with. We have won one of the plane races, maybe because others let us win. It was our first race attempt that we won. I'm happy enough with this. I think we should all take a photograph. Everyone is wearing yellow and blue rain jackets. One of the men is cooking a pot roast in a microwave oven, which is actually an oven. There are fixings with the roast. The man seems like Mick from the university caving club."
"1675"	"(04/28/1998)"	"A Titanium Watch I see a swinging pendulum-like object. It is huge, and seems to have a semi-truck at one end. It swings and smashes a ghost-like being into a wall or building. The being is made of a skeleton, but is Jell-O-like, smashed. The pendulum breaks through one building, with the flattened figure of the ghost stuck to its end, and smashes into the next building. The ghost-skeleton is severely beaten. The ghost is then the actress Linda Hamilton. She picks herself up and continues on despite the beating. Her name is Wendilot. She is being chased, a spirit may be trying to kill her. I may be one of the spirits chasing her. The goal of Wendilot would be to make a titanium watch for her uncle, who may be helped or cured after 30 or 40 years of illness. He would be able to cure himself. I'm evading Wendilot, staying hidden around my neighbors the Stein's house, and the front sidewalk at home in Oak Valley. A man with bl___ (?) may be the protected or the protector. I have a brown or blue hat on."
"1676"	"(04/28/1998)"	"Two Straight Flushes I'm sitting outside Super America playing poker with my friend Paul Jones and others. Paul and I each get a straight flush. Twos, threes, and eights are wild. He has the 10, 9, 8, 2, and 6 of hearts. I have the 10, 3, 8, 7, and 2 of spades. We both have the same high card. He notes that he has less wild cards in his hand. I see this, but don't want to lose, and quickly point out that my suit, spades, is higher than his, hearts. He admits this, gives in, and I win the $10 in the pot. I offer him half the money because of our indecision. I wouldn't mind if he accepted this, but he declines. My friend Kevin Simpson is there with a funny brown hat and a jacket: being his goofy self. My friend Nate Nelling shows up and slaps down five or ten dollars on the table. I will give him chips for his money because I've got the chips, but I don't want to get into gambling, and I know Nate is a gambler."
"1677"	"(04/28/1998)"	"Urinating In A Bottle A man has sex with my friend Jane Gracie. My friend Nat Miller and I are there, with others. I go into Nat's bedroom and urinate in a bottle, and then hide the bottle in the other trash. I didn't empty my bladder completely: the bottle wasn't big enough to hold all the urine."
"1678"	"(04/28/1998)"	"A Sexual Tourist Area A man walks in a tourist area where there are numerous whorehouses. People are playing chess in the area. A man talks on a microphone in the area, to the man walking. The speaker is half mocking the man, and half coercing him to do what he wants. The walking man is lower down in a parking ramp area, where he talks with the speaker. The speaker wants the walking man to falsify kissing and sexual acts. To appease the speaker, the walking man pretends to kiss him, but doesn't ever kiss him on the lips. This seems to be to demonstrate a purpose, for the public, to encourage or advertise somehow. There is a young Asian man and a woman there. The man seems to have just awakened, and the woman comments that he didn't put his hands in his pants nearly as much as she thought he would. At one point, the Asian man tells the woman to stop touching/arousing him because he'll get an erection. There is another white couple there."
"1679"	"(04/28/1998)"	"Overbearing I'm in the Big Resort Area. I walk with two people. It's winter. We're south of Eagle Lake and east of Trout Lake. I point out Trout Mountain as we walk: a snow covered peak off to our left. We'll have to walk back to Eagle Lake and then portage to Trout Lake. We walk on an ice and snow covered, plowed, road. On our left is a frozen lake with an ice fishing house on it, as well as other house and huts. We continue to walk north towards Eagle Lake. Cars drive by us on the road. I think this area has really been opened up for use, and I think it's dangerous that the roads are so icy and we're walking against oncoming cars. We continue to walk back towards our group. Our dog is with us. There are many dogs across the road from us. At first I think they may be Timberwolves, but they aren't. We go past several men on snowmobiles. I have a snowmobile then, and I cruise up to the group that is walking towards us. My high school teammate Ron Lind is in the group. He has long hair. I ask my friend Kevin Simpson where to go. We decide to go to Trout Lake. We're all at the public landing at Eagle Lake. It's a beautiful day. Kevin puts a spare key for his truck inside a key holder and places it in my jeans pocket. I think this is a good idea: we'll each have a key then. Kevin's watch says it's 8:30am. My watch says 10:30am. We're heading out with a group of people new to this area: rookies. I'm excited about our trip. I'm very anal retentive about the details of the trip, because I want everything to be perfect. I'm so picky I may detract from people's experience, and my own. I ask my high school classmate Tanya Simmons and another woman where they want to camp tonight: on an island or around here on the shore? They say it makes no difference, but Tanya seems to hint at the shore. I suggest an island because the breeze will keep the bugs away. Our goal is to make it to Trout Lake (on the first day?). I'm really excited about camping on Trout Lake. My friends Tim and Niles Zelling have a big red tent and a red tarp with. One of the women has a big puffy red sleeping bag with no stuff sack or cover for it. I say the one thing that we absolutely need is to stay dry! I make the woman walk down to Fishing Haven and buy some garbage bags. One shore, a man and his son are fishing. The boy, who is three or four, catches a nice smallmouth bass. The bass gets off the hook right near shore, and starts to flop and wriggle back into the water. My brother Wally is knee deep in the water. He grabs the fish as it tries to swim away. They have caught a two-headed fish: the bodies of two fish are connected at the tails. The fish is going to die. I try to revive it. It is a white platypus-like fish at one end and a smallmouth bass or a northern pike at the other end. I can't revive the fish. I think of getting my knife, to cut the tails and save one of the two fish, but they can't be revived. I'm meticulous and anal retentive about all the details and everyone's packing. I want everyone to have a good trip, and am looking out for those who haven't experienced this before. I realize I may be overbearing."
"1680"	"(04/29/1998)"	"Meeting The Vaders I'm with several people. We start to sing songs with American and Australian accents. They sing a song I know. I don't sing along, but it seems like another American person I know does sing along: maybe my friend Niles Zelling. I walk with my friend Stephen Ramos and another man. I'm then crawling on my stomach on the ground. Approaching us is a man, and behind him is an older couple. I get up and walk when we pass them because I would feel embarrassed crawling by the man. I'm near the Uptown Theatre. The old couple is there; I talk with them. The man is wearing an akubra. I ask them, ""Didn't I see you on the way home from Australia?"" The man says yes: they were on the same plane as I. We talk briefly. I ask them how their holiday was. The man offers to take me hunting. I'm happy and surprised, and ask, ""What do you hunt?"" He answers, ""Tobacco."" I'm surprised by this, but will give it a try. I tell him I'll give him a call or stop by later: he only lives down Home Avenue in Oak Valley, just south of 2nd Street. I walk over to the movie theatre. I hold a rolled cigarette in my hand as I walk. I see my brother and his friend Mryle Madden, and greet them. Mryle is terse. He is three or four inches taller than I. He has a drink, but doesn't want to drink tonight, so I get his drink and consume most of his Screwdriver. I give it back to him, saying that the orange juice is sour. He agrees. I see my high school classmate Justin Michaels with a false razor blade cut on his left cheek and artificial blood on his face, in the triangular shape of pork chop side burns. I walk over to the movie ticket line. A woman who is above the line in a balcony-like area or on a roof, yells out to me that I'm going to throw up. I know this is asinine. I had one drink in a few seconds, and I hold a lot more alcohol than that before I get sick. I walk through the line to get up to a group of people I know, because one person waved at me earlier when I was standing next to Wally and Mryle. I carry liquid in a cup or bowl. I'm careful not to spill it. I walk past many familiar faces, including my high school classmate Helen Cullen. I see a person who looks like my childhood friend Helen Vader. I say to her, ""Helen Vader?"" She turns and acknowledges me: it's her. Behind her is her brother, Trevor, whom I haven't seen in many years. We shake hands. He is tall, and has put on weight. He ahs darker brown greasy hair, and glasses. Another woman there shakes my hand, and introduces herself as Helen Burger: a friend of mom's. We all talk. Someone comments about me coming to a movie by myself: they are impressed. I try to think of what movie to see; all the movies look unfamiliar to me. I see the title for a Simpson's movie, and I don't know if it's about the television cartoon family the Simpson's, but I go to it anyway. The movie begins like the television show. Homer Simpson is in the bathtub, and he puts Bart in charge for the day so he can masturbate with a bar of soap while in the tub. It seems to be me in the tub: I see myself there."
"1681"	"(04/29/1998)"	"Overdose Of Mushrooms People are eating hallucinogenic mushrooms. A man takes mushrooms, which are for sale for six dollars each, out of a glass case. He eats for of them at once: all that were in the glass case. This is too much: an overdose. The mushrooms are large, like Fig Newtons. This is too much for one for one person to eat without a groove, without a channel to eat them, which is the exception for the overdose. I'm chewing the mushrooms, and I think I'm chewing them okay: they are being masticated. I may be the man who took the overdose."
"1682"	"(04/29/1998)"	"Sideburn Stealer I'm with my brother Wally and maybe his friend Myrle Madden. We seem to be in the basement at home in Oak Valley. I realize my sideburns have been cut off, and my goatee is gone! Either I have shaved them when I was really drunk and don't remember, or someone else has cut them off without my knowing! I'm upset. I really wanted to have good length, full sideburns, even if trimmed. Whoever cut them off shaved off too much the bottom for me to trim them while still leaving them all along the side of my face. I'm annoyed, sad, and disappointed."
"1683"	"(04/30/1998)"	"Glory Days I'm standing in an area that seems to be like the old Demo Mall. I see a man, who asks me, after recognizing me, where the location is of the team I scored the winning basket against in high school basketball. I ask him, nonchalantly, but definitely to boost my ego, which, of the two games, did he mean. He indicates vaguely, and I point up on the wall, on a large blotch of piece of paper, to Nimen, and also point to where Wilmerton is. I say that was the game in the second round of the playoffs that we beat our cross-town rivals. He indicates he was at the game. I say, ""Oh, glory days..."" He doesn't seem to understand what I mean by that, so I repeat it and explain what I mean, but then he seems to understand, so I stop. I ask him what he does. He says he's an NFL scout. We talk as if he missed an opportunity by not recruiting me when I was in high school. We talk about New York. I walk into a lunchroom area where there are two U-shaped arrangements of tables: one inside the other. I sit down on the inside of the outer U table. There are other men in the room. I have two cans of soda and something to eat. One of the men has a deck of cards, and is playing with it as he eats. Another man farts. I want to bring about a spirit of camaraderie: to have some fun and get to know these guys."
"1684"	"(04/30/1998)"	"Smoking With Gordie I'm smoking a joint of marijuana with the man named Gordie that I met on the Backcountry Trail and others. We seem to be on the Backcountry Trail."
"1685"	"(04/30/1998)"	"Weather In Montana I'm with a group of American students watching a bunch of television screens displaying the weather reports in different parts of the United States. We are in New South Wales. I see it is 91 degrees in Montana, and 95 degrees in New York. Grandma Redding and my mom are there. The news is on these screens. At this point it seems to be one larger screen. As the news ends we see grandpa Redding on the screen in the crowd behind the reporter. The news ends, and grandma goes to grandpa, who is then not in the crowd but there in real life. They hug each other and rub noses. My uncles Nelson and Vev Redding are there. I shake their hands. One of them hugs me from behind. I'm in a mall-like area with another man. Ambulances have come for many people: injured or victims, it seems. There are men who prepare the victims to be taken away by the ambulances. They come up to use and pull our sleeves down, altering our dress, and start to pull down my pants. I tell the man that I'm not hurt, and that if I have to have my pants down to let me take them down, and not to do it right now so I stand with my pants down waiting for the ambulance."
"1686"	"(04/30/1998)"	"Lucidly Pursuing Ray Jackson I'm near a soccer field on which two teams are playing. One of the teams is supposed to be a lot better than the other. That team scores a goal very quickly: minutes after the game has started. There is a young player on the team named Jeff. He is very cocky. I go up to him and call him over to the side; He isn't playing at the time. I warn him that though he is a good player he needs to put a little more effort into his sport: to not slack off, but keep honing his skills or he may suffer the consequences. He leaves the area with his girlfriend. He may be wearing a blue jersey. The announcer comes over the loudspeaker with the scorer and time of the goal. He then says that Jeff has been kicked off the team. I walk up a path away from the field. It's difficult to walk: I go slowly, and limp. I move in slow motion. I walk by an open, fenced in area, on my right; maybe tennis courts. I can see people sitting inside the area, but can't distinguish them. I walk by a group of people on the side of the path. A woman with long blond wavy hair waves at me. I wave back at her without stopping. I pass another, smaller, group, where an identical looking woman with long blond hair says hi to me. I say hi back to her without stopping. I think the blond women may be identical twins; they are very pretty. A strong collie-like dog with orange/gold/brown fur prances around. I call the dog, but it won't strictly follow me. It runs up to a small hill on the path and stops, turning back. When I get up to the hilltop I see that down below is a zoo. Two large black bears are being trained for photographs. The dog was scared, so I go on a different path off to the right. I walk down in an area where trees have been cut and the stumps remain in a field. A house is on my right. I job briskly down this downward sloping path. I'm on a wooden path, and I hop briskly from log to log. The dog goes its own way, up the slope to the right. I walk on and come to a wooded area. I think I see a deer, and slow down, realizing it would be spooked already if it were a deer. I slowly walk and do see deer. I see a four-point buck with a large rack, 12-15 inches high. I also see a six-point buck. The deer seem to be everywhere! I see eight to ten very large deer, at least 180-200 pounds each. They dash away as I approach. I watch. I continue on through the small forest and enter a shack. There are three men in the warm shack, which is adorned with antiques on the walls: very cozy. One of the men says he started work at the shack today, which is a little cafe/supply store. They ask me if I have land around here. I tell them yes, thinking that the Ramos' land is around here, but then I realize I'm in New South Wales. I talk about the deer I just saw, and they say it's a good thing this is a shotgun hunting zone (because the shack is so close). There are many deer around, and since my friends the Ramos' and I are to hunt in a few days, the prospects look good. The working man says he has two kids that are hiding behind the counter because they've never heard a shotgun blast before. I leave. I'm in a very old pickup truck with two men my age, one on each side of me, two older men, and one or two younger kids. We drive. I want to make it to a football game where my housemate Glen Ryan is. I need to find the Dark Green Stadium where the game is being played. I may somehow get there in the truck. The man on my right pinches my thigh/butt. There is not much room in the truck: we're packed in standing. I grab his hand and tell him to stop. He continues to pinch my thigh and butt, and gets the man on my left to pinch my thigh and butt on the left side. I'm fed up with this. I punch the man on my left squarely in the nose with my right fist, and then elbow the man on my right. I yell to be let out of the truck: I'm in the company of mid 1900's rednecks! The driver stops and I get out, grabbing my green and red sweatshirt. The man that was on my right gets out after me. He it tall and strong, with short, neatly combed hair: a homegrown farm boy! We fight. I think that he has the size and strength advantage. I punch him three times in the testicles with my left hand and smash his face into the truck and ground while I hold the back of his head with my right hand. The other man my age gets out of the truck. I punch and beat him as well. I then hurry away from those hillbillies for fear that they may pursue me. The area I walk in is an old 1950's city, but fully functioning. It's being built at the same time. It is cloudy. I walk or jog along a road, hopping over logs, kitchen plates, and armchairs that are lying around because of the construction. A sidewalk is being built. The white cement looks modern in contrast to the old-fashioned town. I get to the football stadium and enter. The bleachers don't go up very high: it's an old stadium, uncovered. As soon as I enter the quarterback of the driving team makes a long pass that goes over the end zone and nearly hits a lady in the head as she walks out the door, about three feet away from me! I walk and look for Glen. The stadium is small and made completely of wood. It looks brown on the inside. Two men approach me, one on each side, and grab me. I am moved into a corner where one of the men stands in front of me. He is wearing gray. The other man takes a photograph of the man and I with a camera that has a large lens on it: very high tech. They seem to do this to somehow get a false identification card because they're younger than I: about 16 years old. I wrap my right arm around the head and neck of the man in front of me and threaten to break his neck if he doesn't leave me alone. Several of their companions show up. One shorter man deems their behavior useless, and slices an identification card in half with another identification card. I continue on. There is not much space in the stadium. People sit on picnic tables. I walk by and see my grade school classmate Ray Jackson sitting at a table. Immediately I recognize that I'm dreaming because Ray is not in New South Wales with me: he's in the United States. I say out loud, ""I'm dreaming"" at the exact same time that Ray looks at me and says, ""You're dreaming"". As I say ""I'm"" he says ""You're"", and our saying ""Dreaming"" coincides. I float or fly backwards, away from the table where Ray is. I will myself to fly towards Ray, and I do. He is then outside. I fly left, passing through a window without breaking it, and fly after him. He flies faster than I: I can't catch up to him. He has honed and practiced his flying skills. I follow him distantly, flying over trees. I fly upwards into white clouds and fog. I can't see anything. I fly in loops, arching my back, like I am a roller coaster. I try to fly back down to the ground. I can't see myself. I may make it down to the ground, but if I do I can't get a clear image of the stadium or the people. I can't seem to stop flying, so I open my eyes (in real life)."
"1687"	"(04/30/1998)"	"The Sketchy Bus Ride I'm riding on a metro bus with others. I don't know where to get off the bus. It's late and night and the driving conditions are extremely poor: it's very foggy outside. The woman driving the bus is wearing an akubra-like hat. She speaks on the radio as she drives, communicating with the bus station base to let them know we're in dangerous conditions, and that they should check in on us if they don't hear from us in a while. We ride over the Dirty River bridge to the Riverside School area. We're returning then, after having gone somewhere. We don't know whether to get off the bus at my dad and Lisa's house. We drive by and see they are there, so we get off the bus. I have a case of returnable beer bottles. We walk up to the house. It seems to be an open area. I say hi to my stepbrother Gary Lawson and his girlfriend after he acknowledges me. When he sees me we greet each other superficially. He doesn't say much. His girlfriend say they're drunk: they were at a party, to which they are now going back with my brother Wally and his friend Mryle Madden. My stepbrother Nan Lawson is there, as is my dad. I open my case of beer, which feels remarkably light, and see it's half empty. The bottles that are in it are old. There are some dented cans with $5 price tags on them and some tiny one-inch tall bottles: A real crappy stock of beer. Everyone is wearing or changing into bathing suits. Mryle is wearing a light blue Speedo. The others have two or three cases of returnable bottles as well."
"1688"	"(04/30/1998)"	"The Contract Man I'm in a flat. I awaken in the morning and see that the midget man from my history class has stayed or is staying for the night. My friend Becky Muldoon and another woman are living there as well. The man has meat sitting out on the counter ready to cook. Becky, the woman, and I are about to cook a breakfast of eggs. I'd like hash browns as well. The midget has ordered light bulbs to be delivered to our place to replace the ones that burned out in the flat. The delivery and bulb costs are our expense. We are all upset at the man because of this. We tell him that we don't need to have all the bulbs in place until our flat inspection on May 14th. We are angry, but try to express our feelings tactfully. The delivery man arrives driving a white truck, which he parks in the alley- I'm at home now in Oak Valley. The delivery man comes in with three light bulbs and the midget pays him $14. We feel angry because we had no choice in the decision-making. Even though the midget paid, somehow, we are paying for this. The delivery man and the midget leave. The midget stays for a bit outside on his motorcycle-like vehicle. I take the bulbs. One is five or six inches in diameter. I hold it from the bulb portion and inadvertently dent it by squeezing it: it is malleable. The filament falls apart, away from the rest of the inside of the bulb. The midget is watching us from his motorbike outside the window. I tell the others that I've broken the large bulb by squeezing it, and I feel stupid for this. They tell me that a hair-thin thread is still connecting the base of the bulb and the filament, and the bulb is still good if I take a piece of cardboard and form it around the filament to protect the side of the bulb from the heat of the filament. I look and see the hair-thin filament. I realize the cardboard would probably burn up. Two other men arrive in the driveway and are talking to the midget. One man has a briefcase and a load of papers under his arm. He is coming to our door to advertise or sell something about fishing, we think. I tell the others I'll talk to him and tell him politely to go away. He comes to the back door. My sister Ramona and my friend Gretchen Warwick each run to the door, tell him rudely to go away, and then run away from the door. I walk out onto the porch to talk to him and tell him we're not interested in what he has. I invite him into the porch because it's cold outside. I ask if he's selling something. He indicates I should come with him, so I do, wearing socks but no shoes. He wants me to come out to his orange camper-like vehicle that has a high roof in the rear, which is parked in our driveway. He tells me he's been living in his vehicle about a month waiting for me. I'm disturbed by this, and ask him what he wants. He starts to explain to me that my parents entered into a contract with him. In this contract they paid him a good deal of money so that I would be taught about computers; to be married to computers. The money that was paid to him was used to buy a computer, which is now at his house being used for storing his information, documents, and files. At first I don't understand and am disturbed by what he is saying. I ask him questions to clarify, and then I understand. I'm very disgusted and angry. We're standing next to the plum tree in the back yard. I say to the man, ""Go back and sit in your car. If I get confirmation of this (from my mom, who isn't here at the moment, I think) I'll come out, apologize for being harsh, shake your hand, and we'll talk. If I find out there is no bond, I'll come out, shake your hand, and ask you to leave."" I think of my choice of words: I'm deliberately polite and concise. I'm very loud, firm, assertive, and aggressive. The man is shorter than I, and he is balding. He's a businessman. I bump him as we talk. As I leave, he says to me, ""Your checks are good. You're pushing me around like a Swan Ball."" He means that I'm strong, firm, decisive, and assertive. Before I go inside I get up close to him and say loudly and threateningly, ""A contract is only legal if both persons are not coerced into signing it."" I head for the back door. There is a group with the man now. I deliberately bump into one of the group, to tell him to leave. I'm in a very belligerent and disgusted mood. I go inside feeling flustered."
"1689"	"(05/01/1998)"	"Do Not Raise Voice I awake in my bed before my alarm goes off. I'm in the larger bedroom upstairs at home in Oak Valley. Becky Muldoon, an acquaintance, is chained to the railing on the stairway. The chain is attached to her neck. She does this by choice. She may be sleeping or trying to sleep. I let out a yell, as I sometimes do in the morning to get going. I get out of bed and put my red John Henry underwear, with a crumpled elastic band, on my shelf. I wrap a towel around myself and walk downstairs. The two monks who teach my Buddhism class, Dhar Thack and Jonah Daruwalla, are at the bottom of the stairs with another monk. Dhar says to me, ""For example, we do not raise the voice: yell."" I realize that I'm disturbing their sleep, and I say, ""I'm sorry."" My brother Wally walks by. I'm in a castle where there is a festival occurring with people selling things. I'm near a stand where a man is making and selling black t-shirts with words written on them in a chalk-like substance. He writes ""1st Sold"" on some of the shirts. My old girlfriend Darla Robertson and several other women walk by. They're all wearing bright orange shorts. Darla asks me if I'm logging again this summer, as a job. I say no. I'm in a class on Buddhism taught by the two monks. Then a woman is teaching the class in the castle-like setting. A woman next to me asks questions about the lecture material. I tell her it's all in the reading. I know that kids have taken over the castle for 50 years. I'm sitting at a picnic table, which is one of several tables in a group. Something is happening, maybe the class. My dad and Lisa burst through the door. My dad is loud, laughing, and is carrying my friend Reed Maxwell's tent, which he gives to a man thinking he is returning it. My dad is fairly out of control: laughing and talking. He says someone in the room must have the farts. At a table that is turned 90 degrees from the one I was sitting at first, I sit with a group of people and play poker. I have four 7's in my hand. I bet ""four-of-a-kind"", which is a very strong bet! There are several cards in the middle of the table face up. Of these cards, two or three are 7's. I have two or three 7's in my hand, and the ace of hearts, so I have five 7's in all."
"1690"	"(05/01/1998)"	"My Newborn Infant I get into the passenger seat of a station wagon that a woman is driving. A woman who may be my wife gets in the car next to me. I hold a tiny newborn baby in my right arm. It is very small! It is clean, soft, pure, beautiful, and unspoiled. I wanted to have my wife hold the baby as I got in the car, and then I would hold it as she got in, just to be extra careful about not dropping the baby. But this didn't happen. We need to drive from the roadside on Home Avenue I Oak Valley, around the corner to our alley. It's not very far, but I don't want to take a chance of harming the baby. We make it around the corner, though the woman is not a good driver: we swerve a lot."
"1691"	"(05/01/1998)"	"Wyatt Belzer to France My high school classmates Wyatt Belzer and Mya Rousing are going to, or have gone, to France. Alister Thomas is going or has gone as well. I'm a robot or an efficient worker. I rollerblade along a busy street and catch up to a teenage boy. A man there, who has a high status, sees me as I rollerblade. He asks me a question about being an efficient worker, and I reply. I seem to have to be near a median in or near a busy road."
"1692"	"(05/01/1998)"	"Sterilization Of Aboriginals I'm with a tribe of Aborigines. I then move to another tribe. At the new tribe sheets are being cleaned, which occurs once in a few years, by hanging them out on a line. The first tribe sends three or four members to the second tribe for talks. All of these members are dressed in bright orange shorts. The chief of the second tribe ignores or rejects the talks. He walks away. He is a huge man: over six feet tall, weighing over 300 pounds. The first tribe then begins the destruction of the second tribe by sterilization, via food and burning/smoke. Some of the plants burned that give off good smoke are also good to eat, including cauliflower. The leader of the second tribe killed his own people after learning they were sterile. I'm in a room with my housemate Glen Ryan. We're talking about horrible killing of the tribe by sterilization. It is pouring rain down very hard outside."
"1693"	"(05/01/1998)"	"Basketball With Michael Jordan I'm in a gymnasium where Australian people are playing basketball. I ask a man about the rules for three-point shots and slam dunks, if there are any. I easily touch the large rim here. My housemate Chase Unter and his friend Luke are playing on a team in an intramural-like league. My team plays soon. Michael Jordan is on my team. I'm very rusty and stiff as I take off my green and black warm-up pants, put on my shoes, and pull up my long socks. Michael comes over to me and kneels down next to me, to psych me up before our game. He says he is ready for me, which I think is encouragement. I say the game will be fun. I think I'll be able to play and well and my skills will allow me to dominate the other team, even though I haven't played in a while. Two acquaintances of mine, Jay and Troy, are there. Jay's bladder has somehow moved up to his neck area. Eh hasn't been able to urinate for days, and relieves himself by vomiting. I tell him that is serious and he could easily die: he should see a doctor now! He and Troy think he'll be okay until he gets back to the United States, and then he'll get it checked out. The other basketball team we're playing includes Randy Zadra. I'm the tallest player on both teams. Michael Jordan is a referee. I take my wad of gum out of my mouth; it has peppermint in it. I get a drink for as long as I can. The game is about to start. I'm really out of shape, but have the mindset that I can beat the other players."
"1694"	"(05/01/1998)"	"Killing A Great White Shark A large great white shark has been killed. It was hooked and then shot in the head. Oil, fat, and blood run out of the shark, turning the water purple. Others and I are not on the boat then, but drag the shark back through the water of a beach area by hand. People are there. The shark will have to be cut up and processed in a wooden shack where we have dragged it. It is big: about 20 feet long."
"1695"	"(05/01/1998)"	"Cross Dressing Clubs I walk and talk with my sister Heather. We split apart in an area where there are several nightclubs. This is a cross-dressing area: there are many transvestites and transsexuals. Heather may go to work. I walk along a road. Many cross-dressers pass me. I'm hauling two bags of garbage. Faintly, I hear the words, ""Sluuu, Sluuu, Sluuu..."" I look and see my friend Stephen Ramos! He and his brother Jose come over. I'm happy to see them. We talk, and may continue on together."
"1696"	"(05/02/1998)"	"Squirrel On My Back I'm in a room with others around. My acquaintance Phil Crusan is sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag. I go over and jump on him, shaking him. I drop raisins or black currants from my left hand onto his face. This agitates him, and though I was joking around, I may have crossed the line. It's raining hard outside. I'm on the porch of the Whitman house, which is different. Items are scattered about, messily. A young couple in their mid to late teens are sitting outside next to a tree. The girl comes over, grabs a piece of paper and a pen from the porch, and goes back. I hear her comment on the messy kitchen and the clean rooms inside the house. She means the porch but calls it the kitchen. A squirrel runs up my leg and onto my back, under my shirts! I'm very anxious and scared about this because the squirrel could bite me. I feel it on my back: it is jittery and nervous. I want to get the squirrel off my back. Other people are there. I take my shirts off. The squirrel may leave."
"1697"	"(05/02/1998)"	"Tom Napper's Sex Tape I am talking with my friend Tom Napper. He tells me that he has had sex with a woman. She videotaped the sex and he has a copy of the videotape, he says. He only kissed her lips once, he says, and then he moved on. I am surprised."
"1698"	"(05/02/1998)"	"Expressing My Sexuality I'm at home talking with my mom. She comes towards me as I handle a condom wrapper or a condom that is like a spool of thread. I don't hide the condom, and by not doing so I expose a part of myself to her. I think: if others can be open about their sexuality, why can't I? My mom is concerned about my supply of lotion. I have two full bottles of lotion, which I never really use, that I show her. There is some fuss over them, maybe regarding their cost."
"1699"	"(05/03/1998)"	"Commando Hanson I'm on a bus with a group of armed soldiers for military purposes. I'm a black man that looks like the character Dillon from the movie Predator. I, the black man, am called Hanson. At times I see this man, and at other times I feel his motion and move as him. I ask the man in front of him (I), who is Hanson, for weapons, because he (I) has (have) none. The man sitting in the seat next to me gives me a grenade launcher with a red laser bead scope and an automatic machine gun that looks like a rifle and has two triggers, about eight inches apart, on the stock. We ride. I drop one of my guns on the floor: it's a bumpy ride. I pick it up and am then more careful with the guns, putting the safety buttons on. We approach a man on our left. He is in a tree with a clay target thrower. He has five bright orange clay targets lined up, one by one, in the thrower. This seems to be the usual: we never do anything about it. But he usually only has one or two targets lined up, not five. This time when we pass a white man sitting a few seats in front of me stands up with an automatic rifle to shoot the targets. He waits until the trajectory of the targets is perpendicular to the length of the bus. At this time, the man in the tree flings five targets at once, and the soldier demolishes the line of targets with his rifle. Immediately we see the man throwing the targets is no longer there: he must be wounded, shit! We stop the bus and look around the area without getting off the bus. We can't see him or his body. This must be some kind of trick, and the man is our enemy. We are a hard-core military unit. We are in dense bush country. A woman is with us driving a small bulldozer. She clears the way for our bus to make the necessary turns. She clears a path through the jungle for our powerful, specially designed bus. We continue on. I'm riding in the bucket of a large yellow bulldozer that seems to be what the unit is then riding in. The bucket is raised high up and tilted so I can sit in it and not be seen. I may be able to help the unit as a spy by keeping a low profile here while the main unit rides below. I have the grenade launcher with me, and a gun below with the group. I accidentally drop the grenade launcher. I want to ask the others to hand me my other gun, but then I would expose my hiding spot. I pull two bananas out from the outside of the bucket, behind me. We approach a more elevated area with a trough-like waterslide in the ground that is slippery and muddy. We may be going by plane now as we approach this land. I use hand motions to direct the position of the vehicle to drop me. I indicate to slow down and get closer to the ground. I land, and am dropped off. I will try to rescue my unit from the spy type person that is a threat to us: he may be an assassin. I slide down the water slide, which turns to metal. It is very curvy, with overhangs in some places where people have hit their heads and seriously injured themselves. This slide may be named ""Spiral"". I slide on a banana, which makes me go faster. I know that I'm not the first person to experience the slide. I also know not very many people have experienced this. As I approach the bottom of the slide I seem to know or be told by a narrator that there will be water. I slide in slowly, trying to slow down so I don't get really wet, into a few inches of water. I'm in a laboratory-like area. There is a coffee lounge and several televisions. A teacher is there. It is an academic/research setting. Hanson says, ""What the hell is going on here?"", because he is expecting to find something more covert and militant. The teacher there has no idea what Hanson is talking about, and goes about his business with a cup of coffee or a snack. On one of the televisions an announcer says that ""Hanson has brought the Lions to only three Super Bowls."""
"1700"	"(05/03/1998)"	"The Church Performance I'm at a church gathering with many people. I'm sitting at a table with a few others. A group of men, including my friend Kevin Simpson, are singing. Everyone laughs at their performance: they are funny."
"1701"	"(05/03/1998)"	"Blue Beanbags I'm at a large gathering where some people speak. Several dumb women speak. They are the stereotypical type airhead blond women. Some of these dumb women get voted out by means of a color match of a blue beanbag and some blue body of water. We write about our suggestions for improvements in the way things are run. I write messily that my suggestion is to incorporate dreams into _____ (I forgot, but it means the way things are run. It may be the lectures). My aunt Sheila Redding seems to be there. A dog, which I may pet, is there."
"1702"	"(05/04/1998)"	"Fourteen Out of A Hundred I get my psychology cognition report back. I watch the woman as she scores it, and she makes comments about my use of the word ""intent"" and ""intent to intent"". She criticizes my writing, saying I say nothing substantial. She hands me back my paper with a score of 14 out of 100 points! I'm extremely surprised, because I thought it was at least a fair piece of writing. I tell her I thought it was pretty good. She tells me to redo it. I tell her I want to get an appointment with her to talk with her about it. Everyone seems to get a low score. A bright Asian man gets only 35 out of 100. My acquaintance Rachel Steiner rides by on a bicycle."
"1703"	"(05/04/1998)"	"Vacuuming My Room I borrow a vacuum from my housemate Chase Unter after he is done vacuuming his bedroom. The vacuum has a huge head that about five feet long. I go to vacuum my room I pick up all the items off the floor in my room and moving my sheets and blankets."
"1704"	"(05/04/1998)"	"Esther Thurman's Braces I'm walking in Armstrong High School. I meet my friend Esther Thurman, unexpectedly. We talk a bit. She is nervous because she has a big test today or tomorrow, like the MCAT. She smiles and I see she has headgear-like braces on. I think they are temporary. People are in the gymnasium next to us."
"1705"	"(05/04/1998)"	"Muzzleloading I'm deer hunting using a muzzleloader. My friends Jose Ramos and the other hunters are all set up in deer stands close to the house at the Ramos' property. They are all north of Jose's stand in the small cornfield. I continue to walk down towards the tire pile. I encounter several deer off to my left, near the pine trees to the east of Jose's stand. I have difficulty getting my gun ready to fire. Several hunters on my left fire at the deer, which then run out into the field in front of me. One of the hunters may hit the deer closest to me. I fire at the deer. It flinches and jolts its body, so I think I've hit it. We all seem to gather a short time later. I say I saw four deer near the pine trees. All of the deer were relatively small, hardly any with antlers: some small does and fawns. I walk with my friend Gretchen Warwick. We go after deer, to a forested area. We go through a flock of sheep that contains several fawns, which I point out to her. We don't shoot at them. We must cross a fence to get to the area, which is a hard climb for her because she's short."
"1706"	"(05/05/1998)"	"Roof Is Rotting I'm at a rock climbing gymnasium with my classmate Doug and others. I tie the rope knot to hold me. I look on the wall for the best place to climb: the easiest with the most holds. My brother Wally arrives. He tells me to go straight up the middle. After looking for the right path, I climb straight up. The holds are thin aluminum-like holds. I make it 2/3 of the way up, where the roof meets the side of my home. I'm climbing on the side of my home in Oak Valley. I stop when I reach the roof, hanging on, putting my butt into the wall. I put my hand and foot in small door-like openings: holds. I don't climb on the roof because it's rotting. I easily tear off a piece of dead rotting wood, soggy and decaying. There are wooden steps running up to the side of the house to an entrance at the level where I am. I climb over and down, onto and over steps, to climb down the other side of them. The steps are rotting wood, with pieces missing. Some steps are decaying with rusty nails protruding from them. I carefully cross over this dangerous staircase to the other side where I'll climb down. I fall 15 or 20 feet into the soft leaves that have collected on the ground. Wally has not kept the rope that is holding me tight. I'm okay. Wally has big puffy green mittens for climbing. Doug let me use his chalk for my sweaty hands. My grade school classmate Kari Otis is there at some point, and says something to Wally or I. Wally has nibs or bullets, which are chicken, and french fries, which are dehydrated."
"1707"	"(05/06/1998)"	"Shotgun Spying I'm in an open field area with another person. Several vehicles pull into the driveway of the property where we are. We look at them and try to discern if they are Japanese. I think of shooting them from a long way off using a rifle with a scope. Inside a residence there is an insane man who talks nonsense. He has several attendants looking after him. He explains his statements, three or four of which seem contradictory. I use large orange or yellow garbage bags to ""parachute"" my way down stairs as I walk. The man, who is a convict, is locked in. Another woman and I lock the basement doors to keep him inside, and then we run upstairs, inside. I kick or slam a door very hard. Something about the convict is frightening. There is a plane outside with two ski-like apparatus' on the bottom, curved upwards. It takes off near the house and spins in circles as it flies close to the ground. It is a very maneuverable plane. It lands and takes off again, going through a wooded area over a tin shed. I hear the engines pick up as it does this. I'm at home in Oak Valley near my neighbors the Stein's driveway looking into a window in our home, which seems to be where our driveway is. I'm with another person. We spy in the dark. I have a shotgun. My uncle Dannie Redding and others inside see us. Dannie indicates this by pointing three of his fingers, since I'm with two people. The three of us split up and run. I go into the old garage door, just while Dannie, who is like my uncle Brian Vincent but is a different relative, comes out. We greet each other, though I was trying to avoid him, to spy. He picks up four wooden stakes and asks me for an onion. I look around, and after unloading the six bullets in my shotgun, point him in the direction of some homegrown onions. I go inside. My aunt Sherry Redding is there. I ask my brother Wally and my mom, who are cooking chicken for dinner, what time dinner will be ready. My mom says it will be done at 5:00 if they started at 4:30, which they did. The chicken is sliced and breaded."
"1708"	"(05/08/1998)"	"Patches Of Facial Hair I see my face in a mirror. I'm trimming my goatee. I trim it so much that it is divided into two parts: one patch on each side of my chin. It looks pretty funny. I don't want to shave off my facial hair completely, so I think I'll leave it the way it is."
"1709"	"(05/08/1998)"	"Joking Is Unstable I'm in a house that may be my friend Kevin Simpson's house. I lay on the floor trying or pretending to sleep. Kevin enters to sleep in his bed. I'm talking with Kevin and my friend Stephen Ramos in the house. I ask Kevin about the Big Resort Area: if he wants to do two trips, one with just us, and maybe cover some new ground on the Woodsville side of the Big Resort Area before the rest of the group comes up. We could meet people there. Stephen is pinching me. This annoys me. I tell him to stop. He doesn't stop at first, and I yell at him loudly and angrily. I tell him that I don't like the pinching: I really don't like it! I'm very assertive, very angry. I say that kind of joking that we used to do is unstable. I leave promptly, feeling disturbed. I walk down towards Pool Park and interact with two young girls."
"1710"	"(05/08/1998)"	"The Stepping Tree My friends Kevin Simpson and Jennifer Valentine are in a place that is like a store. They have felled a tree, which will be used for something. Kevin cuts the branches off and uses them as steps up along the trunk of the tree."
"1711"	"(05/08/1998)"	"A White and Black Snake I'm with my mom, other family members, and people from a different family. I see a snake come out of a rock-like area where a sleeping bag is. I point it out. People are frightened. I grab my camera and run to try to get a photograph of it. It's about 30 feet long, white and black in color, and really thick. I follow it and take a photograph. Several people are carrying the snake, a couple meters apart. I take a photograph of them carrying it. The group I'm with is going to my friend Hank Anderson's grandpa's cabin. We're in Fishville now; my mom has driven this far. It's getting dark. I'm full of energy and want to go. I say I'll drive. Another family is in a vehicle following us. We leave a park-like area after adjusting the loads and the passengers in the vehicles. Initially I have trouble driving: I can't find the brake pedal. I'm not used to driving in the United States. I say it's less than an hour to get there, and I try to remember the exact route to take."
"1712"	"(05/08/1998)"	"Lost In A Casino I'm in hotel/casino. It doesn't seem to be that big, but I'm disoriented. I sit in a spa that is only lukewarm. Many people arrive and I leave shortly thereafter because I don't want to be around them. I wander through rooms. There is a big bathroom, a shower area; maybe several bathrooms. I try to find my way out or in. I'm in the casino portion when I notice my old classmate Bud Slick standing next to me. I say, ""Hi Bud."" Then I notice all the Slicks are there: the whole family puts on disguises like moustaches and clothing. All the members of their family are professional gamblers. I begin to walk away, carrying a pool cue. A man that works at the casino runs after me yelling, ""Settler"". I stop and turn around. He tells me I'm going to have to leave the casino. He is kicking me out because I'm wearing sandals with no socks on my feet. I try to reason with him, pleading for him to give me a break. He is shorter and larger than I: about 5'8"", 230 pounds. He has a light brown/reddish goatee that is tied or bound together right beneath his chin, but which flares out below the binder. The goatee is fuzzy/furry. He notices my goatee, which I may have in a rubber band at the time. This is our common bond. This bond, along with my pleading causes him to say that I can stay in the casino. I walk to a different part of the building. I go up stairs. A woman is there. I'm outside the casino. It's raining. I'm wearing white socks with no sandals. I run in the rain, trying to avoid puddles that would get my socks unnecessarily dirty. I run up to the main entrance of the casino, thinking I'll be able to find the way to where I want to go from there. I'm lost. Cars pull up to the valet."
"1713"	"(05/10/1998)"	"Drunk Annie I'm at home. My friend Kevin Simpson is talking with a woman I know that is our age. They joke and laugh, drawing faces on a board. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is washing dishes. Something seems wrong with her. I go up behind her, grab her waist affectionately, and ask what's wrong. I realize she is really drunk! She has consumed six beers: two before dinner, two at dinner, and two after dinner. I talk with my mom and others about Masters programs: how they take one or two years, I say. I say most people who have focused/concentrated before do two years. I talk about my friend Stephen Ramos' Masters program work. My friend Gretchen Warwick calls Kevin on the telephone. I stir pieces of not-well-cooked, slimy, lamb in a large frying pan."
"1714"	"(05/12/1998)"	"Dream Of Lucidity I have a lucid dream. In the dream I have decision-making ability. I may follow something or someone. I'm at or near Armstrong High School. I practice exercising my volition by going through doors. I discriminate and direct people. Ultimately, I control everything. [This is what I dreamed of; that is, I dreamed that I had a lucid dream. I did not actually have the lucid dream. Rather, I dreamed I had it, and experienced these things. All were experienced within the dream.]"
"1715"	"(05/12/1998)"	"The Persistent Drunk I'm outside Carter School near the south sidewalk by the gymnasium doors at a table with a 750mL bottle of beer. Another man is with me. He may leave. I look for a sytrofoam cup. Inside the gymnasium two acquaintances of mine, Toly and Mads, are playing guitar in a concert-like occasion. There is a party occurring inside. A security guard is near the gymnasium door, and the door to the outside. He's dressed in a blue police uniform with a funky, feathered hat, and has small, official writing on his uniform. I'm sitting at a table with others facing the sliding gymnasium door. A man brings some brownies with marijuana baked into them. They look like rice crispy bars. They are a darker shade, and have a chunk of chocolate or marshmallow on top. He has four of these brownies left. I ask him for one, entreating him half sarcastically and have seriously to let me have one. He seems to intend to eat all four himself. A strange drunk man approaches us from my right. He wants a brownie. We say that the brownies are not good for him, because he doesn't know they have marijuana in. He is persistent and asks why, in his drunkenness. I say to the drunk, ""See these two guys here?"", pointing to my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson, who are on my left side. ""They're my friends. It's their party. So get the fuck out."" The drunk is out of control and isn't respecting other people's space. We fight. I pick him up by his face with both of my hands, as my fingers grip his skull and the inside of his mouth. He drools and spits a lot. I get saliva on me. I carry him outside. He is really intoxicated. I throw him out, despite his persistence. It's a long struggle. He takes quite a beating, but he stays out. I scoop up a couple handfuls of slushy snow off the steps and rub it on my face to wash off his saliva. I walk back inside to a group of people who know I've just thrown this man out. My acquaintance Nicolas, another man, and two friends that I know from Norway whom are wearing large puffy bright yellow jackets are there. Kevin and Stephen cheer me for kicking the stranger out and beating him up. My friend Ellen Sanders is there. I give her a big friendly joking shove."
"1716"	"(05/12/1998)"	"Bitch Snubs Ramona I'm at Brimson near the student union. I see my sister Ramona approaching. She is a first-year student at Brimson. She walks over to me; we're going to talk. She has a photograph of herself: an eight by ten or a ten by twelve, of her in a red sweater when she was younger. We're near the top of the north steps on the west side of the building. A woman is Ramona's first-year class comes out of the student union and starts walking up the steps to go by us. She has long hair that looks like it's dyed black. Ramona says, ""Hi Kari"" to her as she passes. The woman kind of says a snotty hi, but she essentially ignores Ramona. Ramona starts to raise her photo for the woman to see, saying, ""Do you want to see..."" The woman continues walking away, ignoring her. I think this woman is not a very nice person: is conceited. Ramona is being very friendly: making an effort to get to know people. I think if Ramona keeps doing this she'll meet some good people. I'm going to talk to Ramona about financial aid, since I've been through the process."
"1717"	"(05/12/1998)"	"Giving Kevin Advice I'm on the phone with my friend Kevin Simpson while talking with his father Dilbert Simpson in person. I'm trying to appease Dilbert and carry on and understand a conversation with Kevin. I'm in the basement of the Redding farm with Kevin. This may be for privacy. We talk. Kevin is having a difficult time. I say I don't always know where I'm going, but that's okay: it works out. Kevin is stumbling in life. I give him advice. There is a pool table in the basement. Dilbert may come down to the basement at some point."
"1718"	"(05/12/1998)"	"Rampaged Rich House I'm at a house owned by a man that is excessively wealthy. There is a group of people there. The group gets out of control and rampages the house."
"1719"	"(05/13/1998)"	"A Kiss From Ellen I'm at a family gathering at the Redding farm. People get together in a group and take photographs. Grandpa Redding has a black video camera that one holds on both sides, like a steering wheel, and points in the general direction of the subject of the video. There is a toilet or two that are in the open, in the middle of a room. My aunt Sharon Redding urinates here, sitting down on the toilet with her pants barely pulled down enough to urinate and her knees and legs together. I play a video-like game on a computer. I have to put in my username and password on a computer. My password shows up as a black fish, and I have to try a couple times to get it right. Grandpa Redding does this a lot, and says to me that he has not gotten as for on it as I have, or has never done that. People leave in cars. I lag behind, until the last two cars are going. I may go in a car with my brother Wally, my cousin Archie Weber, and uncle Brian Vincent. I feel cool with them because they've always been the jokers, the mischievous bunch at the family gatherings. People are going to church. We arrive at the place for church. It's a park-like area with scattered trees and small covered shelters. Smoke rises from different area, engulfing the gathering places. There is one main pavilion-like plaza where a crowd is. I know this mass is a polka mass. I comment to my mom on how this one or this time things are more spread out. I approach the mass and see that the Brimson College African Music Ensemble is singing and dancing. Their performance slowly draws to a close. I see my friend Ellen Sanders in the crowd, from a distance. She sees me, and smiles or does a little wave. We have not seen each other in such a long time, and are happy to see each other. The crowd begins to disperse. Ellen comes over to me and we share a big hug. She kisses me on the lips and the right cheek. I kiss her forehead. We exchange a few words, a long time waiting, and she begins to walk away. It's kind of a romantic encounter. She may have said something about marriage, and then left abruptly, leaving me wondering. I want to talk with her! I'm in a group with my mom and several young Arabian men. We're sitting in the pavilion on the ground. We talk about my acquaintance Toly. My mom knows him from her stay in Germany a long time ago! We laugh at this irony: that I also know him from my stay in Australia."
"1720"	"(05/13/1998)"	"The Illegal Officer I walk near a hospital parking lot with a woman who vaguely resembles my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I leave my backpack and wallet behind. The wallet is sitting on a desk in the open. There is a security guard/policeman who checks the ID's of two men from Armstrong High School. He then sees my wallet on the desk and casually pulls my driver's license out. I see this as I walk away, and run back to the desk yelling at the man that it is illegal for him to do that. I get back and stand right next to him. I've caught him in the act. I assertively and loudly ask him, ""It is illegal for you to go in my wallet when I'm not here, right?"" He says yes, it's illegal. He says I'm dismissed. I say thanks. I have proven my point: the officer was wrong. I pat his left shoulder with my left hand, put my wallet in my pocket, and walk away. I walk with a woman in the parking lot looking for my dad's old gray car. My high school classmate Brett Ball is there. I'm embarrassed of the car we're looking for. We don't find it. My woman friend opens the back door of a car where people are. I run, to catch someone it seems. I run into the hospital, up stairs, down a hallway to the right, and down stairs. More people are chasing this person: everyone running and converging on him or her. I begin to run down a hall. Out of the left corner of my peripheral vision I catch a glimpse of a figure that has ducked into a room though an open doorway. I double back and go into the room. The person is hiding there. The person is a woman-like man or a man-like woman: androgynous. This person is wearing a hat over short, shaved hair. The person is then a woman, and explains her story of sex: How she seduced a young man to have sex with her ten times, and then moved on. It seems that she and the young man are the same person. I feel, and imagine having sex with this woman. I have an erection, which is bent. Someone receives fellatio. Urine and semen are secreted. I sit on a toilet and defecate pieces of feces."
"1721"	"(05/14/1998)"	"Flying Through A Train I almost have volition. I'm in a plane with my housemate Glen Ryan. We're flying to Sydney. It's night. Breadcrumbs are dropped out each side of the plane to mark the runway. I'm in a train tunnel. I fly over the train tracks, two or three feet above them, hovering. A train or some object passes through my body. I am transparent or translucent. At some point a train comes and I duck to the side of the railroad tracks. It speeds by, emitting sparks. My mom's friend Mike Granson is there, yelling. I may go with an aborigine whom goes into a cave to paint. Something happens with sensual water."
"1722"	"(05/14/1998)"	"Murderer Of Two I'm in a large room playing tag with a group of people. The ghoul, or safety zone, is a wall: one can't be tagged ""it"" if they're touching a wall. I'm tagged. I crawl on the floor, giving people a slow count to ten to run away. A short Asian woman is there. She has chin length curly thick dark hair and is wearing lipstick. She is in distress. There is another taller woman there. The two women are standing in a room about 30 feet apart facing each other. The Asian woman is troubled because she is a woman: because she ""has a vagina"", she tells other women. The taller woman says, ""I have a vagina too..."" but there is an adjective the taller woman uses to describe her vagina that is different from the first woman. This adjective may be 'moister' or 'thinner', both meaning more sexually alluring. My classmate Theresa Jamison jokes that I'm a murderer of two people. The area is dark and seems stage-like. The Asian woman, who I think has been wearing a silver dress, is sleeping on the floor. I have a sword. I kill the woman by cutting the floor around her. The floor is a wooden grate-like vent. I cut the pieces of wood in between the holes of the vent. I kill this woman because her father would kill himself if he found out that she is a woman. She is dressed like a man. Blood from her heart drips onto the floor. Theresa jokes that I'm a killer, and will stab her in her sleep, and she will be too scared to scream. I approach Theresa, who is sleeping on a small blue loveseat. She is covered in blue blankets. I have the sword. I cut her several times, shallowly: about one inch deep. I have trouble manipulating the sword to make deep cuts. She awakens and realizes what she said is true: I'm stabbing her and she is too scared to scream. I inflict deeper wounds, stabbing her in the chest, killing her. Blood spurts on the knife I then have, and on the floor. The knife is 12-18 inches long, but isn't a sword. I move her body so it's back on the couch, fully in the sleeping position under the blankets. I think of concealing the body more by sliding it into the sizeable gap between the back of the couch and the couch cushions, but I don't. I know people will find the bodies in a few days and I want this. I don't want to hide the bodies. I'm conscious of my actions. I notice that a Michael Jackson CD is playing at a barely audible level from a CD player in the corner of the room. I need to shuffle the CD or stop it before I continue on. I walk into the kitchen at the Redding farm. It is dimly lit. It's very early morning. I'm wearing sunglasses. I take them off and can see a bit better then. There are several cats walking on the floor. I put the knife in the sink near the washer and dryer. The music is still playing very softly. I'm a murderer of two, as Theresa joked."
"1723"	"(05/15/1998)"	"The Chocolate Factory Woman I'm in a phone booth about to call the cute brown-haired woman I saw on the chocolate factory tour. I look outside the booth and I see her, her blond-haired friend, and my friend Stephen Ramos. Stephen is a couple with the blond woman. Later, I know he is with woman number 279, which is now number 320. I walk over to them in a friendly manner. They're dressed nicely. The cute brown-haired woman is wearing a short skirt with a matching top and heeled open-faced shoes, all of which seem to be tan/orangish-brown. I notice she has braces. I don't mind this. She's very attractive. The four of us start to walk. I hold the cute woman's hand, then put my arm around her. She's very receptive, and holds my hand and puts her arm around me. I'm surprised at the ease with which we hit it off. She's obviously attracted to me, as I am to her. It's odd walking with my arm around her: not the most comfortable way to walk. But it's all right, and we continue. We're walking in snow then, going north on the west side of Home Avenue in Oak Valley, past my neighbors the Trammell's house. I see the brown station wagon in our driveway and know my mom is home. We get closer to our front steps. There is about three inches of fresh powder snow. I'm barefoot. I open the rear passenger side door of the station wagon, which is parked on Home Avenue facing south on the west side of the road. I climb in and grab my red and gray wool socks for my feet. We're all going to walk to a movie theatre. I ask the girls if they want me to grab them a pair of socks, since they're wearing none. They say no. We walk to the movie. I talk with Stephen about deer hunting. We're in a building about to walk south towards Jose Ramos' deer stand at the Ramos' property. The speed of a bullet must be programmed into a small electronic device on the wall before we start walking. Both of the women have cigarettes: they smoke. This doesn't seem too aversive to me: it seems to be something I could tolerate. I'm a bit past the building out in a pasture with cows. I have two lit cigarettes in my hands. I blow through them, not breathing in any of the smoke. I don't really want to smoke them, but they're not as aversive as I would expect them to be. My acquaintance Gordie is there, smoking. We walk to Jose's deer stand, then back along through the trees and forest. I'm watching a movie of a gunfight in which two men turn and face each other, about to fire. I've seen this movie before. One of the men is shot, but not by his opponent, but by another, miniature, man. He is shot several times. One man is shot in the eye, leaving a large hole there, like in the movie Terminator 2. The cute woman comes over and sits next to me. She is warm. I see a red scar on her belly. I'm happy to be with her: It's been a long time since I've had a sexual encounter. I talk giddily, nonsense. I want to say something because I feel good to be with her. I act goofy and say I'm always cold. We kiss. Immediately I can tell she is a good kisser. I try to kiss well. She sticks her tongue very far inside my mouth. I gag, and feel paralyzed, like I can't open or close my mouth. Her tongue is then her finger. I bite her finger, in what seems like a natural reaction because I couldn't breathe or move. I cut her finger with my teeth, I see, when she pulls it out of my mouth. It is a wide, deep, long cut on the side of her knuckle. I didn't mean to bite her."

"1725"	"(05/15/1998)"	"Underwater Bomb I'm with some men from Brimson. We're all going to get the same, short haircut. The men include my friends Nat Miller, Niles Zelling, Tom Napper, and others. There has been a bomb that has gone off underwater, and a prisoner is trapped underwater. He can't breathe, but he escapes. He gets help from others and I, and is saved."
"1726"	"(05/15/1998)"	"The Gunman There is a man talking on a pay phone. He is a gunman. He talks casually as he blasts a machine gun up the stairs next to the phone, killing people. When he is out of bullets he casually alters his weapon to use shotgun shells, or uses a different weapon. He is poised, cold like steel, calm, and he kills. The government has inundated a beach with dump trucks and soldiers. There is a massive search for a man who is a fugitive. This is a huge search operation to look for just one man."
"1727"	"(05/15/1998)"	"Effect Is A Cause I'm arguing with my psychology professor Jim Arstens about cause and effect. I say that an effect is a cause for the next event. He disagrees with what I say. We try to demonstrate our points of view: we're in a class."
"1728"	"(05/15/1998)"	"Hunting Woman I meet a woman who hunts deer. I ask her where she hunts, and she says near Merton. We talk about the location and narrow it down so that I know she's the woman who hunts across the road from the Ramos' property. I ask her about the Ramos' property, to describe where we hunt. She's not familiar with the trailer house on the property or with the Ramos family."
"1729"	"(05/20/1998)"	"The Line Spewing Motor I'm in the Big Resort Area working near a lake. There is a dock there. A woman comes up to me. She needs a hedge clipper. Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills are gone to town for the day. The sheds are locked up so I can't get the woman what she needs. It's later, Mike and Phoebe arrive back. Mike says that after their baby went to bed at 9am they got some rest. We may be the woman her tool. I'm down on the dock with my friends Jerry Parsons and Tom Olson. It's an overcast, chilly day. Jerry looks cold. I ask him if he wants a shirt. He says yes. I then realize I don't have any extra shirts, and I tell him I'll give him mine when I get done with work. There is a 44-foot whit boat, which Tom, and then Jerry, get in. There is a smaller 12-foot boat with a motor. Mike pulls the smaller boat up on the left side of the dock. He runs the motor to get the fishing line out of it. The motor spits out a long thin strand of line. When it's done, I pick the line up. The curling, slinky-like strand of line is apple peel. There is a stereo on the dock, tilted. I sit and look at tapes there: Led Zeppelin and others."
"1730"	"(05/20/1998)"	"Heather Opens Up I'm back from Australia. I seem to be near the Uptown Mall. I see my uncle Rusty Redding and his kids Melvin, Rich, and Melissa. I go up to them, and give Rusty a hug. I talk to Melvin a little bit. I say hi to Melvin and Melissa, and then Rich, pausing before I say hi to Rich as if I have forgotten to say hi to him. I'm in the large bedroom upstairs at home in Oak Valley. My sister Heather is in the closet. I knock and enter. She is curled up in a sleeping position. I ask if she's okay, and I tell her I want to talk to see how she is. She opens up emotionally: I go in and we talk."
"1731"	"(05/20/1998)"	"The Star Map There's a large black piece of paper on the floor with small dots of dried glue on it. It's a map of the stars. My classmate Phil Crusan is there. He says something about being in some kind of a jam because he didn't see a magazine cover, and something resulted from it. I connect the dots: the stars. I use a pen at first. Then I use a high liter marker, maybe pink. I'm then using paint. I connect the dots according to another piece of paper that already has the lines drawn in. There are three men in a room. Some of them have guns. They attack me because of the way I paint. One may fires his gun and almost hits me. I fight with the two men. I have a .22 rifle, and am out of bullets. They seem to be out of bullets as well. I use a gun as a weapon for hitting. I jab one man in the throat with the butt of the gun. The gun is then a metal bar I use as a hitting weapon. One of the men is hit repeatedly on the head and may get brain damage. His skull is soft and mushy: beat to a pulp."
"1732"	"(05/20/1998)"	"The Electrifying Criminal Oak Valley Bank has been broken into. The bank is inundated with police and investigators. Two men broke in, and are still inside the bank. They're caught and brought out. One man seems to be dead. One of the men is charred black, with some green or white marks on his body, like a costume. He comes alive, electrifyingly! He's somewhat like Spiderman: elusive, cunning, sneaky, but with a spark, a bite, an electric charge. There is a safebreaker there, picking the lock on the vault with a computer, to get a match."
"1733"	"(05/20/1998)"	"Reed's Invasion I awake and notice someone sleeping on my floor. It's my friend Reed Maxwell, I see. I don't know how long he's been there, or if he has seen me urinate in the pot. He says he climbed in through the window. I surprised I didn't wake up when he did this."
"1734"	"(05/20/1998)"	"Lucid Long Family I see my friend Mark Long, who is dead, and realize I'm dreaming within the dream. I am dreaming of having a lucid dream. I spin and roll. I'm disoriented. I will myself to stop, and I stop spinning. A large woman, whom I seem to know as being larger or smaller than the last time I saw, her confronts me. I recognize her as Mark's mother, Murielle Long. One of the Long girls is also there: Tara or Shannon Long. My friend Gino Teavor is there. I may tell him of the Longs."
"1735"	"(05/21/1998)"	"Chickenfeed I'm with my friends Gino Teavor and Patrick Bergman at the Railroad Company softball park in Oak Valley. We're hitting baseballs. Patrick is batting, standing in shallow left field hitting towards the backstop and the first baseline dugout. I only brought two tennis balls and two baseballs, so I walk out along the right field fence line to look for stray baseballs. I find five balls, and put them in my baseball glove to carry back. Patrick is hitting hard line drives. A few vehicles circle around and stop near the park. They are city vehicles: the men have come to tell us not to play on the field. I ask one of them men to see his bill showing the amendment that says we can't play here. He pulls out a sheet with his photograph and a bunch of signatures on it. I ask when it was passed, to see if it is in effect. He says it was passed on fifth. He then says, ""In nine and a half minutes you should all go over to Chickenfeed, if you know what I'm saying."" I understand him to mean that we have ten minutes to leave, of which a half-minute has already elapsed. Also, by going to Chickenfeed, which is a building near the Hill Lodge, we may play at a different place: it will allow us to keep playing. I think of Sundial Park and the Little League Park, trying to figure out what he could mean for a place to play. I don't understand where we could, but he's implying there's a way we can get around the law and play. A person arrives on a tall old white 10-speed bicycle. Another man arrives in a big white 4x4 truck. The two people are my classmates Bud Slick and Kory Reynolds. My classmates Mike Brimms and Jesse Dockens arrive. I tell them meekly that we can't play. I'm afraid of Mike: he's big, strong, and ""cool"", and I don't want to make him angry. Mike has a broken leg or arm, and is on crutches. Another kid is there: a pudgy kid with longer curly light colored hair. A parade of Carter School kids marches into Hill Park for the school picnic. There are three women by a toilet. Someone may take a photograph of them."
"1736"	"(05/21/1998)"	"The Party Pile Up I'm having a party at home in Oak Valley. A carload of drunk kids leave. There is a struggle, like a gang battle, between these kids and another group. Across the street in Thompson's old house is where the battle occurred. One of the groups took a plastic garbage can and put a cannon ball sized smoke bomb in it. The can was then moved from the sidewalk/steps of the house to the middle of the southbound lane of Home Avenue, by one of the gangs. Cars swerve to avoid it, and go off the road. Several cars crash. Soon there is a long pile-up of cars. I'm outside in the front yard. I yell for the people inside to call the police, and I run out to the cars. I see if people are okay. Several people are shaken up. I tell them not to move: the police are on their way. A crowd has gathered to see the half-block long pileup. When the police officers arrive I walk up to talk to them first, since I was an eyewitness. I tell them what happened, and about the gangs fighting. I surreptitiously put the blame on one of the gangs, the gang which wasn't at my house, to exonerate myself from guilt. The police seem to think that searching for the gang is futile. Eventually there may be a reward, and a search for them. I see my aunt Annette Colby in the crowd."
"1737"	"(05/21/1998)"	"Eve Nichols' Kiss I'm at Armstrong High School. My friend Eve Nichols is with her friend Dave. They are standoffish at first, and share and awkward hug, and then a peck of a kiss goodbye. After the ice is broken with that, they fully embrace and kiss. I'm waiting near them, around the athletic doors, for a ride. I walk back to my locker, which is on the end of the junior lockers, near the commons."
"1738"	"(05/22/1998)"	"Wally Slept Next To Annie I'm at Lake Jefferson in Wilmerton playing pool with my brother Wally and others. The pool table is on the north/northeast side of the lake, about where the stream flows in. I see the Thomas family arrive in the distance: Bill, Tamara, Tina, Jessica, and a female I think is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, but then realize she is Tina's friend. Jessica walks up to the pool table. I don't say anything to her, putting on my ""cool"" persona. She talks to Wally mostly, and some to me. She says that Annie and Wally slept next to each other from the 23rd to the 29th. I know that Wally wouldn't double-cross me: he wouldn't do anything sexual with Annie, so I'm not worried about it."
"1739"	"(05/22/1998)"	"Egocentric I'm at home in Oak Valley. At first it seems I'm outside, and then I'm inside. I let three dogs out that seem to have been lounging in my mom's room. One is a small black dog, less than a foot tall. The others are larger. One is a light colored dog, maybe a yellow lab, and the other is black or gray. I open the inside garage door and they run out under the big old yellow swinging garage door. At some point I'm calling them back in. It takes a while for them to come in, but eventually they do. It is winter: cold with crusty dry snow. My mom is gone at the moment. I see my friends Annie Thomas, Nate Nelling, Emily Zates, and another person. They walk down Home Avenue going south, as I look out the front window. I don't want to run after them directly, but I do want to see them, so I plan to run down the alley and intercept them nonchalantly, so it will look like an accident. I put on shoes that are too small for me, and are very tight on my feet, with tight laces. I'm wearing my green wool sweater and I put on my fuzzy green coat. I go out the back door and grab an old cracked and broken red/orange plastic shovel. I do this so it will look like I'm going to do something. My mom pulls in the driveway as I'm about to walk down the alley. She is driving the brown station wagon. I get near the end of the alley and come across a boy whose bicycle is in disrepair. He is about eight to ten years old, and his bicycle is small and brown, BMX-style. I help him fix it. I take the front wheel and fork apart from the frame and see there are three bolts holding it together, going into the fork. Annie, Nate, and Emily walk up to me as I'm helping the boy. One of them comments, ""I should've known that he'd be here..."" I help the boy, starting to screw in three bolts. Nate says, ""So, how was it?"" He means my study abroad in Australia, from which it seems I have now returned. ""It sucked"", I say facetiously, and then crack a smile. I continue, as the others laugh at my sarcasm, ""I'm going to India."" The others catch a glimpse of my captivation by my experiences. Annie is lying on her back to the right of me. She laughs. I say, ""No, really, I am (going to India)."""
"1740"	"(05/22/1998)"	"Party With Dhar I'm in a party like atmosphere. My professor Dhar Thack is there. I have a bat a baseball, and I hit the ball in enclosed space. Dhar is concerned I'll hit him or someone with the ball or bat and cause damage. I say or indicate that I don't think I will. I feel out of place at this party: my mood is not congruent with the moods of others. My friend Gretchen Warwich may be there. I leave. I go into a huge black church-like building and turn on a heater and some lights that pertain to a small area of bunks where I'm now staying. I hear someone approaching and may know it's my friend Nat Miller. I turn off the heater and lights to play a joke on Nat by startling him. He arrives, and is not surprised by me being there. I comment on our accommodations, which are pretty nice."
"1741"	"(05/23/1998)"	"Penis In Pieces I'm masturbating in a bathroom stall. My penis breaks. The top 1/3 of my penis, the tip, falls off. That piece then breaks into two pieces: the tip and another portion. I am horrified! My penis has broken into three parts! I don't know what I'll tell people. I continue to masturbate and ejaculate onto the floor of the stall without the tip of my penis. I see my penis is then whole again, and I am very relieved!"
"1742"	"(05/23/1998)"	"Tooth Crumbles I feel my front teeth touching each other. There is a tension like a strand of yarn is attached to each tooth, stuck on a prickly part of the tooth. I open my mouth, knowing my teeth are fragile. My front, top tooth on the left side cracks and crumbles. It continues to crack until it has completely fallen out of my mouth, in bits. I'm in Australia with a month left to live here. I think about dental work here, since I have a big gaping hole in my smile. I hold the pieces of the tooth in my hand. I know I have been lacking calcium. I think about photographs, and having a toothless grin: how awful it would look."
"1743"	"(05/25/1998)"	"Moose With Calf I'm moving in a vehicle of some sort with another person. We are going past a wooded area. I tell the person to go slower, to look for moose. At the end of the forest we see the backside of a moose! We slow and stop, looking at it. The moose backs out of the brush, and we see it has a calf climbing on it, like a young monkey climbs on its mother. The calf is about _ the size of the cow. I tell the other person to keep our distance from them, because of the calf. We move away, down the road."
"1744"	"(05/25/1998)"	"Goldfish Rain Coat I'm looking at a rack of t-shirts with a man. There are a lot of white shirts with different colored Nike logos on them. The shirts cost $10, which I think is too much. There is a red shirt with Michael Jordan and Spike Lee on it, and a wife beater with a huge amount of space around the collar. The man I'm with, who is a friend, tells me I should get a shirt like this, and he holds up a Goldfish (tiny crackers) shirt that is clear/whitish plastic, like a rain coat. I tell him I've already got one."
"1745"	"(05/25/1998)"	"Convict Web Page There is some sort of problem to solve. I'm with my sister Ramona and my mom. There is a convict web page. I can look at it and find the problem, error, or cover-up. People are tired. Ramona is taking a nap. I may nap too, before I work on the problem."
"1746"	"(05/25/1998)"	"Toilet Paper Aggression I'm in a campground-like area eating lunch with my friend Paul Jones and others. Paul sits down with a bunch of wet, rolled up toilet paper. Some men come over and are made at Paul for taking so much toilet paper. They are belligerent environmentalists, but they don't act like their cause is the environment. I stand up, literally, and talk to these men in a firm but docile manner, to reason with them. I say we're going to burn it anyway, so it will be used as fuel. There are four or five men, bigger and taller than I. One of them argues, but I fail to see his rationale. He repeats himself, and I'm beginning to see his pint, but it's still fuzzy. I ask him, ""So, what you're saying is, in order to not get flies (around our asshole) and to have a cleaner asshole we should not wipe our ass?"" The man doesn't reply directly. I ask again, ""Is that what you're saying or were you being facetious?"" He still doesn't give me a direct reply, so I get cocky and say, ""Do you know what facetious means?"" I'm taunting him, nonchalantly. The men become physically and verbally belligerent and aggressive. I remain calm, docile, and polite, but firm and unwavering: poised. I ask the men to please leave and let us eat our lunch. After the macho men stall a bit, they leave. I begin to pick up some of the scattered bits: the things that have been spilled by their aggression. I feel victorious, but poised and confident: mellow."
"1747"	"(05/25/1998)"	"Shoveling With Wally I'm with my brother Wally in a van he is driving. There is a lot of snow on the ground. Some of the snow is too deep to drive through. We're in the house of an older lady, shoveling snow off the reddish, short fiber carpet, and then shoveling up the carpet itself. One of the shovels is blue metal, which is no good because it cracks and is bent. I grab an orange plastic shovel."
"1748"	"(05/26/1998)"	"Frolicking With A Mermaid I'm fishing with my dad on some sort of a platform. I cast a buzzbait and reel it in. A fish follows it: the dorsal fin cutting through the surface. The fish bites the lure close to the platform, and then dives. It dives hard, and pulls me in the water! I splash in the water, and try to keep the line tight as I tread water. I give the rod to my dad, who is on the platform. I climb back up. He gives the rod to me. The rod has broken down near the handle. I pull the rod up slowly; it is a big fish. A woman in a bikini comes up from the water! She looks a bit like my sister Heather, when Heather was younger, in that she has a full face, but it isn't Heather. I kneel down on the platform edge and kiss the woman. Water gets in our mouths. I get in the water and swim with her. She is a mermaid. The water isn't cold. It seems to be saltwater: a hazy turquoise color. She has one orifice in place of a vagina and anus. We're going to have sex. We frolic all day in the warm saline water. I'm wearing many thick layers of clothes on my upper body: sweaters, sweatshirts, and flannel shirts. My dad is there, or he isn't, but will be back by 5:00. We need to be back by 5:00. We seem to be near the Redding Farm. My step mom Lisa Lawson is there."
"1749"	"(05/26/1998)"	"Horseback Riding I'm going horseback riding. I pick mites or ticks off a horse before getting on it. I forget to put a saddle on the horse. My uncle Dannie Redding may be there. I get someone else's horse, so we switch horses."
"1750"	"(05/26/1998)"	"Rooftops I'm on a rooftop. People there are talking about superheroes, including Spiderman and Magnetic Man. I'm defecating on a toilet that is in the open on this rooftop. My friend Reed Maxwell may be there. Other tall buildings are around, and other people, who may be Asian, are on the different rooftops."
"1751"	"(05/27/1998)"	"Guilty Spillage I'm walking in a parking lot with my friend Theresa Jamison. We walk past a car, on our right, which has fogged-up windows. I see the vague outline of a naked woman bent over, kneeling, and I hear two people having sex, in the car. We walk on, passing tennis courts on our left side. A man and a woman are next to the tennis courts, in the open, having sex. As we pass the courts, there is another man there. The three of them are in a group. The man having sex ejaculates. As we pass the woman yells at us, telling us not to laugh, because she got second place (for acting, I think). I make a comment, humorously, being critical of the woman and her ""acting"" ability. We walk up to a house. There are two women in front of us walking up to the house. One of the women is naked. She is slim and has large breasts: stereotypically attractive. She puts on a pair of underwear. We enter the house, which is a party house. It is early: about 5:00pm. We've arrived very early for the party that is later tonight. Theresa immediately runs to the bathroom. I see if she is okay. She vomited, and makes a comment indicating that she's not going to drink alcohol tonight. The house is messy: things are scattered about the floor. There is a man loafing on the coach, watching television: it's a college house. I'm in a porch-like area of the house. I spill some beer out of a Cascade Tube can. I grab a towel out of a basement-like area and wipe it up. The towel is a big blue-green beach towel. Theresa tells me to just leave it. While I'm wiping the beer up one of the men who lives in the house comes over and helps me. I'm embarrassed for spilling and feel guilty for using a good towel, but he doesn't seem to mind. The top of my beer can is cut in jagged edges. I comment on its being warm as we go down to the basement. An Australian man says, ""Why can't American guys just drink a beer and pick up women: it's their house."", meaning we should be able to do that in our own homes. My acquaintance Eve Nichols is there. She serves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with cheese and spouts on them. I'll take the cheese off mine: yuck! I'm wearing a pair of my cut-off jeans. I have a brownish-red rock in the small pocket within the pocket in my shorts. People really like these stones that I carry in my pockets, which are like jelly beans. Many of the men there have short hair. I comment on their hair, saying it's like mine: I like it, we all have the same hair."
"1752"	"(05/27/1998)"	"The Glass-Cased Drawers There are a number of dresser-like drawers enclosed in a glass structure. People are around it. I see this and may be there. Some drawers can be opened and/or removed, while others can't be. We need something in the drawers. A boy is sent to crawl through the maze-like glass casing surrounding the drawers. It's a tight squeeze for him. He's going to get a small item: maybe a key. He needs to avoid being seen by the teacher, by certain individuals. When the female teacher or others are there, the boy is riding a bicycle. He is naked, but has a shirt and pair of baggy shorts draped over his naked body as he rides the bicycle. The kid jokes sarcastically about making and selling a light blue shower curtain. A woman there says that it's a good idea. He does make shower curtains, and makes money! Later, there is a celebration. Fish is or has been cooked. It burns, and the room is smoky. A man tells me how the fish came to be burned."
"1753"	"(05/27/1998)"	"Egocentric Familiarity I'm at a Brimson basketball practice. The team doesn't look very good. I look down on the courts from the balcony in the gymnasium. There are some taller men, many look familiar, but not really talented. My friend Jimmy Youngman catches an ally-oop and shoots it on the jump: a nice shot that goes in. Others watch with me. Tickets for the Armstrong vs. Rival High school basketball game are on sale now outside the gymnasium. Someone says that with a ticket there are $1 drinks after the game. I decide to go get a ticket because of this, even though I'm already inside the gymnasium. I walk out to the line with my high school classmate Rose Mueller to buy tickets. The line is really long, so I decide not to buy a ticket. I walk into the gymnasium. A team is there wearing white jerseys. I see it is Rival. The teams are about to warm up. I see familiar Rival High School players, including Al Tall, and we acknowledge each other. They see I'm not playing. The gymnasium is mostly empty except for the two teams and coaches. One side has a large section of bleachers; the other has a small, short section of bleachers behind the teams' benches. I walk over near the Armstrong bench. My high school friend Jack Miller is there. I think he must be one of the coaches. I sit down in the small section of bleachers. I'm wearing a thick, heavy jacket and clothes. I talk a bit with the people around me, whom are familiar. I'm in familiar territory. I haven't been in this position in a long time: I've been absent, and I feel uncomfortable because of that. I take off my heavy yellow rain coat and see that it's the same one as a kid with short blond hair sitting right behind me and to my right. The game starts. The teams are dressed in dark colored gold and dark ___ (blue?); their uniforms look thick and heavy. I learn this is the B-squad game. The game is a non-conference game involving two teams that aren't so good, instead of facing tough non-conference opponents like Powerton. I'm standing on a different part of the sidelines on what may be a different court. One team has several really big players. There are two or three slam-dunks, one by a really tall man and another by a shorter but stronger man. It's a fast-paced game. At halftime my friend Nat Miller leaves. I head out to his car with him. My friend Matt Yams has gotten in the game. I cheer for him. He has short hair. Nat and I agree to play basketball at 10:30am tomorrow morning with my acquaintance Kevin Valley and maybe others. I go back inside. I feel like I'm the center of attention when I walk in. The team is wearing red warm up jerseys. Coach Shooter Jackson is wearing one over his suit."
"1754"	"(05/27/1998)"	"Post College Options I am talking with my grade school friend Ray Jackson about how he has alternatives after college. I say that he can avoid work and loans while getting paid. He doesn't believe me, or he thinks it is not a good, practical idea. We talk more. A fat lady comes in the room and sits down. She has talc/powder on her fat. Ray may be there. The lady says she is hungry. I see it's 10:30pm. I think: no wonder she's fat if she eats a lot late at night. They haven't eaten dinner yet. The lady has a bag of strawberry flavored hard candy. She and Ray eat some. I decline to eat any, though she never really offered me any. I know Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills from Fishing Haven are near. They may be in the next room. I hear baby noises faintly, and I think Mike and Phoebe may have had a child."
"1755"	"(05/27/1998)"	"Square Knot Ties I'm walking through a JC Penny or a Sears store. I think of tying my ties in a square knot: a knot that won't kink the tie. I'm looking at buying jeans. I think that when I eventually need to buy jeans I should go to Sears because they're usually cheapest."
"1756"	"(05/27/1998)"	"Interesting Eyebrows My sisters Heather and Ramona and another woman are in a beauty competition together. It's possible that all three could end up in the same competition, on the same day, at the same time, in the same place, etc.... This would be interesting and unique, and for them, maybe monumental. This possibility seems to be a big deal.. They all sit on a couch. Ramona is on the left, Heather in the middle, and the other woman on Heather's right. Family members sit in between each of them. I note their eyebrows. Ramona's eyebrows are connected, and form the shape of a sine wave. Heather's eyebrows are meticulously plucked and arched, very thinly. The third woman's eyebrows are also connected, but they are not smooth like Ramona's: there is a jagged patch of eyebrow above the bridge of her nose. I view them on the couch from about fifty feet away."
"1757"	"(05/27/1998)"	"Dad Embarrassed Of Himself I explain to my mom and my uncle Rusty Redding what happened to my friend Kevin Simpson and his living arrangements. I tell them briefly that he got kicked out and is living in his truck. They seem concerned, so I elaborate: four men moved into the house without signing a lease because Kevin's father didn't have a renter's license because he wanted to evade taxes. Then Jose Ramos left, so Kevin's father Dilbert evicted the rest of them. I portray Dilbert as a greedy, unloving father. My dad is there. He says he is very proud of my siblings and I for the way we act. He says he's embarrassed of his own actions when compared to ours: we are caring, selfless, compassionate, and loving. I hug him, and we cry. I say I love him very much and that he means a lot to my siblings and I. He seems to be feeling belittled when compared with his kids, but we don't think so, and tell him this."
"1758"	"(05/27/1998)"	"Garlic Clove Skin Slice I have a sore on my left hand. I seem to be in a place where a talk is taking place. I open a cupboard without getting up, and take a pin out of the tomato pincushion that is inside the cupboard. I see the pin is thicker, and is plastic. I use it, poking it into the flesh of the sore. A bit of flesh rips away a slice of skin, which seems to be dead and decaying. The piece of skin that tore off looks like a slice of a clove of garlic."
"1759"	"(05/28/1998)"	"Hiking With Paul I'm talking with my friend Paul Jones about bushing to Mount Anne. He says he wants to bring a picnic lunch. I tell him I'm going to bring a stove so we can cook. I say I'm going to bring a lot of gear, thinking of sleeping bags, blankets, and clothes."
"1760"	"(05/28/1998)"	"Meeting An Aborigine I'm in a sparsely forested area with distinct New South Wales vegetation. I'm with another man. I see the trees that the aborigines have used as shelter. Ahead of me in the distance I see the outline of several aboriginal figures watching me from behind trees. An aboriginal man approaches me from behind and on my right. He is completely gray: covered in ash. I feebly try to speak in a way to which he is accustomed: my attempt to use aboriginal jargon. I say, ""G'day mate, 'the native'?"" This is a greeting and inquiry. He understands me and replies, speaking English. Other aborigines come forth. We're camping. Four or five of the men are white, and my age. They have joined the group. I wonder about their background and homes, but I don't think it's right to ask them about it because that would degrade their status as aborigines. One of the young men talks of a septic tank, and others comment on holes for fecal disposal. Another man talks about Chai tea. When he asks, I say there is tea where I come from. There is a large fire; it is dark out. There are several large pieces of wood in the fire, and the coals are red hot. I add more wood on top of these. I dump water out near the sleeping area, and then realize I should have dumped it away from camp. I dumped some on my sleeping mat. I kneel down and, upon opening my sleeping bag, see that there are many ants in it."
"1761"	"(05/28/1998)"	"Cutting Through Yards I'm riding a bicycle on the route that I used to take cutting through yards on the way to school. I don't hold onto the handlebars, but hold onto a different part of the front of the bicycle, like the brake cable. This doesn't work as well for steering. I decide I could steer better if I used the handlebars, so I grasp them. The bicycle is an old 10-speed, with fat tires. I go down the alley behind the ""A"" house on Bauer Avenue. I encounter my dad, who is working in the garage of a house near the ""A"" house. He is repairing a wheel chair over his lunch break and has to go back to the hospital soon to work. As I pull up the front tire and fork go completely wayward, detaching from the frame because of a loosened neck bolt. I talk to my dad to see if he has a 9/16"" wrench handy to tighten it. I tell him I heard he was out fishing. I'm happy and excited about fishing: it's great he could go, and I'm excited to go."
"1762"	"(05/28/1998)"	"The Truck Maker I see a man and his two sons. The man makes semi-trucks in England. He earns a good income from it, and his trucks are good trucks: solid and well built. Some of the trucks carry fuel, are well sealed, and have been shipped overseas while full of cargo. I seem to be moving in a vehicle. I hear that a new site is being made on Seaside Hill. The site may be for camping, but the design is such that there is not enough room to camp. The new site will afford a good view through a thin line of pine trees."
"1763"	"(05/28/1998)"	"Naked Gay Men I'm with another man my age. We're in an alley-like area where there's a large dumpster, black with rust and moisture, cold. The man was in or on the dumpster and has left or lost something in it: a small red or orange item. The area seems to be a protected, industrial area. We walk from it, seemingly leaving the area, maybe when we're not supposed to leave. A siren goes off when we are leaving and we start running. I come to a large house on a small hill. I'm in or near that house or another house. Two naked gay men come out, one of whom may be the father of the man I'm with. The men are about 30-40 years old, six feet tall, and 180-200 pounds: average males, maybe a bit bigger. I'm trying to fly. I'm concerned about not being able to fly and landing hard. I put on knee and shin pads, and am looking for the best suitable spot in the house to jump: out of a window or something. I'm back with the men. There may be another person there. The man my age doesn't seem too fond of his father's behavior. The men turn, and I see them from the front, partially, whereas before I only saw them from behind. One of the men has an erection, which I notice isn't that long. These men are rather stocky."
"1764"	"(05/28/1998)"	"Armstrong's Friendly Reception I'm at Armstrong High School standing in line for a school lunch, in the hamburger/pizza line. When I am next to be served the lunch lady begins to serve people in line after me: she serves several Asian students and then a mentally retarded student. I wait, trying to be patient and pleasant, saying nothing. The lunch lady then serves me a rectangular slice of greasy pizza, with crumbled beef in it. I also get a slice of white bread. I take my yellow tray to the line. I stop to take a blue carton of skim milk from the large white cooler. As I do this I see my grade school classmate Tim Nimen. He is tall, with longer, brown straight hair. He says, ""Hey!..."" I say, ""Hi Tim"", in a very reserved manner, and continue on. My lunch is rather small, I think, but I'll eat it. I walk out to the cashier. There is some chaos near the cashier: several people are there just standing around. The cashier is attending to something else. I stand there a bit. Since there's no one to pay, I think of punching my own lunch ticket. I don't have a token. I turn and face the commons to go eat. Immediately many people surround me, talking to me, and shouting out. They make a big deal that I'm back. I recognize many faces: My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles, a guy named Brice or Brady, and many others. I sit down and others join me. Sonya is on my left. She comments on something to do with her breasts: how she will never do that again, implying changing her breasts. While she says this she lightly pounds her chest, one breast with each fist. I understand her to be saying that she's content with small breasts. She takes the middle of my piece of bread sneakily. When I see this I quickly eat the rest of my lunch, because it's small. I wiggle my front lower right tooth. I think I should drink a few more cartons of chocolate milk, for the calcium. The milk I had with my lunch was chocolate, though it was skim when I took it."
"1765"	"(06/01/1998)"	"Australian Rules Football I'm going to a football game with my family. My mom and my three siblings are there, I think. I talk about Australia with my brother Wally and sister Heather: we disagree about the location of Brisbane and the Tasman Peninsula. We go to the football stadium and I quickly get in line to get tickets for all of us, ahead of the others. When I get up to buy them I ask the man about prices. It costs too much, I don't want to pay. The ticket salesman has contempt for me, and withdraws the tickets from the counter. Then, a scalper comes up and slaps his tickets down, giving them to me! The game has started, and the scalper can't get a good price for them, so he's giving them to me. We all walk to the stands. We have good seats. The game is outside. I soon see it is Australian Rules Football."
"1766"	"(06/01/1998)"	"Bigger Burger For $1.09 I'm just eaten some food from the Greasepit. I hop in my truck. My friend Kevin Simpson is driving. His truck is fixed, and the bumper is on my truck. I'm happy to see him! I ask him if he's hungry: if he wants to eat, and where. I tell him it's my treat: I'll pay. He says the Greasepit! I tell him they've lowered the price of a Bigger Burger from $1.50 back to $1.09, the previous price. I'm on a bicycle at the intersection of Main Street and Last Avenue in Oak Valley near Tom Thumb. A tall blond man is next to me. I swing my arm to hit him in the face with the back of my hand. He catches my hand in his mouth, biting it. I swing my arm away and he is thrown because he is still hanging on, biting my hand. I ride away, thinking I definitely got the better of our confrontation. I ride past Grocery Getto where, from behind, I see my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, walking. I go out to an intersection on Oak Avenue."
"1767"	"(06/01/1998)"	"Basketball Days Are Over I'm at the Highland Pub, but it doesn't look like the actual pub. My acquaintances Eve and Julie Nichols are there. A man is coming to meet one of them, and everyone is excited. We are drinking a shot called a Lemondrop. A shot of lemon-ish liquid is put on the table and one has to suck or lick t off the table and then chase it with a lemon-flavored chaser in a glass with a straw. The man arrives and joins us. The biggest problem, I find, is not doing the shot itself, but having enough wind power to suck it all up off the table. My high school friend Nelson Eastman comes up: he is a waiter and is clearing the table. I'm with a man whom I'm friends with from high school; we both know Nelson and ask for free drinks. Nelson says he could probably help us, and asks how much we want to drink. I say as much as possible. When I say this I notice Nelson's boss has walked up behind him! Our attempt to get free drinks may be foiled. Nelson rolls his eyes as he walks away from his boss. We still may get free drinks if his boss didn't catch the gist of the conversation. I get up and walk around. The pub has quickly become crowded. The people I was sitting with have moved or left and others have taken over the table. I see my high school classmates Donald Dilson and Nathan Plumber. I walk around. A woman walks past me from behind and taps her fingers on my back as she does, indicating she doesn't like it when people do that to her: she thinks I walked past her and tapped her on the back a moment before. In fact, I didn't. It must have been a different man clandestinely hitting on her. I see a blondish woman at a table. I think I hear my name, but when I look she doesn't notice me. She looks a bit like my friend Sarah Reed or Helen Vader. I see my high school teammate Shawn Salzburg and his brother Brent, standing together next to a wall. I go talk to them. Both have long, stringy goatees, like mine, but about four to six inches long. Brent's is especially long. My teammate's father Greg Kulik is there with us. He is standing close, facing me. I jokingly pretend to knee him in the groin. After, I think that isn't the kind of personality I want to be displaying. I talk with the Salzburgs about basketball. Shawn says he's playing for the local youth hostel association. Brent's girlfriend yells at him because he's drinking and has a heart murmur: he could die. He says he's not on the drugs anymore, so he can drink. He is close to me, and I get specks of saliva in my face as he talks. I tell Shawn that my basketball playing days are over. While I talk with them I see a short stone bridge. It rises sharply in an arch over the water to be bridged."
"1768"	"(06/07/1998)"	"Raping A Dead Body I'm in the very back of a hatchback-like car. A large, powerful black figure comes to me and takes me with him. I'm in a place that I later recognize to be the Carter Church basement. There is a being there that is my leader or boss. He is a polar bear, but sometimes seems to be human. There are people/bears in the room. The leader has to elicit a reaction from the others by doing something unusual or abnormal. This may be something secondary or in the second attention. He jumps on tables, which seems to elicit a hostile response from the others. He jumps down, in their midst, and they fight. He has two-inch claws. I help him fight. He is a good fighter: strong and quick, and can fend off several adversaries. I smash one person on the side of the head with a rock or melon. Barbel Inhelder is there. Her head is a melon, though the melon and her head are separate. Whatever happens to the melon happens to her head. I hold the melon. I smash it against a right corner of a metal structure, piercing and splitting the melon, and Barbel's head. She is dying. I kneel down and pull down her pants to rape her. With her last bit of energy she weakly attempts to resist, to pull up her pants. She has no strength, and is almost dead. I turn her torso around to rape her from behind. I think: I'm terrible for doing this."
"1769"	"(06/07/1998)"	"Neighbor's Noise Complaint I'm at home in Oak Valley having a party with my brother Wally. My cousin Archie Weber and friends Stephen Ramos, Barb Flanders, and Jill Banks are there. I say I may not drink much alcohol: I don't feel like drinking. I have a caramel-flavored shot that tastes good. I talk with Stephen. There are between 20 and 40 people here. It's a very relaxed party, with people talking, some outside. It is darker, in the evening. Two phones in the house ring. Wally answers. It is the neighbors calling to complain and threaten us. While he talks I walk out into the yard to have the guests come inside. While I'm doing this, two police officers come and say there are complaints of noise. I go talk to the police. They say the complaints were on public access! One of them asks for a house plan. I'm sober, and confident that we were doing nothing wrong, so I quickly tell him I live here and I'll show him around the house. I show him around, beginning upstairs. He is very terse: rude and belligerent, egotistical. I'm annoyed with the neighbors. Earlier I asked Stephen for a joint of marijuana. He didn't have one. Now I think that it was good he didn't have one, since the police came."
"1770"	"(06/07/1998)"	"Driving To Naliton I'm driving near Naliton and Middleton College. Several Roads are blocked off. We continue to drive north until a road leads east. Going east, we descend a long hill. I feel nauseated. The road turns to a bridge-like structure, a dike a few feet above the water's surface, with bodies of water on both sides of the long, smooth stretch of highway. On the other side of the water is Naliton, which I see to be an old town of dark-colored brick with narrow roads. The road, which is flooded annually, has ""steps"" up, when we get close to the town. Coming the opposite way, several people on bicycles and motorcycles ride down the steps. In town, we're at a small restaurant. An employee cuts up my leftover steak, from my dinner last night, on a piece of white bread, and heats it in the microwave."
"1771"	"(06/07/1998)"	"The Deadly Mini-Gun I'm with another person walking north down the upstairs hallway of Carter School in Oak Valley. I feel that we are being followed, so we turn into the janitor's room to see who, if anyone, is following us. We wait a moment, and then the person I'm with points out to me that there is a gun being pointed at us through a hole in the wall, from where the boy's bathroom is. We are ""caught"", so to speak. Either I or the other person nonchalantly makes a move that seems like it would be of no consequence. However, we are harboring a mini-gun, which is used to shoot the person with the large gun."
"1772"	"(06/07/1998)"	"An Uneasy Friendly Visit I'm at home with the family. My mom's piano student arrives, so we all have to leave. We go to the neighbors, who live kitty-corner to us, to the south of Alvin Broud's house. My sisters Heather and Ramona enter. I lag behind. I'm flossing my teeth. I wait outside the door, not wanting to go in by myself because I will feel uncomfortable. I wait for my brother Wally. He arrives and we enter together. A married couple lives there. They have two sons, who are in their late teens: young men. I have not yet met them: they seem very peaceful and friendly. I track mud on their floor. The woman tells me to wipe my feet next time, but does not say this in a harsh manner. In fact I did wipe my feet this time, but will wipe them again, and better, next time."
"1773"	"(06/07/1998)"	"Biological Mother Anna Gates I learn that my neighbor Anna Gates was the egg donor for one of my mom's children! I think that child was I!"
"1774"	"(06/12/1998)"	"Lucid Crow Cue I'm walking in a university setting that seems to be in Southern Australia. I walk by my classmate Yolanda Ginsburg, who I know is also studying in Australia. It's strange to see her. We say a surprised, ""Hi!"" I walk on. There is a crow. Something is happening to the crow: it is doing something that makes me question my perception. I ask myself if I'm dreaming, and I float upwards, flying. I realize I'm dreaming. I struggle to stay on the ground and concentrate hard to make myself fly down. I seek to have sex with someone. I meet my acquaintance Eve Nichols and we have sex. I lose my lucidity at some point, but regain it later. My friend Paul Jones and his roommate Cordero are there, with others. Paul is fighting someone."
"1775"	"(06/12/1998)"	"Liza Minikel's Evaluation I'm in a class of kindergarten-age kids being taught by my third grade teacher Liza Minikel. I am my current age (21) and size. It is mid-quarter time, and all the kids have evaluations. I got a ""D"" on one aspect of my evaluation. The kids can respond to the evaluations by communicating in pictures. I think of drawing a hand with the middle finger sticking up, flipping off the evaluator, as well of other ways of protesting my low score. I comment on Liza's accent, saying it sounds better than it will seven years from now, which is the time I am from in the future, and I know from having heard her accent then. The kids giggle and comment at this, suggesting that I have sexual intentions. I'm slightly embarrassed, but shake it off, literally and figuratively. I may be drinking a beer."
"1776"	"(06/12/1998)"	"The McDyss Residence I talk to my mom, who says something about my friend Melanie McDyss. I'm excited at first, and I think Melanie will be home in New Zealand when I visit. Then my mom says that Melanie called our house and said she'll be at our house for Thanksgiving and New Year's day: she will not be going home to New Zealand. I'm then in the McDyss home in New Zealand. It's a very large house with many separate rooms for different people and functions. Many tables are set up for a fine dinner. There are several pool tables, both upstairs and downstairs."
"1777"	"(06/16/1998)"	"We've All Changed I'm with a group of people who have just come off a boat. It's a hot sunny day. Our guide says we'll fry out in the hot sun before long. We have come in to wash and eat lunch. Before we eat everyone washes. I lather my entire body with soapsuds. We're on a boating/diving trip, and have come in to rest. I'm at a party that has a similar feeling to the group I was just with. Friends from high school are there. They and I have both changed. My friend Elise Rooks is there. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas walks in, wearing what look like high black leather boots that extend to her upper calf. I see this, having no particular positive or negative reaction, other than to think people change. She comes in and I see she is actually wearing long black fuzzy socks with black sandals that have colorful straps. I think these are from her study abroad in Germany. They seem to be a little more consistent with Annie as I know her, than the boots. She walks by me. I sit on a couch or chair with my elbows on my knees. I don't look up: playing coy. She walks past and touches my left hand and fingers. I say, ""Hey Chief..."" My friend Esther Thurman is sitting across from me. We've not seen each other in a long time. She sees me and starts a conversation with her usual enthusiastic greeting. I'm mellow, and reply. I have a plate of shredded carrots and processed cheese that I eat. I'm fairly comfortable around these people though we've changed. I'm very mellow. I notice the changes in others more so than in myself."
"1778"	"(06/16/1998)"	"A Renewed Armstrong I'm on 2nd Street in Wilmerton between Large Company and Box Company going west. I'm riding a bicycle. My friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos are with me. There is a man on the median waiting for something. He seems to be a teacher from Armstrong High School. I ride and turn right at the intersection of School Avenue. I see a sheriff's car down on the bank of the Armstrong pond. It's rear tires are in the water. There is one officer in the car and another standing up near the road next to a tree. They are trying to catch students who are speeding on their way to school. The sheriff near the road has a radar gun. The car is parked on the bank, low in the water so people won't see it. I ride by on the grass, thinking I'm doing nothing that can get me in trouble. As I get closer to the school the officers stop a speeding vehicle. It is my friend Bubba Hacker on his motorcycle, I see. I arrive at Armstrong and look for my locker. School is about to begin. I feel that this place is very familiar: I am used to it and am comfortable here. I see my friends Mya Rousing and Sarah Reed. They come up and ask me questions about something I have said in the past. I don't to focus on that, or deal with it. I reply tersely that I just call 'em like I see 'em. I can't find my locker. The lockers are a different style and have a different kind of lock on them. They are made up of small drawers. I ask my friend Virginia Green where are lockers are, and she points them out to me. I find a bra and panties in the top drawer of my locker, and as I open the other drawers I see more items, as if the locker is still being used. I see the name ""Julie Newman"" on a notebook in one of the drawers. I know this must have been her old locker. In case she is still using it I set my stuff on the side. [Interesting day residue note in journal.] I walk down towards homeroom. There are many people in the hallway; many teachers. The atmosphere is lively. I know it's the first day of school. I walk through the crowd, recognizing a few teachers. One of my teachers says to me, ""Feels good to be a senior, huh?"" He is a good teacher: a friend. I see Bubba wearing his football jersey and joke with him about his speeding ticket. I walk to the commons area, which has been remodeled. The structure of the building is different. It is essentially a new building. The ceiling of the commons is high, and there is an a la carte lunch line on my left side. It seems to be much classier than the old lunch line. I see my old teammates Nate Nelling, Tony Kramer, and other basketball players. I go up to them in a friendly manner and say hi. They are terse and say hi back unenthusiastically. They are not excited to see me, and I think would probably prefer to not see me because they think I'm strange and am on the wrong track in life. Tony, in particular, thinks this. There is a large cream-colored phone on the table. I pick it up. It is 14-15 inches long. It has earpiece holes, but no mouthpiece to speak into. I say ""Hello, with whom am I speaking?"" I see Bubba on another phone, and know it's him I'm joking around talking to. A woman's voice is on the phone. She says, ""Kenneth?"" I recognize the voice as my acquaintance Eve Nichols. She is working as some sort of a telephone operator. Tony seems to be embarrassed of my joking antics and silliness on the phone."
"1779"	"(06/18/1998)"	"Fall Of The Immense Tree I'm in a partially open forested area high up in elevation. I'm on a walk with a group of Boy Scouts. I walk apart from the group. This is moose territory. We arrive at the huge dead tree we have been walking towards. It's dead but has leaves. It's hundreds of meters tall, at least 40 feet in diameter, and it shoots straight upward: a massive, cylindrical trunk! There are no leaves or branches below about 100 meters, like a eucalypt. I stand at the base of the tree and look up: the tree is immense: absolutely huge! Others in the group and I want to set up some kind of structure or habitat in this huge tree trunk. I see a notch cut around the tree, about a foot deep: just a scratch in a tree this big. We try to figure out how we can get up to the point high up on the trunk to begin our work. It is 90 meters to the base of the foliage. We only have 70 meters of rope. I see the dining room at home, and the metal hooks attached to the wooden ladder-like plant holder. I think if we can tie the rope between the hooks, or from hooks to stretch across the open space, then we'll be able to grapple our way out to the tree, like a tightrope. I see the immense tree bend and sway with the wind. The trunk cracks and falls. Huge triangular chunks of wood pour down like rain. They are about 10 feet tall and just as wide, and weigh tons. I take cover. They are parts of the tree. Two of our group members are at the base of the tree when these fall. I fear that they will be crushed by the immense chunks of wood, and I frantically look for them. The wood chunks are still unstable, and could roll over or shirt, easily crushing a human. I don't find the bodies of the two. I'm in the basement at home in Oak Valley. Fifty-gallon drum-shaped rock boulders drop from above me, all around. I am scared of being crushed and may take a way out, through the pit room. I think this may be a chain reaction: from falling tree chunks to boulders. In the basement I though the danger was gone, but it continued, and rocks fell near the base of the steps."
"1780"	"(06/18/1998)"	"Full House At Casino I'm in water. I see a picture of a ferry ship. Something is unique about it. Others are with me, including my brother Wally and friend Paul Jones. There are some mattress/floatation devices. Wally craftily manages to stay on top of his mattress when it flips over. There is a wharf on one side of us, and a reddish building on the other side where the picture of the ship is. I walk into a casino with other people. There is a table where one person is playing blackjack. He is someone we know, and gets paid off well. Others and I join. I try to sit at the first hand at the right end of the table, but my acquaintance Bill Vanderbil is playing there, he is just absent from his seat right now. I move over to a spot in the middle of the table. The game is poker. I get two pairs: aces and kings. I draw one card and get a king, for a full house! My acquaintance Geoff Hamilton is the dealer. I'm surprised to get paid eight-to-one for the full house. Geoff draws a few cards. I see the draws three 4's, and that he has a four in his hand, for four 4's, which beats me! I'm a bit confused, because this has been divided into two hands, and though he has four 4's, I'm still going to get paid for my full house, because they occur on different hands."
"1781"	"(06/18/1998)"	"Autofellatio 14 I'm in my room at home in Oak Valley. My classmate Megan Hughes is there, and leaves through the door. As she does, she sees I am masturbating and comments that I'm always masturbating. She goes out, leaving the door about a foot open. I'm sitting on a bed with my pants down to my knees. My sister Ramona comes in. She stays for a bit. I try not to look like I'm masturbating, which is hard when my pants are down. Finally I say to her, ""Ramona, will you give me a minute?"", to indicate that I want to finish masturbating. She leaves. I'm giving myself fellatio. I manage to crouch over far enough to suck the tip of my penis, then get it a bit farther into my mouth. I suck for a while; it is mildly pleasurable. I notice my erection has shrunken. It is like a balloon that is stretched out but wrinkly and deflated. There is much loose, plastic-like skin and my penis is thin and rubbery: flaccid like a rolled out piece of play dough. I try to re-establish an erection, to inflate my penis, but it is to no avail."
"1782"	"(06/18/1998)"	"Uncomfortable With Virginia I'm out at night at a pub. I win two pints, two beers, and a six-pack, but am not given the six-pack. My friends Stephen Ramos, Virginia Green, Virginia's sister, and my sister Ramona are there. Virginia comes up to me when I first see her, and says something about how she always was attracted to me in high school. I'm uncomfortable and don't know now to reply. The night continues. In the morning I awaken at a place with many people, all of whom have stayed overnight. Some of the people are going to Herman or Johnsonville. I notice the faces of several people from the university in Melbourne. I see my acquaintances Wendy, Joe, and Amanda from the Backcountry Trail. That morning I'm walking with Stephen. We seem to be leaving. I ask him if Virginia was really there last night, or if it was a dream, because it left me feeling uneasy. He laughs and says it was real. I think, then, of another situation that I was in, and wonder if it was a dream. But I don't ask Stephen because I'm not sure it was."
"1783"	"(06/18/1998)"	"Glancing At Prancing Women I am lying on my stomach on a couch. Scantily clad women walk by me and expose their breasts. It is a provocative action: a kind of joking and teasing. I laugh and act like I am not paying attention as I try to catch nonchalant glances at their breasts."
"1784"	"(06/18/1998)"	"The Empty Store I walk up to a small store with a much junk in it: small trinkets and colorful odds and ends line the walkway to the store. Inside, the store is white, and there is a late middle-aged woman working there. She is large, but not fat. The store rarely gets business, and has no customers in it now. I may look at the freezer case, which contains Popsicles and other things. I think of having sex with the woman. A late middle-aged man comes in and begins to talk with the woman. I'm a bit annoyed by this because I thought it would be good to have sex with the woman. (Apparently, I didn't think the woman would mind this.)"
"1785"	"(06/18/1998)"	"A Friendly Jock Reunion I walk into a building where baseball is being played. It seems to be a practice because there is a batting cage around the batter. There are, however, teams there, and people timing pitch speed and selling concessions. I see my high school teammates Simon Naver and Binky Ahmed, who are participating in the game in some way. Binky may have the radar gun. I shake their hands and we talk. I haven't seen them in a while. My old coach Shooter Jackson is there. I see him and we talk. His face is covered in bits of toilet tissue: he has really cut himself badly when shaving. Then the bits of tissue are gone. I ask him how this year's team is doing. He says pretty shitty. I ask if they are young, and he says yes, telling me about several sophomores and juniors."
"1786"	"(06/20/1998)"	"Meeting Person I'm catching chickens. I wander through several large rooms with corridors between them. There seems to be an underwater feeling to the rooms. I go into a room where two familiar women are peeling shrimp, as a job. They ask me if I want one. I ask them if it's okay, and they say any of us can eat all we want. I think this is like the chocolate factory I visited. I ask if the shrimp are cooked, and the woman says yes. So I peel a shrimp and eat it. I'm on a plane flying over a city. It's dusk. I look out to my left where the chicken barns would be. The barns are smaller: about the size of a city plot of land for a house, and are close together, connected. There is water, a bay or a river, that the city is built along. I lay down on the left wing of the plane (from the point of view of being in the plane facing forwards). I'm out at the tip of the wing, and I hold on to the edge. We fly over the city. It's dark and the city lights shine beautifully. The plane begins to turn and I feel unstable in my position on the wing. An arm reaches up and touches me on the left side of my head. I'm wearing my green wool hat. I realize that I've been lying down on the person whose arm touched me. I see she is fair skinned and has thick straight shoulder length blond hair. She reminds me a bit of my friend Emily Zates. She doesn't mind that I'm laying on her. She is lying on her stomach too. She indicates for me to hold on as the plane turns, and I do. The plane soars to the right, coming in fast for a landing. It gets close to the ground, and slows, and it seems the plane will be thrust forward and upwards, but it lands, unexpectedly to me. A red station wagon-like car is in place of the front wheels of the plane. There are several inches of fresh snow on the runway. The woman and I are low to the ground and let go of the plane when we can do so safely: without being in danger of being hit or run over by the plane. I feel peaceful, happy, adventurous, and free. An old couple is then driving the car that was the landing gear. The woman introduces herself as ""Person"". I think this may be spelled Pearson or Person, but is pronounced like the noun 'person'. I introduce myself as ""Kenneth"". I'm very happy to meet her. She is a very attractive person in many ways. We walk where the snow is deeper to get back to the airport terminal from the runway. She has bare feet. I'm wearing sandals with no socks. My feet are warm. A white car drives along side of us. Three young men in it ridicule us for no apparent reason. Person runs up to the car and hops in the sliding door on its left side. I follow and jump on. This surprises the guys inside. One of them says his name is Gabe. He tells me he's going to the airport to pick up (my friend) Gretchen Warwick. I tell him matter-of-factly that I know Gretchen: we were on a study-abroad program together. I introduce myself to him. The airport is a large open area. We wait. Some of the guys ask about my green hat. I tell them it's wool, and it's warm. Gabe asks me to drive my acquaintance Bill Vanderbil home because Bill and Gretchen don't get along in the car. I'm nervous about driving, but then he just asks me to hold the keys, which is fine with me. My friend Jennifer Valentine is there. She talks to me, saying, ""I can't believe you laid on her and didn't know she was there!..."" I see Person , who is with the woman that came to the airport to get her. She is standing a few hundred feet away from me, about to leave the airport area. We make eye contact and wave at each other: there is a mutual attraction to each other, not necessarily physical, though that may be present. I'm attracted to her person: who she is. Though she is far away, I hear her voice. She is describing what I look like so that she can point me out to the person I am with. I'm wearing my baggy 8th grade Union Bay jeans and the green wool hat. I have on my turquoise chamois cotton shirt with some shirts underneath it. I unbutton my turquoise shirt so person has some description of me to relate to her friend. As I do this I hear her saying, ""He's unbuttoning his shirt..."", identifying me."
"1787"	"(06/20/1998)"	"Lucid Coverton Cat I'm with my mom and others. We're all getting dressed and prepared for dinner. We're having a taco festival. We're at the Redding farm. One man there makes me mad: he backs up into me. One man steals my moustache and acts like he won't return it. I talk to my mom as if she is new here, a visitor. I tell her this is how unpeaceful it is here: harsh language, conflict, hatred, anger, which all occurs in silence. I walk out the porch door. To my left I see Seaside Hill. The base is visible but the peak is in clouds. I realize I'm dreaming because Seaside Hill is not near the Redding farm. I fly around the farmyard, slowly and low to the ground. I see the black and white cat that roamed the neighborhood of my flat in Coverton, and often visited the flat. I land and call the cat over to me. It doesn't come at first. I try to use my will power to make it come over to me. It comes closer, and is about ten feet away. I don't force it to come any closer: I try to respect the cat's wishes. I sit there a while with the cat nearby. I think about the cat: what it's doing, what, and who it is. I tell the cat that I'll see it again."
"1788"	"(06/20/1998)"	"Lucid Slide On Meat Blood A slick camera is filming an NBA game from close-up. A backboard is broken. Dennis Rodman is on the court. An orangutan is on the court, or I see one. It or someone makes fun of Rodman. I'm on the court playing. The court is made of finished white pine. It is very slippery. My shoes are slick, hard plastic or rubber. I spit on the soles to give them traction. My legs are stiff and sore: I'm rusty and very stiff. The ball is passed in. A teammate and I nearly turn it over, almost passing it out of bounds, but we save it. The other team fails to get back on defense and we get a two-on-one fast break. I'm one of the two, and I go in for the lay-up. I'm fouled. After the foul, as I fall, I grab the player who fouled me and drag him down with me. The referee calls an intentional foul on me. I know I'm guilty of this. I think it was my rustiness that made me commit the foul. I should have just realized I couldn't get away with it, and should have taken the foul and got the free throws. I am replaced in the game. Somehow, I get a shot, a lay-up that is an ally-oop, and is very out of control. It misses narrowly. Then I'm replaced. I walk off the court. I grab a tray of ground beef like one would buy at the grocery store, and dump it over the head of the other coach. I realize I'm in a dream. I fly, low to the court. I slide on my stomach on the court. The court is white plastic with meat blood on it, like a tray from the grocery store without the meat on it. I remember to look for the black and white cat from the Coverton neighborhood."
"1789"	"(06/22/1998)"	"Global Changes I see that the sun and moon are rising and setting on the same side of the horizon. The sun is rising in the west. I think this could produce major, cataclysmic, global changes."
"1790"	"(06/22/1998)"	"The Real Coming Home I'm arriving home from Australia. I'm walking down 2nd Street in Oak Valley, going west on the south side of the road. I'm in between Home and Next Avenues. I see my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona ahead. I'm very happy to see them! I slip on the ice, but am not hurt. I get back up quickly so they'll see I'm ok. I try to fly to make sure that what I'm experiencing is real, to make sure it's the real coming home. I can't fly, and conclude this must be real. We meet near the intersection of Home Avenue and 2nd Street. I hug Ramona, and maybe Heather. Then I hug my mom for a long time and cry. I am very happy to see her: it has been so long since we've seen each other! It's a very emotional moment."
"1791"	"(06/22/1998)"	"The Frozen Lake I'm driving with my mom and my sister Ramona. We go up a steep hill, but the new car makes it. It is winter. There is a frozen lake. The land is dry and frosted: crunchy. I comment about going on the lake: I wouldn't go there without a truck. Later, we're in a pub-like place. Some fish are mounted in the place."
"1792"	"(06/23/1998)"	"Rock Talk I'm in a snowy area near a large rock. I'm with some familiar and some unfamiliar people. We're talking about skiing, rock climbing: specific holds when climbing, shallow holds and deep holds when climbing on icy rock."
"1793"	"(06/23/1998)"	"Four To A Cabin I'm in a pub in Oak Valley where the McDonalds used to be on the southwest corner of Home Avenue and Main Street. I have a bicycle in the pub. I walk the bicycle down steep stairs. Really wild shots are served at the club for getting people really drunk. I'm going to a cabin, which may be my friend Kevin Simpson's father's cabin, which holds four people. I choose my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and her friend Elise Rooks to go with us. I tell them about it plainly."
"1794"	"(06/23/1998)"	"Hovering Down A Path I'm traveling on a road. I pass a baseball park where the Oak Valley team is playing; they are in the field. They are losing. The batter hits a stand up double. There is a cross-country race taking place. My friend Reed Maxwell is in it, as well as my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper and others. I float along this road, hovering three to five feet above it, going past people. I cheer for Armstrong High School. I get past the large group of people and am in the New South Wales bush, in an area with CCA duck boarding. I wait for my mom, my sister Ramona, and our neighbor Anna Gates. When they arrive I hug them and kiss Anna on the cheek, which is somewhat uncomfortable. I dive off the duck boarding and fly over the side about 30 feet. My friend Kevin Simpson is coming and I want to see him."
"1795"	"(06/24/1998)"	"The Four Pillars I'm in a stadium-like place or temple. There are four upside-down pillars. The stadium works in one specific way. We are trying to figure it out. There are four chair bottoms, with wheels on them, turned upside down at the top of four metal poles. It's as if when the temple is flipped over it will roll on the chair bottoms. The four pillars are in a square arrangement, with an entrance of some sort between two of them. Bill Cosby is around the temple. We are to rub the pillars for help, maybe while being beaten up. Something happens with gang-related violence, and instructions for being beaten up. One is to go by a pillar and yell out loud to get someone in specific to see you. I feel as though I'm in a wok, spinning around the edges of the inside. Something happens with my Van Diemen's Land class examination. There is an average score of about 12, which gives a total of 72 (I think there are six people there). My classmate Fiona Ulness is there. We spin or are whirled around in a circular formation. There are four of something, or four parts. We're above a large stadium in Los Angeles in a ferris wheel-like structure. I sit in a bowl-shaped metal structure four feet wide and several feet deep. We're moving in a circular motion. I'm very afraid of the height we're at. I think I may have to jump out of the bowl when I get near the upper deck of the stadium: jumping and landing on the seats, which would be frightening."
"1796"	"(06/24/1998)"	"Camp At Mud Mountain I'm walking on the Mud Mountain track with my friend Reed Maxwell. I pass my brother Wally and two men. We're walking out as they are walking in. It's 4:30pm. I tell them it's a two-hour walk to the hut. I advise them that they have to go over the hill, across the plains, and then down to the hut. I tell them to get out their flashlights at 5:00pm. Reed and I come to a camping area where a group of people are staying and camping. Reed wants to stay. I agree, although I'd rather just walk out. One of the men camping there tells us he has extra food and lays it out for us. A big wood fire is being built. I talk off my wet clothes and get my sleeping pad out. The man says something about stove fuel: either he does or does not have any extra. We're going to sleep in a tent with part of the group because they have a bit of extra space. I'm annoyed with Reed because he makes it seem, by what he says, that we're really ill equipped. This embarrasses me. We are not ill equipped. One of the men camping there has a daughter who speaks some German. She is eight-ten years old. I realize I left some of my clothes in my other suitcase and have only one sleeping bag. A man sings and plays guitar. He has a good, soft, gentle voice. He sings, ""Come to me, baby, come to me."" Another man and woman sing along. I see the seven sister stars in the sky. Two kids are there and sing along as well."
"1797"	"(06/24/1998)"	"Racist Retaliation I go into a fourth grade classroom with other students. It's the end of the day, maybe the last day of school. We wait around in a line near the door. There is a Chinese kid names James in front of me in line. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper makes fun of this kid, saying he has bugs in his hair. I walk over to Jerry, who is near the wall with the heater vents. My grade school classmates Eric Stoner and Tim Nimen are there. I grab Jerry's hair on the top of his head. None of his body is visible: only the portion of hair that I pull up on can be seen. The hair is where a heater vent would be, coming out of the vent. His head is effectively the top of the vent. I threaten to hurt Jerry for his racist comments. I quarrel with Eric and Tim. I go back in line. James thanks me for what I did, saying I didn't have to. I tell him to forget it. What I don't say, but now realize, is that I was not acting on behalf of James in particular, but was reacting against the instigators because the principle they were supporting, racism, is unfair. Tim is wearing full football pads and gear. He runs by us brushing our clothing to scare, intimidate, and provoke us. I'm poised, and don't flinch as he does this. Eric, my classmate Patrick Bergman, and others gang up on me. I'm slightly afraid, but don't let it show. I'm mostly afraid of Tim. There is a fight about respect. My high school teacher Jim Richardson, the teacher of the class, is in the hall outside the door. He does nothing."

"1799"	"(06/26/1998)"	"Manicured Track I'm on a walk to Mud Mountain. We're going to do a side trip to Davern's Tavern, but will start from Lake Vera. We walk around the ridge, looking up on the ridge to see approximately where the cave is. I'm with my friend Reed Maxwell. We're in a fairly flat, gravely area with a stream running through it. My friend Sarah Reed and her friend ride up on bicycles. We stand around in this flat area. It's a bright sunny day. I'm wearing my green wool hat with a white t-shirt tucked in the hat, falling down over the back of my neck and shoulders. I'm wearing cheap large black sunglasses that block out all the sun. I have a camera that I hold out in front of me, pointing it at myself to take a photograph. Sarah is behind me and will be in the photograph. When I'm about to take it she pushes me forward. I lunge forward while trying to take the photograph. We're about to walk up towards the cave. I see my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer and one of his friends riding on bicycles up towards the cave. They get off their bicycles because it's too rough and steep to ride, and they carry them up. We get over to the base of the ridge. Sarah says we have to go past ten poles. There are steps leading up and around the ridge with poles marking the side of the track. The steps are wide, wooden, and completely enclosed. We get a bit up on the track and there is a view of Mud Mountain with Oak and Maple trees in the foreground. Their leaves are changing color and the green grass is neatly mowed. I take a photograph. The landscape is cartoon-esquely surreal. At the top of the stairs is a shop/tourist place that is mostly empty. It's made of stained and varnished hardwood. There is a cafeteria-like area. My roommate Glen Ryan uses the toilet there. I think he must be defecating because in the bush that is the only time one uses the toilet."
"1800"	"(06/29/1998)"	"My Irreversible Guilt I'm on a busy with my green suitcase. I have killed my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and my friend Persia Miko. In my suitcase is Annie's body, cut up. I also beheaded Persia's body, which is under my bead. I talk to some people. They talk about where Annie is: where she will turn up, because she is missing. I go along with their talk, saying I don't know, but knowing full well that I've killed her. I get off the bus and walk towards a house where I live, which I don't recognize. It seems to be kind of a dump: maybe a trailer home. As I walk towards it I realize I've done something terrible for which there is no remedy. I'm guilty of a heinous crime. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt, despair, and hopelessness. Even if I somehow tried to rid myself of Persia's body, the fact that there is no head would reveal my guilt. I realize that one bad action ruins all the good actions I've done. I don't know what to do. I know someone will find out what I've done. I walk into the house and someone I know or live with tells me there is an animal or something scary in my room. I go in my room. Loudly, I scare a small colorful snake out from under my bed. I'm afraid of it, thinking it is poisonous. I pick it up, grabbing it behind the head, so it won't bite me. It is on the floor. I stomp on it repeatedly to kill it."
"1801"	"(06/29/1998)"	"Snuggling With Annie I am with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We are snuggling and kissing. It seems that we are headed towards having sex, like we always do when we are together. She seems a bit hesitant and resistant about this, but it seems like she is teasing or joking in her resistance."
"1802"	"(06/29/1998)"	"Nice Breasts I see my friend Persia Miko, who at first seems to be my grade school classmate Rita Bauer. I notice her breasts. They are very beautiful: round and plump, not huge but good-sized. She is wearing a white t-shirt and I see her uplifting bra through it. The bra has prints on it."
"1803"	"(07/02/1998)"	"Exam Anxiety I'm riding a bicycle that is difficult to pedal. I'm going somewhere to meet my friends Matt Yams, Binky Ahmed, and Sarah Reed. Matt has cut his hair short, like in his third grade photograph. I'm talking the Wilderness and Natural Area Management final exam. I have to answer ten short answer questions and one of three essay questions. For the essay question there are five cards. I get the ace of spades, and a 10, 4, 5, and 8 of different suits. I'm doing terrible on the exam: failing. My desk and test papers are cluttered and unorganized. The papers fall and scatter about. I grab them as they float down to the floor. I have only 50 minutes left to answer two essay questions, and I'm not done with the short answer questions yet. I'm extremely anxious. Some of the questions are about Darryl Strawberry, as one aspect of sports in Wilderness and Natural Area Management. Many of the other questions have nothing to do with the exam material. I take breaks from the exam to get refreshments even though I'm doing poorly and am pressed for time. I discover that my classmate Kevin Valley has torn up my exam paper! I panic, and go yelling for my professors Hal Banner and Larry Karstens concerning my plight, while I have a mouthful of cake. I know I will fail, but I do want credit for what I did have written. [ An interesting note: I had this dream after my exam was over, and I did all right.]"
"1804"	"(07/02/1998)"	"Nate Loses His License I am with my friend Nate Nelling. He asks me, ""Did you hear what happened to (our old teammate) Kecker?"", insinuating that Olie Kecker is in the some kind of trouble. I tell him that I have heard what happened (but now I don't remember what that is). Nate tells me that he has lost his drivers license."
"1805"	"(07/02/1998)"	"Stealing Combs' Trout I'm with a man I'm friends with. We go to my friend Tiny Combs' house. It is night. We're going to steal a 19-pound brown trout. It helps to salt the fishing line and the lure. The Combs parents awake and we flee. We get in my mom's station wagon and quickly drive away. We're then near Pool Park in Wilmerton. It's 11:00pm. I want to visit my friend Kevin Simpson, who lives near the park, because I haven't seen him in a long time."
"1806"	"(07/02/1998)"	"Melanie's New Love My friend Melanie McDyss shows up at my house (not my real home) to visit. We haven't seen each other in a long time. We talk and joke. I'm lying on the floor and she is sitting on my chest. She spreads her legs and sits with her crotch facing my head. This is uncomfortable for me because I interpret it as sexual but know that she has no sexual intent by this, and is just comfortable sitting like that: she is trusting of me not to abuse, alter, or threaten our friendship. I ask her about her life. She tells me about a relationship with a man named Luis. She says she is in love with him. At 8:01pm she jokes that I've never asked her to stay over later than 8:00pm. I'm then cooking and eating broccoli with spaghetti sauce. We continue to talk. I joke that I try to keep a three to five day schedule in keeping in contact with her, while she seems to keep a five to seven day schedule in keeping touch with me. I say, ""I always try to get you, get in touch with you every three to five days."" Instantly I recognize the parapraxis, but continue talking, nonchalantly joking as if it didn't occur. She doesn't let on that she recognized it, which is characteristic of her, regardless of if she actually recognized it, which I think she did. She explains that by coming over to see me tonight she was consciously breaking out of the five to seven day schedule. Earlier, we talked about her and Luis going to Luis' paternal grandmother's funeral. Luis is Catholic."
"1807"	"(07/03/1998)"	"A New Apartment I walk into an apartment-like building as if I'm staying at a hostel. I walk upstairs to my room, which is at the top of a staircase that turns frequently and seems to get narrower as it climbs higher. I enter my room, number two, and see that it overlooks the center of a city, several stories up. I look into an adjacent room to see what's there. I unexpectedly disturb a woman that is sleeping. She then gets up. She has short blond hair. She talks to a man named Andre who also lives in our place. I know this is the Andre whom I know from the University of Wellington. I realize I'm moved in with Andre and Megan. I go into a different room where I awaken my flat mate Bittie Marton, who is napping. She rolls over, and I see she is wearing a lot of makeup, like she is going out. I notice the bright red lipstick she's wearing. I leave after asking her if I interrupted a REM period, which I did. I have a positive feeling of being in a new place that I find mildly pleasing, and have some old comforts. I'm happy to be living with Andre and Megan."
"1808"	"(07/04/1998)"	"The Target Pit There is a large cylindrical pit in the ground filled sparsely with bits of wood. There is a kind of contest occurring. At the bottom of the pit is a target. Each person makes a dot on a small paper target with concentric circles that I have. They then sign their name by their dot. I put a dot right in the middle. My old classmate Gino Teavor puts his dot near the second concentric circle near the center. I think that this is just like him, to put his dot so close to the center: he has always been fairly egocentric. My grade school friends Jerry Kasper, Eric Stoner, and Kory Reynolds also make dots and sign them. I'm playing cards with my brother Wally and my flat mate Bittie Marton. They talk about my venting my anger, saying either that I do or must, or that I don't very much. I get very mad and express my anger towards Wally. I'm belligerent and try to physically push him around. My friend Mark Long (who in real life is dead) is there. I have him write his new address in my address book. He now lives in Blooming Grove. I had crossed out the old address when he committed suicide."
"1809"	"(07/04/1998)"	"Greeting The Dreamers I'm boarding a plane, but I think I forgot something so I run back to get it. I see my friends Ellen Sanders and Bill Hanson, whom I have not seen in a very long time. I'm very happy to see them! We hug, and Bill lifts me up in the air. I have to hurry back to the plane. There is a glider plane and a plane with a motor. A group of students are on the planes. We have to get up enough speed to take off. The larger plane is going to pull the glider. Students I know ride in one or both of the planes."
"1810"	"(07/05/1998)"	"The Demanding Sergeant There is some type of battle of conflict. More and more people are on my side, increasingly. I am trigger-happy: nervous and agitated. I fire my gun without discretion at some people, for which I am criticized. A mad sergeant-type man comes up to me and demands that I give him my gun. He threatens me. I don't give it to him. Instead I shoot him several times in the chest. It seems to be make-believe shooting: lines of orange-yellow pellets come out of the gun. He is not dead or injured. He chases me with a knife. We fight. I hit him with my gun. At one point I think I should just let him kill me because I will not die. He didn't die when I shot him, so I'll be fine."
"1811"	"(07/05/1998)"	"Beth McDyss Smoking I see my friend's younger sister Beth McDyss smoking a cigarette. I didn't think she smoked; I thought this was taboo."
"1812"	"(07/08/1998)"	"Respectable Prostitution I'm with Ben and Jill Gallon. Later it seems I'm with Jill and Grandma Redding. There is talk and jokes about sexual things. There is a sexual act occurring nearby. I'm tempted to get involved in it. I get an erection, outside a small shed, by myself. My next move would then be to confront the older women about fellatio and their denture-less mouths, or to go wherever this sexual act is occurring. Something happens with my flipping over two empty glasses, upside down. They're like the glasses Rob McDyss has given me to pour my beer into. I'm in a house where people have sex for money. It's more respectable than prostitution, which it is not. One can have sex anywhere on the body, within limits. People are employed to have sex and to allow others to have sex with them. I have sex with a large man. He is big and strong: hefty. He has dark skin and hair, like a traditional Maori. I think he's from the pacific islands. I don't know how it begins. I find him kneeling or bending over in front of me. My erection fumbles around, and then penetrates his anus, which feels tight and pleasurable. While we're having sex I ask what the instructions for orgasm are. They are: one is to stand up when they are about to orgasm and put their hands in the air (like they are being held up!). I do this, but not when I'm about to ejaculate: it's a trial experience for me. I leave before ejaculation. The man says something about the position of my hands above or below something, and how that alters the procedure for orgasm. When I stand up I'm naked, but am wearing my navy green t-shirt. I leave feeling guilty that I used these people because I didn't orgasm: I wasted their time. I walk into a kitchen where my friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos are. They're both naked, wearing towels around their waists. Both have erections. I walk up to them in my shirt, with an erection. This is a type of camaraderie: male bonding. There is nothing sexual about it, it seems."
"1813"	"(07/08/1998)"	"My Rotting Teeth I'm examining my teeth, which are obscured by my gums. There are many rotten bits on my teeth. My teeth are in very poor condition. I seem to be in some sort of a rush to go somewhere. Grandpa Redding is there. My grade school classmate Ray Jackson may be there."
"1814"	"(07/10/1998)"	"Dreams Within Dreams I'm on a metro bus in Oak Valley. We're doing part of the loop around Home Avenue, Main Street, and 3rd Street, Last Avenue, and 2nd Street. I have my luggage with me, and am going home. I realize that I don't remember the flights to Los Angeles and to Metropolis. I can't remember traveling to get back home, even though I'm about to arrive. I ask several young boys on the bus where we are and how long we've been driving. They don't seem to know. I touch my surroundings to see if they are real: there are considerable inconsistencies that cause me to question my state of consciousness. I do not detect anything physically unusual. At one point I think I point at a car to see the energy in it, as Don Juan taught Carlos Castaneda, but I see nothing usual about the car. I'm with my brother Wally and another man. I seem to be sleeping and dreaming, and then awake, drifting between sleep and wakefulness. I am on the verge of lucidity, and I try not to wake up; I try to maintain my lucidity in the dream (the dream within this dream). I test the reality of the situation by biting something and pounding/punching the floor to see if my hand/arm goes through. The floor is hard, and I conclude I'm not dreaming. I try to will my arm to go through the floor, moving it slowly, steadily, and firmly, but I can't pass it through the floor. I then awaken and find myself with the two men, who are laughing at me. I've been biting onto the toe of one of their shoes and pounding the floor with my fist. I think that those actions are incompatible with the atonia of REM, but I think that my body twitches in REM somehow caused this action or was the action. I'm outside on the front lawn at home in Oak Valley on the north side of the steps near the light. I try to write down the dream of the pounding and biting on the grass using a pen. I don't write the dream down completely, or clearly. It's hard to write on grass and rock/concrete. There is a group of women around, including my high school classmate Marybeth Neumann and others. They talk about dreams. I experience a dream [within this dream I'm now writing] in which there is a question of reality and dreaming: A dream within a dream within a dream."
"1815"	"(07/10/1998)"	"Unfamiliar Annie Thomas I have some sort of interaction with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I'm walking, and see her walking the opposite direction. We both look different, and are different people than we knew each other to be the last time we met. We stare at each other as we pass, and slow down, stopping in front of each other. It's been a long time and we're unfamiliar with each other. I'm very interested in talking with her and hearing about her life now. I hope, and I think, that she is equally interested in learning about the changes in me. We begin to talk. She seems to be standing in a house or on the steps. An old man comes and harshly confronts her and I, but it seems mostly directed towards her because she is in his house. We leave. She has short hair, above shoulder length. I have a goatee."
"1816"	"(07/17/1998)"	"The Hectic Jet I'm on an airplane with people who are familiar. We fly over New Zealand. The takeoff is shaky. I'm not sure the runway will be long enough: it barely is. The plane flies very close to the ground, right over and past many snow-capped peaks. The flight is risky and fast: a bit scary, but also exciting. The plane lands abruptly, turning as it does. The runway is narrow and curves. I'm afraid the wings may hit trees or other objects as we land and slow on the runway. The stewardess is going to make lunch, cooking a ham and a chocolate cake, during a short stop that we have. I take, and eat, a ham sandwich. The stewardess tells me that because I stole the sandwich I have to go without lunch. I lie, and tell her it was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I made myself, and she then says it's okay that I have lunch. I get off the plane with my former flat mate Glen Ryan. We wait near a swing set for the stewardess to cook the ham and cake. The plane takes off and lands two or three times, low and fast. I look for the perfect cone shape of Mount Jutness, but don't see it."
"1817"	"(07/20/1998)"	"Aborting Karen Hamilton's Fetus My brother Wally's girlfriend Karen Hamilton is pregnant with twins. Wally is the father, but this seems to make little difference. Karen is talking with my mom about abortion: if she should have one, how to do so, and if it's too late. One way is to wrap a rug around her, she says, cutting off support for the fetuses. I'm eating a small plate of noodle-like food. I bite a noodle with my front teeth and then realize I've just bitten the umbilical cord to Karen's fetuses. I don't know if I should tell Karen or conceal this. I feel bad. I'm not sure if she'll be happy the baby was aborted, or mad and sad."
"1818"	"(07/21/1998)"	"Grunt Job At Arby's I have a job at Arby's restaurant. I am a peon, doing grunt work. I pour corn and a berry fruit mixture from a boiling kettle to a smaller container. I wear an apron so it won't splash on me. I use several hot pads so I don't get burned. The owner and an assistant manager stand near me. We pour the pot of food. We move bags, newspapers, and sleeping bags from near the bottom of the staircase. I ask about time cards. There is no need to punch in, the assistant manager says, because hours are written by hand. It is a mindless job. At the beginning I find myself going into the building and getting the job, being very assertive and aggressive. I guess they must have hired me because I find myself working there."
"1819"	"(07/22/1998)"	"Chasing The Cheese I'm on an airplane that doesn't have a ""big plane"" feel. I'm with a woman and man, both my age or younger. We're then in a very modern building with fancy cars in it. The man and I are following the woman. It's as if she's going to teach us something. She seems to be a unique person, almost a prodigy in some way. The woman says her family of three (parents and she) has four cars. We're in a subtle, nonchalant race-like situation, to beat others. The race is to get the strongest, most pungent, sharp Romano cheese! People come in doors below us, on a lower level, also in the race. [Note: Rat race?] We all go towards the cheese, though we never see it or actually know where it is. I know that this girl lives a comfortable life, financial and otherwise. We near the top floor of the building and the people are close behind us, getting near the top floor and coming down the hallway, of what is now Carter School. I go into the bathroom near the north end of the hallway. The man I'm with goes too. We agree this is the best place to be. We walk in. There is a bluish-yellow pillow in the urinal. This is the place. It is a semi-enjoyable feeling to be in this nonchalant race led by the woman, with others close behind us."
"1820"	"(07/22/1998)"	"Confronting Rita Fosters I'm in a car with my acquaintance Rita Fosters. She is driving on the wrong side of the road! We're in the United States. I'm frightened by her driving and tell her this. I am then driving. I get up the nerve to say to her, ""Will you or do you want to give me a blow job?"" This is a big step for me because I feel I'm exposing myself admitting to her that I'm attracted to her. She reacts in a surprised manner."
"1821"	"(07/22/1998)"	"Autofellatio 15 I'm sexually excited. I feel as if someone is giving me fellatio, but I think it will only be for a short time: six thrusts, six sucks, or six seconds; the number six is pervasive. I'm kneeling on all fours. I realize for maximum stimulation I need anal stimulation as well. I move and thrust my pelvis, as I think a woman would to achieve orgasm. I'm on the floor by myself. I try to orgasm in any way I can. I'm giving myself fellatio. I find that when I get fully erect I can fit the top of my erection in my mouth, and I suck hard."
"1822"	"(07/22/1998)"	"The Chief Brothers There is a television show occurring. There are some episodes of ""Stupid Human Tricks"" on. There is one episode or incident where there are two brothers who call each other ""Chief"". I think and say, ""Hey, my brother and I do that!"" Something happens with my friend Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson on television. There are other figures involved, which may be cartoon figures, which seem vicious, abrasive, and acute. I try to take a photograph of what is occurring with them and this character, but it's happening fast and is hard to get the camera to focus. The cartoon-like character seems to be red with big teeth. There is a gathering with several large groups of teenagers and pre-teenagers. Each group is from some sort of organization promoting a cause."
"1823"	"(07/23/1998)"	"Dinner With Jane I'm in a place that is like home at dinner with some women. One of the women, on my left, has long straight blond hair and fair skin. I recognize her face, and seem to know some about her. There is a brunette woman there. The conversation comes around to venereal diseases, and how people get them. The blond woman talks as if she knows about these diseases and how one gets them. The meal draws to a close and the brunette woman gets up to leave, nonchalantly urging her friend, who is another brunette, to leave as well. She does this to leave the blond woman and I alone, to try to get us together as a couple. I sit with the blond woman in a nervous, uncomfortable silence. I'm not aggressive: I don't try to kiss her. There's a moment when I look at her and have the opportunity to do so when it would be okay, but I don't. I act shy. It seems to me that she wants to have a sexual encounter. I know she smokes, and I take this into consideration when thinking of kissing of having a sexual encounter with her. It seems I'm walking near a fence line not far from the table when I think this. I'm alone. It's drizzling outside and I'm wearing my heavy yellow raincoat. I meet my old school classmate Rita Bauer and another woman from our high school who have just arrived back from a study abroad experience. I talk with them. Rita and I comment on the cold, rainy weather. We both think it's cold, and we're dressed for it. It seems many of the other people don't think so, and are not dressed for cold. I'm walking down a large hallway. I see many people I know from my grade school years: Gino Teavor, Jerry Kasper and his girlfriend, Bud Slick, Mike Brimms, and others. At the end of the hallway is a mail area. I try to get my mail, going to box 369. I try to dial the combination: 17-34-44. I don't dial it properly: don't turn the correct number of turns, and can't open the box. I try several times, with no success. A man next to me gets his mail by reaching through an opening behind the mailboxes and pulling out his mail from the opening in the back. I manage to get my box open slightly and slip my mail out. I have a big stack of mail: about ten letters. Some are business, some personal. I see a letter that looks like it has my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas' handwriting on the envelope, but I don't think it's from her, rather, from another woman with similar handwriting. I walk back from the post office down the hallway. There are stairs in the hallway, and people are stopping and sitting down all around the steps to read their mail."
"1824"	"(07/23/1998)"	"Uncomfortable Accommodation I go into my uncles Nelson and Vev Redding's room at the Redding farm. It's where I'm going to stay. I'm nervous and uncomfortable about staying here because I've never been comfortable in this room: it gives me the creeps. There are two beds: one in the far left corner low to the ground, and another closer to the door and higher off the ground. I feel claustrophobic and contaminated. I see that there is another bed up against the other wall close to the door. It appears someone is sleeping there. This makes me glad, because now I don't have to worry about being stuck in the small bed in the corner low to the ground with someone sleeping on the bed next to me higher up. I think Vev is the person staying in the room. I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona at a campground. We drive to a place away from occupied campsites. It's nearly dark. There is a lot of gear at the site: some huge fluffy sleeping bags and more. I think of staying the night here instead of where I would stay."
"1825"	"(07/23/1998)"	"Looking Down Upon Annie's Work I'm looking down on a place where I know my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is working. It's dark: few town lights are on. There are several buildings with a road in front of them. I stand, or have a viewpoint from the top back of one of these buildings. There is a space or alley between buildings, which I know is where she works. We may meet. I don't see her completely, or see her face. I remember having my hand on her butt, on the outside of her black tights. I may move my hand under her pants and touch the flesh of her butt."
"1826"	"(07/23/1998)"	"The Red Dot There is some kind of a battle or struggle occurring. It's not a destructive battle; it seems to be a passive struggle, an acceptance of change laid down, rather than any kind of resistance. I play a role in this. I seem to be the change facilitator, a major player in the war, but not in any pejorative sense because nothing negative is perceived to be happening. It seems that I go around and change things, like tapping people on the head with a wand and in an instant: poof! Change! There is a star wars-like game occurring. One of the characters is not strong enough to mentally perform a task. A red dot appears, as a mental image of an immense air ship begins to tilt, fall, and crash. The red dot helps hold the ship in the air and keep it level. Han Solo may be the character performing the task."
"1827"	"(07/23/1998)"	"Jumping For Melanie I'm at a small gathering. My friend Melanie McDyss is there, with others. I jump up to the chandeliers and put a crumbled up piece of bread with melted cheese in the glass case that surrounds one of the bulbs, on top of the bulb. This seems to be a feat because no one else can do it. I jump up and reach in and put it out of the light casing as well."
"1828"	"(07/24/1998)"	"Unsafe Bridge Jumping I'm with several friends from home. We walk up to the top of a tower or cliff. My friends Kevin Simpson, Stephen Ramos, and Tiny Combs are there. When we get to the top Kevin goes up to the edge and jumps off without hesitation. I look out through the small door-like opening where he jumped. There is a river hundreds of feet below us. There is a train bridge crossing the river below us. Kevin free falls for about six seconds while the wind blows him over the train bridge below us, down river. I watch as he falls and am afraid he'll land on the bridge: splat! But he blows over it. He gets close to the water. I see white water below him, and am worried he's going to land in a shallow, rocky area and be killed. He lands, and I see him surface, alive and well. Others also jump. I don't jump because it's too high: I'm very scared of jumping from this height. We're in the river water below. There are many people swimming and floating, playing in the water. I see one body in the water, face down. I think the person is drowning, and pull their head up feeling panicked. The woman turns her head and moves so I know that she's okay. I'm nervous about this whole situation: very high jumping, people swimming about. I think someone may get hurt, and that concerns me. Four men in their late 20's, beer-drinkin', cigarette smokin', cut-off wearin', long stringy-haired guys, jump off the lower train bridge into the water. They joke, are careless, carefree, and silly. Others see his and go to jump."
"1829"	"(07/24/1998)"	"Fragmented Urine Stream I talk to a woman that seems to be a medical professional. She asks specific questions about my urination. I tell her that my urine stream is fragmented: the stream sprays out in different directions. She tells me or indicates that this is not good. I may have a defect in my penis. I'm embarrassed because she says this to me in front of another woman."
"1830"	"(07/24/1998)"	"Ducks Call, Blackville, Rwanda I get off an airplane. I feel very disoriented, like I'm losing awareness, because I've been traveling so much. I don't know where I am. I've lost track of the numerous airplane flights. I walk down the ramp. Some people go to the left to get luggage. That isn't the correct way to go; I go to the right. There are many luggage carousels. I don't know which will have my luggage on it. Some carousels are labeled with names. I walk to one that I think is correct because I vaguely recognize the people around it as being on the same flight as I. The luggage starts to feed out onto the carousel. I stand on the flat side and wait. A very large piece of cream-colored luggage appears. A young man runs after it and grabs it as it approaches me from my left. It's a very big, heavy bag, and appears to be hard-sided. As he grabs it, its slow but steady momentum makes him lunge forward, jerking his body. He manages to jerk and drag it off the carousel, and I see that it's not hard-sided, but is made of flimsy black cloth. The man starts to swear because there is a cello in the bag, and it was bumped when he removed it from the carousel. The carousel area is in the bush. There are sparse trees and pale green tall grasses around, dry looking scrub brush. I see a cellular phone on the carousel as it goes past me. I go after the phone because I know it's a man's phone: he is there but just missed it. I go to grab it and give it to him. I pick up the phone and am going to toss it to him but I don't: I'll walk it over to him. All the lighting in the area turns off: the area is dark. A dull, dim, but noticeable light is cast around and upon me. I feel on the spot: uneasy having a light shined on me in the dark. I may go to give the phone to its owner. I think I may have hit a button by accident when picking it up. The light on me changes its intensity. I walk with my grade school classmate Patrick Bergman. It's dark. We have some fleeting light at times to view what is in front of us. I see tan-colored mud, bubbling and boiling, giving off steam. We sidestep or trek lightly through this. We arrive at an entrance-like area where several young adults are. My friend Holly Lapson is there with two others, one of whom is a woman I recognize from school. They're at the entrance to act as greeters. We talk a bit. I am uneasy because of my past behavior around them: I've always been fairly antisocial in appearance and demeanor. Holly says there are two groups, one of which is going out tonight to do an activity. She reads the names of three or four people who are in this evening group. Then she tells me I'm with the morning group. She points out several small cabin-like shacks that are our lodgings. I know that this is a camp-like organization where meetings of young adults take place, in groups. I'm then in a crowd of people in the camp. I see many people I know, including my friend Emerald Reinhold, who waves and smiles at me. She's wearing gray with a hint of bright orange on a zipper; it may be fleece. Holly is there. I walk by my high school classmates Daryl and Chris Yeller. One of them walks on each side of me. I say hi. I see my high school classmates Kristy Puffy and Amber Sherman. My friend Jill Banks is there. I think Jill is back from Africa. I see two Jill Banks', who look exactly alike. There is a girl there who seems to be Jill's younger sister. I sit by myself as people walk and talk to each other. The atmosphere is friendly and happy. A younger blond man comes up to me. I vaguely recognize him as a basketball player, which is how he knows me. He says something like, ""Hey Hanson, how's it going?"" I respond lukewarmly, say, ""Okay."" I talk with Kristy. I'm losing awareness because I've been traveling so long. I ask her where we are because I honestly have no idea. She says we're at the Duck's call, which is the name of the camp. I ask where it is, and she says Blackville. I ask where that is, and she says Rwanda! I recognize the name of Rwanda to be in Africa. I ask if we're in Africa and she says yes. Wow. I can't believe I'm in Africa. This is an orientation outing, to get to know people. I think this is a really long way to have flown for orientation."
"1831"	"(07/25/1998)"	"A Bazaar Reunion I walk north on Park Avenue, from Main Street towards Hill Park, in Oak Valley. It seems I'm climbing a mountain. I comment on the few days that it's nice to walk around here: it has to be clean, calm, and sunny, in the early morning. I walk with one or more people. I grab a stick that is partially fallen and drag it along for a bit. We near the park and I see that people are setting up for the bazaar. There is a huge army green canvas tarp that is being set up and staked down to be a trampoline. The Blackstone family is helping with the setup. Their little girl is crying. I stop and note her crying. I feel guilty because when I was a child I treated these people badly. I'm down under the park pavilion. Many people are there: familiar faces. I see my high school classmate Mike Brimms, sitting to the north of the shelter, with his baseball team, who are all in uniform. I see my friend Emerald Reinhold. We make eye contact from a distance, but the passing crowd obscures it. I maintain my gaze in her direction, and when the people wander out of our line of sight, we make eye contact again. She smiles and waves, and I do too, giving her two thumbs up. I see our friend Jill Banks is with her. I wave and smile. Then I wander around mindlessly: nonchalantly avoiding them. I want to talk to them, but would prefer them to come to greet me, rather than I greeting them. Jill runs around the crowd over to me and we share a big hug. I pick her up, my arms locking down near her waist or butt. She is very light. We talk a bit. I tell her that last night I had a dream that I saw two of her that were exactly the same! She has a friend with her who is a tall woman with shoulder length straight blond hair. She has a small stud nose ring in her left nostril. She is very attractive, I think. She may be wearing a black blazer and seems to have an orange (the fruit) on her somewhere, or an orange is associated with her. She may have a piece of orange peel stuck to her face somewhere, which then falls off. I stand with them and talk. I'm wearing my maroon Nike shorts and my Redson 9th grade basketball t-shirt. Jill's friend comments on my hairiness; I see she sees my legs. I take this as a compliment: I like my hairiness. But I act standoffish, as if I don't know how to take her comment, saying, ""Uhhhhh, Okay."" As we talk, my high school crush Harmony Allure and her friend walk by, and catch my eye. They act as though they don't see me, and I don't acknowledge them. The pavilion is going to be used for Bingo. The announcer rhymes haphazardly on the microphone in a comical manner. His words don't quite rhyme, but he manipulates them in a humorous manner. The crowd and I laugh. I see that the announcer is Jake Truck. Jake has a black and gray beard. I'm jealous of the attention and affection that he gets in this role as announcer. I try to dismiss this feeling. There is an announcement for those in back to sit down, so all the people can see and the game can begin. I go and sit on the edge of a large black picnic table. I see my third grade teacher Liza Minikel carrying a baby. As people all crowd in to find a place to sit I slide down to the end of the bench. My friend Nate Nelling is at the other end. He yells at me saying, ""Hanson, don't move down!"" He doesn't want me to give up my space to these latecomers that are now crowding in. I see that Grandpa Redding is sitting in the middle of the bench, a few people down from me."
"1832"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Freezing A Big Fish My friends Tim and Niles Zelling have a big northern pike. It looks to be between eight and ten pounds: not huge, but still a big fish. They are having it frozen. They have to pay a rate for its storage. It seems to be stored with an older woman. Something happens with a questionnaire."
"1833"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Fighting Drunken Patrick I'm in a church, walking up the center aisle, taking part in a ceremony. I see my grade school classmates Jerry Kasper and Patrick Bergman sitting. I shake their hands: it's good to see them. Later, they attack me. I feel like I'm playing a video game, like I am a video game. I punch Patrick hard in the nose. I then move or I am moved, in a position ready to fight, to another place. It feels as if I'm standing up, hopping or bouncing, and head over to the place or person where control of the fight is originating, as if to fight them. I encounter Jerry and Patrick again. They are drunk, slobbering. I fight them, slowly and steadily beating them. One or both may vomit as a result of the alcohol and/or the beating."
"1834"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Convincing Them of Heather I'm in a car with a couple men. We seem to be in a drive-up teller area. They talk to a couple women who are there, one of whom is my sister Heather. As we drive away one of them says the blond woman (Heather) is cute. I say that she is my sister. They seem not to believe me, so we turn around and go back so I can show or prove to them that Heather is my sister. We do, and Heather confirms that she's my sister in her ""So what?"" manner. I say something to them about the University of Wellington. It hen catch myself and realize that these two men were in New South Wales with me! There is a small underground parking ramp nearby."
"1835"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Blue Saran Wrap Critter I'm fishing with my dad in a shallow area, almost shoreline. There are weeds, lily pads, logs, and stumps around. My dad says the area is no good for fishing: it's too thick. I want to try it out more. I drop my line in a small open pool, after climbing up onto dead fallen logs and stumps. I'm alone. I have a fly rod with a sinking moth-like fly. The small area I'm in seems to have barriers in front of it. There are sunfish in the water below. I dangle the line in front of them. A few fish nip at the lure. I try, but don't hook any. A large fish swims in front of me, from my right to left. It looks like a huge trout! I dangle the fly in front of it but it doesn't bite. The fish turns and swims past me on my left side. There is a band behind me. The fish swims towards it, there is no water there. I see the fish is then an animal with four legs, each about two feet long. It is wrapped in blue plastic wrap and has a rubber band around part of it. I pick it up by its hind legs. I'm afraid of it biting or scratching me. I swing it, whacking it against a large sink six or nine times. It's now dead. After this incident where I beat the animal to death a sketchy evening news team pursues me because of my behavior. A woman with a microphone hounds me. I don't reply. I go to my truck, get in, lock the passenger door, and drive away. I may have the dead animal with me."
"1836"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Amends With Mike Hollow I'm in the Big Resort Area working at a business that is in the same building as Fishing Haven. I'm outside on the shore or dock. I see a man swimming off to my left. He returns to the shore where I am. He sees me. We begin to talk, slowly and cautiously. He is my old boss Mike Hollow. I wonder if I'm dreaming, but I don't question the reality of the situation because I think it may be offensive to him. I don't want to annoy or anger him. I tell him that I'm sorry for leaving and explain what I was thinking when I left. He says he's in a hurry and starts to leave, but our conversation continues. I tell him what I have to say about respect: my viewpoint then and now. I try to make amends. I tell him if he ever needs help I'd like to work for Fishing Haven again. He says maybe. He tells me last Christmas was bad."
"1837"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Camping With Herald I'm with my coworker Harold Jamison. We drive, looking for a place to camp. The area we're in is large and flat: spread out. There are a few camp sited occupied, but are many to choose from. There may be a lake nearby."
"1838"	"(07/26/1998)"	"New Equipment I'm going into a sporting goods store like Smith's Sports. I meet my friend Sam Kingsley, who is on his way out. I ask him to come into the store with me. I'm going to look at and possibly purchase, some athletic equipment. We go to the section of rollerblades. Then we're in a section of Lacrosse-like equipment, or some sport like it, where there are long sticks with nets on one end. They are different from lacrosse sticks, specified for the sport, which I'm not sure of. I see a stick that looks all right, and look at its price. It costs $75, which is much more than I thought it would."
"1839"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Flying Cars and Trucks I'm on the runway of an airport. My brother Wally and others are with me. We see a plane land. It touches down at about midpoint of the runway, which I late, I think. It slows down, but is still going fast, approaching the end of the runway and a fence. It turns sharply to its left, going past us, narrowly avoiding the fence and us. It's a small three-person place. Planes take off to our left. They speed down the runway. I don't know if they will lift off enough to fly over the hills at the end of the runway. One of the planes lifts off and flies up in a loop-de-loop. It's a silver hot rod van with a trailer. There are other cars too that fly up in loops. They are very powerful, can fly straight upwards. I think and feel the difficulty of pulling or straightening out of a car after flying right loop-de-loops in succession."
"1840"	"(07/26/1998)"	"Mountain Woman Guide I'm in a truck riding with another man. There is a woman driving the truck. The truck is fairly old, from the 70's or 80's, and is green. We drive on a freeway-like road. We're going fishing, on a charter it seems, and the woman is the guide. We'll be fishing for trout with spoons. The woman drives fast, passing people without changing lanes, weaving in and out of traffic. She's a strong, sturdy mountain woman, I think."
"1841"	"(07/27/1998)"	"Close To Orgasm I'm in a weight room with my old teammates Simon Naver and John Kulik. They are doing an exercise like upright rows. I somehow hurt John's feelings, am rude to him. He leaves feeling dejected and angry. I'm holding a barbell and John and Simon are holding the ends. I don't want them to do this, it annoys me. I shake the bar, jerking one end and then the other, freeing it from their grips. Simon lets go, and seems apologetic. As I jerk the bar, the right end hits the large mirror that is behind us, and leaves cracks that look like a spider web. I feel bad: I'm guilty. No one with authority is there, so I play it off as if it never happened, like I'm not responsible for the cracks. I use the barbell with two 25-pound plates on it. I try to military press the bar, standing up. I can't do it, trying several times, struggling, and failing to fully extend my arms above my head. I am alone in the corner of the weight room. I look out the windows and see trees. It seems to be the area near High and Old Avenues in Woodland, next to the river. There is a phone call for a person named Katie, from a woman. The woman is calling about a talk show. The woman works 2am-2pm, and says Katie should call her back after these hours. I see the broken glass is one small pane, of many, which comprise the large mirror. The pane is about 8"" x 10"", and is flexible. It has a magnet on the back to stick to the background. I think it may not be too expensive to replace. I'm on the curb of the south lane of Old Avenue near the river. I see a woman on the road in front of me. She's wearing an orangish-brownish-goldish bikini. She has huge breasts: at least an F or G cup. I say to her, ""You have huge tits!"" I grab her, move her to the ground, and say, ""Let's fuck."" We start to have a sexual encounter and I rub my penis between her breasts. She has had breast implants. There are two large, lumpy areas on her breasts that are purple or black in color. I slide my erection between her breasts and tell her to give me fellatio at the same time. She does. I near orgasm, and feel pre-ejaculatory fluid spurt out of my erection. She stops giving me fellatio: she doesn't want a mouthful of semen. I say, ""No! Keep sucking!"", and I start to masturbate to keep up the arousal. She starts to give me fellatio again. I'm very aroused and am experiencing much pleasure, very close to orgasm."
"1842"	"(07/27/1998)"	"Ramona's Party I'm at a small airport. My sister Ramona and others are there. The occasion seems to be in Ramona's honor. I'm then at home with a group of people including my friend Nate Nelling, ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, Ramona, and others. This is a party for Ramona. Annie and Nate smoke a joint of marijuana. It's long and think: skinner than a pencil. I want to be included in this, and they pass me the joint after a little bit. I take a huge, long breath as I inhale through the joint. We're in the garage. They both react to the size of my hit. When we're done I run around and do something nutty, making Annie laugh. The reason I smoke is to be a part of their experience, and to nonchalantly show Annie that I partake in some vices. I say that we've got a couple hours, and should have some drinks and then just relax. We're being pretty loud. Ramona is upstairs, and yells down for us to be quiet, which puts a damper on our festivities, since it's her party and we'll listen to her."
"1843"	"(07/27/1998)"	"The Free Spirit Mechanic I'm near Slope Avenue South in Oak Valley, by Long's old house, by the corner service station. There is a young man there in his early 20's who seems very odd, and frightens me. I'm not sure what he wants, what he does, why he appears to be so strange. I'm sitting in my truck in the parking lot east of the service station there. I invite the young man to get in the truck. He gets in the drivers seat. I'm the passenger, I realize. This is scary, because I'm not sure what this man will do: what he does or wants. I think even though he's in the driver's seat he probably won't know how to operate the truck. He's slim, with long scraggly brown hair, not greasy or stringy, but soft and slightly curled. It's not combed, but looks okay. He's wearing a rusty red or brown mechanic's suit. He has a mysterious quality about him. I determine to not prejudge him. I ask him his name. He tells me. Police officers come up behind us. A female officer sternly says, ""Get out of the car. Don't say or do anything. Not a word, or I'll arrest you."" We silently get out. The man mocks the officer, whining and mumbling intentionally. She begins to arrest him. There is a male officer on my side of the truck when I get out. He is about 5'10"", with a round head. He speaks to the female officer, saying, ""Why don't we let these guys go?"" She agrees. I look at the male officer and he smiles at me. He has braces. I smile back in appreciation, careful not to say anything. The man and I get back into the truck."
"1844"	"(07/27/1998)"	"Stephen's Mishap I'm on a bus with a group of students. People seem to be throwing things out the window of the bus. My friend Stephen Ramos gets a fist-sized rock and throws it. It heads directly for the windshield of a car that a man is driving. The rock smashes through the windshield as the bus drives by the car, while the man is stopped at an intersection. The man quickly yells vengeance, records the license plate number of the bus. We hear him talk, recording the information, even though we're in our bus driving away. We're all shocked. I quickly move out of my seat to a different seat not so close to Stephen to seem like I didn't have a part in this event. Stephen assures us all he'll take full responsibility for his actions and put no blame on us."
"1845"	"(07/27/1998)"	"The Space Age School Others and I are on a field trip to play basketball. I'm on a bus going to the school for a basketball tournament. My old teammate Simon Naver is near me at the front of the bus. We arrive at the school, which is really new and high-tech. I ask people where the gymnasium is. I go past a cafeteria-like area where I see my high school classmates June Meeker and Tracy Noles. I talk with them even though we didn't talk much in school. My schoolmate Aaron Webbed is there. I'm told the locker room is five blocks down the hall; this school is huge! I pass my grade school classmate Ryan Vaurnet as I go down the hallway. There is a man scrubbing the floor. One person slips on the wet floor. The person is all right; the cleaner stops until we pass. The hallways are smooth, sealed, tan or off white in color: really space age looking. There are large areas on each side of the hall for entertainment or food. There is a place where people shoot footballs like one would a basketball. This school seems to have everything! I make it to the locker room. I see other teams there for the tournament. I know I'm an important player on our team: the other teams recognize who I am."
"1846"	"(07/27/1998)"	"Mistakenly Kissing Sarah I'm with my friend Sarah Reed. I kiss her. She says, ""No!"", and tells me not to kiss her like that, not to kiss her at all. She kisses me in her manner, and then stops, indicating we're not to kiss. I am embarrassed, like I've made a mistake: I've crossed an uncrossable line. I've ruined a friendship. Later, I realize that I kissed her in a dream, not in real life, and I'm relieved."
"1847"	"(07/27/1998)"	"Trout And Salmon Room I'm at a home I know to be that of my friends the McDyss', in a room I've never seen before. The rooms are dimly lit, if lit at all, with old brass and copper artifacts: signs of salmon and trout fishing. It seems like a room of collectors' items. The McDyss' and I and maybe others are then eating dinner. We have fruit and vegetable salads. I don't think I'll get full, but I say nothing. Rob McDyss says we're having smoked salmon for dessert. I hope we do, so I eat some food with substance. I'm outside with a group. We see the sun and moon close together in the sky, low on the horizon. People scramble for their cameras to take a photograph of this. I get my camera. I walk forward to try to get a closer shot. Something obstructs my view. I can't see one of the heavenly bodies when I do this. I back up and see the bodies shining between branches and tree trunks. I try to get the full round bodies of both in the photograph. I take the photograph."
"1848"	"(07/27/1998)"	"Laundering Money I'm standing at a laundry machine. I seem to be in despair. People come up to me and give me things or say nice things to me. My aunt Sheila Redding is one of them. I have my wallet out. I'm losing or spending money very quickly. Someone, maybe Sheila, gives me change for a $20 bill."
"1849"	"(07/27/1998)"	"Duck Hunting Gone Awry I'm duck hunting with others. There is one person next to others and I around the swampy area. I'm worried about accidentally shooting someone. Lines of fire seem to encounter people frequently. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. He looks over and sees his brother Jose lying face down: he has been shot! Stephen doesn't take this seriously. He waits a bit before walking over to see Jose. I'm paranoid. I think I could have been the one who shot Jose. We walk over to Jose. Stephen turns over Jose's body. There are several small holes in his head, which I think are from a .22 caliber rifle, which clears me from responsibility because I'm using a shotgun. I run to get help. My friend Nat Miller follows me with a whistle. Others get my attention and we stop. Jose's death was a hoax. We hunt. I see ducks, but they are sparse and fly fast. My shotgun doesn't work well for me. I misfire a lot, and have the safety on when I want it off. I'm having difficulty firing when I want to. I fiddle with the gun, trying to get it to work. A large flock of Canada geese is well within range right in front of me. My friend Kevin Simpson comes up next to me; we take aim. There are geese tightly packed on the water, and it seems more geese are on top of these, up to several feet off the water. The geese scatter. I misfire. I try to fire again at a goose that is close, just as it's taking off. It slows and sinks into the water. I happy, I finally shot a goose! It begins to float. I grab its head of black hair and lift it out of the water. It's not a goose, but a boy! He is hit in three or four places with pellets: in the head and upper body, and won't live. I'm horrified! I have shot a person! I try to comfort the dying boy, give him what I can. I caress his limbs and hold him in my arms. I try to keep him warm, hugging him. The boy is wearing shorts. He has about three-inch long black hair and darker skin. I think he's Mexican. People seem to discount the seriousness of what has happened. I'm in shock. I feel shameful, guilty, and disgusted with myself. I feel like crap."
"1850"	"(07/28/1998)"	"The Creepy Crawly Hallway I'm at the Redding farm. I'm in the southeast corner of the house in the baby room or in grandpa and grandma's old bedroom. I may be masturbating, or be about to masturbate: there is a sexual feeling. My brother Wally is there. I go upstairs in search of pornography. I walk in the upstairs hallway. My uncle Dannie Redding's old bedroom is barren. The hallway is dim or dark. Bats fly out of the small room across from Dannie's. There are spiders covering the walls and floors. Some of the spiders are large: bigger than my whole hand. Others are the size of a lemon. I only see the spiders when I get a glimpse of the light in the area, out of my shadow. I'm wearing gloves. I feel surrounded by creepy crawly critters. I crawl out of the area, brushing the floor as I go. I feel anxious, paranoid, and claustrophobic."
"1851"	"(07/28/1998)"	"Relationship Status With Annie I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We seem to be near the Middle Mall in Wilmerton. Our initial meeting is friendly and causal. We touch, I hold her. She starts to tell me what she's feeling at the time: essentially a ""state of affairs"" for her so I know where she's at, and where we are. We're interrupted. It's later, I've come home from a school-like bus. There is a door on the side of the bus midway, or towards the rear. I sit with my mom and Annie's uncle. We seem to be parked and sitting outside a Dairy Queen. My mom encourages me to give the relationship with Annie a chance: to try to make that familiar relationship work before going off and finding something totally new. I see my mom's point: she just wants me to ease into life back in the United States. Being in a relationship in which I'm comfortable would ease that transition. I tell my mom and Annie's uncle that if things work out between Annie and I that's great. If not, if she desires a relationship of something isn't right, that's fine too. I try to keep an open mind, to play it by ear without prejudging."
"1852"	"(07/28/1998)"	"Ramona Dumps Me I see my sister Ramona lying on a bed. She is a person that I've been involved with intimately for some time: a long time friend and partner. We have not seen each other in a while. I go up and try to lie on her and kiss her. She puts her right leg up against her chest to block me from doing so. We're sitting on the floor in her room across from each other. She tells me that she doesn't want to continue the relationship. I say, ""Fair enough."" We sit in silence for a bit. I feel a bit uncomfortable because she has ended our relationship. But I don't feel that bad about the relationship ending. It's not something that I think I'll dwell upon. I look at a book of photographs. A bit later I get up and go into my room. This may be odd that our rooms are next to each other."
"1853"	"(07/28/1998)"	"Dad's Sex With A Box I'm with my dad and my brother Wally. My dad is trying to demonstrate to me how to have sex with a woman, but he is somehow using the edge or part of a cardboard box as a vagina. He is having sex with this box, trying to instruct me. I look away. I feel uncomfortable because my dad is having sex right next to me! He gets close to ejaculation and says something like, ""Here Kenneth, this is how..."" I'm slightly confused, intrigued, and much more repulsed because it's the social norm to be repulsed in this situation."
"1854"	"(07/28/1998)"	"An Uncomfortable Senior Party I'm at a sort of dance, ballet concert, or recital. There are different student performers. Cash prizes are awarded. The grand prize is $25,000. There is a lesser prize of $1,000 and many smaller prizes. The performances take place and the prizes are awarded. The top cash prize is not awarded. One young Asian woman is angry because she should have received the prize of $25,000. In response to not getting it, she gets up and does a spectacular performance that involves her reflections in a phone booth-like structure. A photographer shoots photographs and marvels at the images that are created by the woman. The woman walks up and down the steps in dim or dark light. There are many supporting dancers on stage. The auditorium, which has been dimly lit, is now bright. My friend Matt Yams is on one side of me. My friend Stephanie Peterson is behind me. A ceremony has ended and a reception is about to occur. I stand up in the front row of the seats. I have gas, which I'm trying to hold in. Stephanie bumps and pokes me. I blurt out a little, but noticeable, fart. She is disgusted, and facetiously says, ""Oh, nice, Kenneth."" I laugh, feeling embarrassed, but also glad that I let it out. I hold in more farts. Matt talks to me about the color of a particular fishing lure: how to get the reddish color deeper or better, using small cube-shaped blocks of red. A senior party is occurring. People are given checks for thousands of dollars in fake money. They need to go cash them to get the money. I get a check for $13,000. It's actually worth about $98, which my family as paid for so I can enjoy the senior party. There are long lines to cash checks, so I wait. I'm in line for something. My grade school friends Eric Stoner and Mark Long, who is dead, are there. I think of Mark: is he real? I touch his shoulder: it is firm. I think he is actually there. The next moment he is gone, when I look. I say to Eric, ""Did you see Mark?"" I look on the floor where there is a scratch. I think this scratch is a sign of Mark. I look at it, concentrating, having a moment for him. Eric sees me on my knees, scrutinizing the scratch. He criticizes me. He knows I'm doing this because of Mark. My friend Stephen Ramos comes up to me and says he needs the $5 I owe him. I tell him not now. He repeats himself, saying he wants the $5 now! I reply harshly, ""Not now!"", because I'm busy. I leave the area and walk. I'm not in the main area of the party. There are not many things around. I walk through an area of Carter School, alone. I see my friend Marge Drummond and her brother Carl playing a makeshift two-person game of baseball. I walk alone, away form the crowd. I feel lonely and secluded. Later, I'm in line to cash a check, and tell Stephen I can give him the $5 now."
"1855"	"(07/29/1998)"	"A Terrible Tornado I'm at home with my old classmates Bud Slick, Kari Otis, and another woman. A storm is brewing outside. I see wind swirling and hear there is a tornado forming. We talk about which area of the house we should go to: the northwest corner. I quickly direct everyone downstairs to the basement. We huddle in the pit room full of its junk. Looking up, I see the tornado over our home. It's a massive, swirling brown wind. We must be without part of the roof because I can see up. The tornado has a devastating effect, causing lots of damage: mass destruction. The people I'm with are safe. We are going to take a shower. Kari is in a wheelchair. I go into the shower, which is a very large open tile room with many shower stalls. I walk around the corner, out of Kari's view, and shower naked. Bud helps Kari get into the shower in her wheelchair. He then goes around the corner where I can see him and showers with a pair of boxer shorts on. Later I talk with him about my back pain. He says I should exercise my back: do pull-ups."
"1856"	"(07/29/1998)"	"Depressed At Brimson I'm at Brimson walking form the building where the financial aid office is towards the student union. My friend Sara Miller passes me up while I'm walking. She facetiously says, ""Thanks for writing me this summer."" I'm somber, and don't reply. I'm sad, depressed, and very sullen. My friend Kate Josslyn and others have a snowball fight. At some point I tackle and tumble with my friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, whom I haven't seen in a long time."
"1857"	"(07/29/1998)"	"Living A Dreamed Tornado I drive my mom's Chevy Celebrity into the driveway at home. My mom comes out of the house and talks to me in the way she does when she has bad news. She tells me to go upstairs, get my sleeping bag, and bring it downstairs: A tornado has hit. I say I've dreamed of the destruction of a tornado. I go look around and in the house. The street in front of the house looks like it's under construction from the tornado damage. The trees in the yard have been bent and broken. The color of the bark of the branches is lighter. The house seems flimsy. The upstairs floor is thin and unstable. Much power is lost, only a few lights and outlets work. Much of the damage is subtle: no walls or windows are broken, but the structure and foundation seem to be less stable. I shine a few lights on my room, which is on the east side, upstairs. There are unscathed liquor bottles. The floor is flexible. I think that it needs a good solid layer of plywood to lend some strength to it. My mom tells me that the cause of this destruction is a person: someone left her a note, threatening her because of something she has begun. I think this is atrocious. I fully support my mom in her cause even though I don't have personal interest in it. I know there has been arson: a fire. There is a conflict and pursuit of the arsonist using hair samples to try to prove who was there. There is a group of four men, one of whom seems to be the runt of the group. The others try to put the guilt on this man, but all were involved."
"1858"	"(07/29/1998)"	"Die Hard Criminal Love I'm in a restaurant. There is one person next to me, slightly behind me out of my view. We both have guns. There are two people, a man and a woman, at the other end of this long, narrow restaurant. They have guns. We shoot at each other. This seems scandalous, like a robbery involving ruthless drunk criminals with guns. I shoot the woman. My gun only fires once in a while, though I pull the trigger a lot. The man comes close to me. I cannot or do not fire, but I know I'll be okay. The person I'm with, next to me, has a gun. The man gets right in front of us. My partner shoots him in the chest. The man is awake and coherent, but is stunned. I beat him over the head with the butt of several different guns. He acts drunk, but he should be dead. There is a fat man lying in bed with the criminal woman. She hits or knees him. He gets up and runs to the bathroom to vomit. He doesn't make it. He stops, sits on the corner of the bed, and vomits on the floor. This has the feeling of a tragic criminal love drama story."
"1859"	"(07/29/1998)"	"New Old Hardside Luggage I'm at an airport where I see lots of luggage that is to be discarded. I want to take a hard-sided suitcase to protect some of my stuff more than my green suitcase. I have left my green suitcase on a bus, for storage, parked out in a flat open area near the runway with a few other vehicles. There is a small white truck with a topper-like compartment that is filled with explosives and ammunition for my friend Kevin Simpson and I. I hold two small wooden boxes with sliding top lids that contain ammunition. I take a black hard-sided suitcase out of the baler-like machine. It's old and has a scaled appearance, but will work fine. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. It's hot. I tell Stephen I want to go get a drink. We do. We walk along with the crowd. I see my sister Ramona sitting at a table with her friends. It's as if I'm a senior and she is a freshmen. I jokingly touch her head, saying hi affectionately. She shakes it off, annoyed with me, as is characteristic of a freshmen."
"1860"	"(07/29/1998)"	"Agile Warrior There is a video game like scene, like the game Power Pete. The video character is slower than his aggressors, and must use his agility to outmaneuver them. Earlier, a warrior-type young man escapes a death-defying situation, thereby passing the first part of a dangerous quest."
"1861"	"(07/29/1998)"	"Dragging A Box I'm driving my truck, dragging a box behind by a chain. I'm driving from or to the airport. I decide to put the box in the bed of the truck. It is still connected to the truck by the chain. People follow me. My friend Kevin Simpson or Stephen Ramos is with me."
"1862"	"(07/30/1998)"	"Lucid Mark Smiles I'm downtown Wilmerton. My friend Tiny Combs is there. Something happens with a ""baseball guy"": a player or fan. There is a fight: I beat this baseball guy. I have a handgun. My old classmates Andy Jones and Carl Everson are there. We seem to be near Oak Avenue and 3rd Street in Oak Valley, in John Cantwell's back yard. I threaten Andy and Carl with the gun. I shoot the gun around Carl, not hitting him. The police come. There are no deaths, but I'm a killer. I'm near my neighbor Anna Gates' house. I see police cars coming down the road to get me. I run across Home Avenue, but run back and grab the murder weapon, which is the gun, which seems to be the kind of plastic case that a corsage is kept in. I run east on 1st Street. I get a ride from a man in a gray 4x4 vehicle, with floodlights that have ""hella"" or ""heller"" covers on them. It's as if I'm coercively hitchhiking. The man isn't happy about picking me up or letting me in the truck, but I'm assertive. This is one way for me to elude the police. We drive down the alley between Home and Next Avenue, from 1st Street towards Main Street. We're then driving north up our alley at home. I crouch down low to not be seen by anyone. I realize I'm dreaming. I'm not in the gray truck. I float up, flying. There are pine trees and hills around me distantly. I stop. I see my high school classmate Chris Yeller near the back garage door at home. Someone tells me to fly using me ears. I do, crossing my arms and legs, using what I think are my pointy, triangular ears to fly. I see my dead friend Mark Long as I scan the items in the dream. He is looking at me. I look at him and he smiles."

"1866"	"(08/06/1998)"	"I Eat Off The Ground I'm at a gathering that is later a church service. There are several groups of people there. I stand apart from these groups, separate. I'm waiting for something. We seem to be at or near the bus terminal in Auckland, New Zealand. One of the groups is wearing black with navy blue hooded sweatshirts. They seem to be gang-like. My high school classmates Donald Dilson, Todd Warden, and Sonya Nittles are there. I'm at a church service outside in my back yard. My grade school classmate Patrick Bergman is there, as are my friend's parents Elliot and Eleanor Teavor. I stand apart from the others. As I go up for communion I may be eating something: wolfing down the last swallow. I drop the host on the ground. Father Vance Brock is presiding, and he says to me, ""We don't eat off the floor in the 20th century."" I pick up the host and say, ""I do."" I eat the host as I walk away. I say it's okay because I remember when Father Vance or someone else told us it's our choice as to whether we pick up a host and eat it or get a new one."
"1867"	"(08/06/1998)"	"Rusty And Rich's Office I'm with my friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos. We get, make, or have very large sandwiches with meat on them. We go into an elevator on a building. We go upstairs, where I go into a room. It's my uncle Rusty Redding and cousin Rich Redding's office. They are both lying down. Rusty is on the couch without a shirt on, halfway covered up. I feel uncomfortable here with Rusty, which is unusual for me around him."

"1869"	"(08/09/1998)"	"Kevin's Simple Lifestyle I'm driving east on 3rd Street just past Friends Avenue in Wilmerton. There is a building on the northeast corner of the intersection of Gallop Avenue and 3rd Street. In the windows are large copper colored pictures of old pennies. This is a campaign strategy: to get old buffalo or Indian images on the penny reinstated at the mint. I'm driving south to my friend Kevin Simpson's house. I seem to be in an alley. I stop when I near his house. I'm in back of his house, which faces west on the west side of the block. It's early morning. I was at his house yesterday, but am back for something. There are stacks of newspapers outside on the ground. Kevin delivers papers. There are stacks of large envelopes that have been sent via Federal Express to his door. The house is a single story with a basement and no deck. I have a key to the door. The door is solid gray and whitish with no windows. It is unlocked. I go in and yell hello. I don't expect Kevin to be here. I'm in the basement. Kevin's cat is there, and I call it to me. Urine from the cat starts to drip and stream from the ceiling. Kevin is then there. He yells at the cat, which stops it from urinating and scares it off. I realize he has a partner upstairs in bed. I ask him, and he tells me he doesn't know who she is or where she came from: a one-night stand. I realize that the person we're speaking of is male."
"1870"	"(08/09/1998)"	"A Potentially Round Table I'm with my mom, brother Wally, and sisters Heather and Ramona in Sydney, Australia. We're on a small white tour boat. I look at a map that has a number of very colorful buildings on it. They're red and yellow, and made into odd shapes like amusement rides. The buildings are very bright. I see them: see the area to which the map corresponds. They line a shore a ways off in the harbor. The boat docks and the captain immediately starts taking tickets for the next tour. There are two grayish-white dogs on board. One dog has a bandana on, like a ribbon, to indicate that she is a female dog. We get off the boat and walk up a street to a restaurant. The area is older and has some brick. It's not dirty or uncared for, but is plain, quaint, and old. We walk. There are a few people walking near us, maybe going to the same place. We may pick up our pace to beat them to the place. The restaurant is on the left side of the road. We enter. I know the restaurant is about to close, and the bar will be open. I'm at a table with Wally in a small square room. There are short hallways into adjacent rooms where there are tables at which people are dining. We make commotion, tripping, kicking, or knocking things over. The people in one of the next rooms, behind me, seem to be upper class, ""proper and decent"" folks. They are annoyed by the ruckus we have caused, disturbing their meal. I think of closing the doors to the room so we won't disturb them. The table we're situated at seems to be quite open, in a well-traveled area of the restaurant. It is square, and made of dark smooth hardwood. It has a leaf on each side that flips up, creating a round table. I say to Wally that while the square table will accommodate four people nicely, since we have five people we should flip up the leaves to accommodate us all more comfortably. He doesn't seem keen on this idea. I think it's an easy decision for the comfort, practicality, and convenience of us all. I'm in an adjacent room. All the rooms have been decorated with tact and taste, and are neat and quaint, though others might describe them as elegant. There is a sort of mixer occurring: some event where people are socializing. A familiar face and voice catch my eye: my high school teammate Simon Naver! I stand up and turn around in surprise, asking myself if I'm dreaming. Simon is smiling and happy, and greets me energetically. I ask him in disbelief what the hell he's doing here. He replies that he's here because something happened to our old teammate Larry Rollie. Larry was supposed to be here to receive an award or honor, or was named to a special project or assignment in the community. Simon is here on Larry's behalf."
"1871"	"(08/09/1998)"	"Realigned Love I'm at home upstairs in the large bedroom in bed with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. The double bed is in the northeast corner of the room. We lay on separate side of the bed: no sex. She is near the wall; I'm on the outside of the bed. Neither of us can sleep, and we may communicate this to each other. We're tired but restless, unable to relax. It almost seems as if we're drugged up. We may go to someone to get drugs to help us sleep. The allure of touch grows between us. At one point I think that sexual contact between us always seems to happen. My sister Ramona is sleeping in the next, smaller, bed. There is a stereo in the room with a radar remote control that has right lights on it. Annie turns on the music. I'm worried that the music will awaken Ramona, or disturb anyone else in the house. It's very late at night, and the music will draw attention to anywhere or anyone. I think of this knowing also that the sexual activity that will soon follow the music is not the ideal situation to be found in when confronted by disturbed individuals. I look back in the small room, and see Ramona stir. At some point I know she has gone downstairs to sleep because the music disturbed her. I'm glad she has done this so we don't disturb her any more. I walk back to the bed. Annie is lying naked, her head pointing north, sideways on the bed. As I near her she spreads her legs wide open and bends her knees upwards: she is ready for and desires cunnilingus. I start slowly, rubbing my nose in the inside of her left thigh. She makes some high-pitched creaky noises: I'm tickling her. I lift her pelvis up a bit and lick the area between her vagina and anus. She laughs. I'm not embarrassed, uncomfortable, or at all deterred by this. She lies on top of me, and I think she will initiate penetration. The sexual contact stops. There's some discomfort between us. She asks me, ""How come... you're going to all these small places?"" She may have asked me this earlier before the music, and received a short, incomplete, ill reply from me. After a bit of a struggle we are both frustrated and she is about to leave. I say to her, ""Listen"", as I sit her down to explain myself. ""I've changed since being gone. Before I left my life was stable and constant."" She replies, ""Yeah, you used to be able to laugh at anything, make fun of anything."" I say, ""Now my life is not so stable. I'm not in the same place."" Something clicks in my mind and I choose to use a scene from out past to somehow illustrate what has happened to me. I say, ""When we were first-years in college we talked in your garage over Thanksgiving break, the first time we saw each other since the summer after high school. I told you I couldn't or didn't love the parts of you that were new, that I didn't know. The same applies here. I don't think there is any fault, it happens to everyone."" I say this to try to communicate that we change when we're apart and there is nothing wrong with those changes. Jake, Pia, and another person from the University of Wellington are there. They've heard our conversation and agree with me to some extent. I seem to have posed a clean, convincing statement of my view. It's about 5:00am. I think: how or why did these three people come to my house at this time of day? I think they must have just walking in the back door, since no one would be up to meet or stop them. I think maybe they're still out from last night, and wonder if they're drunk. We talk about the sleep cycle. One of the three says that the only sleep that matters is from 10:00pm until 2:00am. I say no: if one person sleeps 10-2, and another from 10-6am, there'll be a big difference! People seem to agree. I add that the person who sleeps 10-6 will live about 40 years longer! I tell them that all that information is in a book on the shelf, and I point to the bookshelf next to the south wall. I'm thinking of Moorcroft's 'Sleep, Dreaming, and Sleep Disorders', and I peer on the bottom shelf to see the blue binding of the book. I don't see it just then. The others get up and look. One of them pulls out a tall, wide, thick book with a clear plastic cover over the hardcover. It is called 'AIDS and the _____ (young athlete?)'. The man looks through the book. There are several removable sections in the book that he takes out when perusing it. Each section is on a subtopic. It's just beginning to get light outside. I look across the street. I see the outline of the figure of my high school classmate Chad Owens walking southward on the roof of my neighbors the Smith's house. Two of his brothers are near him on the ground. They're delivering newspapers. I stand up and walk over to Annie, who is standing a bit away from the bed. We share a hug. My left arm goes below her right arm and my right arm goes above her left arm. It's comforting, to her, I think. I feel strong and sure: stable, like I'm giving her support, comfort, and assurance. It's a warm, enjoyable embrace. We kiss, and continue to kiss as I slowly walk forwards, and her backwards, until she touches the wall. We're just to the south of the south window on the east side of the house. We're considering the different types of panes of glass in a window. It's as if Annie needs a window or pane or combination of panes. There seems to be a window with a single outer pane and two smaller inner panes that slide. The outer pane may be mesh: a screen. I say to Annie that she, ""Doesn't even need a salamander anymore"", because George Costanza has one."
"1872"	"(08/09/1998)"	"No Jacket I know my brother Wally didn't buy me a North Face Gore-Tex jacket because of some design detail having to do with the face, I think."
"1873"	"(08/09/1998)"	"Stephen Flushes The Toilet I am lying a bed that seem to be my brother Wally's bed in his new apartment in Grizzleton. My friend Stephen Ramos walks in and uses the bathroom. He is naked. He flushes the toilet because I didn't flush it when I urinated earlier."
"1874"	"(08/09/1998)"	"Stealing Sandals I'm in a grocery store relatively late at night. I walk by a man and woman and say g'day to them. My left shoulder and torso bump and brush their right side as we pass. This was an accident: I didn't mean to be rude. I see four people dressed in full bird-like goofy costumes. In a bin of some produce item I uncover a pair of sandals with brown leather straps. I think I'll take them, and I go to get a grocery basket. The sandals are smashed and wrinkled."
"1875"	"(08/10/1998)"	"Party At Kevin's I seem to be at my friend Kevin Simpson's house. There is a party-like atmosphere: lots of people are around. My friend Norman Noman is there. Our friend Hank Anderson may be there as well. A young Asian man is living in Kevin's father's old room. He gets ready for work, which may be at McDonalds. He sees to put a lot of cologne on: some added smell is strong."
"1876"	"(08/10/1998)"	"Carving A Pipe I'm with a group of people in a house that may be home. Some of us are going to smoke a hallucinogenic drug or mixture out of a pipe. I get a piece of wood about ten inches long from the garage. It's about an inch in diameter. I'm going to carve a pipe out of it. I have a red Swiss Army knife. I start to whittle the stick down. My brother Wally comes over and says that he wants to smoke too."
"1877"	"(08/10/1998)"	"Annie And I Test I'm at one end of a small rectangular room. There are people there. An argument is occurring. I'm nervous and uncomfortable about being here. There are physically strong and aggressive people involved in the conflict. I leave. I walk out of the room, picking up my ex-girlfriend Annie and carrying her out. We walk down a large hallway, like Scott Junior High, seemingly going west down the north hallway. I lift her up, and she sits on my shoulders. I have trouble balancing with her until she locks her feet behind my back. I walk down the hallway, crouching as we go below arches in the ceiling: low spots, so she doesn't hit her head. We near the end of the hallway and come to a large open room on our right. She tells me she thinks this is where she has to take a written test. I see many writing at desks, seemingly taking a test. People are waiting. I have a test to take as well: a different kind of test. It seems that Annie's test is more academically challenging. I think that this is appropriate because she is a keener scholar than I. Before I leave to go to my area, which is somewhere else, to test, she tells me that I had better call her, to stay in touch, or she'll track me down. She is serious. I feel good about myself because She cares about me, and I know I'll stay in touch with her. I don't know the room I'm testing in: I didn't make a point of remembering the room number. There's no time now to go back and look at the sheet that says the room numbers. I'm in a wooded area comprised of a few large trees and lots of undergrowth and brush. There is a packed dirt path, curving very gently through the vegetation. There are many pothole-like depressions in the path where rainwater has collected producing large puddles that forces one to skirt the edges of the path. I come to an opening where the forest clears. There is a huge fallen tree with a sign or metal plate on it indicating its age as about 1800 years (1836?)."
"1878"	"(08/10/1998)"	"Sledding In A Building I go to a large building with my friends Bubba Hacker and Stephen Ramos. We're planning on sledding. There are many businesses in the building. I see a brand new Mountain Market deli being put in. There are also other shops around. I approach one of the supervisors of the soon-to-be deli. She asks me if I have permission to be going sledding. I say yes, I talked to a man in charge on the phone, and he gave me the okay. She doubts the authority of the man I spoke with while trying to determine exactly who it was. She wonders if the person I spoke with was female. I say no, he was male. We talk about work, and I tell her I'd be more than willing to work a day or two at this deli. I tell her to just call me for problems or questions. I walk away with a red plastic sled that has a pointed tip, in my hand. We walk in this mall-like area. A food court is on our left. There is a place that sells fresh fish, advertising Walleye, Northern Pike, and more. I think, who would want to eat northern pike? We're headed sledding, on a slanted area inside this new building, which is not fully finished off or occupied."
"1879"	"(08/10/1998)"	"Walking Mount Vexer I'm at Mount Vexer in New South Wales. I'm inside a shelter with others. We're going to walk to the summit today. A few of us venture outside. I return shortly, to more adequately prepare myself for the walk. It's a very cold, clear day. I estimate it's close to 0 degrees Fahrenheit. I start to pull on a few layers of clothing. I put on polypropylene bottoms, my gray wool socks with the red stripe, and my old Vasque hiking boots. I may put another layer on my legs. I wear a new red mountaineering parka that my brother Wally has just bought for me. I have me green wool hat and my black and maroon gloves. On my back is my backpack containing my yak's wool sweater. I have a pink hip pouch that I fasten around my waist. I'm inside. My friend Reed Maxwell is there. I toss him a pair of white and red striped polypropylene bottoms. Our friend Fiona Ulness is there. She tells me I look like a guy that is pictured on a milk jug. I look at some jugs, but do not see or agree with her. Our classmates Grace Hanley and Jill Foster are there. I walk outside. There is frost on everything. I seem to be on the southeast end of the lake. I need to walk north, then west, to the summit. My jacket is fully zipped and secured. I feel good: strong, prepared, and ready to go. Reed is next to me. I find I have a beer in my waist pouch. Reed takes a gulp of it. A woman yells at us for having beer. Reed pours it out of the clear glass bottle onto the ground. I put the empty bottle back in my pouch where there is another full beer bottle. A large group of kids walks towards us from out right, down by the lake. They're leaving the area, and herd by us. I walk, and others follow me. We go through a forest with tall trees and little undergrowth. There are two forest service men chopping wood in the crisp air. They're fully dressed for the cold. As I pass them on their right one of them says to me in a storm trooper-like voice, ""Fan out."" I obey his direction and branch off the path to my left. He tells the others as they approach and they fan out as well. We reach an area that is a new track, all laid out. Two by fours bound it on each side, with fill in the middle. We're instructed to trample over the new portions of the track to pack them down. We do. We trample through rice, which quickly spreads from our feet to outside the bounded track. We also walk through mud. My friend Norman Noman and classmate Geoff Hamilton are among the group. I'm then in a group of people where a contest is occurring. There are some big, strong, powerful men there. It's possible that one could get hurt or killed. One of the big men seems to falter at his opportunity: he could, but doesn't throw a spear or dart a long distance. A man blows a dart at me. The contest involved direct physical impacts between two people. There is a large man with a mask. I get shot at twice from close range. Both four-inch darts pierce the skin of my chest, slightly to the right of my sternum. They do not penetrate farther, and I feel no pain. I laugh at the event. My body seems to be very, very strong, like it is impenetrable. It is then my turn. There is a bald man there, wearing a hooded cloak. I go easy on him, not really knowing or thinking of any good feats of punishments to impose on him. I spit a mouthful of a slurpee drink through a straw onto his head. He is like Spock from Star Trek. This is a silly and insignificant feat. It is embarrassing more to me for it's lack of aggression, but I don't want to really hurt the man."
"1880"	"(08/11/1998)"	"Encountering The McDyss Sisters I'm walking east on Main Street in Wilmerton. I cross the intersection and arrive at the corner where Dairy Queen is. I seem to wait to cross. Semi trucks pass. I go into the Dairy Queen. I look at the flavors of Blizzards and don't see any I usually order, and then order a large Milky Way Blizzard. It costs about $5. I give the woman a $20 bill. She gives me my change. I let the change sit on the counter, not noticing it. She comes back in a moment and gives me more money because she calculated my change wrong, and she's correcting her error. When she does, she gives me too much back. There is a supervisor-like woman there. I tell them to take about 60 cents away from my change. There is a large rose bush there. Its branches are thinly spaced. It is in bloom, and has pink blossoms. My friend Melanie McDyss and her sister Beth are there. We talk. The three of us are in a bed. I'm afraid they'll realize I'm attracted to them, so I play it cool. We're sitting at a table with others. There is a poem on the wall about Beth's adventures, particularly with men. She has been pretty wild. She goes and defecates in the bushes, and gives men her pubic hair. Melanie and I hug each other. I have been slouching in my seat with my elbows on my knees, while Melanie has been sitting upright. I'm so impressed by her. I'm in love with her. Her breasts are huge, which I notice when we hug. She is so amiable and friendly to everyone."
"1881"	"(08/11/1998)"	"A Better Breed Of Zebra There is a dead zebra and another animal. They are dead because the gene population is being altered, manipulated to produce a better breed of zebra. The dead zebra is small, and is moved to a different chamber with other dead animals. All the animals are in white plastic. They are small: no larger than a few feet high. This takes place in a sterile laboratory setting. There are many plain, spotless rooms for lab purposes."
"1882"	"(08/11/1998)"	"Stealing A Rye Fruit I'm outside a grocery store with two men I don't know. It's night, the store is closed, and lights turned off. There's a security video camera near the entrance. The men throw four packages of toilet paper at the camera to knock it off its normal surveillance area. The camera clicks a flash photograph, pointing directly at me. I quickly cover my face, but it's too late. They succeed in hitting the camera. We invade the building. The small store contains mostly fruit. One of the men is from North Dakota. He grabs a brown rye. It's stringy, like the outside of a coconut. He takes a few bits, then gives it to me. I take bites. It's sweet and good. We hurry through the store, taking two or three fruits. I think it's dumb to take just a little bit: not worth the risk of entering. We run into the back loading area and I see metal doors, like a garbage disposal or a loading ramp. I push an object away from the doors that is outside the building against the doors. We access the outside. It's a semi truck that I pushed. We jump out, having escaped. It doesn't look like we're being followed, but it's difficult to tell. We go down a dark alley away from the store. I'm worried we're being pursued. I walk faster, leaving them behind. On my right I see the backside of three houses with lights on. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas in each of the three houses. She looks exactly the same in each house: older, wearing a bright yellow t-shirt that has something to do with swimming. She has longer blond hair. She is attractive. She lives in each of the houses."
"1883"	"(08/12/1998)"	"Luggage Tunnel I'm at a hotel with three others. We check out of the hotel. There is a large friendly baggage man. When I walk out the door he tells me that we can give him our luggage and he'll put it in a large limousine-like vehicle. Then he says we can get a ride back to the place we're staying. The people I'm with come down the stairs and I tell them about our luggage option. The luggage man is really nice. The luggage goes through a tunnel to the car."
"1884"	"(08/12/1998)"	"Painting Teavor's House The house on the northwest corner of 1st Street and Bauer Avenue in Oak Valley has just been stained with wood stain. I'm near my friend Gino Teavor's house. I start to paint his house. It's its usual, ugly yellow color, and I paint over it. I have a flashlight, a paintbrush, and one other thing. I'm nervous that the Teavors will see or hear me painting. On the side of the house I think Gino may see or hear me. I run away. I'm at home with painting equipment. Greg and Loretta Slick and their family walk by. I try to conceal my painting equipment."
"1885"	"(08/12/1998)"	"Ethical Hunting I am at the Redding family farm. Grandpa Redding and my sister Heather are there. We are hunting or handling guns: .22 rifles. Heather questions my competency handling a gun. This threatens me. I think about shooting birds and animals if I will not eat them."
"1886"	"(08/13/1998)"	"Full Boats I going to the Big Resort Area with nine men! Two of them men I didn't know were going. Our party ended up with a big, full loud of men."
"1887"	"(08/14/1998)"	"A Fist Full of Trump I'm at a table playing cards with my siblings Wally, Heather, and Ramona and my uncle Rusty Redding. The game we play takes five cards. It's a relative mellow game: not lively. I suggest we play a game of hearts or double-deck feffer. Everyone aggress; we'll play hearts. We're under a car bridge next to a river with gravely, rocky, granite banks. Everyone has his or her hand of cards. I'm across a small channel, about 12 feet wide, from the others. I play a card, flicking it across the channel like a Frisbee. I ask if the cards are wax coated, because the card lands in the water next to the bank. They are wax coated. We play the game. I have no clubs, a good diamond and hearts hand, and four spades, some of which are high. I play cards, not realizing at first that hearts are trump. I try to bring out the joker because I know that some of the others are short-suited in red and I want my face cards to be good for tricks. I think the only way that one can beat them is to trump them with the joker. At one point I realize hearts are trump. I immediately reconsider because I see in my hand that I still have the joker and the jack, nine, six, five, and three of hearts! I must have had a lot of hearts to begin with! Rusty throws in his cards, indicating he thinks he'll take them all. I say wait!, I've got a fist full of trump! He and I are partners. He takes up his hand and we'll finish the game."
"1888"	"(08/15/1998)"	"Crazy Cliff Jumping I come to a small house-like building. A man walks out of the building. He has just signed up for a big jump: a crazy high jump out of a plane, with a woman. It will be later. The woman seems to have doubts about the jump. The man says, matter-of-factly, that they can't change that now: they've already signed up. I think the jump is a crazy feat that I wouldn't do. I see a photograph of a long backpack. It's a ""full mountain pack"" and is designed to fit a person inside it. I walk a short ways and am on a rock or cliff. There are two people with me. Their intent is to jump off the cliff, for fun. The rock ledge we're on slopes downwards gradually, then increasingly, and then is a sheer rock face. It's such that one may be able to peer over the edge for a look. I start to peer over. I'm very afraid of the height. I get down flat on my stomach and crawl towards the edge. It's too steep for me, so I'm going down headfirst just to peer over. I turn around because going headfirst is too frightening. I slide on the rock, not having a good grip. I say to the others, ""I'm sliding!"" They are unconcerned and say that I'm not really sliding. The man decides to jump. He says that he's jumping. He trots past me wearing shorts and tall black cowboy-like boots with no socks. He may have a funny hat on as well. He runs awkwardly with his knees high and legs out, like a comedian. He goes at a steady pace, a bit faster than a jog, and doesn't pause when he reaches the edge, hopping off. He drops below the line of visibility and I see only rocks. The cliff is very high, about 200 feet. I'm not even considering the jump: I think it is disastrous for me. At one point I see a person with a black backpack or parachute on. It doesn't look very sturdy. It's connected in front of the torso by two rings that are four or five inches in diameter. I'm in a dark room. There are photographs of two people on the floor. They may be landing sites of the jumps. In one of the photos is my acquaintance Heather Salley."
"1889"	"(08/15/1998)"	"Crazy Rubber Band Man I'm at home on New Year's Eve. There are two bedrooms on the main level: one is where the bathroom actually is. I'm in a bed on the west side of the dark room with my head pointing north. A woman enters accompanied by someone who tells her she can sleep in the bed with me. I know her: she is _____ (unclear). She is a relatively large person. I don't want to sleep in the same bed as her. I have just ejaculated on the sheets. I get up to sleep upstairs. The woman comments on how dirty and bad-smelling the bed is when she gets in it. I laugh. It's a pretty dirty bed, but I'm used to it: it's worn in, and I don't mind at all. I don't care if she doesn't like it. I'm in the bathroom. I'm naked and have a pink towel with fringed edges (from home) wrapped around my waist. I hear a noise outside. I run out the back door in the towel. I see a young woman with long straight brown hair, who was in my Philosophy of Psychology and Experimentation and Statistics classes with me, standing under the light near the back door. There is a lean and strong shirtless black man standing near the garage door. His skin is not too dark: reddish. He's holding a rubber band. His muscles are tensed. The rubber band may be stretched. He seems crazy or intense, almost in frenzy. Quickly I get others and myself in the house. I lock the back, front, and garage doors. I'm in frenzy. Someone calls 911. We're trying to keep the man out. Then the man is inside. Others or I tie him up with dental floss."
"1890"	"(08/15/1998)"	"Short Changed I'm at a casino with others. Playing nickel slot machines, I have just lost three hours or three days wages. I'm leaving with a man. I see two nickels in a slot machine coin tray. I drop them in the five-card draw poker machine. I go for it all, holding an eight and ten of hearts. I draw three eights. My four eights pays 46,000 nickels. In order to cash out I must first put down one ace, which means to choose a red or black ace. The ace is for approval, it seems. It makes no difference on the payout, but has to occur. I do this, and want to cash out. The hopper on the machine, which I know as the kicker, is empty. A man from the casino comes around and I try to get him to help me with my payout. He won't help or pay me. He says I was in the group of three guys who were loud or had caused trouble earlier. I argue honestly that I wasn't part of that. He still won't cooperate, so I grab him by the t-shirt with both my fists and threaten to expose his unfair treatment of me by announcing the man's actions to all the people in the casino. He seems to change his mind, then. I have given him a time limit, and he returns in a minute with another man who starts to unlock the machine. This doesn't come to fruition. It takes too long, or the man doesn't pay me. I turn and yell to the people around me about the incident that has just occurred, and how the man discriminated and was unfair to me even though I wasn't in a bad group. A few people turn and look at me, listening. Their reaction is not strong. No one is rallying behind me. One woman asks about my statement. I explain to her what happened. Not only is she unsympathetic, but she also says I'm gay, like the three guys. I'm flustered and mad: none of us are gay! I leave out a door, crossing a road. I say to a woman that 'quite' is not a word that gay people characteristically say, but that people from Australia do. I say this to her as if she's dumb for not knowing it. I walk down concrete stairs around the edge of a building. There is a woman in front of me. I may walk too fast and step on her heels. I don't go around her, though the steps are wide enough to do so. I see my classmate Sara Henry, who looks a lot like my classmate Heather Beckers. She is in a gray car full of people. They seem to be going to school. I go inside the building. Two young men are painting the floor blue in places, using long dowel-like sticks with mop-like heads. I steal a stick, wrestling it away from a man. I run, trying to spread the blue paint all over the floor, or track it on the floor. I trip over some large pies that are red and blue in color, and try to spread them all over the floor. I come to a stairway that doubles back. Students of the play Grease are on the stage in a rehearsal. I run up the stairs, disrupting the rehearsal. I yell at and threaten the director and the actors and actresses. I say emphatically that the play sucks, the acting sucks, and that they're doing it all wrong."
"1891"	"(08/16/1998)"	"Afraid Of A Cat A large, white, soft furry cat is sitting on my lap purring. I'm petting the cat, stroking its fur. It seems to be very content. I'm a bit afraid of the cat: I think it may rear up and scratch me, but it doesn't."
"1892"	"(08/16/1998)"	"Emily's Long Hair I'm sitting with my friend Emily Zates, and my high school classmates Becky Nolan and Mary. Becky is standoffish: she doesn't say much. Emily's hair has gotten longer."
"1893"	"(08/19/1998)"	"Deli Court I'm about to eat dinner. I look in a refrigerator case. There are some loaves of bread in it. Some of the bread comes with meat: it looks like two small loaves of bread with a clump of sliced meat in between them. There is one loaf of bread for 35 cents. It is from the 36-hour famine. It looks good to me: it's a big, long loaf of soft white bread. I grab one bottle of beer out of the refrigerator. Others are eating with me. I think of getting a beer for each of us: that would be a nice thing for me to do. My old flat mate Glen Ryan and my coworker Herald Jamison are there. I'm in court, which is a deli. Herald is on trial. My name is called to go to the witness stand. I'm surprised, and feel pressure. I'm sworn in. I put my right hand on a tub of hummus. I hold the tub with my thumb around the edge and my four fingers over the top. I try to keep my hand flat while holding it. The woman bailiff swears me in, asking me if I promise to tell the whole truth. I say, ""I do."" As I'm sworn in, my right hand and arm falls down, it seems as if the bailiff isn't holding the bible (hummus) anymore. I quickly glance at the judge to see if this makes a difference. The judge doesn't flinch, so I guess it's okay. I'm then on the witness stand. It's about six feet square bounded by a one or two-foot high fence made of wood or wire. The judge is to my right, at about 2:00. There are some ovens and some deli cases to the right of the judge. The prosecuting lawyer is questioning me. He is a young blond man. He asks me the name of the deli manager. I say her name is Patty. I don't know her last name, I say. He asks me if I see her in the courtroom. I say no, she isn't here. He then asks me if the inspector is there, meaning the health inspector at Mountain Market. I stand up and look around the courtroom/deli. I really don't know who the inspector is. By process of elimination I come up with a few people in the room who could be the inspector, based upon where people are sitting and whom I know has some other role in the room. I point out one man, and say that could be him. He is wearing a gray sweater and has gray hair. He is a big person. I say I don't really know if he's here: when we work we all have different tasks, and I just haven't taken notice of who he is. The lawyer then asks me several vague and indirect questions. I don't know what he's trying to demonstrate: where he's going with his line of reasoning. I'm very direct with him. I say very firmly, ""Why don't you tell the court where you're going with this."" He arrogantly says that he will. He then brings up my criminal history. I immediately feel threatened and think he may expose my speeding ticket or expired tab citation, or my stealing meat and cheese from the deli. He starts to talk about my life. He is speaking pure lies, trying to degrade my credibility. He says I missed bail three times. I realize that this guy is talking out of his ass: he doesn't have a clue about me. I yawn and stretch and scratch my head in contempt for him. I look around and see my friend Sam Kingsley and a woman who works at Mountain Market. By their facial expressions I know they know that the prosecutor is making it all up. The prosecutor rambles on without making a point. The people who know me know that what he is saying isn't true. My lawyer, who is Herald's lawyer, but seem seems like my lawyer or is on my side-because I seem to be on trial-is a woman with short straight dark hair. She is pretty. As I'm testifying a timer for the ovens go off. Patty, who is near the judge's bench, switches some food, maybe ribs, in the oven as the trial takes place."
"1894"	"(08/19/1998)"	"Autofellatio 16 I'm in a room with my brother Wally and two others. I'm masturbating, sitting on a toilet in the open. I use my left hand to stimulate my anus lightly while I masturbate. Pieces of feces come out of my anus. They are hard and crusty, some large and some small. I drop these pieces into the toilet. I think this is embarrassing and unusual that I'm masturbating in front of these people, but I don't concede the experience is any less real. It is also less disagreeable to me: some kind of social or mental compromise has been reached. Wally says there's no more lotion, which I had used to masturbate. I give myself fellatio by bending over. I'm not able to fit much of my erection in my mouth: just the tip. I decide I'll only give myself fellatio when I'm about to ejaculate. There is an area of the room where a shower curtain could be set up: there is a metal ring structure to which a gray shower curtain is attached. Wally comes over and helps me set up the curtain. There is a metal track-like structure attached to the ceiling, to which the curtain rings are attached. The curtain slides on this track. I'm wearing a pair of my button fly Levi jeans and white brief underwear, but my erection is exposed as we set up the curtain. I'm in the shower then, to have a private place to masturbate. There is almost no room between the shower curtain and the wall: no room to move, just to stand. I slide down to the floor, sitting, and lift the curtain over my head, putting it behind me. I unbutton my fly and continue to masturbate: I just want to ejaculate. Others see me, and I feel embarrassed, but I just want to orgasm. I give myself fellatio and semen comes out of my erection. It's very salty, and I spit it out onto a while athletic sock that I have. I don't have the physical sensation of orgasm, though I did suck some semen out, so I continue to masturbate to have an orgasm."
"1895"	"(08/20/1998)"	"Jackie's Father I'm with a person who may be my friend Melanie McDyss near a country dirt road. We walk towards the road. There are two people there. We talk about North Dakota tourists. I tell the people that the place to go is three miles in one direction. We cross a dirt road where there is fast-driving traffic, and walk down the road. We're in a car. There are six people in it. My friend Paul Jones is driving. We're riding to school. He drives fast; the shoulder of the road is bumpy. I sit in back on the right. I try to fasten my safety belt but the chest strap for it is broken. Paul asks us to close the windows to help clean or defrost them. I think it's already stuffy in the car, and say it will take ten or 15 minutes to air out and clean the windows whether they're open or closed. There is a new boat for sale. There are men in dresses who appear, something happens as a joke. We approach Tressel. I go inside when we stop at a gas station. I see a manual camera for $9.08. I stop to look at it, and am very interested in buying it. The man who runs the station comes over to me. He is my acquaintance Jackie's father. He talks about Jackie, and asks me if I know her. I say yes: She was in Australia when I was, and I lived near her Salt Lake City. He makes a comment on how we better watch out now that we're back in Tressel, implying changes in her relationships with men. He may think I'm one of her old boyfriends."
"1896"	"(08/20/1998)"	"The Tiger I'm hunting. There are five lions there. Or, there may be two lions there. I have an encounter with a tiger. I'm near the white house on the west side of Home Avenue in the middle of our block. The tiger charges at me. I take aim at it with my BB gun. I wait until it's within range, and I fire, hitting it squarely. It reaches me. I stab it in the face with the barrel of my gun. I fire then gun and stab it again, and repeat these things four or five times. The tiger dies. I'm inside the house, where I go to bed. My mom and my sister Ramona are sleeping. I say to my mom that the tiger, or my brother Wally, died four dreams ago."
"1897"	"(08/20/1998)"	"The Communal Soap I'm in a group of people. A man, who is our leader, holds up two bars of soap in a bag. It is the kind I'm using now: a pink bar of Caress. He says all of us have to shower using the soap: one person each day. I will shower on the last day. I'm in a circle of people. I'm the person others have to jump on to get elsewhere. They have to walk on me rather than on the ground. The first man tries to do this, and I feel pain. It hurts my back and body to have people step all over me. I appeal to my high school teacher, Jim Richardson, who plays a role in this situation."
"1898"	"(08/20/1998)"	"The Chain Laces I'm at an Armstrong High School physical education class. I need a shoelace, and I try to cut a chain to use as a shoelace. I may melt part of my clothing trying to do this."
"1899"	"(08/22/1998)"	"Mobilization Of The Soul I'm with the older Honduran man from Mountain Market. He talks to me, teaching me. I listen attentively to every word he says: I'm an eager student. We're like Carlos Casteneda and Juan Matos. We're near the ceiling. There may be some kind of a cylindrical structure there, possibly accompanying the teaching. I stand on something, which may be the white five-gallon plastic buckets, with covers, from Mountain Market, to get closer to him, in a final effort to understand his teachings. It is his time to go: to die or leave. Then, he is gone. I must follow him. I feel I must pursue him-not so much his physical body, but the whole person of him, and what he meant in my life. I lay in bed on my back. My right leg is bent at the knee, upwards. My left leg crosses my right leg: my left ankle resting on my right knee. I intend to will myself to go where this man is. I concentrate intensely, focusing all my energy. In some respects, I don't know what I'm doing, but I seem to have some sort of direction or knowledge that guides or directs me: an innate sense. I concentrate on moving. My body lifts up. I lean upwards and forwards. I see a pale image of my body separate from my physical body, which has not moved from the cross-legged position on the bed. My knees are a bit sore, and I think of the amount of time my physical body will be immobile: it will be uncomfortable to keep my knees still, but I disregard this. I continue to concentrate as my ""soul"" body separates from my physical body. I'm slightly surprised and amazed at what is happening, but am determined to continue the experience. I lift up out of my physical body on the bed. I stand, shakily. It's difficult to move. I'm a fledgling, a newborn: uncoordinated and weak. I steady myself and begin to walk, with increasing coordination. Then I realize I don't need to walk: I fly. I'm in an apartment. I fly through a doorway around the apartment, looking around. It is very neat. The walls are pink or coral in color. There is neat, modest furniture, very conservatively decorated. I want to see the man, because I know this is his realm. I will him to appear in one of two chairs with a small coffee-like table in between them. He does not appear. I realize that he is the apartment: that everything around me consists of him."
"1900"	"(08/22/1998)"	"Running With Kevin I'm near water on docks. My friend Kevin Simpson and a woman are with me. There's an unusual shaped dock, with many right turns, which Kevin and the woman walk around. I don't want to walk all the way around the dock. I want to jump in and swim across to the other part of the dock. The water is very dark: black. I'm not sure how deep it is, and am afraid of jumping in. I swing down on the dock, below it, holding onto the wood, and drop into the water, swimming the short distance to where the dock continues. We walk on, Kevin is next to me. We move quickly and deftly. There are grates on our path that close in front of us as we approach them. Kevin slides under some of these. I slow down: I'm not up for sliding under closing doors. The doors open up, they are like automatic garage doors. I grab some of them as they close, lifting them up, opening them. My fingers get pinched between the door and the ground. This doesn't hurt, and the door opens back up. I arrive at a group, where I take a folding chair and sit next to my high school classmate Analisa Paulsen"
"1901"	"(08/23/1998)"	"A Day At The Mall I'm in a car with my brother Wally and sister Heather. We come to the intersection of 2nd Street and Bauer Avenue in Oak Valley. We're on the south side of the intersection. The school lunch line running from Carter School to Jefferson School is very long. It blocks the road. We turn around and drop Heather off at home. Something happens with a green gun and a car mirror. Wally drives fast. Something happens with some sort of light. He drops me off at the Uptown Mall. Something happens with grocery carts. There are some uniquely designed old cars there. I'm inside the mall and my dad is there. He is very terse with me, giving me a $20 bill and an umbrella. I'm standing outside a video game store that is in the approximate location of Musicland. Inside the store boys are playing Pacman and skiing on a computer. People disperse, and I have my chance to play. I'm about to play, when I decide that I want my day at the mall to be productive, so I continue on. An employee from one of the mall stores walks up to another person or group near me. Someone gets man at the man approaching because he has been dripping soda in a trail behind him. I go into Smith's Sports through the entrance by Subway. I'm looking for #6 size fishing hooks with barbs. The hooks I see are flimsy: they're just prickly metal wires. I see my high school classmates Binky Ahmed and Nelson Eastman. We talk briefly. They, Nelson in particular, seem to be disapproving of what I'm doing. My mom and my sister Ramona enter the store. My mom has brought a box with a pair of shoes in it, which she has bought for me, so I can return them. Nelson leaves. I talk to a store employee. He is reluctant to accept my return of the shoes. I have ripped a shoe on top when on top of Mount Mary. I explain this to him."
"1902"	"(08/23/1998)"	"Ignorant Of My Actions I'm in a play with my friend Kevin Simpson. It doesn't seem or feel like a play: it feels real. We run though a ship on narrow walkways, turn sharp corners, and jump over blocks. The area seems to be made of grayish-white concrete. Three pirates are chasing us. I run past weapons that are on the ground: knives of different types. I'm a good distance ahead of the pirates, and in no need of a weapon. I'll leave them for Kevin. I may pick up a weapon later. I feel very confident in my ability to evade the pirates: I'm nimble, quick, and decisive. There is a confrontation, a battle between Kevin and I, and the three pirates. We have knives. We seem to be the ""good guys"". We spar. I may be stabbed or cut, but I feel no pain and notice no difference in my ability to duel. We are victorious, but it really seems like there is no big winner: it is just a duel. The play is over. I'm in a crowd of people. A group of people around me all have red or reddish hair. I feel that they are looking at me funny, as if they don't like me or have some interest in my and my actions. Most of them are not tall. I notice some of the women are attractive. Some of the red-haired people approach me and tell me I have nice skin, or skin like in a movie. I'm surprised by this comment. They're not talking about any part of my body's skin in particular, but I perceive the focus to be on my upper body. I'm outside. I'm running to the student union building at Brimson. I slow down and walk. I see my acquaintance Jim Henry going in the opposite direction of me, calling out his girlfriend's name: ""Jackie!"" I see him and jokingly call out, ""Jackie!"" I pass a young woman while I walk. She was in my Brain, Mind, and Behavior class. She has blond hair, prominent white teeth, and sat in the front of the room near the window. I near a building that has many large windows. Inside I see my friend Melanie McDyss waiting to make a phone call. I go into to see her because we haven't seen each other since we left for study abroad. I pick her up and we share a big hug. I'm very energetic. We fall on the ground, I'm still hugging her, very happy to see her. The hug ends abruptly. She seems to be taken back because of my energeticness. I feel out of place for giving her such a friendly, energetic greeting, because it appears to me that it was more than she expected and desired. We sit there, at a loss for words, feeling awkward. The conversation is dying and dull. Melanie's friend Erica Lange is then with us. We're sitting together, facing each other. They tell me that there are a lot of things I won't be able to do. I don't understand them fully, but from their tones I know they are reprimanding me for something I've done that they deem inappropriate. I think I must have done something wrong: offended or insulted someone, and now they are mad at me. I have no knowledge of what this could be. I feel uncomfortable, and get up abruptly and leave, saying a terse, ""Bye."" I walk to Armstrong High School, which is not too far away. I enter with no problem: I am asked no questions. I see some people I know, including my old classmate Larry Erickson. Then I see my friend Bubba Hacker. Bubba's first comment to me is something like, ""Oh, there's the guy..."" to the effect that he and everyone else know what it is I've done that is so radical and bad. This disgusts me. How can everyone know what I've done, and yet I am oblivious to it, I wonder. I'm frustrated, angry, and confused. I just want to know what it is. I say I'm going to defecate, and turn into the bathroom near the freshmen lockers. Bubba also enters to defecate. There are two stalls with no door on either. As we sit, we look out towards the sinks. The stalls are divided, but due to the mirror above the sinks we can see each other. I ask Bubba emphatically what is going on: why everyone but me seems to know what's going on with me. He replies something like, ""You know how ____ (a woman) is attracted to you? Are you attracted to her?"" I honestly reply no. Bubba says, ""Well, there you go"" indicating that my lack of attraction to women is my problem. I'm confused, and don't believe what he's saying: I don't think that is the problem. He gets up and washes his hands. I defecate a lot, and for a long time. The toilet bowl is metal. Toilet paper comes out of the inside of the toilet bowl on the right side, like out of a box of tissues. The toilet paper is brown and yellowish, in clusters, folded like a tray of sliced deli meat. It seems to have already been used. My feces are soft looking and yellowish."
"1903"	"(08/30/1998)"	"Large Trip Group My friends Gino Teavor and Simon Naver are going to the Big Resort Area with my and the rest of the party. This gives us a larger group, of eight people."
"1904"	"(09/07/1998)"	"Exposed Some books and other information are stolen. A death is faked. A big cover-up is exposed. Others and I learn about this cover-up, we see what is really happening."
"1905"	"(09/07/1998)"	"Hilary's Date With Wally I have a sexual encounter with my friend Hilary Nano, and we have sex. I give her cunnilingus. She has a date later with my brother Wally."
"1906"	"(09/08/1998)"	"Disturbing Night I get a phone call. It's late: either 2:00am, or 7:00am. It's my old girlfriend Jackie Hunter calling. I can barely hear her. She is talking strangely. I have recently spoken with her, before she called. She may be drunk-I think she is. She rambles on for a while, and eventually I hang up. A group of young people-my age- arrive back from a night of partying. I'm in the large bedroom upstairs at home in Oak Valley. The people want a place to sleep. The house is pretty crowded. My friend Nat Miller is there. My friend Stephen Ramos is in a smaller bed in the southwest corner of the room. His dog Spot is with him. Spot starts to bark and growl when the people come near him. I don't want these people (one woman and one or two men) to sleep just anywhere. I tell Nat he can sleep in my mom's room (she isn't here). Then I suggest the floor downstairs for the others, in an attempt to put some distance between them and I, so I still get a good night of sleep. One of the men suggests that he sleep in the bed with me. I don't like that idea: I would feel crowded. I remember the basement, and tell them that one can stay in the small bedroom, and the others in the family room."
"1907"	"(09/11/1998)"	"Combat At Washington I'm at Washington University inside a building. There is a man captive inside. I'm holding a brown book as if it is a gun, pointing it at the man. Other people are there. I'm outside the building then. I'm fighting a group of men that includes my grade school classmates Gino Teavor, Patrick Bergman, and Jerry Kasper. I'm greatly outnumbered. We fight. I'm quick, and I land many punches with my left hand. They are quick, sharp blows but they seem to have relatively little impact. It's winter, there is snow and ice covering the ground. There is an older man there. He has large (ten inch) cubes and chunks of explosive material that I know to be fire bombs. When dropped on the ground these explode within five to ten seconds. This is enough time for me to get away from them. I run away from several bombs that are thrown at or dropped near me. I slide on patches of ice, on my stomach. There are nuns there who comment on the trees surrounding us. The nuns say there are too many trees. I disagree with them, expressing my fondness for the trees."
"1908"	"(09/11/1998)"	"Tree Leaping I'm in the Big Resort Area. I'm at the top of trees. I fly or leap from one tree to another."
"1909"	"(09/11/1998)"	"Bell Sinker Photo I return from fishing, maybe in the Big Resort Area. I didn't get any huge fish. I talk to my brother Wally. The boat is parked in the alley behind the house for now. My mom takes a photograph of me and my fishing rod, which has only a bell sinker tied onto the line."
"1910"	"(09/12/1998)"	"Scared I'm with a semi-truck driver. He is belligerent. We fight. He is very persistent. Our fight is just a scuffle: no serious blows are delivered at first, but it continues. He is a short, slim man. He may be Mexican. I clutch the back of his head and smash his head and face into a wall. He falls down and lies on the ground. I see that his head is bleeding. This has an emotional impact on me: it is serious in comparison to our scuffle. There is just a small amount of blood, but it's significant: it frightens and startles. Me. There is a wood structure about two feet square made of layers of wood pressed together, a few inches thick. There's a head (of the man) smashed between some of these wood pieces. Bits and pieces of brain, skull, and blood drip and pour out of the wood structure. I try to figure out which way is 'up' on the structure so the blood and brains will remain in the fragmented portion of the skull and not drip out. It's of no use: every way I flip the structure blood still drips out. There is not much blood left in it. There are other people around. A grocery store is right next to where we are. I'm with several people. We all seem to be employees of the store. I will get off work in 20 minutes, at 9:30pm. I need to conceal this death, because it is scandalous. Some sort of plan materializes. It seems to be a group idea that I will have to implement myself. The body needs to be disposed of, and it needs to appear as if I entered the cab of the semi truck through the sun-roof-like opening. I'm in a bedroom that I know is mine. Many things are made of brown wood. There is a container of petroleum jelly on one of the beds. I think a man must have left it out there after masturbating. I grab one of the small flashlights I have. There are a couple batteries on the bed that look like size 'D', but are shorter and fatter. I climb up ladder-like stairs to the cab of the semi truck. The steps are made of wooden dowels, one inch in diameter and a foot long. I'm scared as I climb. I think someone may be in the cab waiting to harm me. I get up to the cab and see it's empty. There are a couple shelves with numerous items laid out very neatly on them. The shelves are the cab, essentially. There are wood cabinet doors around the shelves, like bars. I take several keys off a shelf. Some of the keys are gold, attached to gold key rings. Some keys are small, like our old square freezer key with a round tip. I have to use the keys to start and move the truck. I'm on the ground. There is a noise. It's a curious, strange noise that I find frightening. I dismiss and ignore it. I hear the noise again. Others look to see what it is. The noise seems to be coming from a pile of wood and metal scraps. Then its source is uncovered/exposed. It is something covered in black plastic. I know it's a person who is in sordid captivity, but is alive. I'm afraid of the person. I'm hesitant to get near the plastic, of getting involved in any way with the person or thing in the plastic, because I'm afraid it will harm me. Someone (me?) removes the plastic at one end, and we see it is a man. I'm afraid of him. He extends his arm, holding out a letter for me. I take them quickly. I'm involved in a situation that is greater than I: held and captivated by it. The letters may be from my sister Ramona. I'm scared of the letters. The writer, who is not Ramona, knows a lot about my life, and me and yet I'm unfamiliar with him. It seems there are instructions in the letters: things about me: my past, present, and future, and things that I have to do, from a source greater than I. I'm scared to read the letters. Others look at the letters and read them for me."
"1911"	"(09/14/1998)"	"The Gambling Sickness I'm with my siblings Heather, Ramona, and Wally. We're going to a play at Ford's Theatre. We're outside. I get into my mom's Chevy Celebrity; I'm driving. The car is very clean. I go to pick them up. We're in a casino that we've stopped at. I play a few quarters in a random slot machine. I talk to someone-maybe Wally- telling him about a woman who defaulted on her loans, and then won enough at the casino to make a payment of $8,000 towards the principle of her loan. As my slot machine spins I say it would be nice to win enough to pay a chunk of loans like that. I turn and look at the slot machine. Numbers stop spinning: 2, 0, 0... As they stop one by one, I imagine the best: the jackpot, of all zeros after the two. The numbers keep flipping, and are all zeros! I have won 10,000 quarters! I start to laugh! Wally is there. Bells on the machine go off. The machine has stopped at 171,000,000 coins. Wow, I think: I've won a lot. I call the attendant over. She asks me if I want a check. I say yes. I reconsider and ask the siblings if we should gamble more instead of going to the theatre. They say yes, so I tell the woman attendant I'd like $1,000 cash and the rest in a check. She tells me she'll need my ID and a cologne sample. I say I'm not wearing any cologne. There is a hassle over my ID. They need a photograph to validate my identity. They ask for a photo of me with a moose! I tell them I don't have any such thing, but that I can get a photograph of me with my two siblings, Wally and Ramona. I stand in a circle with the attendant and a group of casino regulators as we discuss and argue over the ID issue. The regulators are against paying me without their conception of ""proper"" ID because they argue it will decrease their odds of winning. The attendant has the check in her hand: a stick of gum. I recognize the evil in gambling: the sickness it is, when all the regulators are there. I have gotten lucky, and should remember that I'm very susceptible to the sickness."
"1912"	"(09/14/1998)"	"Buying Kevin Pudding I have just returned from the Big Resort Area with my friend Bubba Hacker, and we're in a grocery store. We're buying small plastic cups of pudding for our friend Kevin Simpson. There are different flavors, and they have whipped cream on top. They're cheap: we buy Kevin five or six. I see my friend Stephanie Peterson and say hi. We leave. I give Bubba $15 gas money for driving back from the Big Resort Area."
"1913"	"(09/14/1998)"	"Postponing Trip Cleanup I arrive at my dad and Lisa's house, which is a white house with a garage, not a townhouse. My mom has driven me here. I have a canoe with me that is filled with gear for camping, paddling, and fishing. My friend Niles Zelling is at the house. The canoe is aluminum, and is in the garage. My dad and Lisa come out. I ask them if I can clean up all the stuff from the canoe trip tomorrow: it's a mess. They say that's okay."
"1914"	"(09/14/1998)"	"Kevin Costner Explorer Kevin Costner is an Antarctic explorer. His ship gets burned, and he loses much of his gear, but he still has some cold weather items. He is stranded on an island. It gets dark and windy very quickly. There are no matches to light the stove with. There are four men on an island. There is a fight with a bear. Some or all of the men survive."
"1915"	"(09/14/1998)"	"Newlywed With Two Wives I'm a newlywed, married to a young black woman. I have two wives; my other wife is a young black woman too. I am having sex with one of them. The woman's father is there. I assertively tell him to go away: his daughter is my wife now! This is a bold move by me. She and I have sex. She has an orgasm, I come close to an orgasm. I try to get her to give me fellatio. She may do this eventually. My friend Tiny Combs and others are there."
"1916"	"(09/16/1998)"	"Running Scared I'm with two men, one of whom has a motorcycle. The other man and I ride on the motorcycle behind the driver. At first I ride on the far back, while the other man rides in between the driver and I. We're near or in the Railroad Company land, east of where Home Avenue extends northward from 3rd Street, and north of 3rd Street, in Oak Valley. There area is sandy dry dirt. The driver has double-crossed us. He tries to befriend us, to reconcile our differences. We get back on the motorcycle, I sit in the middle of the two men. We go south on Home Avenue. We're going to my home. We go past my house. A police officer appears behind us. The driver leaps off the motorcycle at the sight of the police car, and runs in a southeast direction, towards Roman's house, trying to evade the officer. I grab the handlebars of the motorcycle. The officer pursues the fleeing man. I think that I'm free from any inquiry of the officer. I wander over towards Next Avenue, going by Smith's garage, back near Mrs. Shelly's garage. I realize I'm going the wrong way: I could be going away from the officer, going northwest towards my home. I have a vehicle with me that seems to be a four-wheeler. I hear a vehicle speeding north, towards me, in the alley. I know it's the police car. I leave my vehicle and quickly dive forward into the long (one to two feet) grass in front of me, hoping that the police car will speed by and not see me; that I will be partially obscured by the white garage in front of me. As I land in the grass the police car comes to a screeching halt to my immediate left. I look, feebly. This deft officer has the fleeing man in his squad car. The officer gives me instructions as I lie on the ground on my stomach. He says to tap my knee and then my toe on the ground. It seems almost like a dance. I don't understand why he wants me to do this, and I question it. I don't think I've done anything wrong, but it seems that I have."
"1917"	"(09/16/1998)"	"Catching A Puddle Fish I'm walking westward down a road that seems to be 1st Street North in Oak Valley. There is a little water on the side of the road with some weedy much. I'm with several people-maybe my dad and my sister Ramona. My friend Kevin Simpson is a few steps behind us. He makes a cast with a fishing rod to the right side of the road in a few inches of water. Immediately a fish strikes his lure. It must be a bass, I think. I'm playing the fish. It's a nice fish. I'm near a dock on a lake. My dad has landed the fish. It's a big northern pike, about five pounds or so. I have a camera, and I take a photograph of it. The fish is back in the water to be released. I grab its tail and move it back and forth in the water, reviving it. It swims away. I'm in the water. I have lost hold of a shotgun. As I flounder in the water I bump into it as it sinks down in the water. I grasp for it and grab it, glad that I've not lost it. There seems to be a swimming pontoon there."
"1918"	"(09/16/1998)"	"The Fighting Fish I'm fishing in the Main River in Wilmerton on the cement wall below the dam near Wilmerton University. There are several women on my right. One of the bobbers we're floating gets a hit. The fish runs, and the bobber moves on the surface. I coach the woman on my right, half demonstrating how to play the fish. I flip the bail open and let lien out until I see the black of the spool and know I'm running out of line. I flip the bail closed and set the hook; the fish is still running hard. The rod bends sharply. It's a lightweight rod that I don't want to break. The fish runs hard. I am pulled off the ledge and plunge into the water. The fish runs along a small island, in circles. I get to a point where I have taken up some line and seem to have the fish isolated in a pool in front of me."
"1919"	"(09/16/1998)"	"Shotgun In The Locker Room I enter a basketball locker room with a shotgun. My old high school basketball teammates Binky Ahmed and Greg Kulik are there. They give me a hard time about having the gun. I take no shit from them. I'm very terse and stern. I am belligerent and am easily provoked."
"1920"	"(09/16/1998)"	"Blowing Off Steam My housemate Norman Noman and his girlfriend Sunny Pile have been busted by the police for having sex in public places. The next day the police, their parents, and relatives gather with Norman and Sunny to confront, reprimand, and scorn them. Norman makes a caustic comment towards Sunny's mother: something about smelly feet or shoes. He seems to have contempt for Sunny's family's disapproval. These people are gathering in cars. Norman and I are with our housemate Hank Anderson in his car. Hank is driving. We speed by the people in this field-like area. There are some grassy patches, with dirt and mud. We drive through the puddles, splashing the people that have come to reprimand Norman. Hank, Norman, and I walk away. Norman walks between Hank and I. He is angry because of what has happened. Hank and I try to comfort him: to relax and calm him down, help him forget about the incident. I'm with my friend Niles Zelling and another male friend. Niles is very mad, and he throws a football very hard to release some of his anger."
"1921"	"(09/16/1998)"	"Jumping Off The Moon I'm looking out a window with two other people. I see a scene where a crowd of people is entering a door-like area. I know it has to do with Australian Aboriginal dreamtime. Out the window and down a bit is the earth or moon. I'm on the moon (or earth). I can run and jump to the other, and I choose to do this. I think briefly of the hazards, but I just go. I run and leap out the window. I fall very short of the moon, but I know that I can fly and can utilize my dream body. I float up onto the target destination. I encourage the others to do so and they do. My friend Nat Miller is one of them. We enter an apartment stealthily; I lead."
"1922"	"(09/16/1998)"	"My Mom's Old Film I'm in the garage at home. I uncover a pit in the cement floor that had been concealed. It has old rolls of film in it: some used and undeveloped, some unused. It is my mom's film from the early 1980's. There is some high-speed film: 700 or 800 ASA. There are a few photographs in the pit too. I talk to my mom about the pit. She seems to have forgotten the items there and is almost reluctant to speak of them or deal with them. She says the film is expired and is no good to use."
"1923"	"(09/19/1998)"	"The Illuminated Night I'm in a barrack-like structure. I show a man where his bed is: next to mine. He has a body sheet wrapped around him for a sleeping bag. I have a small trash bin near my bed. The man has a sleeping bag. I'm outside sleeping. It's dark. I awaken. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are there, in sleeping bags. I'm lying down in shallow water in a sleeping bag; the water comes up to my neck . I take big gulps of the water. Tim says he wouldn't drink the water because it's muddy. It's kind of muddy; I drank before I stirred up the mud on the bottom. There is lake to my left, and a bleacher-like area where people have gathered. Police are there. I leave the area I'm in and creep through the bushes on a path that turns towards the people. I see a tennis ball on the ground. I get pinesap on my hand as I walk; it brushed up against a tree. It's a well-lit night: the moon must be out, though I don't see it. I see the Brimson crew team on the lake. My friend Tom Napper is coxing. They row fast. They approach the shore, not slowing, and scrape the boat up onto the rocky beach. The boat they row has two main aluminum hulls, like and elongated pontoon. The Brimson golf team is playing near the shore. My classmate Katie Grendvig hits a drive. I feel like giving a verbal commentary, a play-by-play, of what is happening. I have a good feeling, being out on an illuminated night."
"1924"	"(09/19/1998)"	"Wally's Enormous House I'm in Utah at my brother Wally's house. It's a very big house with many rooms and a deck. There are other houses around it. I'm on the deck with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We start to have a sexual encounter. I give her cunnilingus. Something I do with my mouth or teeth hurts her clitoris. I try to learn what it is so I can change what I do. A bit later we're inside one of the many rooms. We start to kiss again. She says to me in a firm voice that I love her but she doesn't love me. This is a very bold statement, I think. Wally and others are in the house cooking a meal. The meal is prepared, and he calls for me to come join them. It's easy to get lost in so many rooms and hallways in the house. I have some difficulty finding where the rest of the people are. I look for them."
"1925"	"(09/19/1998)"	"Grandma Redding Dies I receive a phone call from my mom. We talk. As she speaks I understand that her mom, my Grandma Redding, has died. My mom talks about her. I feel my emotions sink, and I slowly start to cry. I hear my mom's tears on the phone as she continues to talk about grandma. I'm filled with grief and sorrow from the loss. I have an image of grandpa, being alone now."
"1926"	"(09/21/1998)"	"The Dam I'm flying with my friend Melanie McDyss and her family. We seem to be going west, following Main Street out of Wilmerton. Melanie and I are in contact: I have my arms wrapped around her legs, while her knees are pulled up towards her chest. I seem to be attached or supported by a thin metal wire that stretches across the sky. We are whisked over the ground-the wire may move. We fly over a river, very low, close to the water. I know that we are, or this is like, flying over New Zealand. I turn or am turned backwards as we fly. I see the family behind us. The clouds in the sky are dark, in contrast to the other clouds around them, which are puffy, light and dark: very ominous and beautiful. We come to an immense dam made of light-colored concrete. It is several hundred feet high: huge! There is a small amount of water flowing out of the top of the dam. Melanie and I fly and float above the dam, high above the water. She and I embrace and kiss. We float and fly, doing a backwards loop-de-loop, which is a mind-bending experience at this height. We continue to kiss, and have a sexual encounter in the air. We descend a bit, rubbing up against the damn. We're in a large bathroom that has several stalls with her sister Beth. Beth leaves. I close three doors after her. She has a good idea of what Melanie and I are doing. We continue to have a sexual encounter after Beth leaves."
"1927"	"(09/21/1998)"	"Cliff Fishing I'm fishing with my friend Paul Jones. I catch a couple of tiny fish. We're using small and medium fish for bait. I get a large fish that looks the same as the smaller one I caught. I catch them off a cliff. I see the water below me through a hole in the soil: the cliff is undercut. We jig off the cliff for the fish."
"1928"	"(09/21/1998)"	"Emerald Reinhold's Scar I'm with my friend Emerald Reinhold and others. I persuade Emerald to let me cut a piece of flesh from her stomach, where a scar or cut is. This may be for fish bait. She has a long scar on her leg. I take a photograph of my uncle Rusty Redding, cousin Melvin Redding, Emerald, and my sister Ramona by pulling a string, which sets off a timer."
"1929"	"(09/21/1998)"	"Relegating Melanie To Back A large semi-truck is outside a liquor store. The store is being stocked, and there is lots of alcohol near the back entrance that has been unloaded and is waiting to be moved inside. I'm with my friend Hank Anderson. There are crates of bread on the back of the truck, for storage and hauling. We rearrange some of the bread. There are some sandwiches in different compartments on back of the truck: meat and bread. A woman, who may be my friend Melanie McDyss, is made to sit on back of the truck in one of the compartments. I'm glad about this."
"1930"	"(09/22/1998)"	"Overzealous Fishing I'm fishing in a canoe with my dad and other people in other canoes. People are casting near a brush pile. My Dad is overzealous: he gets too close to the brush pile and moves too fast. He falls in the water. There is a boat and a canoe there. Everyone falls in the water. My friends Hilary Nano and Nat Miller are there, having a sexual encounter in the water. I go over and poke them playfully. There are some things on the lake bottom that I pick up, including rope and film."
"1931"	"(09/25/1998)"	"A New Apartment I'm in a new apartment. It's for three people. I'm living there with two other men. We're on the third floor, and are called number four. We may be number 304, but I'm not sure. There are some women in the building in different apartments."
"1932"	"(09/25/1998)"	"How To Ripen Fruit I'm in the back end of a station wagon at home. My mom and my sister Ramona are there. I have a banana. I explain to them that ripening fruit gives off a gas called ethylene. That is why if you contain a fruit in a plastic bag the gas that collects in the bag will cause it to ripen faster than if it's in the open. I tell them that I just learned that fact."
"1933"	"(09/25/1998)"	"Pursued I'm with a group of young Asian adults, my age. They talk fast. I don't feel comfortable with them because I don't fit in. They talk about their dating relationships. We're under a bridge or overpass. I'm fitting a green coin-like disk to the underside of the overpass. There are two other coin-like disks there that are a different color. The purpose of the disk is to be antagonistic: there is a woman chasing us. The coin is a sign for her, it is a clue, as if I want to keep her on my trail. I'm outside of a building. I may have just parked a vehicle. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper pulls up in an old car, parking it next to the building. I'm inside a room in the building. The room appears to be empty. There are two closet-like openings in the room that have no doors. I look in them: things appear to be neatly stacked; I don't see any people. I think or sense that people are there. I say, ""Guys, it's me!"" and two groups of people emerge from hiding. I'm surprised because I didn't see any places to hide in the room. The people seemed to come out of the woodwork."
"1934"	"(09/27/1998)"	"Refusing A Drink I'm at a bar with two of my friends. We have a beer. The bartender makes up shots: drinks for the others and I. I'm hesitant to drink it. I feel a lot of pressure to drink it, but I really don't want to. I resist, and decline the shot tersely, asking for the tab. The bartender is visibly disgruntled by my rejection of the drink. I examine the check closely, making sure I didn't get charged for something I didn't drink. The bartender is forced to throw the drink out. He throws it out outside the back door of my home in Oak Valley, which is where we are. The bill is for three beers and two shots."
"1935"	"(09/27/1998)"	"A Family Picnic I'm at a large picnic-like gathering outside with my dad and my siblings. There are many tables that quickly become occupied. We find and empty table. It's large and made of grate-like black metal. People start to eat. It is a help-yourself sort of meal. People go and get pieces of meat, strips of chicken or steak, and eat it. I hear there will be more than enough for all of us to eat. I see an empty table. Since we're sharing a table with others, I think of telling the family that we should move. But I don't say anything, and soon the open table is occupied. I see a large pallet of drinks: cans that are stacked up. It is help-yourself, so I go get a can. I grab a beer from the bottom. It's a long silver can. There may be soda there too."
"1936"	"(09/27/1998)"	"Vacation To Australia I'm about to fly to Australia with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona for a vacation. I'm talking with my cousin Melvin Redding on the phone. I say I need to stop talking to pack for my trip or I'll miss the plane! It's true: I'm not prepared for it at all, I'm just winging it. My high school basketball teammate Olie Kecker is there. We may be in my mom's bedroom. I try to decide if I should bring one or two bags. I'm going to pack very lightly: barely having anything and scraping by. We're at the airport. I run back to exchange or pick up something at the last minute-maybe to exchange a bag. I think I may not be bringing a camera."
"1937"	"(09/28/1998)"	"Horseback Northbound I'm traveling north on horses with my housemate Stephen Ramos and a second person, who may be my housemate Hank Anderson. At some point I think the second person I'm with is a woman. We're near the artic circle. When we get to a certain point, which may be the northernmost island in the world, we get off our horses. We let our horses go when we get there. The horses, which I see as a metal radio-controlled car-like object, continue to go north. We turn back, walking on the ice and packed snow. We jump over ravines, snow chunks squishing beneath our feet. Some of the snow slides, breaking off in a small avalanche. The woman is swept down into a v-shaped ravine. Stephen is swept after her, but not as far. I tell him I'll grab his hat, which has fallen off. I do, then slide down the ravine to help the woman. I grab her hand. She has trouble getting her footing as I haul her up. Her feet slip on the snow. The snow is then gone in that area, and she slides down a rock ledge. She catches her footing on a rock just above the water. We make it back to the ending place. There are three people, including my friend Kevin Simpson, there that I know. I'm happy to return. I'm very tired. My greeting with the two others is lukewarm, but with Kevin my greeting is strong, excited, and happy."
"1938"	"(09/28/1998)"	"Integration of Opposites I see words that are written that have to do with the integration of opposites. I know something happens with the integration of opposites."
"1939"	"(09/29/1998)"	"Lucid Graduation Practice I'm at Carter Church for a graduation practice ceremony. I'm in a pew at the back right side of church. We're being called row by row to walk up the center aisle and around back to our seats. People's names are called, row-by-row, from the back. I walk up with my row. There is a mistake made: I'm out of order. I think it's no big deal because this is practice. I'm back in my seat: the last person on the right end of the pew. I see my high school classmate Kory Reynold's father walk up the center aisle. He's a big, scruffy biker man with dark hair and facial hair, wearing a ripped black Harley Davidson tank top under a blue flannel shirt. He responds to someone at the back of church when he walks up the aisle, disregarding all of their concerns and interests, shrugging them off like a brute. My friend's brother Jasper Yams returns from his walk up the aisle. He is tall, and has a black cast on his left arm. He stops to say something to my friend Matt Yams, who is sitting in front of me in the next pew. In the pew in front of me are Matt, Kory, Gino Teavor, my dead friend Mark Long, Nolan Sires, and others. I think of people's last names and the order they have been called. I realize that I'm out of order. I look at the group in front of me, and see Mark. He is a boy: a little, young grade school kid with messy hair and a cute face. I look at him, saying, ""Mark."" I know I'm dreaming because Mark is dead. I stand a float upwards, looking and pointing at Mark."
"1940"	"(09/30/1998)"	"Internal PH My housemate Stephen Ramos explains that his unique body odor, which is a funky smell, is due to a change in his internal ph."
"1941"	"(10/01/1998)"	"Paulette Redding's Husband I'm in a house. My aunt Paulette Redding is there, talking to her two sons, Phil and Kyle Jessen. She says that she's going to work ten hours today. I think it's good she's working ten hours: she needs the money. She had the day off yesterday. She also says that her husband has to go back to work today. I see him lying in bed. It's about 8:00am. He gets up. I have just gotten up and am lounging around. He is a tall (6'6"") pale white man with a belly and not much body hair. Eventually we shake hands and meet, but we're both standoffish at first. There are two men in their 20's there. They're the grandsons of a Mrs. Johnson. I meet them and shake their hands. I'm driving out to Many Fish Lake on the frontage road next to Superhighway 100. There are brilliantly colored flowers along the roadside. I'm following a vehicle in front of me closely. I realize this and I slow down. There seem to be three colors in the flowers, in a pattern. I play visual pattern-seeking games with the flowers as I drive. At the lake, it is a very cool fall day. There is a horse standing in the water close to the shore by the boat launch. A few people are playing water sports. I have a tube to fish off of, but I don't want to get wet because it's too cold."
"1942"	"(10/02/1998)"	"Lucid Wundt's Five Shooter I'm outside near buildings. I seem to be on a nearby rooftop, with many buildings around. There are people on the rooftops below me. One of them is a man throwing bottles into windows that are higher up on nearby buildings. The buildings begin to crumble, and the people leave, going up a ladder or stairway. I'm with my friend Sherman Andrews, standing on a rooftop. I say to him that one of us is going to be eliminated: is going to die. I say this very matter-of-factly, with not much competition. We both start to move to get out of the area. I jump down 20 or 30 feet off the roof. There seems to be a large cushion-like object nearby to jump on, but I don't do this. We enter a narrow stairway from one of the rooftops. I'm about 20 feet ahead of Sherman. He gets squeezed or caught in a door at the bottom of the stairs, but squirms through it. I know that I have Wilhelm Wundt's handgun. It has to do with the number five, like a five-shooter. It hangs on my belt over my right hip. I'm walking down a dark hallway, not seeing anything. I realize I'm dreaming. I continue to walk. My footsteps are very loud and resounding: my boots sound firm, strong, and hard; powerful! I try to focus my concentration to remain in the dream. I will the setting to be light, and a very bright light appears in front of me in the shape of a candle flame or almond. I walk towards this light. The light is then a yellowish circle with a smiley face in the center of it, like this:_. The smiley face has a curly moustache on it, like in the board game Monopoly. I'm nervous and edgy about this situation as a whole. I have my right hand on my gun, but don't draw it. I awake [false awakening] in an apartment or condominium-like building. I have the feeling I've been walking, and I wonder if I could have been sleepwalking. I'm in a different place. My mom seems to be there. I'm amazed by my dream. I rant and rave over it, saying, ""Wow! Holy Shit! That was amazing!"" There is another bed and person in this loft-like area where I am. I want to attract their attention and tell them about my dream. They do not respond. I reach for my dream journal and knock my pen onto the floor. I'm in a big chair-like structure and I seem to be off the ground a ways. I see the Ramos' blaze orange hunting hat in the house."
"1943"	"(10/05/1998)"	"Systematic Duck Hunts I have to complete a systematic duck hunt to finish off two of six ""blocks"" or hunts. I feel some ambiguity, some doubt about my enjoyment for this. I feel some pressure on me to do this, and I am also reluctant."
"1944"	"(10/05/1998)"	"Waiting For Jim I'm with the Lorenz family waiting for the arrival of Jim Lorenz and maybe my mom. We're in Carter church. A ceremony takes place that involves my mom. I move from the back of church to the pews. My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles is in front of me. My friend Jill Banks is near me. I feel strange being in church, as if I'm reverting to the days of old. I walk, and my footsteps are very loud."
"1945"	"(10/07/1998)"	"I've Lost Weight I'm at a dentist-like office. A woman is going to examine me. We talk about my weight. I'm lying on my back in the chair. I have a pair of clear plastic glasses on. I say that I've lost weight: I've grown accustomed to eating less. I tell someone I weight 210 pounds, and they believe me. Then I tell them I don't really weight 210, but really weight 175. She makes a comment on my nutrition, saying I need to eat more."
"1946"	"(10/07/1998)"	"Invalid Dream Interpretation I'm talking to my classmate Robyn Masters. I explain what lucid dreaming is, and how to manipulate a dream, giving her examples. I talk about willing a car to move, to come towards her. I finish giving her the explanation and she seems dissatisfied. The topic changes to dream interpretation, and she doubts that my methods are valid. There is another skeptical young man there. We talk about looking for something in a dream and finding it because you're looking for it. I talk with them. I feel very strongly for my viewpoint and I try to point out how their doubts are unfounded and invalid. I make a firm argument. There are pictures on a wall. They seem to be like the sand-in-a-frame pictures. Some things may be stuck to the glass. These pictures seem to have something to do with my old roommate Jens Nils."
"1947"	"(10/07/1998)"	"Revising The Resume I'm going to the career development center at Brimson to talk with someone about revising my resume. There are two women there, both are busy talking. I wait to speak with one of them. Then I ask them if I can see one of them. They tell me walk in hours are not today, but are Wednesday night, and Thursday and Friday."
"1948"	"(10/09/1998)"	"Incest Hands I'm at my step-mom Lisa Lawson's house in the basement. There is a woman lying on a massage table there. I'm standing next to the table. I have my right hand on the woman's back, giving her a half-hearted massage. A woman I know is standing behind me. This woman starts to give me a back massage. I'm very tense: my back muscles are tight. The massage feels very good: relaxing. I start to feel rubbery, as if I'm melting. I focus more on the massage I'm receiving, and my right hand does not massage the woman as much. The massage I'm receiving ends. I'm sexually excited: I have an erection, and I direct my intent towards the woman who was on the table, and is now standing. I am behind her. My erection protrudes between her legs to the front side of her body. She is fully clothed. I squeeze a blob of pre-ejaculatory fluid, which looks like semen, to the top of my erection, and lick it off the head of my penis. The woman leaves. I'm upstairs with the woman who was behind me. She is my sister. She has long, dark brown hair. We're on the floor. There is plutonic physical contact in what we're doing. I creep my hands into a position where they are over her breasts. I think I'm being nonchalant, as if she won't realize what I'm doing or go along with it. Suddenly she yells out, ""Incest hands!"", accusing me of my actions. I deny what I'm doing, and try to play it off as being normal or insignificant. I don't think she accepts this lie. We are soon in a sexual situation. She says something to me along the lines of, ""You wanna fuck?"", in an obnoxiously cocky, teasing voice. She is on top of me and pulls up her skirt to have sex. There is some action: wrestling-like play. I see she has no genitals. I know that she is male, and that she cut off her genitals she was younger. There is a phone call for me. I go upstairs to my room, which is white, neat and clean: it looks like the bedroom for a middle class suburban young adult. My dad is coming home, I know, or I see him from my window. One the phone are my cousin Anna Strange and grandpa Redding. I want to talk with them, but I only hear and talk with my classmate Georgia, who is male. I'm outside in a phone booth. The weather is cloudy with a steady hard rain. There may be boats nearby. People are there."
"1949"	"(10/09/1998)"	"A Bus Crash I'm in the front of a bus. We go fast, and start to go up a steep stairway. The bus flips over, crashing. The front of the busy is up: it is steeply slanted, on one end. It is stable: the crash is over. I see what I can do to help. I unbuckle my seat belt while hanging onto a rope-like structure to keep me from falling all the way down to the bottom of the bus. I slide down a rope to the end of the bus on the ground. The doors of the bus near the ground are stuck. I push and pull them open. People are lying around, badly hurt: crushed. I take them out of the bus and lay them on the ground as carefully as I can. One man is very badly crushed. He looks deflated, like only flesh. My housemate Stephen Ramos grabs him carelessly by the neck and moves him. I'm grief stricken by the sight of these people, and Stephen's treatment of them. I begin to cry. This is a terrible sight. I stop crying, setting aside my grief, and continue to help people however I can. My left ear is bleeding seriously from the inside. I have a white cloth bunched up on the side of my head to catch the blood. The stairs that the bus has flipped up on are in a store. As we leave the wreckage I tell a man working at the store that we'll see him in court. The next question is how the group will get home. I seem to be with a college group that is stranded, now."
"1950"	"(10/12/1998)"	"Through The Bowling Alley I'm at Carter School. I'm leading a group of younger kids. We're being pursued. We get out of the school through the bowling alley, going through areas with wheels and cranks. The area is dark and dusty."
"1951"	"(10/12/1998)"	"Winter Clogs I'm in Oak Valley going to catch a Metro bus on 2nd Street, when it is coming up the hill. It's winter. I changed my socks to wear with clog-like shoes that I have on."
"1952"	"(10/12/1998)"	"Singing Birthday There is a birthday party for my housemate Hank Anderson and I. There is cake there. The women's singing group from Brimson sings at the party for us."
"1953"	"(10/14/1998)"	"Silhouette Deer I see some deer over a hilltop. I'm with people. We creep up and look at them. There is one real deer and several fake deer that are silhouettes. The deer move."
"1954"	"(10/15/1998)"	"Mount Olympus I'm driving in a car in New South Wales. There are several people with me, and two teenage boys in the vehicle. We seem to be going north on the east side of Lake St. Clair. It is a bright sunny day, but brisk and crisp with a bit of snow. We go past a large mountain on our left. I say it must be Mount Olympus. We look at it in admiration as we pass. We drive shortly and a huge mountain comes into view, towering into the sky on our left. I say that must be Mount Olympus. I turn to the two younger boys and ask them if they know if that is Olympus. One of the boys glances at his map and says that it is. I'm in a car that is headed for a semi-mountainous area where we can hike. There are patches of snow on the ground: some snow cover. We pull into this area. There are three or four others in the group. My brother Wally is there. We get out of the car and walk. I carry two axes. We walk through several old wood garage buildings. There seem to be a man coming up behind us. He may be in a car. I'm in a restaurant-like place later in the day. I meet Wally and ask him what he did today. He tells me about several streams. We're standing on several wooden bridge-like structures over two smalls streams of water that are enclosed in trough-like structures. He tells me about the differences between the streams: color, etc. One may consist of Crappie feces, or have Crappies in it. We're in the front of the restaurant. There are two women serving us. One is next to us trying to sell us food, and another is back behind the counter fixing food. Our group gets an order of French fries: someone wants them. I don't want any food. The waitress is trying to sell us chicken salad sandwiches. The group, and Wally in particular, agree to get the sandwiches. This happens after some degree of confusion and lack of communication. We leave the restaurant. I'm with the group. Wally isn't there. We haven't seen him since arriving in the Salt Lake City valley. We seem to be outside Burger King in Grizzleton. Our vehicle is about an hour up the valley. Our task is now to get back to our car."
"1955"	"(10/16/1998)"	"My Gino Teavor Rage I'm with some people. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there. Gino gets very hyper and angry, throwing one of his fits that he does when we play baseball. I comment on his inability to remain calm. Others and I, including my grade school classmates Patrick Bergman and Jerry Kasper, are near the south end of Bauer or Old Avenue in Oak Valley near the service road that runs below the Main Street overpass. Gino has left the group in one of his fits: mad, pouting, and angry. I yell at him in the distance. I tell him he's weak. My goal is to help him, to make him realize how he's acting. I don't know the best way to go about communicating this to him. Earlier, he and I fought. I punched him. He hated it, but didn't respond. He gets mad at my yelling at him and he turns and starts to run at me in a way that only he can: the tense, rigid, emotionally charged rage and determination. I leave the area where we're playing baseball, leaving Jerry and Patrick. I get around a house out of sight and I start to run at a moderate pace. I know Gino is running after me at full speed. I hope to lose him, cutting through yards and between houses, going towards Carter School. There is a group of boys going to play baseball. I turn around to see if Gino is in sight, thinking he probably won't be. He is about 30 feet away from me, with gritted teeth, full of his transient rage. He has on a pair of thick black-framed glasses. He catches up to me quickly. We may fight: I may punch him between the eyes."
"1956"	"(10/18/1998)"	"Truckin I'm driving a semi-truck. I'm driving a group of young adults, my age, on a fairly long trip. I pull the truck into a gas station in a small town. I'm not really sure where to park, so I just stop next to another truck. People go into the shop to get a break from the driving. The truck starts to slide sideways. I'm outside the cab on the ground. I try to control the slide. It bumps and smashes into the semi-truck next to it, and then bounces back, sliding into the gas pumps on the other side of the truck. I realize I haven't set the parking brake on the truck. I put the parking brake on. The truck then stops sliding. It then slides a bit more. I look at the front tires and see that they're over some hatch-like vents that have popped up, or are up, off of the ground. The truck slides down these hatches about 12 inches. When the truck wheels hit the ground at the bottom of the hatches, I think it is finally stable: it won't slide. The others come out from the store. I don't think anyone has seen the fiasco. I'm especially thinking if the owners of the gas station have seen it, since the truck hit their gas pumps. My housemate Stephen Ramos is among the people there. I have been driving the whole time. Stephen says he would take a turn. I say no, I'll keep driving. I am sore and stiff, but we haven't been driving that long: four to eight hours. I keep driving."
"1957"	"(10/19/1998)"	"Plain People I'm on a mountain or large hill. It is heavily wooded with hardwood deciduous trees. A truck approaches on a windy dirt road. In it are my friends Bubba Hacker and Kevin Simpson. There is smoke filling the cab and pouring out of the windows. I think the engine must be on fire. As they pass me I hope that they'll be okay, that their truck doesn't blow up. I walk, coming to a hilltop on one of the smaller hills. I walk down across a sandy dune-like area towards an office that seems to be the headquarters at a campground. I see two women walking there too. Inside the office there are a number of people. They are middle to old aged people and are simple. They are the kind of person who would work in a campground check-in all their life: not intellectually stimulated or educated. I walk into a game room like area. There are several people there playing games like foosball. The room is old. I imagine it to be a 70's-esque pastel green or light blue. A Bare Naked Ladies video is on television there, in cartoon form. My friend Niles Zelling is there. We both feel out of place in such mundane circumstances. He is near a foosball table where a woman is talking to him about the game: they may be about to play. There are five small dark-colored balls on the table in a line. The ball in the center has a dot on it. There may be one ball missing. The lady explains the game in her simple terms. It seems asinine that this woman is explaining foosball to Niles: of course he knows how to play. Yet her rules are different, as if her game is different. I'm with my friend Nat Miller and a middle-aged white woman. She is not unlike my boss Carly Lunch in appearance, but I imagine her to have a much softer voice, and she doesn't smoke. She and I have sex. Nat gives her cunnilingus while I grab and suck her breasts. This goes on a bit, and she nears orgasm. I'm standing naked with an erection, next to her. She is scantily clothed, and may have a shirt on. I approach her to have sex. I see that where I thought she was is a huge man: her husband! I play dumb, saying, ""Oh my god, I'm naked!"" The man is going to kick my ass! I manage to evade his wrath. I hit him in the groin a few times. A bit later a person or I hit him about ten times in the groin with pool balls, while the person only gets hit once. This should allow the person, who may be I, to have enough time to escape."
"1958"	"(10/21/1998)"	"Knee Injury I injure my left knee, particularly in back of the knee. My leg seems to be bent forward. I jump in a lake of cold water to put colder temperatures around it. I yell and scream in pain. Later, my knee is wrapped up. It is held in place by a belt that goes around me knee or waist."
"1959"	"(10/22/1998)"	"The Natural Power I'm in a movie theatre. There is space between the screen and front seats. There are rows of seats that run perpendicular to the screen, on the sides of the space between the screen and the front rows. I know that these seats on the sides are Aquarius seats. I may be poked in the back by a foot. I hear my name. I turn around and see several young women sitting behind me. The woman directly behind me is the one that said my name. She talks to me, saying her name is Amanda _____, that I know her, and seems to ask if I don't remember her. She looks familiar. She is pretty. She has fair, clean skin. I look at her face, trying to identify, to place her. She looks a bit like my cousin Sandra Redding. There are several businessmen to our left. They talk loudly and obnoxiously for a theatre. They move up towards the screen. One of them flips over a chair, like a somersault. The others jump and tumble. They gather in front of the screen, talking loudly. One of them pulls out a handgun and points it at the head of another. There are between three and five men. The man fires the gun, shooting the second man in the head. The second man may fire back. Several of the men then have guns drawn and point them at each other. One man points a gun into another's mouth. The pointee redirects the gun into another man's mouth, who is then shot. There seems to be a blast of glass shards, from a gun, I think. Most or all of the men die. There is a young blond woman working at a gate that lets cars into an area. It's dark. A bus speeds up and crashes through a gate. The woman may want to go after the bus, because that would be a duty of her job, but she would not be very effecting chasing a bus. She gets out a telescope that is three to four feet long. A helicopter flies overhead. She tries to spotlight the helicopter; it seems to be the runaway vehicle. The telescope may be a spotlight. I'm in an uncovered jeep-like vehicle with the woman. She is looking through the telescope as we ride fast. She is supposed to be looking through it with her left eye but seems to be looking with her right eye. A woman is being pulled by a car that is going fast. She may in the car, but is somehow being pulled. She pokes and prods me with a metal wire, like an electrode or a bent clothes hanger. I'm grabbing onto something. The poking is painful. I clench my fists and grip harder, gritting my teeth. I'm biting onto the front of her blue denim bib overalls. I bite harder as she pokes. I may know her, and feel somewhat awkward when I pull away from her after biting her overalls. People are gathering in a small parking lot because it seems to be a safe haven. There is a person who sleeps in a garbage can because it's safe. I am this person. I'm in a large garbage can. I flip the lid down over my head, peeking out of a crack. Other people in the lot are in vehicles. There is a house across the street. It has holes in it that appear to be shot into it. It looks like Swiss cheese. The holes may get larger. The house seems to be a shell, made of just the outside walls. It's falling apart. There is a power that is affecting the house. It is frightening and threatening to me. It is a natural power, like a storm, but is very destructive."
"1960"	"(10/23/1998)"	"Joint With Mary I'm smoking a joint of marijuana with my advisor Mary Monroe. My classmate Chuck is vomiting over a car. It is morning. There may be snow on the ground. My friend Nat Miller is there."
"1961"	"(10/27/1998)"	"Killing Woodies I'm in the yard at home in Oak Valley between the two maple trees where the sandbox used to be. I have a shotgun, and am shooting ducks. I don't have or use any ammunition. I point my gun and the ducks and pull the trigger. There is a ""click"" sound of the firing pin moving in the absence of a shell. I have a specific plan of attack: I want to kill some ducks, but I don't want to maim any. I want to do this quickly and discreetly. I maim about five ducks or birds. They're all still living and sit on tree branches, clinging to their lives. I know that someone has informed the police that this was occurring. I gather up the dead and dying ducks and put them in the garbage can in back of the house. There is a phone call for me: it is the police. I talk with a male officer. I explain my actions. Knowing there are limits for each species of duck taken, I tell the officer over the phone that I've killed two wooducks, one mallard, one teal, etc, all of which are legal numbers, even though I know I've really shot a bunch of wooducks. The officer asks me about my friend Nat Miller, whom I know was with me when I was hunting. I try to explain to the officer that because Nat is from out-of-state, he doesn't need a license for hunting, just a valid drivers license and a key. The officer asks me questions about this, and I long-windedly make up answers to excuse our actions. The officer finally says, ""Shine up your keys."" He means he is coming over to look at Nat's key to validate the story."
"1962"	"(10/28/1998)"	"The Jig Monkey I'm in a house with my mom and others. I'm doing homework. It's nighttime. There's a silent, creepy, eerie feeling. I have been drinking tea, and my urge to urinate grows. I have to go outside. I'm holding up one edge of a tent, which may be my dome tent. I hold it up with one hand urinate on the ground with the other hand holding my penis. I urinate here, under the tent, because I'm scared to go elsewhere in the darkness. My urine foams and forms puddles as it hits the dirt and soaks in. I wonder about the moisture being a problem when I set the tent down: I know the tent has a plastic sewn-in floor that will probably be fine with muddy ground. I'm inside looking at photographs. There are many old photographs of our family that I've never seen, or have not seen in a long time. There are photographs of my parents, and the kids from the early 1980's. My parents slept out in a tent in the yard, where the sandbox would be. They were having marital troubles. It is later, and I'm going outside to urinate. I walk along the outside of a long white, single-story house. I stand near the end of the house in the dark. There is something there in the darkness. I may get a glimpse of it, or hear it in the bushes. I'm scared. I run away, back into the house where my mom and my sisters are. I feel frantic and frightened. I say I have heard it or seen something. I go into frenzy out of fear and agitation. I run back outside in my frenzy to confront this person or thing. I yell out to it, ""Come on you Jig Monkey!"" I'm fed up. I it there, and it flees. I see the shadow of it as it runs away. It may have pointy ears."
"1963"	"(10/28/1998)"	"The Projection Of My Shadow I'm on a farm with two men my age that may be my friends. The farm has the layout of the Redding farm. The barn is there. We approach a group of birds. We're hunting the birds east of the barn near the big hay shed. I slow as we get closer so I can load my .22 caliber rifle and fire early at the birds, which are crows. Most of the crows fly away. I'm on the second level of the barn. We're planning on shooting some of the birds from the small door opening. I load the clip for my .22. The bullets I have gotten are from my old housemate in New South Wales. Some of the bullets are too thick or too long for the clip. I load three or four rounds into the clip. We're going to shoot crows, owls, and other birds. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. A large brown owl is just outside the barn door opening. Kevin grabs it and kills it with his hands and a screwdriver. I have verbally prompted him to do this. There is a man that sees us. He is outside the barn standing a ways off, in the direction of the birds. He yells at us for intending to, or actually killing, the birds. He reminds me of David Hale from the University of Wellington. He has long brown hair. He starts up towards the bran to confront us. We need to flee. I tell the two others to go ahead: I'll catch up. I may say this so I have time to fire a shot and still get away. We flee. We go through the barn on different levels, in stair and corners. I climb in the rafters of one level to hide in a place that I think is a good spot. I lay flat in the rafters. There is a light bulb below me attached to the underside of the rafters. I see my shadow projected onto the floor, even though it should be on the ceiling considering the position of the bulb and myself. I must move, so that when the man comes in to look for us he doesn't see my shadow on the floor. In the route we take as we flee there is a dead grandma lying on the floor. We need to step over the decaying clump of a woman. There is a book there that is either written by or about Bob Mould."
"1964"	"(10/28/1998)"	"I Am The Shadow The Combs family lives in the red house on Home Avenue on the block north of home on the west side of the road. I come to the house a lot to visit my friend Tiny Combs. His parents don't like that I come. There are two entrances in the front of the house: one on the second floor, and one right below it. I go to visit Tiny. It's winter. There is much snow on the ground, with 4-6 inches of fresh powder. There is a long black metal bridge that is on or over the sidewalk to the lower entrance to the house. This bridge is a plow that removes snow from the sidewalk, silently spinning and sweeping the snow away. When I arrive the bridge is spinning to clear the path of snow. This is a clandestine plow, something that happens in secret, like for Tiny to let me in without his parents knowing. I'm wearing a winter parka with a big furry Eskimo-like hood. I pull the hood up as I approach the door so snow doesn't go in my face. Tiny's parents know I'm coming. They may see or hear me. Tiny's father comes out and yells at me in a frustrated manner, ""Get out of here; just get out of here!!!"" I take off running. They think I'm a prowler or a burglar that is nagging them, since I visited yesterday too. I run down the sidewalk going north. I turn left into the alley. I run past a vehicle in the alley near Andy Jones' house. There is a woman and dog standing outside the vehicle, which may be a mini van. I run to the next block into the short alley again, and turn left onto the long alley, going near Booker's back door. There are several feet of crusty snow. I'm in the alley of the block where my home is, where the old blue house was, kitty-corner to our home. A Chevy Blazer roars by, going north, in the alley. I take cover so I'm not seen. People in the Blazer are looking for me. They don't know that the person they're looking for is I: they think the person is a stranger, a nuisance, and a pest. Really it is I, and they don't know."
"1965"	"(10/28/1998)"	"Nate's Family I'm at my friend Nat Miller's house. I get a phone call from my friend Nate Nelling. Something may happen with Nate's family."
"1966"	"(10/28/1998)"	"Jungian Faith Shaky I'm talking with my dad. I tell him about my 'dilemma' in which my faith in Carl Jung's theory is not on as solid of ground as I would have liked to think."
"1967"	"(10/28/1998)"	"Out Of The Game I'm in a fancy old hotel. There is a rich woman there. She has a brochure of some sort: a piece of paper. This paper is moving from person to person across the world. The point is to see what kind of people will come in contact with the paper. The woman wants me to take the paper because I'm low class, because the paper will come into contact with all kinds of wealthy high class people on its journey, so giving it to me would keep the paper's journey in balance. I think this woman is full of crap. I leave, not taking the paper. I walk in the hotel. There are several different theatres in the hotel, each with different color front doors. This place seems to be like Las Vegas. There is a sign for a gambling room. As I walk towards it I see a blackjack table. I have not gone into the room yet: the doors are closed and I'm outside the room. The table is out in the open lobby area. A black woman with long dark hair is at the table dealing cards, apparently to herself. I enter the gambling room to take a look at the poker table in particular, but also just to look around. It's fairly dark. There are some pool and other recreation tables, and a couple slot machines. I wander over to a table that I think is poker. There are several men around the table, playing what I see is pool. One of them immediately asks me to play with teams. They are playing for money. I'm leery of this, and I say, ""I don't know, I'm not very good..."" I look in my pocket and pull the change out. I have $1.50 in quarters, a penny, and a nickel. It costs $36 to play a game. They seem to include me though I don't have money. One of the men on the other team starts playing and puts in five balls consecutively, easily. My partner and I are then out. My partner is a not very good either, maybe not even as good as me: another chump they rounded up as well. We have not played, and have not paid to play. We were in, and now are out. It feels no different, if not a bit relieving that I won't have to do anything. I walk out of the room. There is a very old vending machine with a pastel blue or green front. Nachos cost 59 cents in this machine. A small sign says the machine is closed."
"1968"	"(10/31/1998)"	"Sucking Norman's Dick I'm alone at the Whitman house. I go downstairs. It's cold. It's morning. The back door is open and just the screen door is keeping the heat in. The radiator is on. This is not very good insulation: I feel the heat escaping on the outside of the house. I'm inside near the stereo. I seem to be with a woman who is submissive, or to whom I act very dominant or aggressive. I take two ice cubes from the ice cube tray at the top of the freezer to use in our sex. I hear a faint noise and see a flicker of color reflecting in the main windows. I walk over to the living room and see that the television is on. I think this is strange because I don't think I left it on and no one else is home. I shut it off and go upstairs. I see the light in my housemate Norman Norman's room is on, though I know this to be my housemate Hank Anderson's room. I enter my room and find Norman there. I give him fellatio, and his penis becomes erect. I tell him to turn over, and I rub an ice cube on his anus, which flares out like layers of a blossoming flower, like a vagina. He thinks this is odd. I look over and see my door is open. I try to shut it but it won't stay closed. Hank is in his room, and as far as I know is unsuspecting of this behavior. Norman may think Hank knows. Our sex ends. Norman is in the bathroom wrapped in a towel, about to take a shower. I go in and start to give him fellatio while he is standing there. He still has partial erection. I suck hard. I'm kneeling, and I may urinate into the toilet while performing fellatio. In a short time he says, ""____ ____ oh please stop it."", which tells me his is in the ever-so-sensitive period at and after ejaculation. I slow and am lighter with my sucking motions. We have locked the door. Norman ejaculates into my mouth. The semen tastes warm and salty. He comments, ""God, Kenneth"", indicating that I'm good at giving fellatio. I feel nauseated from the semen. I spit it in the bathtub and take a drink of the running shower water to rinse my mouth."
"1969"	"(10/31/1998)"	"Sewer Masturbation I'm in the sewers of Wilmerton where I went in 8th grade. My friend Kevin Simpson, and people who I later identify as my friends Jill Banks and Terry Foss are there. We walk. I'm in the lead. I know that Allen Rechtshaffen has been though this same situation before. I walk though the water, which permeates my boots. We get to the 6th manhole and climb up to the second story area, a small loft-type area. There is a cut out opening in the floor to climb though. I want to masturbate, to ejaculate down through the cut out hole into the lower level of the sewer. T he others start masturbating, not using their hands. Jill and Terry masturbate by rubbing their thighs together, and Kevin by flexing his penis. It seems to be non-manual masturbation all around."
"1970"	"(11/03/1998)"	"The Intrusive Record Player I seem to be at home, which is different than in real life. My friends Gino Teavor and Glen Ryan are there. It's late: I have stayed up late tonight. I walk to my room, which is a big room where we all sleep. I go by a computer lab and see my classmate Laura Caster working at a computer with headphones on. I had seen her earlier. I get to the room and enter. The door to the room is a big colorful wooden door/painting, splattered with much color. The door is broken: the top pin hitch is broken and the top of the door hangs loose. I try to put it back in its place and end up putting it to the side, completely off its hinges, inside the room. There is a record player on the floor playing loudly. I shut off the power to the record player and it slowly slows, still producing the loud noise. I find the noise disturbing: a loud blare in the quiet, dark room. I don't take the needle off the record. Eventually the music stops. I walk into the room. It is dark and cool with good airflow: a very relaxing atmosphere, like a cool summers night. There is a woman sleeping in a bed on my right. I don't want to disturb or awaken her. My bed is mattress or two on the floor. I see that I have two blankets instead of one, in a messy bundle on my bed. I'm glad about his because I think it will be a bit chilly tonight."
"1971"	"(11/03/1998)"	"Capturing Chuck Norris I'm in the passenger seat of my dad's brown Ford Taurus. My dad is driving. We seem to be coming from home in Oak Valley. We drive north on Home Avenue down the hill. We get to the bottom of the hill and turn right on 3rd Street. As we do a red compact station wagon turns onto Home Avenue, going by us. I see a young man driving it, waving at us. I see it is my friend John Thomas. He puts his car in reverse and backs up, approaching the side of our car while waving. I want my dad to slow down, not sure if John is waving to say hi or if he needs something. John is then driving forward, following us. My dad slows and pulls off to the side of the road, saying he's going to pull over on 3rd Street near the police station. He thinks the police station is still on Bauer Avenue in back of Jefferson School. I tell him that the police station isn't there any more. I'm annoyed, confused, and angry with him for not pulling over right away. He speeds up, doing almost 50 miles per hour, which makes me even angrier because now he's prone to getting a speeding ticket. He seems to be glad that things are speeded up. John has speeded up, following us. We quickly approach a fenced in area with chain link fence gates. My dad drives right through the gates, speeding. There is nothing in the fenced in area. It is unused, like a vacant lot with a few puddles and leaves. We speed though the fences. We pass a few people, maybe including an Asian man, around the wreckage of a car. A police siren wails in the distance in front of us. I think for sure we'll get a ticket. My dad slows down. As the police car approaches us it goes by us to the scene of the accident. My dad has been spared a ticket. There may be another police car going to the scene of the accident. I'm standing with dad nearby. There are two other men with knives. One is closer to us than the other. The one that is further away throws his knife, which sticks in the ground a short ways away from me. The men are challenging us to a fight. I pick up the knife and mock the men, saying it's dull. I do this after rubbing my finger across the back of the blade near the handle. I then realize that this is not part of the blade, and that the actual blade is very sharp! One of the men is Chuck Norris. We fight, eventually all four of us are fighting together. They are very good fighters, and use their skills to make us immobile, by pinching a nerve or poking a precise area of our bodies. They have specific fighting knowledge and tactics. We subdue them. We go into a barn. This seems to have something to do with releasing or disposing of the men we've captured. There is a ledge in or near the barn. Below the ledge the ground is covered with uncooked pasta noodles on one side and seafood on the other side. There are food piles covering the ground. I know that the pasta area is the _ Ocean, whereas the seafood area is the Asian/Indian Ocean. Either I push the two men into this, or they fall because they are beaten and tired. Then I'm in this area without the men. I hear someone coming on the ledge above and I hide. It is the men, and they are physically okay, and following me. I try to evade them, climbing and scurrying around. I hang from a ledge and moving by ""walking"" with my hands. I escape the grasping hand of one of the men. I get to a window in the barn to jump out. It is high up: 30 feet or more. I hang and jump, seeing if my training has paid off: if I can sustain the fall. (What training, I do not know.) It has paid off. I know that I take the fall in many ways, but I don't experience it more than once. As I fall I do several dances: the Rice Walk, the Combo, and the Swag. I land solidly and feel strong. The land is tan and dusty around the barn where the fight was. There may be a group of women about 100 yards from the barn, as if to cheerlead."
"1972"	"(11/04/1998)"	"An Attic Room I'm crawling through the attic at home, towards the far end. I encounter lights that are turned on, in the attic. I think this is odd. I near the end of the attic and there are more lights on. I see and hear my mom and a small, open, lit room that is beyond the end of the attic via a small passageway around the left side of the main attic. My mom is surprised to see me, as if she is trying somewhat to keep the existence of the room a secret. She says something like, ""You didn't think there was nothing above my room, did you?"" I'm confused and dumbfounded. I say no, accepting and realizing that there is a room above my mom's bedroom."
"1973"	"(11/04/1998)"	"Redding Family Reunion I'm at a Redding family gathering at a house that is near Roundabout Way in Wilmerton, southeast of the sharp northward turn in the road, near Karen Hamilton's house. My uncle Rusty Redding and his son Melvin are there. I'm in a gray Isuzu Trooper-like vehicle with my cousin Rich Redding. I'm driving; Rich is in the passenger seat. He makes a comment on how he is attached to or likes this vehicle, and how he will miss it and won't know what to do when he is without it. I back the Trooper out of the driveway and park it next to the curb on the right side of the road. It's a stick shift, with a ""sticky"" shifter, not a smooth one. I may put it in gear to park it. My aunt Elaine Grains has bought the house two doors down from the one where we are. I'm walking back towards the house. Someone has a big box of Cuban cigars. They say the cigars were left over from my high school classmate Todd Warden's party yesterday. Todd was sick at his party, and cigars were passed out. I get a cigar and go into the house. I unwrap it, but don't know which end to bite the tip off, so I don't bite it. The cigar unwraps a bit. My uncle Dannie Redding and cousins Henry and Avery King are there. My housemates Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, and my supervisor Carly Lunch are there. There is orange juice in the refrigerator. Melvin is outside playing with a younger cousin. He has a red light, like the ones we're using in physiology lab. He is holding the light, which deflates when he nears a stream of hot air being out by a small heater. I may instruct him on how to avoid this. The family seems to be divided into two groups for a big game. One group consists of adults, who weigh more, and the other group of younger people and kids. It seems to be lopsided, so grandma Redding runs from the one team over to the other waving her arms comically. All of the extended Redding family is then in a big circular gathering. There is cotton candy being made in the center of the circle. Everyone is supposed to get a turn eating this cotton candy, but we all hold back, waiting for others to do so, so as not to be rude. Then someone says that newborns/young people should go first, so Melvin runs up and gets some cotton candy. From there, there is a pause again: people are reluctant to go. Rusty goes and comes back, sitting on my right eating his cotton candy. He says he's not going back to get more. I'm outside with a group of people sitting near the alley at home in Oak Valley at the south end of the garden near the tree. We sit in the dark watching the sky. There are lights that move across the sky at rapid speeds: too fast to be a plane, satellite, or other human object, but too slow to be a shooting star. I say, half joking, that it may be a UFO! One of these objects explodes. I think it has been shot. My friend Sarah Reed is there, behind me. I can't see well because there are branches in the way, so I move. There is a loud blast. Everyone stands up, startled and concerned. I say, ""That was a shotgun"", and then feel silly because many Redding men are there, and I know they know what a shotgun blast sounds like, so my words really just indicated my inexperience. Rusty leaves with Melvin to protect him. More blasts appear, and we see that there are fireworks in the sky. I sit down where I have a better seat. My friend Nat Miller is there. I see the silhouette of a helicopter circling close to us. It's dark and hard to see. I'm concerned about his because it seems like a war helicopter. I know there is one person in it, and later realize there are two. I'm concerned, and as the helicopter starts to come in to land at the north end of our block by the alley, I flee, to get out of sight. I know the men in the helicopter are from the army and will kill indiscriminately. I run out front in the yard, but then cut back towards the back yard. I see the two men approaching from the direction where they landed. They look lethal. I run though the back of Trammell's yard, down near the white house, across Home Avenue, and over a fence near the Giles' yard. There is a large machine at Giles' house that crushes people. There seems to be a narrator now. People are not spared. The army is responsible. There is a big spring in the machine that crushes people."
"1974"	"(11/05/1998)"	"A Full Car I'm with my friends Emerald Reinhold, Holly Lapson, and other friends. We're leaving a place, driving in a car. The car is full: there are seven or eight of us in it."
"1975"	"(11/05/1998)"	"Breaking Open A Clam I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and friends Niles and Tim Zelling. We seem to be camping or at a cabin. We're at a small store to get some supplies and fun stuff. Stephen and I look at large packages of water balloons: 20, 100, 500, or 1000 in a package, costing from $3 to $120. Some of the balloons are very large and are too big for water balloons, I think. An old man with a shopping cart is on a beach. I walk up and look at a newspaper in his cart. He comes over, thinking I'm stealing it. I was just showing Stephen a photograph on the front page of a man catching a trout on Lake Erie. It's the fishing opener. I say that it's a trout, but at second glance it looks like a bass. I walk out into the water with my pants on, going knee deep. I see a bunch of clams, some of which are very large. I pick one up. It looks old, having a lot of algae and growth on its shell. Its shell is large: ten inches long, and six to eight inches wide. I grab it with both hands and smack it hard against a rock. I look at it and see that the shell hasn't cracked. I flip it over and smack the other side hard. The shell still doesn't crack, but it's easy to open. I open it and rip the foot out of it and throw it down on the floor. I straighten the top of the clam muscle, to be flat, and it looks like half of a heart."
"1976"	"(11/12/1998)"	"Tiger Encounter I'm in a cave-like structure that is dark inside. Some people are with me. I see the eyes of two tigers in the cave. The eyes are green, and shine brightly. I seem to be on the Redding family farm, or a farm with open spaces. They two tigers are there, a little ways off. Others and myself are scared of the tigers. Someone hands me a .44 caliber magnum for protection. I open the chamber and see there are no shells in it: the gun is of no use. I go into a small shack, which is the farther north of the two old white sheds at the Redding farm. I try to close the flimsy wooden gate behind me. There's a gap below and above the gate, which wouldn't protect me from the tigers. I look on the shelves of the shed for ammunition. I find many shells that are close to what a .44 caliber magnum shell looks like, and I try them in one of the six chambers, but not many of them fit. I find one that fits. It looks like a longer, thicker .22 caliber shell. The tigers come around and enter the shed. I am terrified. I make no quick movements. I try to act smoothly and calmly, like I'm not worried at all by them. I know the tigers are extremely powerful, self-contained, and potentially deadly for me. They wander through and leave. I know one bullet isn't enough, so I find more."
"1977"	"(11/12/1998)"	"Exposed Computer I'm in a computer-like lab. There are a number of people there to take some kind of test. My friend Tiny Combs was there, but left because he finished the test. I look for a Macintosh computer. There is one screen that is high up. I don't use that computer because I don't want people to see what I write. I'm with a woman there. There is an old truck. We walk by it. I note that it is like my truck. I put the truck back in reverse to park it, and leave."
"1978"	"(11/12/1998)"	"Melanie's Tootsie Roll Sundae I'm in a restaurant that seems to be like a malt shop with my friend Melanie McDyss. The waitress shows us a list of all the shakes they offer. I point out which I would like, pointing to flavors of Dum Dum lollipops that are on the flavor list. I point to several, including blue raspberry, which have wrappers that are partially unwrapped. I ask Melanie which flavor she wants. She points to the second flavor on the list, which is the Giant Tootsie Roll. I tell the waitress that we'll take the Tootsie Roll flavor shake. She tries to get us to order a steak. I am reluctant because it's early in the morning and I don't feel gastro intestinally stable. She tells us to call her if we want to order. Melanie and I move to a different, nicer table because someone else has moved. I squeeze through the space between the seat and the edge of the table, which is a booth. It feels like we're on a date. The waitress brings our shake, which is like a brownie sundae on a plate. We both it eat it with forks. We're overlooking a city park with tall trees. There are some people under a big tree. A branch is high above them. Melanie makes a comment about doing something mischievous with the tree branch, tricking the people. I chuckle, unexpected to hear this, and say something along the lines of her comment being her shadow side. I walk with her and encounter others. We go into a house where my friend Tim Zelling lives. My friends John Thomas and Tom Napper are there."
"1979"	"(11/13/1998)"	"Grandpa's Shotgun I'm with grandpa Redding. He is old and doesn't hear well, so I speak loudly and clearly. I ask him if I can buy one of his shotguns, if he doesn't use them anymore. He's responsive in his peppy, affirmative way, and goes to get one. I tell him I would use it for duck and deer hunting. He takes out a gun. It looks odd, like a special high power rifle, not a black and brown shotgun, like I expected. It has a silver barrel and several connecting parts where the trigger is. There's a small triangle piece that is the scope. It sticks up off the barrel a little ways. I look though it and the edges of the field of view inside the scope are blurred, like in a normal scope. He takes out the bullets for it and shows me. The look like .22 caliber shells: about a half as long and look empty, discharged. The bullets have to be placed over small nub-like projections, like a hairbrush with thick bristles. The shells have to be placed over the numbers, with ten or 20 in a bunch. It takes a long time to load the gun. Grandpa has several small boxes of these shells and a larger shoebox size box of ammunition as well."
"1980"	"(11/13/1998)"	"Aniston Missiles I'm flying. There is a jet fighter plane flying near me. It is loaded with missiles, some of which have writing that says ""Aniston"" on them. I think the plane may be attaching someone or someplace soon. I'm flying above a layer of thick white clouds. It is perfectly calm and still, and very pleasant. I dip down through a hole in the clouds. Below the clouds it is stormy, with much electricity and tension. Something on the ground may have caused all the chaos, maybe a bomb or a missile."
"1981"	"(11/13/1998)"	"Taking A Cyanide Pill I take a cyanide pill and know it will kill me. It is small and whitish. I put it under my tongue, remembering what my dad said about people in the war who committed suicide by putting a pill underneath their tongue for a very quick death. In a short period of time my left arm and parts of my body start to go numb, like they're falling asleep, tingling. I find that the pill has not dissolved, and that I can still reverse its effects. I take the pill out of my mouth, because I don't want to die. My body slowly regains its functioning."
"1982"	"(11/18/1998)"	"My Rotting Teeth I have a loose front tooth on the bottom left side of my mouth. It is pushed back, bent out of shape. I wiggle it, trying to get it to be straight. I finally just pull it out. I bleed a little bit, which tastes salty. I spit into a garbage can. My tooth is long: the root foes very deep, about an inch or so. The tooth gets wider at the root: it's a very large tooth that I've pulled out. The tooth and root are rotting: the outer layer of the tooth has chipped away, exposing the more sensitive layers. It is stained, brown and rotting: decaying. I feel the place in my mouth where the tooth was, with my tongue. I hope that losing this tooth won't affect my smile. I don't think it will, because most of my lower teeth don't show when I smile. I see another of my teeth, in my mouth that is peeling like a hangnail. I think that I need to see a dentist for sure! I didn't think that I was taking that bad care of my teeth!"
"1983"	"(11/18/1998)"	"Persona Is My Shadow I'm chasing my shadow. I'm conscious of being after my Jungian shadow, not my physical shadow. I'm pursuing and confronting something that I know is part of me. It occurs to me that parts of me that I know to be my shadow may actually be the 'light' parts: the desirable parts of my personality, while the persona, the parts with which I am familiar, may actually be my true shadow."
"1984"	"(11/19/1998)"	"Crusty Feces I'm licking a man's anus, and I put my hand in his anus. There are crusty feces there. I find this disgusting but still do it. It's gross."
"1985"	"(11/19/1998)"	"Sister Hilary Sex I'm about to have sex with my friend Hilary Nano, whom I know to be my sister. She seems wary of sex with me at first. My erection is rock hard. She knows that I want to have sex."
"1986"	"(11/20/1998)"	"Jerry Kasper's Unacceptable Pay I'm in a small room with one or two other men. I urinate all over the floor, without regard for what I am urinating on. My classmate Julie Adams is there, watching me urinate. I leave with the men. She and another woman look around the room in disgust. There is a puddle of urine on one of the chairs. The women are repulsed by our behavior. My grade school classmates Jerry Kasper and Gino Teavor are there. A pregnant woman who breastfeeds, but is not doing so now, is there. I say something about this size of this woman's breasts changing. She has voluptuous breasts: large, soft, and fertile. Gino is concerned about the pay rate at which Jerry and others are receiving. Jerry works in a bicycle shop and is getting close to $10.00 per hour, but is not supposed to be earning that much. Something he has inadvertently done has caused him to get a raise. I don't think the situation is completely acceptable. Gino is expressing his concerning in his cussing way, the only way he can. Jerry talks to a man, and the error that resulted in his higher pay is easily corrected."
"1987"	"(11/20/1998)"	"White Kittens I'm in a large pole barn-like structure. It's nighttime. People are sleeping, lying on rolled out mats and sleeping pads. I go to my friend Kevin Simpson, who is asleep, and take his keys. He consents to this, sleepily. There is a wicker basket in which there are many small animals, including two white kittens. They are tiny, about the size of small rodents. They squirm around like newborns."
"1988"	"(11/20/1998)"	"Uninterested In Harmony Allure I unexpectedly meet my high school crush Harmony Allure. She recognizes me and talks to me friendlily, which startles me. I'm tired: very mellow and compliant. She may be with a man. She asks me if I want to get a drink. We're in a bar-like setting. I know I don't ask her to get a drink. I mellowly agree to go; if it were not she, I would not be drinking: I'm tired, dragging, and I have a glass of water already. I walk to find a table, going from a brown wood dimmed light setting to a bright Wal Mart-type store with many white and pastel items. There are tables dispersed in this area. I sit down at one that is near the main walkway, too tired to get one that is more private. I see Harmony coming towards the table, maybe with a man, from a long ways off. When she sits down I see she has started smoking. She looks more like white trash than I remember: her teeth are not as straight or as white, her hair is in a banana clip. She tells me she's been in Forkville the last year or two studying."
"1989"	"(11/20/1998)"	"A New Home I'm in a car at a stoplight with my brother Wally and other family members. The car is a stick shift. We're going uphill, turning at the intersection. Wally has a huge burger, drink, and side order that he has just picked up to go. He tells me it only cost him 35 cents on his card, some type of card. We drive down a road and talk with my mom. Our house has burned down, I understand. We go by a lake on which there are canoes and boats on the other side of this divided highway. My mom tells me our boat was lost in the fire. Someone is going to give Wally $12,000 for his car- a ridiculous amount of money for it. I react, asking why anyone would give so much for such a piece of junk. We drive from the highway, which seems to be the Thru Highway, going north from Superhighway 100 near by teammate Olie Kecker's house. We get to a neighborhood near Riverside school. I have seen a map with a thumbtack hole in frequently visited places. I see our home in Oak Valley and a tack hole worn in there. There are many other holes, including another heavily worn, near Riverside. It may be marked in a solid color, indicating a house. We arrive at a dark brown single story house, a few houses north from my friends the Hackers. My mom, Wally, my sister Ramona, and I are there. I follow someone who has or gets the key to the front door. We walk in to the living room. The carpet is coral colored. There is a collection of black and white china vases in the fully furnished room. We turn right into the kitchen. In the sink there is a white plastic bowl with salad in it, partially covered with a plastic bag. Who know that this is the doing of my aunt Elaine Grains, who was coordinating the preparation of this place before we arrived. There is a box of pet white rats in the kitchen. They belong to Ramona. I go into the basement. The floor is hard, the ceilings low, and the walls are finished off. There are three or four bedrooms in the basement. I look into each one. Some are connected to others such that one has to walk through one to get to the next. I disturb Wally, who is sleeping in a larger bedroom in the basement."
"1990"	"(11/20/1998)"	"Adam Sandler's Urination I'm with my classmate Fred Potter outside a field house-like area. Fred has a gun. Crows fly overhead. I urge Fred to shoot them. He fires several shots and hits one. I run through a partially combined cornfield to where I think the crow fell. The crow flutters and falters, but continues flying. It flies at Fred, squawking and angry with Fred for shooting it. Fred yells for me to, ""Get center___ (get centered?)"", which is something that will help him get rid of the crow attacking him. He is out of shotgun shells, so I run to get one. I run back. The crow is on the ground, dead. I have a gun with a scope, and am standing with several others in the same area. Loons fly overhead. I whirl my gun around; the others duck. I don't fire. Planes fly overhead. I know we're near the Thru Highway, on the west side of the divided highway, going south, near Superhighway 100. The plane zooms in, and I think they must be landing at Powerton, not going all the way to Metropolis. They are big planes: normal size passenger aircraft. I see or am at a large plane whose cargo is being unloaded. There are many pallets and large box structures to be lifted out by a huge forklift that is controlled by hand, using a joystick. I'm then on the back of a flatbed truck. The bed is full of bottles and cans of pop, can bales, and other beverage items. It is very heavy. Machines move, load, and unload the items. I squish up against the back of the cab so a fast moving pallet or forklift doesn't crush me. The truck is then moving. I'm in the back of a pickup-size truck with walls around its bed. A naked man and several women leaning up against the cab are there. The man or I may urinate out of the moving truck. The naked man then holds the ankles of Adam Sandler, who is now in back of the truck as well. He does this so Adam Sandler can urinate out of the back of the truck without falling out or it. Adam then turns and urinates on a woman in front of him, jokingly. She is sitting up against the cab with her knees to her chest. She kicks and spreads her legs out; her lower body is naked. She urinates back onto Adam Sandler, who is still standing there."
"1991"	"(12/01/1998)"	"Outdoors Store I'm at an outdoors store looking for two items: one for each of two different men. There may be a clothes sale on. I have an old blue backpack, and am looking for a pack cover."
"1992"	"(12/03/1998)"	"Storm Arising I'm in the Big Resort Area with three other people. We have two canoes. We're on a big, windy lake with cold water. One canoe, which is smaller, capsizes. There is another canoe party there. The wind dies down. A storm may be arising, and has been here before."
"1993"	"(12/03/1998)"	"Grandpa's Moose Sighting Grandpa Redding tells me he went to the Big Resort Area with two old friends and saw five moose, one of which was huge!"
"1994"	"(12/03/1998)"	"Attempting to Fly There is a small plane trying to take off, but it is not taking off. I try to fly, and am almost successful. I crash and suffer some scrapes, but am okay."
"1995"	"(12/03/1998)"	"My Dad is Dying My dad is dying. I hold him in my arms and we cry. I tell him I love him. He says we'll see each other soon. He says he'll see my mom when he dies: ""At least I get to see Natalie."" My three siblings are there, and they seem to be asleep. They wake up, and my dad gets up, rousing himself."
"1996"	"(12/03/1998)"	"Flowers From the Robbins I see my neighbors Mary and Kent Robbins at Carter church. Kent gives me a bouquet of flowers."
"1997"	"(12/03/1998)"	"Neighborly Communication My housemate Stephen Ramos talks to our neighbor, the old Hispanic woman. He is firm in his words and says that if... (something), then we're going to... (something). This isn't really a threat, though it sounds like it. He is just being firm. We aren't going to let her frailty deter us excessively, beyond what is respecting her to what is patronizing her. She invites Stephen inside."
"1998"	"(12/05/1998)"	"Porn on Stage I'm in a pornographic setting having a sexual interaction with a married medieval-like woman. She is giving me fellatio. There is a braided rope around my erection called the ""The Sluuu"", or ""The ____"". I ejaculate, and my semen spurts out a long ways, onto a stage, which may be at Carter School. My housemate Norman Noman is there. He takes photographs of the semen that I ejaculated. I'm wearing my light blue 'Fiddle and Dance' t-shirt."
"1999"	"(12/05/1998)"	"Dead Wrecker Something happens with a wrecker that we have to watch. We watch it move with our eyes. Something is green. There is chart-like paper feeding out continuously. The wrecker slows and stops, and is dead. There may be another there. There is a man in bed with a quilt from my home. I approach him in a boat, with others. I tell the others to be quiet, saying shhhhh. I want to get this man. I toss my ID at him and hit his head. He is married. He is having an interaction with a woman with large puffy cheeks who wants sex from him."
"2000"	"(12/08/1998)"	"Murderous Retaliation To Torture I'm at home in the kitchen. Two men with handguns are there. Another person and I are guarding these men. They are supposed to be our captors, but we seem to be the one who has captured them. We allow them to have handguns but we can't overtly tell them of make them give us their guns, or they'll react violently. One of the men has his gun pointed directly at me. Fire and flames come out of the barrel. They feel intensely hot! The man is torturing me. If I move, he will shoot me, and if I don't, he will torture me with fire. I feel intense pain, but think this is better than being shot. As this continues I feel my energy building, and being held back. At one moment both men have laid their guns on the table. I spring from my seat and attack the men with all the fury and rage that I can muster. The struggle is brief and intense. I kill both men. My sister Heather has also died as a result of my rage. There is a soda pop fountain dispenser there with the Coke emblem on it. The dispenser is razed in my rage: ripped apart. There is a thin white drainage tube in the dispenser. Chloride drips and collects in a tube in the spill tray. This chloride will kill a person. I handle this destroyed dispenser and some liquid out of the plastic tube. I then spit the liquid out and rinse my mouth out with water, thinking that I could have just ingested chloride. I sit in the living room. The fight is over. I lazily read a magazine, wearing my boxer shorts. People are dead, so I guess I should notify the authorities. I call 911. A woman answers and I tell her there has been a sexual torture and murder-I am both the torture victim and murderer. I explain this to a woman very calmly and she tells me authorities are on the way. I wonder if I will be punished for killing them as retaliation for their torture. I walk in the house and wait for the police to arrive. I'm in the living room. I look into the kitchen and see one of the men, who is white. The other man may be black. The man gets partially up, resting his head on his hands, looking at me. He's alive! I'm terrified. He will kill me. I run out the front door of the house, and know that he goes out the back door. I run around the north side of my neighbors the Stein's house. I near a man coming around from the alley, calling out to me. The voice I hear is from my classmate Jackie Hunter. I am in great danger. I need to stay alive until the police arrive. I hope that the police hurry here. I think I see a car drive east on 2nd Street across Home Avenue. It's spray painted with multi-colors, like my housemate Stephen's old car. I know this is the police, and that they're approaching the scene cautiously, going down a block and then sneaking up on the scene."
"2001"	"(12/15/1998)"	"Ground Cherry Jam I'm making ground cherry jam. I use some of my mom's jam that is already made to make more. I have about two cups of ground cherry juice that is yellow looking. I ask my mom how much jam that will make. I collect ground cherries from the front yard at home near the stone wall. There are young boys there. I show them how to collect the ground cherries. I am oddly dressed in a black Star Wars hat, the kind the evil soldiers wore, and some tight leggings. I go behind a stage where a professor is lecturing to a physics class about a test that the class just took, on which the class did very well. My friend Niles Zelling is in the class. I go to grab a bowl and then leave."
"2002"	"(12/15/1998)"	"Alaskan Cruise I'm on a cruise ship in icy Alaskan waters. It is a large but not a fancy ship, for day tours. There is another ship there. We go by icebergs and see much beautiful scenery. The water is extremely cold."
"2003"	"(12/19/1998)"	"Owing Money I'm in a Brimson environment. I go to an empty office, with no furniture. It's hot inside, and later it may be cold inside. I'm wearing only a towel around my lower body. I see my advisor Mary Monroe changing her underwear. My professor Everett Klanter is there as well. I may sleep on the floor of this office. Two people make sexual comments. There is a man on a computer. He owes a person money, and is threatened by that man. I'm the person who owes money. I'm near two restaurants: a Pizza hut and a ____. I think of robbing these restaurants to get money. I don't know how much cash I'd get, or if all the customers would be paying with checks or credit cards. I talk to the man that I owe money to on the telephone. He asks me about he money. I don't have the money, but I don't tell him this flat out. I hint at this, and indicate when I may get the money."
"2004"	"(12/19/1998)"	"Guilty Cookie Eating I'm north of Brimson on Fish Street or Brighton Avenue, with two kids. We're throwing snowballs at two kids across the road. There's not much snow on the ground, which is soggy with a few ice chunks. I'm surprised at the accuracy with which the boys on my side throw. The boys that are throwing at us are throwing weakly: we bat their snowballs with our hands. I'm walking south towards Brimson with three people, including a man named Alf from my physiology class. The people I'm with find clear plastic bags with stacks of cookies in them. Alf finds a bag, the other two people find a bag. There are different kinds of cookies in the bags. These people may need the cookies for a project at Brimson. I eat one of two of the cookies, and feel guilty because the students need them. We get near Old Avenue. I'm with two people. One of them, a man, says we should hurry to the humanities building to copy the videotape. There is another ground of people. The man in my group says we should hurry, to beat this other group, to do something. I walk near Social Science Hall and Old Main on the way to the humanities building. I see my classmate Julie Adams and friend Sara Miller. I forget Sara's last name. I see a man on a bicycle. He says to me, ""I know what you did."" I feel guilty about doing _____(something). I just feel guilty. Something was going to happen with the cookies. The plan is to hurry and copy the videotape."
"2005"	"(12/23/1998)"	"Good Conference Record I'm attending an Armstrong boys basketball game. I enter the gymnasium and shake my old coach Jackson Shooter's hand. I'm with my dad. We go to sit in the stands. There is a paper or book where I see that this year's team has a 6-1 record in conference play, which is really good! Also, the paper notes the record of my class in 1995 being 9-0 in conference play."
"2006"	"(12/24/1998)"	"Offensive Language I'm sitting near my advisor Mary Monroe and another professor named Jim Ryan. Jim makes a comment involving the word 'boy' or 'boys', and a few other ideas. I verbally attack him, saying, ""What the fuck are you talking about!?"" As soon as I do this I realize that everyone that has heard me is indignant: my language was offensive. I feel guilty for crossing this social boundary. I try to rephrase my words in a way that is equally as firm and harshly critical but not as offensive. My uncle Rusty Redding is standing about 30 feet away talking with some people. He gets my attention to show me how people reacted when they heard my obscenities."
"2007"	"(12/24/1998)"	"Sparse Snacks I seem to be descending from floor to floor of a building. I go from the upper floor to the middle floor. Here, a group is singing songs. My friend Nat Miller is there singing. We move to the next floor down. Cookies and snack items have been placed out, but now there are just leftovers. They were set out earlier and have not been replenished. I walk over and grab a few of the cookies. Jordan Clemens and Jim Ryan, two psychology professors from Brimson, are there."
"2008"	"(12/24/1998)"	"The Moving Floor Escalator I'm with people. At different times my friend Hank Anderson and Emerald Reinhold are with me, as well as a man who has a class with Hank and I. I'm on a flat escalator-like surface that moves around the edges, following the contours of the large room we're in. The escalator is 20-30 feet wide, like an entire moving floor. I ride on it for a class. When it abruptly turns around corners I lose my balance and it takes a moment to regain my balance and composure on the moving floor. I'm with an academic group in a non-traditional academic setting. We're outside. There are large mountains in the background. I comment to Emerald about them. They appear large, but I can fathom their size: I understand the size of one mountain in particular. I think it's actually not as large as it appears. The class is having a program of presentations. Hank and I and the man are supposed to present today, but the class hour is almost over: it's 1:48, and there are 12 minutes of class left, so we'll have to present tomorrow. A one-day delay isn't much of a delay, I think. I thought we might have a longer delay."
"2009"	"(12/24/1998)"	"Swimming With An Axe I'm at Mud Lake near the boat landing with my housemate Stephen Ramos. It's a hot sunny summer day. We walk into the water to swim. We're both wearing life jackets, to float around. I carry a light brown wooden handled axe, to hit things on the surface of the water. We start to swim. I hear that Duke and Kentucky are in overtime for their basketball game. We're swimming near the south end of the lake with three other people. I probe the water in front of me with the axe so I don't swim into a brush pile or into the mucky bottom. Many people are swimming at the lake. A male and a female police officer arrive. They ask us suspiciously what we're doing. I think they've been tipped off that we're doing something wrong. I try to conceal the axe. We're in shallow water near my carp fishing hole. The axe is on the floor of the lake, about 12-18 inches deep. I try to nonchalantly stir up the lake bottom so sediment settles over the axe. The female officer asks me if that is a paddle, pointing behind me. I turn and see the axe handle sticking out of the water a few inches. I try to cover it up, saying that it's just a little paddle that I use, and hope that she won't look at it. She moves towards it. I see the handle is white plastic, and is actually not a handle, but is the leg of a white plastic chair, the kind we have at the Whitman house. I quickly tell the officer that this is actually a chair that I have with me so when I get up into shallow water I can sit in the chair. We both see it's a chair. She doesn't ask me why I said it's a paddle. She thought the white plastic was part of a cooler, and that I had been drinking. She asks me, ""Have you been drinking?"" I reply honestly, smiling, ""No, not today."" The older male officer says Army is losing. He means losing in college sports. I ask him the score. He said they lost 315 to 17! I know that Duke and Kentucky are in double or triple overtime in college basketball."
"2010"	"(12/24/1998)"	"Carrying Esther Thurman's Luggage I'm at Brimson. I see my friend Fran Susse and a man I don't know well. He is 45 minutes late for the crew team's spring break trip. Fran is a crew team leader. She is trying to use her key to unlock a glass gate. Her key won't fit the lock. The crew boats are all loaded, I see. I tell them that I have a key to the Science Hall, and can let them in. I'm actually not sure that my key will work: it's a holiday, and door locks may have been changed. I'm in an airport. I see my friend Holly Lapson, who is coming back to Brimson after a very short Christmas break to take a test. She is wearing headphones, and doesn't seem happy. I talk to her, and am concerned about her. Something bad has happened to a friend of hers. I feel sympathy for her, and want to talk with her. She is not very loquacious. I see my friend Melanie McDyss, who is leaving. She is wearing makeup. I'm in a hurry, but up to this point have not overtly rushed. Now, I start to move quicker. I'm carrying three bags for my friend Esther Thurman. They're not huge, and they are light: I can carry them all right. I also carry a plastic cartridge, about 3x5 or 5x7. I get to the terminal. I need to find a flight departure screen to see if Esther's flight has left yet. There are many computer screens around, like video games. I need to find a particular computer named stigmat, sigmalon, or something like stigma. I look at many computers before I find it. I kneel down to insert the cartridge into the computer. This cartridge will produce a message on the computer from Esther about a departure. I man named Joel that I recognize from Babe Ruth baseball a long time ago walks by, recognizes me, and says hi. I say hi back. I insert the cartridge and attend to the screen. I push button A, and then realize this is wrong, and will cause some unimportant message to come up. I quickly press button B to get the important information. A screen appears that says the flight is now boarding! I should hurry! There is a message from Esther on the screen, saying something like ""You go girl..."". I grab my backpack off a luggage carousel and run! I try to find the gate, which is 23, 27, or 28. I'm frantic! I go the wrong way down a hallway. I realize this and realize where the main hallway to the gates is: back the other way. I turn around and run. I jump off a staircase, over a railing, over the railing of an adjacent staircase, and land on another staircase."
"2011"	"(12/25/1998)"	"Five Base-Ball I'm playing baseball. Several professional baseball players are up before me, including Matt Williams. There are several consecutive home runs hit before me. I'm up to bat. The bat is wooden. The pitcher is mean and arrogant. The throws fast, and is throwing at me. I don't swing. I step back, and he throws wildly. Though it's not a usual thing to do in this sort of game, I walk after about seven balls. The pitcher is just too wild. This enables me to get on base and avoid being hit by a pitch. There are five bases. I'm on second. My friend Tom Napper is up after me. He is a weak batter in our lineup. It will be lucky for me to make it home with him batting, unless by a fluke he bloops the ball into the outfield and it takes a bad hop or gets by a fielder. I have to make it home when he is up, or it seems I'm out. He makes contact, and there are errors in the field. I slide into the next base, where the ball is overthrown. I get up and round the bases, scoring at home. Tom rounds the bases too and scores: an inside-the-park homerun. He has driven in 13 (or 15) runs."
"2012"	"(12/25/1998)"	"Bad Timing Sickness I am sick. I feel my neck and my glands are swollen and tender. I feel terrible. I had just been healthy, and now I'm sick. This is really bad timing for sickness because I want to play sports. I want to try out for football."
"2013"	"(12/25/1998)"	"Charred Mountain I'm in a hilly, mountainous area. The land is charred and black: it has burned. My friend Tim and Niles Zelling, Jackie Hunter, and John Thomas are there."
"2014"	"(12/25/1998)"	"Honest Interactions I'm at a library. I go to a desk to pay for damage that was done to books while I check them out: one page was torn out of a book and a magazine. I don't think I inflicted the damage. I sit down across from a woman at the desk. There is a pile of money in front of me that she doesn't see because it's behind part of the desk. I give it to the woman, saying someone must have left it here. I think I do this because if came back to claim the money and I had it, I would feel guilty and greedy. So, I give it to the woman at the desk. I talk to her about paying for the missing pages. It will cost about $1 per page. I'm sick: I have a cold and my nose is running. I blow my nose into my handkerchief. I feel crusty and sick."
"2015"	"(12/25/1998)"	"Not Knowing The Answer I'm in a class (maybe biology), taking a test. Part of the test is timed. The question I'm working on has me completely dumbfounded: I just don't know the answer at all. I run out of time and also leave another question unanswered. I'm not too concerned about that, I just leave it. People talk about how they ran out of time on the test, implying they could answer the questions with more time. For me, more time wouldn't have mattered: I didn't know the answer. There seem to be some sort of drill, maybe a fire drill, where people leave the building. This is not a true emergency: people are very lax about it."
"2016"	"(12/25/1998)"	"Rusty's Shotgun Gift I'm at a family Christmas gathering. My uncle Rusty Redding has brought three gun cases. He gives me a shotgun as a Christmas gift."
"2017"	"(12/25/1998)"	"Chicken Catching Chaos I'm catching chickens. The people with me are inexperienced. I don't remember all the precise duties of a catcher, and all the exact procedure. The setup is different. There are different size drawers, and a different number of chickens go in each drawer, than what I remember. We don't do a good job: we are slow and incompetent. We regroup later and try again in a different setting. At one point marble-sized bits of white fluff are put in a small drawer to fill it. These bits of fluff are the chickens. I'm assigned to one of two groups."
"2018"	"(12/27/1998)"	"Faulty Stadium Expansions I'm in a large cement stadium sitting down low close to the field. There are upper decks in the stadium. It is virtually empty: only a few spectators are beginning to trickle in. Then there is a tall row of seats, as high as an upper deck, between the field and the seats I'm in. This row surrounds the field. The new seats are made to hold more people. This doesn't make sense to me because the original stadium seats not have a blocked view. These new seats are an effort to expand, to accommodate more people. This expansion is ineffective."
"2019"	"(12/27/1998)"	"Butt Broom At Kevin's I'm at my friend Kevin Simpson's house. I seem to be alone, and am staying there for a length of time: at least overnight. I go out to the garage. I'm standing on a stepladder going up to the rafters. I find a long pole in the rafters, and I suck it like I was giving fellatio. I think I would be good at fellatio. I see a broom with a wooden handle. The handle is a good width for a phallic object, for anal stimulation. The handle has a ball at the end of it, carved into the wood. I take it and start back to the house. I notice Kevin's father Dilbert's vehicle is there. As I get to the deck I see Dilbert in his old bedroom, though the window. He seems very happy to see me. He comes to the door as I enter. I think he knows I was staying here. We greet each other. Kevin is there. I go back towards the old spare bedroom. Dilbert and Kevin are involved in some sort of ritual. I see Halloween cards in front of them. I can't tell whether this is a game of if it has real meaning for them, as in a religious ritual."
"2020"	"(12/27/1998)"	"Playing A Guitar I'm at the Brimson post office. I have set my gray jacket, hat, and gloves down near the office. Later, I can't find my jacket and see that it's hanging inside the post office on a coat rack behind the mailboxes. I ask a man who works there if I can get my jacket. The office is closed. He has come around the other way when he heard me knocking. He is not cooperative, and tells me that I can't get my jacket. I get angry! I raise my voice and explain my situation to him. I lie and say that I just put my jacket down for a moment to check my mail, and when I returned it was gone and everything was locked up! Actually, my jacket had been there for a while, but I think that it makes no difference if it was there a minute or longer. I'm angry, and my words convey my disdain for what has happened, and that I want it to be corrected immediately! The man goes into the back and gets my jacket and returns it to me. I'm outside the post office window. A male student with a guitar is there. Something is wrong with the guitar: the man can't play it. I get the guitar. My classmate Fred Potter is there with us. Fred plays guitar. I walk towards the Science Hall strumming the guitar. I don't really know how to play, but it's fun walking and strumming. It's an attention-getter. As I walk I notice that many of the people I pass look like each other, like they are in pairs. I realize that it is twin day, like a twin prospective freshman day. I enter the Science Hall with the guitar. Outside it is a nice warm sunny day: T-shirt weather. When I enter I encounter a group of my friends, including Niles Zelling, Nat Miller, Hilary Nano, and others. They're sitting in a group. I join them. I've been strumming one particular chord all the way here. Niles has a guitar. He plays, and I play chords. I don't play well: my chords sound off, but it's no big deal. It's fun. The strings on my guitar are very loose, and need to be changed. I feel very good having this guitar: happy-go-lucky, free, and lively."
"2021"	"(12/30/1998)"	"Spoiled Deer I've been deer hunting with my friends Stephen, Jose, and Franco Ramos, uncle Adam Redding, and a black man named Brian. We have taken two deer: a buck and a doe. We're at my home in Oak Valley. It's evening. The deer were shot earlier in the day. Jose shot the buck. The Ramos' don't gut the deer. I get mad at them for this because the venison will spoil, and the deer will be wasted. The Ramos' are very nonchalant about this, saying the meat will spoil or has spoiled, and can't be used, oh well. Adam and I feel differently. We say because it's cool outside the meat will be fine. The bacteria _____ need 45 degrees Fahrenheit to grow. It's cool: for sure less than 50 degrees, and probably less than 40. We argue for the use of the meat. I argue that they can't just shoot a deer and not use the meat: one just doesn't do that. It is Brian's birthday. It will be dusk soon: it's 6:15pm now. I hurry to get ready for the evening hunt. I usually like to have much more time than we have now. We go back to hunt. I argue with Stephen and Jose, saying that their logic is terrible, and is ignorant, narrow-minded, and even backwards. Stephen comments critically that they all worked around my schedule just to be here. Franco is driving out to the land, and we ride with. I talk with two men next to me. There is no sense in being on bad terms with members of your own hunting party. I ask them which stand they're sitting in. There is only an hour until dark. The road is covered with pieces of deer antlers. There are new, expensive homes along the road that have been built recently. I'm riding a bicycle down the road, with the two men on the back of it. We enter an affluent neighborhood. We go down a steep hill. The men may now be walking, and I'm riding or walking the bicycle. There are steps that lead down to a garage area, which is very spacious and neatly organized. We go past several rich people. In the garage there are several cars suspended off the floor about 10 feet, held in place hydraulically. I walk under and around them, to a large open shed or garage. The ceiling is about 50 feet high. There are many large metal axe head-like pieces that drop from ceiling to the floor. These are about seven feet long and two to three feet wide, with sharpened edges. There may be between 20 and 50 of them. They drop from the ceiling, crushing or slicing anything beneath them, and are then lifted back up. I try to avoid these, jumping from side to side, running and dodging them. On the other side of this garage-like building is a set of closed doors. I near this other side, and on the wall I see two large rectangular yellow panels. They are arranged vertically, about 20-30 feet long, and a couple feet wide, parallel to each other. I know that now is the main enemy, the full main enemy that I have not yet met. I do not see the main enemy, but know that the time has come."
"2022"	"(12/30/1998)"	"Ineffective Bow Hunting I'm in a suburb hunting deer with a bow with three other people. I get three plastic or rubber-tipped arrows. There are many other hunters around. A buck runs by. Hunters release a flurry of arrows, none of them hitting the deer. It doubles back and goes in front of me I shoot, and my arrow bounces off the side of the deer, completely ineffective. The deer turns into a man. I run and hide in the pit room at home. My friend Hank Anderson is looking for me. He is coming from my neighbor Alvin Broud's house. He enters the pit room and finds me. I'm having sex with my classmate Megan Cunningham when he enters."
