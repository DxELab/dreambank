"0001"	"(1997-??-?? (?)) I was out the front of the house, and I saw a creepy guy. I tried to scream but I couldn't. I ended up getting inside, and Mom put me over her shoulder and was carrying me down the hallway. The guy came inside and he had a knife. I was holding one of those little dog toys with the plastic head and the bean-y body. He was right behind us, and I couldn't do anything. Then Mom put me in a cupboard."
"0002"	"(1997-??-?? (?)) I was walking down the hallway (at Newtown) from my room, and there were windows where the cupboards should have been and there were these creepy monkeys. I walked past the toilet and there was this thing looking in. It was a light brown colour, and had little black eyes. It looked like the red thing from Looney Tunes. It was called the Easter. It ate Easter eggs, and went ""mmm"". It was really evil and scary. I went and hid in Mom and Dad's room. The curtains were closed, and the Easter was right outside, going ""mmm""."
"0003"	"(????-??-?? (?)) [recurring] I was on a bus with Ezra and Mom. I fell asleep and when I woke up I was the only one left on the bus. I got out and ended up in this abandoned town thing. I then ended up in this monster park thing. These monsters chased me and my friend. They ended up changing into one. There was a Target and Woolworths. There were lots of doors. I got out and got back to abandoned town. [Sometimes I'm by myself, sometimes I had a friend] ."
"0004"	"(2000-05-20 (9)) I was at school with Danielle and we were talking about Angelo. We were waiting for Sineita and Angelo. We saw the bus turn up and we ran up to it but only Angelo came out. We asked him if Sineita was on the bus but he said no. Sineita turned up in the car and she didn't look right. When we were in class she was really angry and she did her work, but she wouldn't talk to anybody and she kept mumbling and giving us angry looks. I didn't know what we had done wrong. At recess I asked her what was wrong and she told us the whole story: ""Last night when I was having dinner we had chicken, and Mom, Gemma and I were eating it but Gemma and Mom didn't eat they said it tasted funny and they only had a tiny bite and I had nearly eaten two pieces. The chicken had been poisoned and I had the most so I got sick."" Sineita said. ""I'm going to die!"". She started crying. ""The Royal Show is in two weeks and I'm going."" she said. ""But you won't be alive then."" I said."
"0005"	"(200?-??-?? (?)) A spider pushed me into the pool and held me at the bottom. Ezra and a friend were already dead."
"0006"	"(200?-??-?? (?)) Mom picked me up from somewhere and she had an orange Toyota. It was all orange on the inside too, and I didn't want to go in it."
"0007"	"(2002-??-?? (?)) I went to an amusement park place with Dad, Ezra, Farrah and Valerie. We weren't allowed to leave. We were shot at and caught by the president of the park. We escaped and drove the car through some water, which was hard. There were pieces of paper with people on them flying around. There were chickens running around in the water."
"0008"	"(2003-??-?? (?)) Me, Ezra, Farrah, Pippin (Lord of the Rings) and Dad were standing in the street somewhere. I was friends with Pippin. I was talking to some friends. I turned around, and Pippin was walking off, he turned around and looked me in the eye and I got shy. We ended up in Ezra's stomach and other stupid things."
"0009"	"(200?-??-?? (?)) I was at Mom's and there was a video camera hanging down from the balcony and the screen was playing a movie with Quincy and a girl having sex. Evil lepers came like zombies toward the house. We ran inside, and my class from 2003 was there. We were all trying not to get touched, because the lepers broke in. I got touched, as did Devin and two others. We went on an excursion, and Devin and I had to sit out."
"0010"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at school. I went to the toilet and there were two creepy guys. I flew over a whole house with a bike.  Me and some others dressed in costumes and broke this guy's neck. This group stole something and then we got it back. I was then with Terrence and some others and Mom picked me up from school and it was about 10.00. Then I was on a boat. Julius was friendly with me. I saw Victor Garber and he was really old, but looked just like Dad. He talked to me."
"0011"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) There was a school disco thing. The theme was fishing and water stuff. There was some competition thing."
"0012"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) We went to this big fun place like 2 Much Fun. We were there with the school (Year 7 class). Aron was playing with these strange dinosaur things. Ramona and I went to go down slide. Ezra was there."
"0013"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) We were in some big house. There was a big tornado. It missed us, and a girl was in our basement."
"0014"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at home, but it was different. It was dark outside. Jayson was staying over. We heard that there was a tornado coming. We went to this deli thing and the tornado came and was coming closer. We got in the car and raced home and I kept looking out the window watching it."
"0015"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) We were at the Gold Coast, but it was really different. I got locked out of the hotel room. I went down to the beach and there were big waves so we couldn't swim but they knocked us in."
"0016"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at some freaky place with a restaurant. I was outside next to the restaurant and it was dark, and I was near a swamp thing. I saw these dead people and they were talking to me. It was actually kind of scary."
"0017"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at a big shop and me and others from school were all sitting in a circle. Then Classmate-M-18 (French) started breathing funny and walked away. I followed him and then he was telling me something and he died. I ran back and got help, but then I couldn't find him."
"0018"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at school during S & E. These people were after me. I went home and they were there. I had a fight and I was winning but then they started strangling me. I called out and an old lady left her door open and the guy killed her, but then we fought again and I killed them."
"0019"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) Ezra and I both wanted to play Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. I don't know what happened, but there were strange people everywhere and then me, Ezra, Jayson and Virgil were on these stairs trying to spy and hide from people."
"0020"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) Some guy stole something off this friend guy. I went up this building thing and I got it back for him. Then we went to this restaurant and this gargoyle thing went nuts. There was a freaky storm outside. I went on the roof to escape but the gargoyle got me."
"0021"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at a school with Widget. I lost her. I was looking for information on planets. I went outside and Mom and Dad were there in their own cars. I had to get Widget. I found her but she looked freaky and she had a big nose. Then I went back to Mom's."
"0022"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at some place which I think was the Gold Coast. Ezra and I were locked out of the room so we were walking around and it got dark. I lost Ezra and I got on a train. I remember Ramona was somewhere too."
"0023"	"(2004-??-?? (?)) I was at Nana's. She had this dragon thing. It turned into a girl after a while, who decided she liked me. I was then at a shop. Jayson and some people I don't know were all chasing each other. It was Sims like and relationships were going up. I hid somewhere and when I came out, everyone chased me. We went down in a ditch and I killed these two guys. The dragon girl, who was called Louise, said to some people that she had killed the guys, not me."
