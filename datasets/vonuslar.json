    "description": "This remarkable series of 6,100 dreams in German comes from the philosophical psychologist Detlev von Uslar, a German-born citizen of Switzerland and a Professor Emeritus at the University of Zürich.   Von Uslar published these dreams in a companion CD-ROM to his book, Tagebuch des Unbewussten: Abenteuer im Reich der Träume (Diary of the Unconscious: Adventures in the Realm of Dreams), published by Königshausen und Neumann in 2003. The CD-ROM includes reveries, daydreams, and his thoughts about the dreams, but we include only the dreams here.\n\n(The book itself discusses his views of the dreams and his general ideas about dreams. For a brief summary of each chapter of von Uslar's book, click here.)"
