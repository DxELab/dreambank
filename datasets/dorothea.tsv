Mother says I may divide it with J., M., and F. I start to eat and am called on for scene 2 of play. Lines forgotten but it doesn't matter for play shifts to one like Torch Bearers and we are playing behind scenes. Can see people in front tearing down set scene. Poor audience.

"47"	"(11/28/25)"	"In penitentiary for few months for legal offense. Jailer, rather heavy-set, says he has vacancy but it would be inappropriate for me to apply for it seeing I'm a prisoner.

She falls as if seat had been taken from under her. "
"52"	"(01/03/26)"	"I went to a church but the service was Sunday school. The teacher was Rev. R. of Iowa city but did not look just like him, made me think of Wallin. The room was a long narrow one opening into a church auditorium. Rev. R. said something about collection. I remembered I had none but would look in my coat pocket. Went to coat room. In reaching over folding chairs knocked down some caps, blue and gray angoratams, and found some money, mostly Chinese coppers had fallen out. I picked them up and took them with me as I did not know which wrap they had fallen from. Return to class, sit at side table. Found a short man, dark man by Rev. R. and several pupils. They were drawing up a biographical sketch of Rev. R. Something about an election as to his continuance. He asked if his son could join the class. All said yes. I wondered why a boy in a woman's class. Boy looked pleased and embarrassed. Then we were eating at the same long table. Peculiarly served meal. I asked people near me how to find claimant of my find explaining why I kept the cash. Might I leave it with the dean of women. People around me are changing. Some are from Fargo College. Decide I will advertise in the Iowan.   People are leaving table. I look up and find Rev. R. and others talking but at our end we are through. Excuse self, go to coat room for wraps. Coat room is a suite of three rooms. Tell some girls ""I'll show you why I was late for class but I don't want others to see."" Three girls laughing spread themselves out as a screen and I show them the money. One girl is B. Wellman. A tiny Chinese girl sees and asks, ""Is it Chinese money?"" I ask ""Did you lose some?"" She says ""no"" but names someone who did. I look for paper to write down my name and address and phone and have him come for money. She says, ""He'll come."" And then he's there. A rather stout Chinese enters the inner coatroom and gives as his name the one the child gave. He leads me to outer room and we seat ourselves in rockers. There is a woman there who is Chinese but her face is half dark like a Negro's. I ask him how he lost money in a woman's coatroom. He says, ""But she was with me."" I ask him how much he lost. For a long time can get no answer. Then he says, ""40 coppers."" I start to count them out for him but there are not that many. Suddenly I realize something is wrong and that he had not really lost that money. Then we are on the street, I coming after him. He throws the money into a basement window grating. Then changes its place and drops its. He tries to extract it but goes on. I come up and try to find it. There are broken dolls in the dirt by the window but it is a business house and at last after I have dug about for a while, I realize it dropped into a room inside but it is noon and I can't get in. I enter waiting room of the building but keep on retreating to corner where I shan't be seen to fix bloomers. When skirt is up a woman is ushered in to wait. I apologize for my condition. Other people enter. A man asks if I will help him invoice that p.m. I say I'll be glad to have work but I've never invoiced before but I's sure I could do it. Then he looks at the woman's papers and tells her to go away until she's 14. I wonder how she can look so old. Then another one waiting tells me to take my turn but I say I've done but I must see the heads. Then father comes in wearing a beard. (He had it cut off some years before his death.) I think I must be seeing wrong for he's dead. It must be his brother, uncle M., but it is father and I ask him, ""How could you come back?"" He says ""Oh, I could"", and kisses me. I say, ""It feels just like you again."" He laughs, ""Of course."" We go downstairs to the basement. I see an almost empty room reminding me of the Sunday school room and tell father, ""The day nursery used to be there but we moved it upstairs."" We go through many rooms. In one room rich people are eating lunch. At last we reach the office near the window behind some junk. Another man has hurried forward to look too."
"53"	"(03/04/26)"	"My room adjoining R's family. Some trouble about radiator. I object to her children coming into my room without knocking. Told C. (R's husband) how my present landlady does not knock and came in twice finding me stripped. Large hole in floor in entrance between rooms and man working there. Am told R. has a newborn son. Eliz has named him babe of Bethlehem. Go to see child. He has red gold hair. Very strong. Starts to sit alone. Grows bigger and stronger and asks for food. I protest it can't be so strong a child. This must be a dream, but it seems very real and insists it is not a dream. Ask R. what she is doing out of bed. Discussed whether I had noted her condition. See as if remembered her father stout, walking outdoors with C. Ask if she if she is going to call child some other name. Say initials B.O.B. people will think surname is O'Brien...Deserted banquet hall. See chocolate dolls. Start to eat one. Find its hair is spun chocolate. Before all eaten, other people enter. Secretary to Univ. club among them. More food on tables. She tells us to take some. I eat crumbly tart, cookie and wrap up in paper parts of two cakes. Feel heat and keep adding papers to preserve hands. The room is large with very long windows, takes up large part of a stone University building."
"54"	"(08/19/26)"	"Looking at photograph mother is showing of some Mission function (where she worked). Photo appears to be cut off at the end. In photo mother is giving the mission head a large basket of flowers. I say to H. ""look at Eu."" In picture see W. catch e. by arm and draw him up. Then Eu. And two little children come running down in horse reins decorated with flowers. I conclude I must be looking at a movie. Yet it still seems to be held in the hand. Scene shifts to long banqueting table. About to eat but have no chair. A number of people begin to hand in chairs. Some mix-up with person next to me about salad but I finally get mine. Then, 4 of us at window to watch boxing. Two people are strangers but the other one with me is someone I know, B.B.? We have folding chairs. First set them at some distance, later close to window. Other two at end of long couch. First act, a very handsome dark-haired boy is to wrestle with another. The two clinch and hit. At last get hold of each other and turn somersaults quickly, in such a way that first one then the other is on back. At last dark-haired boy is down and other in a green stripped suit up. Then the first rising and we see him crying. I think it must be over his defeat. Next act is on a very high scaffold. The boxers are so distant that we can't see well. Friend says to me she wonders why boxing is always on such poor stages. We walk over to field to see better. Quite a crowd. I say ""What a lot we're seeing it for 50 cents."" ""No, that is the price of the coming play, Snow white and the seven dwarfs."" We find seats at the end of plank benches near a roped off ring, seats are full. Then some people come on with large cloths, stiff as cardboard, 4 ft. by 6, number of sheets in each hand. Cloths painted in old Egyptian style. While man sing something from bible that I wonder if it isn't sacrilegious about somebody, tearing them in two. Then we can't see well. Things in between my friend and another person go to place to see better. The other one of our party urges me to go too, but I think I can see well enough. Then we start across field. All of a sudden the field is divided into rooms by green curtains. Push past these and look down sort of alley, think I see part of show. Then suddenly see large stage at far end of field to the right. I know it is the stage but it too is curtained with green Pullman sleeper curtains."
"55"	"(12/02/26)"	"Riding on a river steamer. Great crowd at stern. One man takes a baby, small but acting as if older and happy. He ties it up under his arms where all can see. Baby laughs. Baby belongs to some woman. (Associated woman with self.) Steamer goes on stopping frequently at crowded towns. Passes one almost black boat with no windows but through open front see a woman passenger. The boat is like a Chinese one. I talk to passengers about boat and decide it's a freight boat. Our steamer has sides that open up. I see a two year old baby standing by open side looking over and rush to seize it and carry it over to other side and ask it to sit with me. A door is swinging in the way of our seats. We go to kitchen. Cook explains some article cooked. See a large oblong tank filled with hot water. Cook hands us things to eat. Nearing destination. Scramble to dress to get off. Must change my white shoes and stockings to darker ones. Change lying face down. See wharf where we are to disembark. It appears crowded. No place for boat to dock. Previously one man left behind and one nearly so jumps on after boat is leaving. R. tells me she has had invitations to walk on shore from every male passenger. She shows me letters to herself and J. which advise her marrying a man even if he is foreign. I see three bridges for an instant. On one is my name in full. My name appears to be drawn on a letter and over river at the same time."
"56"	"(12/05/26)"	"Quite worked up because mother asks me on a very busy morning to make ten calls for her to leave money. She complains of me to a servant. I protest to R."
"57"	"(12/08/26)"	"There had been some disaster, a fire? I was in the basement of a building. Someone said ""There has been plenty of water."" I saw various pumping devices.  I started to men's w.c. and met B. T. coming out. Surprised that neither of us is embarrassed. He talked quite friendly to me. Getting ready for train trip. Hurrying to pack. Finally all done and put on wraps, good coat and best hat. I have two suitcases but Joe, a little boy, is not ready. His things must be packed. He has too much and must choose what to take. Tell him will miss train. I find my watch is fast and so less hurry. On train with mother. She is wearing an old blue morning dress and is waiting at the w.c. I am provoked that she is wearing that old dress. The car has dark red seats in three rows, two of single seats and one of double. Someone stops train and gets off to pick up something she has dropped through  w.c. Mother and I at end of car. Mother drops nickel, gets down after it and gets back in wrong car. I tell her to hurry as train might leave without her. Look under cars. See dirty river, puddles on bank and trash thrown out. See people on boat in river. It is almost swamping. Train is mow a steamer and go to rescue. "
"58"	"(12/29/26)"	"On a Chinese boat, unusual plan. Chinese woman cook gives me quarters. I am bothered because it is only a corner, no separate room. She gives me bedpan. I see a narrow passage at side of boat. Two children, about 2 and 4, are there. The younger, an English child wears a pinafore. Their mothers are upstairs. Then I am teaching. Looking for classroom. Find 4-2. Small class. I ask them, ""Is this the class that has no teacher?"" ""I am to teach you."" Look at program. Read B. Arith . A reading . Call B class and go to another class for lesson. Send class to black board which is on almost worn-off plaster. Children  start work. First question is, ""Imagine a goose, a kangaroo. Draw them."" Class is in alcove. Two boys disappear. A class returns. I call for the two boys, get no response. "

She would be impressed by the diatribe her father is giving. I am in a garden. We start down a path. Eu ( a nephew) is standing about level with my shoulder on muddy bank near deep path. He is about to jump. I ask him if I shall help him to jump down slowly and start to do so. He becomes frightened, flies into a tantrum and seizes my chin into his mouth biting. I tell him I won't make him jump if he'll only let go. As I'm waking I think ""Oh, I've been asleep that's why Eu. seemed so small."""
"68"	"(07/20/29)"	"I am in a house but a Catholic priest is to confirm me. There are candles. I lean over and whisper to him only he now seems to be Rev. S. (a Protestant minister). ""Don't let my mother know, she'll feel so terrible but I am doing this for my husband to be."" For this is preliminary to marriage. I think my husband to be must be D. if this is necessary."
"69"	"(04/28/31)"	"I was going for a ride. Heard the Dunlays had returned. I said I must run to the office and see if they had come for they'll be sure to stay at the Donna. Waiting for someone to finish talking, look below curtain and see H. Dun. there. Run over and embrace her. See J. Dun Jr. Hr looks fat and flabby, has no clothes on. His father greets me and says to Jr. ""Go on with your sun bath."" Talk to H. Dun but she doesn't respond. See she is wearing a big instrument like a telephone receiver at her ear. I exclaim ""Oh, what have you done to your ear."" It seems she is deaf. Still little response from her. I feel very sad. She doesn't look like H. Dun but she is her. She has very bushy light brown hair with a reddish tinge. I now go for a ride with her and three of my family (The Dun's were old friends and I had just heard they were coming to Hawaii again that summer.)"
"70"	"(05/03/31)"	"I was outdoors watching a party start off in a homemade auto. The engine acted up and the car spun round  and round in the yard until it fell to pieces. We rushes up to find the remains of the party, all women, and were puzzled not to find anyone. A big dog attacks me, throws me down but I manage to hold his muzzle so he can't bite. (Miss W. had told of a similar attack on her the preceding evening.) The dog is lying all over on top of me."

"72"	"(05/06/31)"	"Anticipatory dream of class picnic, I was to chaperone. Hunt for Miss J. to ask if 10 p.m. is early enough for return. Trouble locating her but when I do she says ""Yes"" Truck arrives at 2:30 loaded with food, etc. while I'm in the library. "
"73"	"(05/13/31)"	"On a steamer. It's been pretty rough. I am walking on deck wearing winter coat. I throw it back, revealing blue figured slip. At breakfast only a few there. Neighbor at left, a semi-strange lady crowds me. Suggest she moves a little. I am at a corner table. My brother has come. I hurry out to meet E., kiss him, bring him in, ask lady her name so I can introduce him. She says it very queerly, make it out as Gahn-Dibb-Lee. Introduce her to mother, E., but Jr. Gets up before E. can so there is some confusion. By this time, there is quite a crowd in the dining room. Wonder if mother will suggest family prayers and invite all these strangers to stay if they want to. "
"74"	"(05/14/31)"	"I am led through two locked doors, then taken through trap door up attic in a hammock by men. Have me part way up when they say, ""We'd better not let her see these first"" and they let down 1 or 2 unconscious men. I see part of a man's head, black hair and a very white face. Then I'm up attic. Two children are playing with dolls that are really babies. I think they are illegitimate babies and that's what I will be made to produce. I ask where the babies were found. They point to a corner. I ask R. for toilet. She says there is none up here and I'll have to get along without. I find slop pail partly filled with soapy water and use it while R. is smoothing up bed with no sheets. I hear the urine in a stream. I know torture is to await me. (Woke needing to urinate.)"
"75"	"(07/01/31)"	"Sex relations with Jo,"
"76"	"(07/27/31)"	"It was in school. A little dark naked girl found in bed under sheet. Ask why there. Older girl says she is her best beau's girl and so must be with her. Child says all his girls must be together. There is writing on blackboard but some of it is gone. I am waiting for class to assemble. Discover desk is gone and an old makeshift is in its place. I indignantly remark that I had been promised I could have it until Tuesday and begin to search for it. Go down to find M. has left but janitor takes me to his room to get desk, but in room is only a cot, no desk. I protest it was the desk I wanted. ""Oh, I didn't understand"", says the janitor, and we start to another place. I think it must be time for second bell. The janitor is blonde with whitish hair (I had been bothered by QM's demand for keys."
"77"	"(07/--/31)"	"Baby is dead. (Probably F.) Looking at child, notice hand stirs. Suspect child not really dead. Call others. Baby moves more. We must notify undertaker, etc. Child not dead and there will be no funeral at 2 p.m. See child playing rather actively."
"78"	"(09/07/31)"	"Before the oral English exam I was to help give, I am on my way to take language requirement exam for Ph.D. Come to open door and start to go in but say, ""Oh, we shouldn't pass through there"", but a man says, ""Yes, you can pass through."" We stop and talk and he shows us things. I keep thinking that we'll be late but keep on...We should be there by 9. At last we leave and do arrive late in empty classroom. The examiner (my dean?) comes in and I ask if I shall withdraw while he tests S but he says no, he'll take both of us together. I had been looking at her Japanese books and had planned to cram while she was being tested and so am disturbed. I have done no reviewing and can think of only one Japanese word, ""Sayonara."" He goes out and a number of Caucasian students begin to straggle in for class. When he returns I protest that I don't think I should be required to take the exam as I already have my Ph.D. He says he has nothing to say about it but did the office insist? I say the office had not ordered me but they had told me to go and try the exam at the station. He suggests I might find out at the office. Then I see Stoddard and say, ""I haven't seen you for months."""
"79"	"(09/15/31)"	"On a steamer passing many islands. I identify some of the lesser Hawaiian islands but can't one. Inquire and am told it is ""A-pi-it"". On the rocky edge of a crater climbing. It is dark and dangerous. Ask, ""Isn't it usually dark?"" ""It is."" We are trying to get photos. Looking at two photos of mountain scenery, very like each other but of two different places. ""Come around this point and look up the valley and you'll see the falls."" It is the we reach the crater edge. Ask if we can't get in from lower story. Then see some of our group running across the floor of the crater. They look very small. The third person descends to catch. She is so foolish to run like that when tired from climbing. See a long flight of stairs leading into crater. Person turns into insect... At a party set table showing Pit-Pat pictures in my big scrapbook. Her mother calls her by some other name. Ask her about her name and am told several nicknames for her. There is a fussy doily put on and off the table. Pit-Pat wants a drink. Jr. Is complaining about a rusty buckle. Can't keep his pants up as buckle is broken. Has to wear old suit. Marked contrast to well-pressed new blue suit and the shabby old one which is not good enough to wear in the steamer. Heavy dark man, a German, is talking to me about his planned trip East to see Edison and various 'phone business' places."
"80"	"(11/11/31)"	"It was early morning and I was disturbed too son in my sleep. (fact) but that I'd straighten up a bit and go back to bed. Place embroidered pillow on a small trunk near door, undo packages. Furniture near door disarranged on account of bringing in new bookcase. Finally finish and return to bed but first look at time 9:45. That will be too late for breakfast so might sleep some more. Start to lie down. One of the men had not gone and he stretches out on bed by me and closes his eyes. I am startled and ask what he is doing here, tell him to dress and get out. He makes love to me but I struggle and make him leave, emphatically expressing my opinion. Men from rooms on our hall (Dr. I a red haired thin man and Capt. C.) offer their services if he troubles me again. A girl with the red haired man explains who he is. I wonder how they knew. Then I'm outdoors and the man joins me again saying, ""I never thought much about religion until I saw you this morning. May I come and talk about it with you?"" I see it's almost 10:30 and say, ""Why don't you go to church as I am going then?"" thinking he will want to go too. He continues walking besides me and hints his real desire is to make love. I grab his shoulder and turn him around and tell him to first show me his trustworthiness. A lot of women see, understand and talk it over. One says that I will be the center of discussion. Another tells me he got zero in Boy Scout score. Mrs. C. tells of his attempts on children. Mrs. Mc. calls Betty to warn her of him. I yearn after him all the same and get sick about it. Rush to their toilet to spit up clots of blood etc."
"81"	"(12/29/31)"	"Looking across I see mother in a window whipping M. I can see her bare nates plainly with a little white cloth and see the ruler crossing them exactly. In the background are three small boys. I feel satisfaction at sight but think M. is rather old for whipping since he's 17."

Morning prayers, several visitors. Difficulty in gathering. Visitors in next room singing popular songs. I am almost the only one who comes to prayers as expected."
"86"	"(03/08/32)"	"Saw snow falling in huge wet flakes. Then it turned to heavy rain."
"87"	"(03/28/32)"	"In large safety deposit vault alone. Many doors open. Take from three boxes. In one icy-hot thermos bottle."
"88"	"(04/19/32)"	"My hand was hurt. I was trying to bandage it. I am 10 years old. Had trouble pinning it. A man reclining on a cave-like upper verandah offered his assistance. He pinned the bandage and asked J. if he had ever seen a stone couch such as the one he reclined and offered to show it to him. J. went up and I turned sadly away because I knew they wouldn't want me as I was a girl."
"89"	"(05/26/32)"	"Outdoors a little circle of white chickens on a green lawn. I step back and find I had stepped on and crushed a chick but it was dead before. In library at T.C.T. Many changes. Shelves being rearranges and a cozy corner with leather cushions added. I say how many advantages we get now that we are part of the University. Am reading a June magazine and see Wilcox's illustrated edition of Little Women. Shall read it next. Some hunting among books. Think I must go back to my hotel room but it is raining hard. O.M. comes in, offers candy to a number of people entering with him. I hesitate as to whether to step up and share as he passes to every one else first but when he comes to me, I ask if the white piece is peppermint. Then I'll take a lavender piece. He presses upon me a very large reddish piece too. Then I look out of the window and exclaim, ""Just look at the streets, they are flowing like a river. The autos are pushing back waves of water."" Then two cars get in so deeply that the engines are covered and at last only a blur is visible. 8 or 10 bodies come floating down. One 8 year old child with a smile on his face. At least he didn't suffer. C.D. suggests first-aid. Then she is pushing me. I feel angry and frightened lest I fall into the water. [T.C.T. formerly Normal School became part of University in 1931.]"
"90"	"(05/29/32)"	"I was at a dinner party. As we rose from the table a girl came to me, asking if I remembered her. I didn't but pretended to. We talked of former happenings and I walked with her diagonally across the green lawn. She asked where I was taking her and I said ""Oh, I'll take you back"" and we walked back to the crowd. They were going to the country club for bridge, but I was not asked to that part of the party. I reasoned that it was because they were all men. I wondered through the club grounds looking for someone with whom to play bridge but it was a man's club. I returned to the lanai and found the rest hadn't gone yet so I looked for mother. Found her going to an outdoor toilet. Ask why not seek accommodations inside but she said there were none. Someone told me she was sorry I had to go to star and couldn't go with them. It was raining. An earlier dream was about a job my husband had gotten for us both. It was some sort of chemical research for him. My job was not clear. I thought it was probably clerical or statistical. We were in a laboratory setting up an experiment. Watched gas forming and small explosions in a test tube. I told others I knew nothing of chemistry. They would have tom check. Then some gas escaped. The room was filled with strong fumes and purplish puffs of gas. (Iodine such as did escape in a class of my undergraduate days.) My head ached. I went to open windows. J. Dun came to help. I sat down , in entry by window to recover..."
"91"	"(05/29/32)"	"Heard a mother talking to a child. She came with a two year old. I asked him about his bath and showed him my large doll with very long clothes. Turned up its skirts so he could see its feet. He was playing with toys about the large room. I suggest him building a block track for his train. He goes to get the long blocks to build the track. "
"92"	"(07/09/32)"	"Settling into a hotel room. Was to share it with Q. Somebody wanted to share closet. I show it is not large enough, will have to have room for my husband's clothes. The closet has a very elevated floor. Then I realize Q and I are not married and had better not share room. Decide he can sleep on a cot over there and it'll be all right, only how can we keep others from knowing we share a room. Packing Q's things scattered around. Must take them to him but maybe he doesn't want all as he may be returning. Put my clock away but still can hear it ticking. No, it's his small red traveling clock on the dresser that I hear. Gathering up things. Trying to phone for the dray man. Men think box too heavy to carry down. Afraid of missing train."
"93"	"(07/14/32)"	"Turn head and see M. pulling on trousers. He is wearing a khaki flannel shirt and dark blue trousers. I turn quickly, wondering why he changes trousers in public; decide he thought we were looking the other way. Mother in front of me tips her head back until her face is upside down. I kiss her forehead. "

Will never see them again so kiss them goodbye. Barely touch D's lips because he's married but give Q a real kiss. I step off as steamer leaves and find hatbox is off too. I put on old felt hat and sweater and pick up soft leather pocket book. I have two quarters. Glad I didn't use them as tips. Start to hunt real wharf and turn to doors along a long hallway. Knock at one under which light shines. Tall dark man opens door and stands aside for me to enter still talking to a committee within.  I tell him I want to know the way to the wharf and he starts to lead the way explaining that many have asked him. I am in Hawaii. We are soon at the wharf. A wide gang plank leads to lower deck.  ""Is this the malolo?"" ""Yes."" See Peter. Ask him if he is on the deck where our rooms are, and then I meet R. and ask her if we shan't hurry and take one of the regular sightseeing tours. Heavy rain..."
"96"	"(10/29/32)"	"Get in my car and am annoyed as I start to drive to find that child has blocked way with toys and boxes of eggs. I get out of car and go to clear up, calling to child whom I now see to remove obstacles. He has an incubator at one side of steps. He comes and helps me lift wagon up the steps..."
"97"	"(10/29/32)"	"Lying with a man. He fondles my breasts."

"99"	"(11/06/32)"	"Sitting in dark outdoors and see O.M. pass by on way to show. A crowded lecture hall. When speaker arose and began, two large groups of the audience hurried out noisily leaving only the faculty at side platform. The speaker is a fair man, with a large nose, long curly chestnut hair and beard. We stop and we go out to see if it was a fire. Later papers have something about his southern sympathies not appealing to the crowd. "
"100"	"(11/11/32)"	"There was a big tiger and he said that I must get out of the way but I couldn't walk and I rolled over and over out. I had a bundle which he took and when it was in his mouth, I killed him."
"101"	"(12/05/32)"	"O.M. is sitting by me as I am in bed eating. I put a small coin in his hand and let my fingers rest there hoping he will feel desire. I want to get up and dress but he doesn't leave. But my shoes and stockings are on and my kimono so I finally arise."
"102"	"(12/10/32)"	"J. asks ""Will you bunk with me?"" I am startled and he explains that he has bought a house up Nuanuu. But I say it's too far from the University. He says ""It's only 4 blocks from here."" We drive over in his car. He shows me through two connecting rooms with a red and green carpet on the floor. There is a bookcase with a few books. Then we go upstairs. There are rooms on both sides of the hall. M. is living with him. They show me the room I can have. It has a very poor floor. I remember M. is married and has two children. "
"103"	"(01/01/33)"	"M. is lying fully clothed on the outside of my bed. I in nighttime reach for rose dressing gown but he is in the way. I crawl out little bothered by scanty attire, sleepily remember it's New Year's and say, ""Happy New Year."" Go to brush teeth and find lots of loose bristles. H. is lying on lanai opening from room and I greet her too. Aileen followed by a child passes through the room. I am bothered by the looks of things with O.M. there. She speaks to him but when I turn to look at bed he's gone. Am downstairs with R. who has broom in her hand, looking for my watch. She offers me one but it isn't mine and it is broken. O.M. says ""You reached yours over to me this morning, didn't you?"" and starts to go upstairs for it, but just then I see mine on a shelf only it has no bracelet and I call him back."
"104"	"(01/06/33)"	"I had had relations with Q.M. but did not know it. Told mother that as long as it had happened I wish I could remember it. Think I ought to sue him but decide to wait."
"105"	"(01/07/33)"	"Going to a steamer in a ricshaw. The man is a slender blonde. I wonder why a white man pulls it. He talks about his job. My luggage is in the cabin, a very narrow single room. Mother and I are to share it but where can I sleep? I will have to be on the floor by her. We will have to send for an extra mattress. Having arranged the luggage we start on deck. I tell mother I haven't my ticket yet but will wait until we start. Then if they don't like my check they can't put me off. I ask her for cash but she hasn't enough. As we go on deck an under officer asks to see my ticket. I say that I will have to get it form the purser first and ask where he is. He tells me back and to the right on this deck. The purser is busy but in a bit he clears his desk and sits on the opposite side. I start to buy the ticket. ""how much shall I make the check out for?"" $19. I express surprise at the low price, clear from Shanghai to the USA and ask him to repeat the price. I hear, ""Nineteen"" very distinctly. Am surprised and relieved that no objection is made to the check. We are passing down a river."
"106"	"(01/15/33)"	"I am just married. Some one says she put down 40 for her age but she must be older than that. I tell them to look in the library for ""Little Foreign Devils"" card and they will find my age there."
"107"	"(05/19/33)"	"O.M. asks why I cut him and I tell him that I didn't know that I had. I wouldn't for the world and apologize and try to explain why I was cross Sunday night. He holds me close and I see the back of his gray coat especially plainly. He is leaning over."
"108"	"(11/17/33)"	"We are playing cards. O.M. offers to play if needed. He looks rather anxious. I smilingly agree, But he thinks I mean now and enters the game. Some one yields his place, although I offer to give up mine. Now there are 7 about the table, one is mother. But the deal won't come right. There are many different colored patterns on the card backs. We pick out one design but 5 or 7 of the cards are torn clear across."
"109"	"(11/18/33)"	"In a town waiting for train or bus. Want to know which way to sea. Clear picture of small town streets without many trees."

Explain the advantage of the flap to R. and the others. Return and find the cots all cleared away. At table waiting to be served. Tell R. there are no more plates to pass. She leaves table. I go bring more plates. Irritated at R's leaving. Go to toilet. Pass through kitchen finished in blue to reach small white room."
"111"	"(11/18/33)"	"On a ship. A sailboat in distress, its sail gone. We are in a Chinese-like ferry boat."
"112"	"(12/11/33)"	"A woman doctor to whom I had gone for some other reason began to test my eyes. I thought ""I can't let her for my own doctor should have that job."" Then I remember that doctor C. could hardly be my own doctor for he has treated me only once. There is difficulty in getting me seated in the right stool. I am across the room and she flashes a light in my eyes. The retina is flashes on a screen. (I think I really opened my eyes.) There are many bookshelves standing out like library stacks. I wonder where the books come from, mow more than at first. The doctor is now unrolling charts for further examination and has me change my seat."
"113"	"(01/07/34)"	"In a house with several rooms, a procession of gay people interspersed with several imitation animals, elephants, dinosaurs, etc., very real. We had to run to hide from them. Then a man from the animal group got me and I was to be taken somewhere. I didn't want to go. A boy had a cord to lead me. I had an old lavender-gray wrapper on my arm. He took me past some outdoors toilets, three empty sheds with mud floor, three sides with wooden bench at back, all very filthy and odor of toilets strong, and lavatories. Saw two women in one washing up. Told me they couldn't go back right away. Tried to talk to guards but they couldn't understand. Taken to rear of toilets where I fling wrapper around me to protect good dress. Then we are planning to escape. Man is called to see why we women have started a fire to dry our clothes. There is a big log burning. He comes to see if it is safe. Sally and I start down a flight of stone steps to a large cement hall. We have to stay close to the wall so the man won't see us. I had put on my hiking boots before starting. I notice for the third time that the toilet odor is gone and think I must have gotten used to it. At foot of steps we turn to a brick path leading between very close walls into a second large room. Many are following now. I wonder why the man had been called making our escape more likely. Decide he is to think the women had to remove clothes to dry them so men guards wouldn't be there. Lose Sally. Hunt for her. Some one says there are some stairs. They are queer ones, spirally placed rods, mere foot holds. We climb up them."
"114"	"(11/28/34)"	"I had a cute baby. Mother had been caring for it but I took it to tend it. I considered passing it off as hers but was reminded it was as awkward for her, as a widow to have so young an infant. Then I thought I'd pass it off as a sister's which I had adopted. It was always wetting itself and had to be changed. Everytime I handled it, it seemed older. I remembered nothing of its conception or of pregnancy but knew no one would believe that. I talked with mother as what to pass him off as. I noticed quite a pool of water and took the child to change him. The baby said something about the new carpet and I told mother of that so she could see how intelligent he was. The carpet was in new fresh colors."
"115"	"(01/08/35)"	"In the parlor, trying to read a very thick boob by 5 Chicago professors. I notice Hornell Hart's name and try to see where he is now. Difficulty in finding title page and in reading name. My eyes are very heavy and keep closing. Open only with effort to read. Mr. How. Is trying to set up card table in rain. Debate whether to ask for game but decide he wants to play solitaire. Notice one bow of my glasses is almost broken. It is spinning out on gold threads. Trying to mend it as I don't wish to go down town for a few days. A. is trying to help me."
"116"	"(01/27/35)"	"I was at a party, matched numbers to find my partner, a lady dressed in light blue. She turned up a Chinese looking portrait of herself in blue. When pressed explained she had been born in China, then showed further Chinese picture."

"118"	"(02/11/35)"	"Playing quoits with a woman, throwing into a 2 x 3 square pattern. O.M. comes along and says the pattern is wrong. It should be 3 x 3. O. has worked out another pattern and O.M. takes us to see it. We go up on the deck above and forward. I remark we ought to make many more scores on the longer pattern. O.M. disagrees and I explain why and he says, ""Perhaps."" We find a beautifully drawn pattern in black paint. I say ""Let's play here"", and we start back after the rings. I run down feeling very young and happy but come back upstairs more slowly and hand three rings to the other woman. See 4 steamers off starboard and think we must be coming to port. They say it is Kobe; but we don't stop there nor anywhere now. But I insist we must be at Yokohama. There are several passengers about  and I think we must hurry if we have a chance to play. Had remarked as much as we came up the stairs. "
"119"	"(03/08/35)"	"I was on a boat trying to see through a light gray fog. At last the fog breaks and I see the blue sea with sailboats on the horizon. It looks smooth but there is a roll that gives our boat a peculiar twisting pitch. "
"120"	"(03/09/35)"	"Examining white snake's eggs, almost as large as ostriches but transparent so can see embryo snakes inside also tadpoles swimming inside eggs. Bruise one I'm holding. One of them has a protuberance as if the snake were soon to be hatched. This one is not transparent."
"121"	"(03/10/35)"	"I am going to tell a pregnant woman that I am in that condition too. I remember she may be shocked as she doesn't know that I'm married. Say that I've missed my period. I remember she seems interested. I hope she'll think that's just because I'm too old to menstruate..."
"122"	"(03/10/35)"	"I ask O.M. where he is going tonight. He says he hasn't made up his mind. ""Is there some place you would like to go?"""
"123"	"(03/18/35)"	"We were going hiking but the blue sea was covering the road with waves, but we will drive through anyway. F. starts but now dark and can be seen, fairly hard but we turn back and won't go. "
"124"	"(03/25/35)"	"I was returning from the coast and the boat was nearing Hawaii. Was packing suitcases. Tell the other two in my cabin of the larger staterooms in other boats. They have full length mirrors and wardrobes and beds for each. See parts of wharf passing. Someone tries to come in but they're in the wrong room. Then I catch sight of a paper cap and wonder why I have none. Then realize we had no captain's dinner. I had left my packing and return to find had pilled things in neatly. I try to puzzle out what I had done on this trip as I can't remember any sports or anything else about it. "
"125"	"(03/27/35)"	"I was out riding with Miss. P. An uncomfortable object is in the seat and I change my position and she comments on it. We stop and she goes in a place on an errand but the car continues rolling to the end of the wharf. I try to break it but it doesn't stay still. Man comes to help. He says ""You'd better get out and let me get in and fix it."" He goes up the incline, the car disappears. I rush up to the top and ask doorman which way the car went, but can't get a thing out of him. Rush upstairs and tell directors in office, then down to tell Miss. P., then return. Man inquires me what I know and tells me they have the loop surrounded. I ask him if they have the license number and take him to meet Miss. P. The car was white. "
"126"	"(03/29/35)"	"I hunt through several rooms in a large house carrying a pail and looking for a sufficiently private place to give myself an enema."
"127"	"(04/01/35)"	"I was telling C.H. about my research. Said the average S.L. of the Chines group was 3.8% and % of nouns 5.0. She expresses surprise. Then told her about the E.I. difference but couldn't remember how much. Just then, Pres. C. came up and said, ""My dear, how about your research? I am anxious to hear about it."" So I eagerly told him I had just finishes calculation on one age level, had to explain that to him. He sat down to listen and I began to repeat what I had told C.H. [Actually did tell him about my research on April 3.]"
"128"	"(04/05/35)"	"I was looking on a man seated on a sort of grassy ledge on the face of a sheer cliff across a small valley from me. He seemed to be talking to some one. I noticed the ledge overhung and thought it not so safe. Then suddenly it split off and all crashed into the valley below. I told mother to go down the road a piece and get someone to phone for a doctor and rushed toward the man. A man from another direction had preceded me and was working at the heap of earth. I saw the man's hand protruding and began to dig with my hands. Suddenly I exclaimed that I felt his ear and the rescuer began to dig where I was. We had his had free and helped him to raise it and he looked out through the dark tunnel. "
"129"	"(04/21/35)"	"A plot was on. We placed an ax at the transom so when the door was entered the ax would fall and strike him. I was holding it in readiness but my arm became tired so I fixed the ax on the door. Then I went to find Jo to ask who was the victim. Had some difficulty locating him as he was in the toilet. Then I find the victim is O.M. I exclaimed, ""What idiots you are to get me to help you kill the man I love."" Then I wondered if he heard. He cane and went into an empty room to talk to mother. I went and got the ax and put it in a pail. O.M. came out and began to talk to me. I said something about wishing to play again but not so often as last spring because I was really crowding myself too much and getting nervous and irritable. He seemed to understand and it was agreed we would play again and I was very happy. "
"130"	"(04/27/35)"	"O.M. asked me where I got the fine cards. I told him they were given to me as a prize, but I knew I was lying. They were a Christmas present. "
"131"	"(04/28/35)"	"Both Uncle M. and J. were there. J. looked much younger. I said something about not seeing him for a long time. "
"132"	"(05/21/35)"	"On 21st I was slate in rising. Wouldn't have time for breakfast. Told mother I would just snatch a piece of buttered toast to eat on my way. But the dressing room in the basement was crowded, tables partly cleared and no waiter. Mrs. McC asked me what I wishes and told me Ai. would get it for me if I went to the kitchen. Remembered she was dead, it can't be she. Ai. Is with difficulty persuaded to give me what OI could carry. Sliced very large pieces of bread and laid them on others thickly buttered to spread them. I remarked on the clever way of spreading bread. There was no time for toast. It was 7:50, ten minutes to class time."
"133"	"(05/22/35)"	"It was after a big banquet. Mrs. McC offered to give me some advice if I wouldn't be hurt but as she whispered, I couldn't catch much and explain I can't hear whispered speech. Looking at the dining room, long tables. O.M. inside eating, as still set up for the banquet. Ai. Tells of people who didn't like being moved. I decide it's time to dress and tell Baby Kolt so and to come along. Notice how very hairy Eu. Is. A man is in the room without clothes. I have on only a lion cloth. Suppose the stranger thinks it's family custom to go about with little on. "
"134"	"(06/04/35)"	"Rioters were coming. I try to hide money. A woman, when I come to join them, remarks, ""What's the use when we'll all be dead soon?"" I wonder if it's so and think I'm not so ready for death as when I believed more. "
"135"	"(08/06/35)"	"I was going to a church supper and it was raining. Hunted for rubbers. En route passed along the seashore. The waves grew wilder and wilder. On the horizon could see waves like mountain peaks. Near shore they were all foamy white. Reached the place with wet coat and stringy hair. It was 7:30, not must time left bit I insisted I must tidy up. Went to toilet. It was in the bathtub end water in tub rose about my ankles. Then I dumped an inch of water from one boot. My stockings and pink satin slippers were wet. Mother and R. were at the supper I think."
"136"	"(10/16/35)"	"I had been to see Dr. Ar. He showed me a record of someone with many complaints who yet took only ""this much space."" Then he said, ""I'm going to have you talk with Dr. S."" I ask what kind of doctor he is. He doesn't answer but leads the way. I follow feeling irritated and wonder if Dr. S. is a psychiatrist. We pass through an office whose setup makes me think the doctor is an oculist, but we go on through the crowded waiting room of another office. I find myself outside looking at some books. Dr. S. comes out, remarks about those old records of his, tells me he didn't like psychology. One book is marked Oubong, West Africa. So he had been there too and the pictures wouldn't indicate he had been working as a psychiatrist there. I wonder how he became prepared but I do want to talk it over with him anyway. I go back to the waiting room which is now empty, try the closed door which is not locked and look for the doctor. Hear him talking to the last patient in another room. At last my turn is coming. [I had been disappointed in talking to Dr. Ar. In my last office call on him.]"
"137"	"(08/--/40)"	"I was going to have my leg cut off. The doctor came before I was dressed. He said he would talk about an artificial leg later. He was ten minutes early. Then I was with mother waiting for him to come. He was late. J. said he was to cut off two thirds of my legs. While I was waiting, I was to be initiated. They struck me on my back with a lash made of light wire. They left for a bit and a boy of 12 or 14 said, ""Come with me."" He led me to a large empty room and we went behind a door. I thought I had better not hide and came out. All but one were on an upper floor. Suddenly from a window, I saw a bridge sagging. Then it broke and the water was full of drowning people; but others still kept crowding on the broken bridge."
"138"	"(08/26/40)"	"My hands were blistered and peeling, a new white spot would appear, puff out then burst and peel. I show them to some one. ""Want to play class with Naomi?"" Someone has put out the light to make the bed in the dark. Much trouble in finding lights. They are peculiar lights, lit with a wire. We decide to play Chinese checkers. Several beds are being made up in the room. Somebody brings refreshments. I decline and she says. ""We'll being the desert."" On the tray is crisp fried must. I take some but Naomi says, ""That is for father."" (Uncle Ed.) I keep some any way."
"139"	"(08/27/40)"	"I am broken out with a rash all over my abdomen. Show it to some man."
"140"	"(06/--/42)"	"Am going up in an elevator to call on Miss. Drum. With J. Have to wait in an outer room with two or three oriental girls."
"141"	"(08/08/42)"	"I saw Mrs. Sils and Mrs. G. Fit. I was so glad to see them but I had to wash first. The dressing room was very large. There were many swinging doors and I couldn't find the right one. (Had been reading Berkeley Chinca Colony List in which these friends of 40 years old were mentioned.)"
"142"	"(08/23/42)"	"We were on a train going somewhere. We had to spend the night en route at a hotel. As we were arriving she said perhaps we would not want to stay at so expensive place. But I said it was only for one night. So we went together. Someone said the town was so full that there were no rooms on the first floor. We were taken up immediately by the elevator to the third floor, where there were three beds. The bellboy said some one else would be with us. It was some one we expected. He showed us the bath across the hall and we tidied up. I opened my suitcase and found I had not forgotten my tweed coat. After washing, etc. I went back to room but had forgotten our number. We turned to the right and knocked on a door which opened and showed three men dressing. I hastily withdrew thinking I was glad I had knocked and at left found a confusion of rooms. "
"143"	"(08/25/42)"	"I was with a 2 1/2 or three year old baby. He and another baby got into a quarrel. I asked about the other's crying. He said, ""But I was maldeveloped too"", and told his part in the quarrel. I was astonished at Jimmy's long word and told the rest about it. Jimmy wore a blue suit. We were going to spend the night in a camp. I asked him if he wouldn't rather bathe with me in the great big tube (6 x 12 ft.), and we started to do it. The Wist family were settling in some cottages that we passed. Other people were beyond until I wondered where Jimmy and I would sleep. When we reached the bathroom, it had only a shower over a dirt floor heaped up, but I told Jimmy we would bathe there."
"144"	"(11/21/45)"	"I was waiting for a bus, all those passing were for the wrong place. I went back in the house for things forgotten, finally got off, came to home of --. I had no extra things. I was pregnant, was going to have a baby at this place, for the second time. Where is the other baby? In hospital. The room is curtained off from the men in the gallery. Funny the labor pains are not more severe. Mother is somewhere around. How can I have a child. This is the second one since radium treatment at age 50. I must tell Dr. Mill, it can't be."
"145"	"(09/05/47)"	"A doctor in a white coat examining my ear. ""It hurts way inside"" I say. He tells me he sees it now, and would I like to, and tries to twist a sort of periscope around so I can but he can't quite make it. Then he is going to operate. "
"146"	"(09/15/47)"	"I have reservations for an A.A.U.W. supper but have forgotten. It is at the University and I can make it but I have two other engagements which if I dine, I may not be able to make. I may have to call up Mr. -- and tell him I can't play chess as promised. I am dressed as I would but start to assembly point. See B's colorful prints coming, Mrs. St. J. [I do have two conflicting dates for the 16th.]"
"147"	"(06/20/48)"	"On a tilting bed which moved so I was almost dizzy. Had to hold on tightly to it so I wouldn't float off. Some people in were to move rooms. I look up at facade of building and have pointed out the rooms in 3rd story dormer roof that were involved. It was a large stone building."
"148"	"(06/20/48)"	"I was in my apartment with 2 girls who were soon to move out and I was to keep it alone. A man was talking to them. Suddenly I realize he is talking about renovations needed and I'm in on that. I want the hideous red figured tattered paper off and fresh paint. I'll be gone from July 2 thru October, couldn't he do it then? He Couldn't promise, but I'd so like the painting done while I'm not there."
"149"	"(06/20/48)"	"I am swimming with a woman. It is quite dark and I can't see well. We start wading out over dark brown sand, look down at pools. It is a long ways until it is deep enough to swim. Then I plunge in as she says, ""But I can't stay long."" We get out and start off and I've left my red flowered suit. I will have to phone or go back after it. Can't think how I could have left it behind for we had ridden down in her car already in bathing suits because I no longer belong to beach club and where could I have changed? I reluctantly decide I had better walk back after it today. Well I won't really have to. This is only a dream."
"150"	"(11/27/48)"	"I need to go to the toilet. A small boy goes along and stands in the corner of a large room. I sit in an old fashioned three hole private seat. The board in front of the seat yields under my feet. How awful if it should give away. Urinate."
"151"	"(12/27/48)"	"My 5 year old niece mischievously hits me on the eye. I try to coax her to stop. For now I can't go home from the hospital. (I was in the hospital recovering from a operation.) My ten year old nephew hits me deliberately in the eye which is bandaged. Now I can't leave."
"152"	"(01/28/49)"	"I get up to go to the bathroom but E. and H., very little children, get up to go there. H. holds her long gown up to her waist. Then I see R. is up and dressed and going there too, although it's only 5 a.m. I watch door for my turn."
"153"	"(01/30/49)"	"We are going some place. Baby been very eager to go. We were dressing. I was to move room. Came into J's. It was very much littered with children's toys. Look as if some of missing toys are in toy box. Think I see my Tibetan idol there but it isn't; only some long carved wooden dolls. My steamer trunk is closed. I close drawers. After we set out I wonder if windows are closed in J's room. Decide I did leave them up far enough. The baby id laughing and running. I am climbing a steep hill. As I reach P., I ask man ahead of me for help and he helps me up to the last bit. As I attain summit I say to the man, ""I'll be afraid to go down."" Then we start on in opposite direction from where we cam and find a rough path leading down a small grade between high rocks and cliffs that turns in almost horseshoe bends. The man leaps down on the path below but I cautiously follow the long bend, it is very rocky. The summit was bare but trees are more numerous as we descend."
"154"	"(01.30/49)"	"I am looking over a catalog over the last two years of US stamps. Find a red one of a dog that I haven't got. There are others I think I need also."
"155"	"(02/02/49)"	"We are going to a play at 8 p.m., but want dinner first. We think it's in the same building and go up in the elevator. We see no dining room but open a door and the woman, inside the large room like a private dining room with tables in sight whom we ask the time says it is 6 p.m. and it's time to have photographs of the players taken. I say, ""But we have had nothing to eat."" She says. ""Yes, you had dinner."" I am distressed because I can't remember eating and say so."
"156"	"(02/02/49)"	"I am to have a whipping from E.W. She asks me if this is the paddle to use. I say that it is and that I have already been whipped by other teachers. I carry the ruler thru 2 or 3 rooms until I find an empty living room where no one will hear the chastisement. E.W. follows me and the whipping is about to start when I awake."
"157"	"(03/01/49)"	"[Eyes really sore again.] I go to see Dr. M. about eyes. To my surprise, although it was Saturday, not many were waiting. He says it is the kerato-junction again and he puts a rubber sponge over left eye under glasses to shut out the light and ties it on with a large white triangular bandage. I start home along Beretania Street but the bandage flops so I fear it will become too loose. [Had had this trouble soon after operation.]"
"158"	"(03/13/49)"	"I was entering a toilet. Others were coming. I look for lock. It is a peculiar latch near the top of the door. There is a pile of white bedclothes between door and seat from which a pillow protrudes. I wade through."
"159"	"(03/13/49)"	"Four or five of us are drilling outdoors. We each have two spears which we must hold upright and parallel about a foot apart. One of mine is almost broken and I can not hold it up. The drill master, a woman, comes out. When she sees my broken spear, which is splintered across, she agrees I couldn't use it and goes to a shed and from a long piece of wood, a 2x4 inch in width, begins to whittle out a new spear. A man goes to help her as she will be too slow."
"160"	"(03/23/49)"	"A man is in our office. He is to give us some autobiographical material. I ask the secretary if I should ask him for his baby picture. He hands me a long paper. It is translucent and somewhat sticky. (Had been working with stamp collection.) It sticks to my fingers. It will take long to read it. I tell him I will read it at some other time, but I'm expecting a pupil at 9:30 and I've not had any breakfast yet. (Nola, a pupil, does come at that hour.) So I go into another room. I want a shower first. I am not fully dressed. Someone is in the tub with the shower curtain drawn but her arm shows. Another woman is there. I tell them I want the shower very soon since my pupil is due at 9:30, but I start to look for things to prepare my breakfast. I can do some of it first. I go into a third room. There is a tub in it too. I can not think why I can not use it."
"161"	"(03/25/49)"	"I see O.M. (Dec. 1943) and talk stamps with him. I see a page of Egyptian stamps and ask if he is collecting Egypt now. (He was a stamp collector.)"
"162"	"(04/04/49)"	"I have to go to the hospital for a check on my eyes. I go in and start to arrange my things. The nurse tells me the doctor will see me soon. When I open the table drawer it is full of things left by a former patient and many cigarette ashes. I wonder why a good hairbrush is left. I make a complaint. The nurse comes back and says the doctor hasn't come but she had better give me my coke now just in case. I think she means cocaine and I wonder why she gives it the evening before and anyway why since there is to be no operation this time since both eyes have been operated on. Another nurse tidies up the table drawers. It now has a row of short ones at one side like an office desk. She has emptied the bottom ones but I want to use the upper ones so I begin to move the old alphabet blocks from one drawer. Then it is morning and I am on the lanai talking to another patient. Then I am walking in the hallway and nearly fall for I do not see the last flight of three or four stairs at right angles to the first cross the hallway without any railing. It is nearly noon and Dr. M. has not come yet and I worry some. At last he is there but talking to his wife and someone else about going to see an exhibit. I would like to go too. At last he comes to m and asks if I have been receiving treatment. With some resentment I tell him the nurses have done nothing for me all day. I've had no medicine, not even what I've been taking at home. I did not bring that since I was to be here only one day. He pulls 3 or 4 bottles of medicine from his pocket and tells me to take them and says, ""We may not be back today."" He hasn't checked my eyes and I can't go home if he doesn't return and I exclaim that I was to have gone and ""You are always saying that it will be shorter than it is. I wish you'd say it would be longer so I'd not be disappointed."""
"163"	"(05/29/49)"	"A man in a very small auto tells me as I stand on a corner that he would give me a lift had he room in his car. He passes on but he keeps running into the curb. I go in my small car."
"164"	"(05/29/49)"	"I visit Simpson College and talk with head. Then I'm alone in an office. He comes in and asks, ""Did they show you which desk to use?"" "" But I did not know I was to stay."" ""Yes, you'll teach Child Psychology from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m."" Only two hours, I accept but think I must tell mother and H. in Cedar Rapids and Nola tomorrow. Will be her last day because I'm starting on Wednesday."
"165"	"(--/--/49)"	"I wondered if they'd charge me if I didn't wait for Dr. B. Went to the elevator and pushed the button for down. It was an elaborate gold button, square, only one side of which side pushed in. The elevator passed me going down, then went higher and brought down a sick patient on a stretcher. Then she was put on a ledge behind the elevator. They covered her face so I thought she was dead."
"166"	"(08/04/49)"	"Was having breakfast with the Yangs. We had cereal milk. The pop-up toaster wouldn't work and the toast was burnt. "
"167"	"(08/04/49)"	"I was playing bridge, find 8 spades with honors in one hand with one or two wild cards. Don't understand why I should have 16 or 18 cards. Outbid hearts by 4 then 5 spades."
"168"	"(08/10/49)"	"At clinic. Dr. B. very happy after taking my blood pressure, says I should ""say a rosary."" Says he has prayed. I wonder why he should say, ""say a rosary"" because neither of us are Catholic but both Congregationalists."
"169"	"(09/11/49)"	"I looked across the room and see a light wood chest with a brass latch under the window. I thought ""now I'll put bedding in it."" I took things out of the old chest under the bed, an old-much worn napkin plainly marked M.E. Smith diagonally across one corner, an old Turkish towel, etc. I miss the old brown and green cover from the old chest. Some one knocks and I go to the door. A man and a woman who reminds me of Mrs. McB. Are there but they won't come in. Conclude they must have wanted the next door and I go back to work. Another knock, I usher in 4 people. Mrs. McB, N.D. and two very plump women, a mother and her daughter, Sally. I apologize for the upset room, explaining that I had just discovered the chest. ""Isn't that funny?"" A man and woman take my large chair and stool, face and talk to each other. Sally stands around a bit and leaves. I talk to the two other women."
"170"	"(09/03/49)"	"I heard Mrs. S. scolding the children about climbing into the stream. I was on the toilet in the bathroom, had a Turkish towel spread over the seat, disgusted to find feces in it. Just then a girl came in. Noticed a big gap in the wall and said, ""I can climb down through there."" I said, ""No you don't and don't you dare come in again without knocking."" I take a ruler and tap her lightly across the buttocks once and thought, ""MY, won't her mother be mad?"""
"171"	"(11/08/49)"	"I was going to the hospital. As I entered I saw Eva Hunter with a tray of medicines. Some looked just like the large round pills, one black, the other dark red, that I was carrying in my hand. I thought, ""I can take these sedatives I have too, but perhaps I shouldn't. They may give me others."" Asked Eva what she was doing. Vague answer. When back in my ward, I remembered I had brought nothing with me. Went to find nurse, but along the corridor saw only student nurses for permission to return. Behind closed door, heard voices but again saw no head nurse. Decided to hurry back home anyway thinking I could probably return before I was wanted. As I was waking confused skip to back of desk to sign in."
"172"	"(11/16/49)"	"I was looking into a box and picked up a cape made up of peacock feathers which I stroked. It was so soft. It was about 3.5 feet long. I asked mother where it came from. She said it was part of father's Chinese costume but I couldn't remember him ever wearing it. There were also some poinciana flowers losing their petals also in the box and 2 or 3 other articles I didn't get to examine. It was getting dark and I wanted more light to write. 2 or 3 others wanted to read but the boy, J, in the center of the room didn't switch on the overhead light, only ineffective side lights. I grew impatient and went to switch at door, ""Turn on this one."" But when I did there was no light. He said that the company wasn't sending enough electricity. I couldn't understand. "
"173"	"(11/28/49)"	"Two huge jet planes surrounded by about a score of smaller planes rushing overhead in the blue sky. We were on a high building. Seeing a crowd rushing away wondered if we were really at war again, but no warning sounded. Thought how swiftly the jets passed over."
"174"	"(11/30/49)"	"Looking for someone. Rang the bell upstairs. Wanted #19 but from the pencil scrawls on the door couldn't make out how to ring for that number. Hearing voices within, called to ask how to ring for #19. Girl who opened the door told me I had to put money in the slot before I could get a number. I asked, ""How much?"" She said, ""I think 25 cents."" She let me in through their apartment. There were 2 or 3 other girls there. I think I was looking for J. Davis."
"175"	"(12/18/49)"	"I was riding in a ricsha behind father and mother and H., who was about 8 or 10 years. They were in a car. When we stopped my hand baggage fell out. I asked father if I couldn't put it in the car. He told me to put it on the other side if him. I put it in my brown hatbox, briefcase and small suitcase. They went on after answering my question as to where the coolie was. When he came up the ricsha was missing. In search of it he butts in on partly clothed women. Then he with a beard and naked is at the door. He wonders what transit company is looking after the trade. I go to see bishop to tell him I must let my parents know. When he thinks I can wait I tell him my vacation is almost over, must return to tell that I have no money and am on the way to visit sister R. Relieved that I needn't find the ricsha."
"176"	"(01/05/50)"	"I was at some church gathering and was trying to meet my grandmother Strong there. When we sat down to eat, I was at a table alone. When we were thru, I asked a person at the next table if a Mrs. Strong from California was there. She said she had been there but had gone. I might find her at the third floor where there was a ladies room. I took a serve yourself elevator and went up but couldn't find her so I came down. As I was looking around the vestibule, a little old lady came up and asked me if I wasn't Madorah. I had surprised that she had come all the way from California to the meeting. I put my arm around her and remarked how short she was, barely to my shoulder, and let her to a sofa at the right of the room where we could sit side by side. )She reminded me of mother. Had been reading old letters.) "
"177"	"(02/07/50)"	"I am on a train, go to another car and on leaving see that my station has almost been reached. Hurry back to my seat and grab suitcase. Contents are scattered  but I have no time to pack so drop the articles into my skirt, holding it up like a bag. Among other things is my lamp. I jump off the end of the car for there is neither porter nor steps and  miss my lamp. Sure I had packed it. Think of returning after it but just then the train starts to move past me. "
"178"	"(02/21/50)"	"I have asked R. to my hotel so that she too may see Luther and his wife. Had to remake bed because the maid has put the brown and white spread, I use as a mattress cover on top of the blankets. Just as finishing, R. says it must be their auto that has just driven up. I look out can't turn the Venetian blinds so as to see but do see soon after about a dozen tourists coming up the stone steps. Then Luther and Roselle come in. Roselle tells of her planned trip home via Europe. I ask what about Luther and their son. She says their son will stay with Luther. Just then the clerk brings in three tourists who will sleep in my room. I hurry in and see that they have pushed in two beds, moved mine, added green curtains. I protest but she insists my room is larger than hers. Go to talk to Luther some more, bothered because his wife's name is really Frances. The waiter brings in trays for the tourists. I ask if regular residents are not expected to eat in the dining room. He says, ""Yes."" Wonder if I can take 2, no 3, because R. is there too, guests with me. When I have asked because it's 5 p.m. nearly time to eat. Then I wonder if when making the  tourist's beds, they used my blankets and go to see. Look in the beds and in the second one find two blankets, pull them out, thinking I will not remake the bed. Tell the tourists at least they must not sit in my room. but in the common rooms and go downstairs to tell the management. Suddenly I have no clothes on but the blankets are cover enough to go downstairs. I am outdoors, my room is on the 4th floor but I stop on the first to complain and insist on a refund. One of the tourists is sitting behind the desk and she says she doesn't like the arrangement either."
"179"	"(02/28/50)"	"I had gone to see Dr. B. as he had planned for March 2nd. When I remembered I had forgotten to bring data with me, I realized it was a dream and I had yet to go and could take data."
"180"	"(03/27/50)"	"I was to buy a ticket. The clerk, B.W. told me the papers were ready to sign and to come into the other room. It was very dark, just a wide streak of light across. I said I would have to wait until I could see to read the papers. Then I missed my handbag, and in looking for it decided to take off my hat to fix my hair. In taking off my hat, I remove my sleepshade and that makes me wake up."
"181"	"(04/08/50)"	"I was very happy because I was going to have a date with a man. Just as we started out of the house, I found I had forgotten something and had to go back upstairs for it. I hurried down again but he had gone outside. I went out on the sidewalk to look for him. It was rather dark outside. I went to a crowd in one direction and then in another. I called mother but there was no answer. Al last I knew they had all gone off in a car and forgotten me. So I went back in the hotel. Thought I might call the place we were going to and have someone return for me. Perhaps they would come back but maybe they thought I could come out on the bus. (Attempts to phone and conversation with hotel porter mostly forgotten.)"
"182"	"(05/05/50)"	"I had thrown myself on my bed when someone awoke me with a kiss. It was J. I asked the time. He said 12 o'clock. Then I must have slept a long time. ""What day is it?"" ""Sunday."" So I got up but could barely open my eyes. Went into the kitchen to get dinner. Mother was there and said she would get dinner, but he said he had already eaten. I asked mother why she came to help, when she usually didn't, just because J. came. When I knew it was Sunday I had said to myself that I was just too tired for church. I had to sleep."
"183"	"(05/05/50)"	"I was outdoors with another woman and mother going to a restaurant but they walked too fast and didn't wait for me at crossings. I was afraid and called ""Wait for me."" At last I caught ip and asked where mother was. She said she had turned in at a nearer place because of the rain. We'd go on and order and mother would come on when the shower was over. Meantime she had met a friend there. Then the woman said we were there and she would hurry on ahead and see what they had."
"184"	"(06/22/50)"	"I got to the party in my housecoat and nothing else. Told others present that a friend who was coming with me hadn't and then I nearly didn't get there because just after I started, a funeral came out of the church, saw coffin, and we had to back off the road to avoid it. First backing didn't help, at the second, we went around a filling station and down a very narrow alley (like those in China) stone or brick paved. I said, ""There certainly are slums in Honolulu."""
"185"	"(06/22/50)"	"I am to have some medical treatment. The nurse says that now she'll get me ready. Helps me into a sheath like skirt. I said, ""That will keep my legs from moving."" Then she starts to put a hospital gown of Turkish toweling on me."
"186"	"(10/08/50)"	"I had been showing off my curtains. Miss P. had moved into these apartments. They were only rooms in a large house. The phone rang and we let her answer it while we went to our rooms but I went slowly by a round about way, waiting to hear who she wanted. Relieved that it seemed to be herself. I heard her say, ""They are all there."" Then she came to get someone and she stepped into my doorway just as the door opposite was opened by M.M. (who I had met a few days before). I said that I was glad to see her and asked her to come in and see my curtains. She came in but didn't admire the curtains much. I picked up a corner to show her but the lowest bit was all a hole. She said, ""Never mind. You can cover it up with something."" I reached for the second curtain. It too had a hole. I fell badly but thought, ""This is just a dream. It'll be all right when I awake."""
"187"	"(11/18/50)"	"I had just been married and with husband absent, was hurrying to tell others about it. Some knew of it. I thought of at last sleeping with a man. Then it was breakfast at the hotel. I picked up my paper to let my husband K. read it."
"188"	"(02/13/51)"	"I was riding on my bicycle and thought I'd go downtown but didn't know where it was legal to ride, so I decided I'd better park the bicycle and go on the bus. Saw the policeman's family in the yard which looked like Queen's Hospital grounds and thought of asking him but then I couldn't find the bicycle. At last spied it on its side with the youngest boy sitting on it. I felt angry and shook him and gave him two light spanks and scolded him, and told him people would like him better if he didn't get into so much mischief. Then she asked me if I was going to some fete. I said I was planning to. She said, ""Let's go together."" I said, ""I must change my dress"" and went upstairs to do so. Came down in Mabel's outfit but no hat. Her friend asked if I was not wearing a hat and then said, ""I guess I'll take off my hat.' But she went by herself. Then the Z's wife came and the younger boy was going too. She had some part in the fete. I asked where it was. She said it was on Kapiolani Blvd. She had a big load. I carried some of it. I thought, ""That isn't where I was going."" It must be a Catholic benefit."" It was 6 p.m. and I wondered if I could get back in time for dinner. Almost backed out but decided there'd be refreshments so went on. The bus came and she got on but the boy and I didn't in time. She got off at the next stop and came back up many steps rather put out, complaining of her climb. I told her it was the awkward bundle which I was trying to fix as to carry it better that had made me miss the bus and asked how often the busses ran. ""Every 5 minutes each way."" Then another bus came and we got on it  but it went up like an elevator. The boy didn't make it. I said, ""I wish I had a free hand to hold him."" She said, ""Don't worry about him. He'll be all right."" I wondered how he would get home because we had walked quire a way. Then I saw a small procession in holokus and knew we were about there and the program hadn't begun, guess they were just lining up."
"189"	"(08/29/51)"	"I met Rae at church. She wanted me to go with her to visit the new Territorial Hospital at 1:30. She had to before vacation ended. I said their visiting hours were very short. We'd better find out what they were. I had their catalog at home which would give their hours. Church secretary said she had one. It was nearly 1 p.m. and I had to fix a bite of lunch first. Rae said then we'd go at 2 p.m. ""Shall I come to your place?"" ""Yes"", then both of us were at the hospital but I couldn't see Rae which disturbed me. The first impression was that the hospital was out of Koko head way, now it was in the opposite direction. We were taken to a small dining room and given lunch. The tables were for four. But the table where we were seated held more. Two women sat with us. The blond was the economic secretary. She was quite talkative. I asked many questions. She said they no longer had visiting hours. This dining room was arranged for the doctors at present. "
"190"	"(02/23/52)"	"A baby was crying. I went to change him. He raised his shoulders about 6 inches from the bed. I said to him and to someone else ""Do you want to sit up?"" I'd better prop him up. "
"191"	"(02/23/52)"	"I was at church listening to a slender woman preacher. I thought it was strange she should be preaching on Gilkey's last Sunday. She suddenly quit and left the pulpit. And an officious dressed woman followed her out. Something about sunstroke. The church seemed wrong, Like that in Ningpo and I wondered why they had changed the pulpit from the center to the side."
"192"	"(02/23/52)"	"I was renting a room. It was large enough but inconvenient since I had to go thru another room to reach it."
"193"	"(10/08/53)"	"I was walking with mother and R. I was to have a tumor cut from my head. I felt the knife. It was cut out. I asked what the biopsy showed. No cancer, just a few little cancerous grains. I was puzzled. (Woke up with sharp neuralgic pains in my head.)"
"194"	"(10/15/53)"	"Discussing with someone what ""tsau-loh"" meant. A woman had asked if it was good Chinese and what it meant. Cousin Mer.'s answer was not clear. I spoke up and said, ""It means done, finished, doesn't it? Like when you've finished your sewing."" I smiled at her indicating her work. Then I said that I used to think Shanghai, Ningpol and Soochow dialects very different but many words are the same in all and I understood the Soochow right off."
"195"	"(10/15/53)"	"There was a meeting and I sat with Eva facing rows of girls. Very boring. At one point all shifted seats so that the different races were separate. R. was there. Then we were in another room and returned to arrange the first for another meeting. The seats were in small groups. R. said to put them in rows. I started to do so but it was muddy and sloppy. I said we'd skip this row where two clumps of bushes and a big puddle would be in the way and spread the rows so that people could walk in and not get muddy. So I set one chair in a soft place before a good walk and tried it but one leg kept sinking deeper."
"196"	"(10/15/53)"	"Talking with M. about her childhood. She was complaining of her mother's failure to stop her thumb sucking at 3 years. ""She just didn't care."" We were turning pages of a book. M. spoke of he dual personality. I was much interested and asked for more information but instead of answering she began to talk of different times she had made use of illness to avoid work and school, a broken toe among others. She was not always successful. Started to say she had graduated from highschool anyway, but remembered she hadn't."
"197"	"(10/21/53)"	"The easy chair must be kept under the chandelier tp prevent people running into it. I felt annoyed since then I couldn't use it."
"198"	"(10/21/53)"	"A little boy came running across the lawn crying ""Baby fell down dead."" I asked wasn't he hit. He said. ""No, he just fell dead."""
"199"	"(12/01/53)"	"Dream of father. Heard him preaching."
"200"	"(12/06/53)"	"Dreamt of H's twin girls. Telling H. Kathleen had told about some clever remark the twins had made. Kathy protesting Beth's use of their father's papers."
"201"	"(02/24/54)"	"I was consulting Dr. B. about my sore arm. He said, ""You have more."" I ask, ""Of what? More abnormalities?"" I said, ""This noise (had been wakened by the noise of the steamer under my window) is painful to me. Don't you hear it?"" He seemed to be in my apartment."
"202"	"(03/12/54)"	"I was on a train in my nightgown. There were two men in observation car. I thought I'd better get dressed, turned to look for ladies room but then it was my berth I was looking for. My berth was filled with others. I rang for porter and asked that they be put in other cars. He said that my berth was in 3rd car ahead. He took my arm. We passed thru compartment car. I have my arm around him. Thought this wouldn't do for if a Southerner saw us, the porter would get into trouble. When we found my berth, a family with children had strewn articles all over it. I began tossing them and told them to remove them so the dresses would be less mussed."
"203"	"(03/13/54)"	"It is good we are in different houses, it gives us some place to visit, not so alone in this isolated place. ""But I wish we were not so far from a town.' Old fashioned. There are only three chests of drawers. We are now upstairs and I'm trying to divide drawer space with sisters. Where will we put these pillboxes. They'll spill power all over. In those small drawers in mother's bureau. First I'm dividing with R., then with H. and M. also. The 4 boys have the large bedroom, the 3 girls another, parents the small one but that leaves H. out. We'll have to have 4 girls to one room."
"204"	"(02/01/55)"	"I told Dr. B. I was sometimes unable to rise from my bed. He said we must look into that right away and started to help me up onto his table. As he touched my lower back, I exclaimed in pain. Then I told him I was furious at doctors who never told you just what was wrong or what the medicine was. He stood looking at the blood pressure gauge in profile to me."
"205"	"(02/22/55)"	"The little boy thrust a model black ricsha and coolie into my hand saying, ""This is for her."" ""But it will be so awkward to pack"", said I. He showed me how it would fold up. Then I was in a room at the clinic and Dr. A. or Mr. Bor. was saying, ""This is the Eastern Star blood bank."" The walls were white and the room rather empty."
"206"	"(03/06/55)"	"I was lying in a 3-sided cement , no roof, walled enclosure with my legs outside of it. J. was in a similar enclosure next. It was at the seashore. We heard a jet plane explode. He said, ""The plane is falling in pieces."" It didn't hit us. We must dress to go home. (There was a noise of construction near by.)"
"207"	"(04/11/55)"	"I saw in a museum a symbolic picture of a man looking into the unknown. Left side of the picture was dark with shadowy figures, mostly children, peering into the open doorway or around the corner of a stone building. At my right I saw many people coming up the wide marble staircase."
"208"	"(04/11/55)"	"I was in a steamer approaching Shanghai but I couldn't see out so I pushed open a wooden shutter since it was so close as I felt the ship's motion more. Then I could see green water in big swells and the low green shore, shipping nearby but no identifying structures. I think we won't be there for sometime. "
"209"	"(05/04/55)"	"Going somewhere and packing, can't find handbag."
"210"	"(05/04/55)"	"Leaving a meeting, discover I had left my handbag. Seeing many children in the rear, think they might take it so hurry back to where we hat sat. Ask women if they had seen it. ""No."" See a man wandering up a ramp to Farrington Hall. Try to reach to inquire if mother's there."
"211"	"(05/11/55)"	"I am getting my laundry together. When bundling it up, started to rear some old rag with my teeth and eat it, but it was my blue and white nightgown, all ruined. Some pieces were not there so I went upstairs for them, opened the closet door and two cute kittens."
"212"	"(05/12/55)"	"Rearranging bookshelves, moving into new 4 shelf case. My shelf was second. Found a Jo's soiled blue and white shirt behind books. Ask him what it is doing there and tell him to put it on the empty lowest shelf. Placed a prayer book and another tinier book through post at one end."
"213"	"(05/12/55)"	"At the table finishing a meal. Sliced cucumber pickles are passes. They are too sharp to eat alone. Mother says, ""Now one of you girls clean up the room and the other do the dishes. R. says she'll clean. I say, ""If I am to do the dishes, can't M. help?"" ""She can for a little while."" ""I don't see why she can't help all the time. I have done so much work. I am 15 and she is 13. I have only about an hour left. Perhaps you don't think my study is work but I have to do it."""
"214"	"(05/12/55)"	"Start to walk a piece home up Punohous Hill with Mrs. Bick. (Day before we had been co-hostesses at a tea.) We are stopped at a hotel by a woman. I say that I'll go on further but then Mrs. Bick disappears. The lady is very small and looks if she had been ill. Mrs. A.C.M. comes along, greets her warmly, saying how much better she looks."
"215"	"(05/28/55)"	"I tell the secretary, an Oriental man, to watch for my Strong cousins as I want them to meet some of the faculty. I go in with R. to our new rooms, two large connecting rooms with sparse furniture and bare floors, large trunks, no desk. I handle a small table size of a kitchen stool but higher, could use it at bedside. Open one of the large closets isn't going to say that she'll remove them. . Put my green and white hat in the closet."
"216"	"(05/28/55)"	"I am hiking along a country road. It becomes a mere trail. Open my handbag. Miss billfold. It must have fallen out when I opened the bag a considerable ways back. Hurry back. Ask children I meet if they had seen it by the roadside. It has my name on in red tape. In rummaging thru my bag, find two $5 bills so I can not have lost very much. There seem to be others in my party ahead or behind me. [Since taking rauwolfia, I have many disjointed dreams every night which are quickly forgotten.]"
"217"	"(06/18/55)"	"Trying to climb aboard a ship from a stool to reach a ring and so up but the stool is too low so go around to gangplank. Ask for purser. Directed to him at a table in the corner and get a reservation for a stateroom which 3 are to share. Across one closet door is one bed. Look in closet and it seems only shelves. Others enter and complain that there are no closets. But here is one, there's a wardrobe with some hanger space and where is that one I saw? Look for it and find bathroom. Room is quite large but the plumbing fixtures are old, but this is an old house remodeled that used to have fewer closets. Guide calls, ""Now, if you will follow me. Mrs. Cox will show you this rare red flower."" I fall in behind them but they go so fast that I can't find them even when directed. "
"218"	"(06/18/55)"	"On deck of ship passing curious red sandstone formations like crudely sculptured animals. Going out as we near dock by the tracks. Train will be coming."
"219"	"(06/21/55)"	"I am at a tea given by Mrs. St. J. Get in line for refreshments. When I get there only one small sandwich left but several varieties of cookies. I take 2 or 3 white ones, one oblong and one very thin and am offered a chocolate one and take it. Look across room and wonder about going to chat with others but they seem to be leaving as soon as fed. C.H. and M.N. come in while I was in line. Mr. St. J. disappears and I hear much splashing of water. Think I'd better go in the kitchen and help with the dishes. When there I see C.H., a man and another woman all bare to the waist, scrubbing vigorously at their backs. Inquire how come. The stove had exploded and dirtied them. Already It had been removed but other repairs had not yet been made. I look out the window and see water pouring from a broken line."
"220"	"(07/07/55)"	"Told C.H. is ill and wants to see me. I go to his apartment and find 5 people asleep there. Nearest the door is a man, I at first think it's him, but it is not. He lies next. Others are further over. At least one is a woman."
"221"	"(07/07/55)"	"Hurrying to catch bus, down a steep bank, across lawn, worn pathway, after someone, get on bus, try to deposit ticket. Bus driver gets off and the wind blows over his box of transfers. I gather them up and explain to him as he returns that I have put in my ticket and tell him about the upset."
"222"	"(08/30/55)"	"At a restaurant which was seated more like an auditorium. As waiter brought a neighbor a rice and stew plate, I asked for some like it, though it was a peculiar choice for breakfast. He went on serving others, apologized to me for delay. At last he dished up my order but it slopped over and he set the dish up to drip over a tray. He remarked that some of the trays in the pile were too small. Finally I said I had to hurry. Either bring me mine or put it on another plate. Then I was leaving and having some difficulty retrieving my newspaper."
"223"	"(08/30/55)"	"I was at Tanner's. When ready to leave over her protests. I started out one door, down a wide wooden bridge with no rails but at the other end was a group apparently in conference in a glassed in lanai that blocked my way. I returned and asked for another route. She told me to go out the other door, turn left and to a bus stop. While I gathered up Thursday's paper and separated it from theirs which had colored comics, I decided I need not take one page of mine since it contained my work out crossword. Austin said the bus stop was now at Keeaumoku and fifth so I started walking along some distance. "
"224"	"(08/30/55)"	"I was at an old Donna Hotel cottage in Aileen's room on the first floor. I said, ""So you couldn't stay away from your old home?"" She said, ""There's an old diploma of yours in my bedroom. Do you want it?"" I opened the closet door and asked her ""where?"" (The room seemed like my old one but I couldn't spot any cupboard, just a white chest and old drawers.) She cane to help me. Now the closet was a small bedroom. There was an old wooden box, much marked up names. I said, ""I don't need that."""
"225"	"(09/22/55)"	"An old lady was visiting me. She was sitting under an outside stair landing. A small boy with a very big reddish bruise about eyes. Somebody comes to help me treat him. Squeezing papaya from a whole fruit on the wound. I am looking for my footstool to put on a new blue satin quilted pad on it. Person left liquid in a big jar blocking my stairway. I ask mama about it."

"227"	"(09/25/55)"	"I was washing. Jo was helping sort clothes. There was a tennis net which has to be detached from a rope and iron snaps. I started on it with him at the other end doing so well that I let him finish. I was sorting out fragile things to go in the washer by themselves. Pick up a blue silk padded card table cover and decide to put it in with them."
"228"	"(09/29/55)"	"I went to an educational meeting. At the door was a woman taking dues and reservations for the dinner. I asked if she had any blank checks so I could write one. She didn't. I had suddenly realized that I had left my checkbook in my handbag upstairs. I went in. Told me go across to another room as I told her I wasn't going back upstairs. I went in. Sayers was talking but I couldn't hear much of anything that he said. I thought I'm getting deafer, not much use to attend lectures, certainly not discussions. When he finished there was a recess and I went across the hall to pay dues, again I had no money with me. But she put me down for a reservation anyway and said I could pay later. I decided to go upstairs after my bag and started looking for the elevator. When along one hallway and then another angling off from it. Realized I was only in my slip with some wrap on my back and wondered if anyone had noticed. At last I find the elevator. This is the first floor of a large hotel. As I press the button, a small boy pushed me aside, rushes in, the elevator ascends but soon returns and I step in but there is no attendant. While I look to see how to run it, the elevator goes up and stops by itself. I step off and look for my room which is 200 and something on the second floor. The first number I see on the left is 431. Well it isn't so bad walking down as up and I start down."
"229"	"(10/24/55)"	"Arguing with mother, although I know she is dead, that Catholics are Christians too, just another way to worship Him. Take up one difference after another to show that's true. Mother asks, ""But what about...?"" I am just about to discuss their use of Latin as due to conservatism as I wake up."
"230"	"(12/19/55)"	"I am starting to eat at a hotel. Think breakfast peculiar and can't eat much of it. See green salad and potato chips. Look for place to sit, going to another table, but seats are taken. Look for someone to assign seats. No one. Tell Mrs. McC. I cant eat much of the breakfast account of salt. Could I have toast instead? She says I can for any meal. I see the nicely browned toast and toaster in the kitchen.  "
"231"	"(01/19/56)"	"Bingham market delivery arrives as I'm chasing the Sc. Boys from play on my doorstep. I insist he, ""Aren't you a new man?"" must bring in the order and let me check as both recent orders have had errors in them. The crate he carries is all tied around with string. He asks if another crate isn't mine. I say, ""I think so"" but then he brings in some hardware. ""No that isn't mine, nor is that,"" a package of a dozen cupcakes. Then the Sc. Boys are again playing on my stoop. The stoop is much larger now and extends across the next doorway. I tell them they must go, and try to fasten the door so they can't get in. I get my fingers in some green paint doing so to their delight. They say, ""We just painted that."" I start to scold them. ( I had gotten paint from a garbage can on my fingers recently.)"

Find book and want to take it but I have left my card. Sat to new librarian, ""You don't know me but I am Madorah Smith."" Look around for someone of the bystanders to identify me. (After I had gotten up at 6:30 to put out butter, etc., I fell back asleep and dreamt again.)"
"235"	"(04/06/56)"	"I was in a bedroom and was awakened and saw M. and two others in a narrow bed. They had been away. I said, ""They don't notice us. I'll wait to welcome them later and will sleep longer."" I put on my old pink dress. R. asked what length I wore my dress. I said this one was shorter than most. I shortened it when skirts were shorter. Someone admired the dress. Then the doctor was to examine me. I took off all my clothes except bra and old fashioned open drawers. He said he wanted a sheet. R. had the sheet and cutting folds apart partly slit the sheet. It will have to be mended."
"236"	"(05/16/55)"	"I went upstairs for somebody and there on my table was a thick paper bound AAUW book ""America's next twenty years.""

"237"	"(05/16/56)"	"I was downstairs in a large clubroom. Half the chairs were in a semi-circle facing the stage. Half were around the room where refreshments were being served at three tables. I find a chair where I can hear, leave bag there and start rounds, gathering up cookies, etc."

"242"	"(06/28/56)"	"I was visiting with V.S. She kept talking and I was thinking I want to get downstairs and read that book. Then her parents came in and began to say farewells.

Younger ones stay put, older ones you need not watch so close."" Child disappears. I start searching. See him talking with a man who is entertaining him. A couple of women with a little girl of 2 1/2 in a pink dress tagging them and limping. I ask, ""What's the matter?"" She points to left foot, ""It hurts."" I start to remove shoe and sock and children crowd around. As I bare her foot they exclaim, ""No wonder"" for there is a white swollen blister at the side of the sole. I say, ""I'll take her home and phone Queen Elizabeth"" for it's her little daughter. I wonder if it would be better to stay with her and send the message by some one else."
"245"	"(10/12/56)"	"I am at a doctor's office. A man and a woman are in at the same time. I leave and realize I forgot to tell him something. Annoyed I think it was because they were there, wish I had told him. ""I'd not talk till they were gone. Shall tell Dr. next time."" But it's not too late. I've got to see him. Another patient waiting complains, ""Isn't he thru?"" Nurse says, ""I'll see."" I see R. waiting. I ask, ""Have you been waiting long?"" She says, ""an hour but I had an accident."" ""What was it?"" But R. doesn't seem to know me. (I'm planning to see Dr. next Tuesday.)"

Very muddy and a building is under construction. I try two routes but can't find the way out. Return to bus and ask the way. I know they are on Wilder but how far up and how to get to the street? He indicates an arriving postman at far right where it's lighter. I see way to street but the blue bag is still missing and I can't make them understand where I want to go."
"248"	"(03/07/57)"	"We were walking to church or assembly hall. Down right hand aisle, in one pew was some apparatus so we passed it up. She asked if I was going to circle meeting. I said, ""No, I couldn't get Mrs. D. last evening and now it's too late."" "

"251"	"(03/17/57)"	"I was trying to find my way home. At first it was CR (town in which some of family has lived since 1910) downtown but in the northeast side. Then I was tangled in narrower streets and dead ends, blank walls on either side like in China. I ask a woman if I went this way I would get to open streets. She said, ""Yes."" But then, ''Not that way."" But the way she pointed meant climbing the hill again. "
"252"	"(06/13/57)"	"I was working or eating at a table opposite mother when M. came up and pushed me aside and spread out green material as if preparing to cut out some article. I didn't like it.

It's my part time maid's old place. ""She's going to work for me all the time now"", says our plump hostess. The maid whispers to me, ""When's she's gone I'll tell you."" I am worried but it will not be till next week and the maid will come to me on Thursday. Hostess says can put work away in drawers along under the seats on left side. Two of the same profession share a drawer. I am putting my things away, my steamer rug, a very shabby 2 _ Ft. Square yellow blanket, white rags and several small articles in e.g. pencils but look for R. to share. Ask for her.  ""Oh, she went home with rose."" I go to put my bag in drawer and find drawer on our hostess' bureau in the next room. So I take out my things putting small articles in my lavender housecoat pocket and return to hall to look for another drawer. I fin a rotten shelf on which people have been putting things in shoeboxes. I start to do the same but do not find any boxes. "

A Japanese waiter, a small man, brings me coffee. In a pleased manner he points out that he has added cream and sugar for me. I tell him I'm sorry but I'm not allowed but one cup of coffee a day and ask if there's a dessert. He said, ""no more, the kitchen is closed."" He has one eye much narrower than the other.

Before R. and J. came in I saw a small boy of 7 or 8 and asked what he was doing. ""Was he a fish?"" ""No fisherman."" ""Then I won't take you, a fisherman wouldn't be good to eat, would it?"" I said jokingly. When we reach the tables, only at the right hand sides of the right hand table are there three seats together. Someone has put a scarf on one next them. We sit down. Just before dessert some disturbance occurs. We get up to look, on our return find our seats are occupied by some men. We protest but they don't leave, so I seize back of one chair and tip man on the floor and say, ""Now my brother needs a seat too and tip a second man out."" "
"268"	"(10/15/57)"	"Waiting with two other women to use toilet. Those inside are very slow in coming out. I remark I should be meeting my brother and wonder if I could risk leaving to look for him to explain delay. One of the women speaks of her engagement for 4:30 p.m. Finally I get up and try the door. Place is empty after all and I slip in to use it thinking perhaps I should let them who have waited longer go first but still it was me who found it empty."
"269"	"(10/16/57)"	"Walking along a streambed. Betty goes to other bank. I think the right hand bank is more direct. Betty soon finds she can not cross the bank and our destination is on the right hand side. At least she comes to a possible crossing. After crossing the stream she comes up steep rocks by a narrow dirt path.  She lays something down and comes up the steep path with a baby. She dips it in a pool and hands me the dripping child. When Betty handed me the child she said, ""This is great aunt Medorah."" I have only old towels and I use the blue-edged one to dry the child and talk to it as I dry it. Its white rope is half off and half-dripping. "
"270"	"(10/17/57)"	"I was up early to wash. Had dressed in old pink dress. Felt rather stuffed. Checked on time to see if I would get to the machine first. Someone had moved the pan so I could not find the soiled clothes at first. "

Then the meeting is over and I wonder if they will play cards now. Go to talk to G.H. She says something about barley degrees. I ask her if I ever told her about my barley degree then realize it was some financial transaction of her husband's which she was speaking of, so explain that 'barley' degree as I use it was a common slang and proceed to tell her of my Yankton degree.   "
"273"	"(10/26/57)"	"Start to wrote notes on a paper and then realize it was someone else's paper so stop and apologize to the owner. Then I can't find the notes.

"274"	"(11/08/57)"	"We were driving in a car with two facing seats inside and a driver's seat in front like a landau. It was dark. I missed J., perhaps he was in front with the driver. I asked, ""where is J.?"" H. or R. answers, ""On the other side of me."" I say, ""Move nearer then."" For there was a big space, so he can have more room."
"275"	"(11/08/57)"	"We had been at a meeting and needed to go to the restroom. I'd been there before. Pushed open swinging door. Two spaces were connected. One had a wet floor, no seat, had to squat over a pit (as in Chinese inn). I did so and the other person in next cubby could see me lift my skirts."
"276"	"(11/08/57)"	"Coming home a large truck crowded me to one side of the road. It was standing still and I asked the driver, whom I could not see, to remain still so he wouldn't shove me off. It was a dark red truck, looked almost like a shack without windows. Then I cut across a green lawn and saw two dogs lying on the grass. Hoped they would stay asleep but they didn't, barked and cam towards me. I told them I had a right there and the black dog recognized me. I wanted him to tell the buff dog I was ok but the latter kept on barking and coming at me. I wondered why I was not afraid. I could see the large white house which was my home just beyond.  "
"277"	"(12/06/57)"	"H. and I were together hanging up mother's dresses from the cleaners. One was black, the other purple lace. I said that I liked lace much. H. agreed it was very good for traveling. I said, ""also for older people because it need less care."" Had difficulty in explaining."
"278"	"(12/06/57)"	"I was in bed and thinking someone was at window. I opened my eyes and sure enough, there was the shadow of a man on the blinds. While I think what to do, I think I see a gun. I want to phone but he is speaking but I can't hear him and I can't move or talk."
"279"	"(12/08/57)"	"M. is here and I've just mailed her a Christmas card. I think what a nuisance. I told her nothing and asked nothing in it that we've not told each other. "

"281"	"(12/30/57)"	"I had started for a train and finding the New Year's tea in the waiting room. Lingered there but returned for suitcase. Started out again but found I had left suitcase, feared the door was locked but it wasn't. When I finally got it, met M. who was going on the same train. Noticed it was 16 minutes of and the train was leaving at 15 of, so asked M. if she was taking a taxi, went with her but got separated at the station. Hurried in and asked where to check suitcase. ""Right here"" and did so without any ticket, asked where to buy one. ""At that window."" It was double. Two men were at one, I went to the other. Heard, ""Train waits here, you have time."" I got a large ticket cut in an odd shape. I couldn't remember the name of my destination. Said it began with a C and was about three stations away. He said, ""Bonneville, we pronounce it Buno."" Wondered how he knew. Asked, ""How much?"" He said, ""Nothing."" ""But why?"" ""Read the paper."" I much puzzled get on the train. Two men were scrubbing the floor on the side, the other side was wet and looked like hallways. Room at end like European first class car with U.S. section. I look for M. and try to find a seat. While at ticket window, think I lost handbag but now find it on my arm."
"282"	"(02/10/58)"	"I had gone over to Sayer's apartment with Mrs. McBride to try word building game. (Trying to see how many words can be built out a language, a frequent amusement of mine.) The Sayer's had left their apartment for some time. Mrs. McBride and I each took four of the telephone directories to suggest words. I thought of 'considerate' but didn't think it fair to use a word I had used so recently. So I discarded other words. I said, "" why not try central union"", our church but she didn't think it respectful. Then I suggested 'congregational'. Again she didn't think that respectful. I assured her congregational didn't always mean the church. I asked her to please hurry with her choice of words since I must leave by 3. P.M. to take 3:30 date. She said that the directory didn't suggest any words to her. I suggested 'handkerchief.' At least she agreed. I tore out a page from an old directory, hoping they would not use it and discover its loss and began to rearrange 'handkerchief' in alphabetical order. It was hard to read on the printed page what I wrote. I dotted letters in the word as I used each. I missed 'I' and printed it in."
"283"	"(03/05/58)"	"As a feast was ending I began to pick up the cutlery and silver to wash them. Kept finding more and more. I ask where mother is for I think I need help. She tells me, she wants buttermilk, I can't find any. Some one says, ""That is what you poured out for B."" But I doubt it. "

"285"	"(03/19/58)"	"I got a second lot of medicine from the doctor. Several small vials in white, blue-edged enamel cup. First lot was in a battered rusty cup, second in a good cup with extra powder in a small used carton. I decide to throw away the old cup. Then I noticed the doctor had also given me a dark green bottled marked 'Histamine, two or three times daily.' I ask mother what to do about it."
"286"	"(03/22/58)"	"I was shopping at Woolworth's with R. At many of the counters sets of chessman set up were displayed. I picked up some from a box and returned them. Thought since it was September, it was not too early to start Christmas shopping. For whom might I buy chessmen. Perhaps J. could use a second set since his sons had begun to play and were leaving home. Then I missed R. Some one told me she had gone to the Roman Catholic room. ""Where is it?"" ""In the northwest corner."" ""Where is that?"" I am disoriented. She points to the northeast. I go arms facing the door in a very small room. I open one and see mother seated with babe in her arms. Open the next door, toilet. Find R. and tell her I will not ride back with her but instead take bus to Waikiki for a swim. That way I can go direct but if I go home with her, I would have to transfer. But as I return to do a bit of shopping I remember it's too cold to enjoy swimming. "
"287"	"(03/29/58)"	"H. tells me my hair is too uneven. I should get it trimmed. I think she says she will do it but when I suggest she do it now, find I misunderstood. Exasperated I exclaim, ""I will not go to a barber."""
"288"	"(04/21/58)"	"I had written a letter to Kay and looked for an envelope to address but my box of stationery is nearly empty. Finally I find its contents including envelopes in a disorderly pile at the right of my desk.  Couldn't remember the street number and had to locate my address book. "
"289"	"(04/21/58)"	"I had been eating in the restaurant and wanted to go to a psychology meeting. It was in an educational building but I hadn't been on the campus for so long that I didn't remember where that was. ""Was it off that way"", I pointed diagonally. He said yes after my second question. Then I looked through a window and saw the brick wall of a building wing. (like at Iowa) I was in and then in front of a yellow brick building on which I could almost make out, EDUCATIONAL. So I went over into a large hall with step seats. Two men were arranging seats, etc. I asked if the psychology group was to meet there. No reply. I look again at the notice, ""308, that's up one more floor, isn't it?"" ""Yes."" So I leave but go downstairs instead. Notice I'm going wrong and start to climb up. "
"290"	"(04/24/58)"	"I go down a long narrow room to the left to get shoes. And hose to finish dressing. I want to sit down but the long white bench is all covered with bits of cakes of blacking. I look out window and see mother outside, looking sad. She had just been let out of a car and I judge she can't remember which house to enter. I say to R, ""If you don't go and let her, I will."" She says, ""Oh, you go."" But E. who is standing near says, ""No, R. you go, you have your coat right there."" So she goes but mother is now lying down in the snow. I think she looks real glad to see R. and must be saying so. R. helps her up and I ask her if she isn't cold."
"291"	"(04/24/58)"	"H. is talking about Jo. One of her friends wants a gardener but she doesn't want Jo. because he is always talking about his divorce. I remark, ""He's lonely. When someone is always talking about personal matters, he's lonely."" H. doesn't see it so. I ask if she thinks Jo. Should rather be a gardener than a carpenter. She thinks he could take the latter job on after hours. Not much work is needed. "
"292"	"(04/26/58)"	"I am walking around our apartments with a visitor going up and down stairs. Finally I say I will go no further with her.  And tell a boy of 3 or 4 years old to come with me and I wipe the yellowish crusts from his eyes. Ask if it doesn't hurt, it is so much worse than mine. (Was having similar trouble with my eyes. Saw dark eye very clearly.) I dampen a Kleenex and it wipes off rather easily but one bit slips in his eye and there's a dead fly and another speck in. He complains of something in his eye. I get the last bits out easily and wonder how the child can hold his eye open so well."
"293"	"(05/01/58)"	"We were going to a cafeteria. Two of the men hurried ahead and brought back tempting plates for two of the crowd. I decided to follow along and select my own but could not find the way."
"294"	"(05/01/58)"	"I was on a steamer and couldn't find the way to the dining room. At first some one was with me, then I was alone. I went down two decks to sailors. I was told only way further was by a poor ladder so was directed astern. I went back up and again down and was again crew's quarters. I asked if I couldn't get to the kitchen without going up again and did so, passing women washing pile of soiled clothes, colored, a child's bib marked with his name. Passing through the gallery at least I see the dining room though a curtained doorway but when I get inside the counters are almost clear. I ask if I'm too late. ""Yes."" And the waiter begins to cover up leftovers. Two or three times I repeat, ""But I lost my way, can't I have something? Begin to cry."" The head steward leans over and speaks softly to the waiter. I think he's telling him to feed me. "
"295"	"(05/07/58)"	"A young woman and a man are climbing about on the outside of a building in which I am. Suddenly I see her outside the window of the 2nd floor room in which I am and fear she is about to fall. I hurry to the window to help her in but she slides down by holding to the inside of a large blue curtain that covers most of the facade. While I am outside talking it over with some one, I see a woman with a year old baby dressed in a bright red, elaborately trimmed dress. I beckon her over but she goes to one side and joins two other young women with three very small children. I say to the oldest child, a 3-year old, ""How is your big sister?"" She asks me if I'm married. I say, ""No."" Then the women seem to think I'm unfortunate and one remarks they are very fortunate only because they met their men in Germany. I tell them I'm a retired University professor."
"296"	"(05/11/58)"	"We had finally gotten out of the crowd, and I had found her and gotten into the bus when I missed the children, two Shirley's, 5 and 10 years and asked her if she hadn't brought them. I'm afraid they won't have the sense to take the next bus. "
"297"	"(05/12/58)"	"She has to find her officers for O.E.S. I agree to be her Ruth. She has to preside tonight but she hasn't yet got her guest officers. I suggest Hap. I am looking over magazines and show her a picture 2 _ by two inches of a child with leis, in color a dull rose and ask if that wouldn't make a nice picture for a scrapbook. I am not thru the magazine when I lay it aside and go upstairs to help her. See Sadie and others lying diagonally on a long dark green couch at the side of the lodge room. Tell her it won't be so bad because it's past officers' night. (It will be next meeting.)"
"298"	"(05/13/58)"	"She comes in and tells me that her niece is coming and she has no place to sleep her. I say, ""You want to know if I could take you in. Try my couch. You could sleep there."" But it is piled with things. ""Push the papers aside."" She sits in a place made vacant. I think I have enough sheets. I can use my patched one. "
"299"	"(05/17/58)"	"At a picnic dinner. I am eating steak. There is a salad of green string beans. In lettuce leaves. A domineering woman tells me to eat my vegetable. I tell her I am going to when I finish the meat. Then I pick up a side dish and ask if this is the desert. It's 2 _ inch cubes of fruit. I remark on its smallness. The woman doesn't like it, says I shouldn't criticize, ""but take mine."" I protest but she insists and passes her dish of two large stewed dried peaches."
"300"	"(06/03/58)"	"Something vague about a feast. Somebody brings in a large book the size of a unabridged dictionary in a colorful wrapper. It is Two Worlds and I am to get Women Surgeon too. How can I read both in the allotted time.  "
"301"	"(06/13/58)"	"Twice I had been told the old red dress would be all right but when I was about to get in the car, I insisted I must change as it wouldn't do. ""Won't take me but two minutes."" Hurried back thinking my blue and white narrow striped dress would do. But I had to stop and put peanut butter in a dish. When it was all in, found it was slopping over on the ground or table. I noticed specks of dirt or crumbs and several slices of stale bread mixed in it, pulled then and threw them in the garbage."
"302"	"(06/13/58)"	"We were to take the train but got talking and discovered it was past time 2:40 p.m. J. said David would take us, leaving him at office and take Elsie and me on. I saw Elsie had gone fast asleep in the waiting room and went to wake her. Had to shake her before I could rouse her and make her understand we had to go. "
"303"	"(06/16/58)"	"I had been visiting a man in an iron lung. (I had been reading a book about such a case.) when a passerby spattered his face with red tomato juice. I said I'd wash it off. He said, ""Not you, I'm not paying you $1.50 per hour."" I insisted and asked the woman working on the other side of the room, ""Where are the towels?"" Found them and dipping a washcloth in a basin returned and began washing her face. Had to rub hard to get one red spot off her forehead. (Note sex of patient changes in the dream.)"
"304"	"(05/21/58)"	"We were to play cards. I went to draw my tally but each lip had only names and candy with them. Asked about it. Take a candy and names were partners. I drew Miss. Covington. ""Where is she?"" In the bathroom finishing dressing. Then she is on the other side of a long table. I tell her I'm her partner. Then instead of playing cards we are coloring and drawing symbolic pictures. ""We should score them now."" ""Who starts?"" One at my left says she is treasurer. I am alumna. So she comes first. ""Why doesn't Mrs. Lloyd, our chairman, give us rules for scoring?"" ""She's gone."" The treasurer finally starts scoring. Each of us are to score. She holds up a picture of tall houses, says it doesn't follow symbolism of picture underneath and scores it only one. I ask where my pictures have gone. Can't find it. Look at several pictures. They are a mixture of outlines colored and of original work. Still protesting I should find my picture and treasurer should give us rules for scoring."
"305"	"(05/24/58)"	"On the bus going downtown. Talk to little girl in the seat with me. Two little boys get on separately. At first one sits with us, then crosses the aisle to sit with the other boy. I look up from my reading and out of the window and see gray walls slipping by. It begins to look slummy. Think we should be downtown by now. Have I missed my stop? Look for conductor to ask. Now it seems to be a car in a train. We stop an after a bit, I rush off and call to policeman, ""where are we?"" but I can't get a response and hurry back to the train. Car is now all made up like a Pullman but with no curtains and white beds. Miss my white handbag and find I went to the wrong seat. See a boy sitting in a seat jammed between two beds. I understand something is loose and that's why we are standing still. At least the conductor comes along and I ask where we are. 100's of miles from the city. I must get back but I have not enough money. The train should pay my way back I cry in distress. "
"306"	"(06/30/58)"	"Hunting for my blue nylon dress in closet. Find a black and white print and put it on instead and go riding and walking with H. After walk H. calls my attention to fact that my dress is too long. I go to her room and remove it and hunt again for nylon dress. Take down a blue jersey and lay it aside. Notice black and white print isn't mine and it is soled at the bottom. Ask H. if she has had other guests who might have left it. Look in closet in next room but Ad. Is coming there and I haven't dressed. "
"307"	"(07/07/58)"	"Find several church envelops for Jan. And Feb. Filled and think no wonder my accounts wouldn't balance. (Repeats an actual occurrence when my accounts were $1 short.) But how did these get left over? Jo., a little boy, hadn't changed his clothes and she told him to go back, bathe and change. I remark how nice that toilet and bath are separate, for I needed to use the latter. Rooms are black and white. See crib and am told they have three, one for each child. (As in J's family.) I say, ""how sensible"" and speak of advantages of crib over cot. You could push this out the door and let baby have a sunbathe, but I wonder how the rail which dips down in the middle can keep the baby safely in."
"308"	"(07/11/58)"	"At table with tall green pictured glasses of ginger ale. There are three of us, tow men and I. Wonder why I have no drink. Taking my order. ""Potatoes or rice, jello or chocolate pudding, coffee or tea?"" I order rice, chocolate pudding and say, ""nothing to drink. This cold drink is enough."" He asks if I have enough to get back to Hawaii. If not, ask him. I say, ""I wouldn't start without plenty of margin but I didn't know I'd have to be hospitalized."" Then I remember with consternation that I haven't paid that bill. How odd I left without doing so. I remembered we left by side entrance in late evening. In hospital a man in a wheelchair is pointed outs as an excellent patient. He is paying his expenses by working on surgical dressings. I'm walking around and see other patients."
"309"	"(07/14/58)"	"Lining up as if to go into chapter. Leader starts speech and then says, ""Now we'll repeat together the well known prayer."" Now all are saying the Lord's prayer. At the same time I hear many deep men's voices. And a soprano trying to sing. She is usually drowned out by the men. I see a colorful Chinese garment hung on a pole like a banner and think this is hardly the occasion for a prayer."
"310"	"(07/15/58)"	"Mrs. A.L. is conducting a meeting and someone at the right is talking to her. Mrs. Edm. Comes busting in and someone gets up saying Mrs. Edm. wants to sit by Mrs. P. who is next. Then we are leaving the table. (The dresses are in color.)"
"311"	"(07/20/58)"	"I see H.D.'s face very clearly in a crowd and she comes down to join me."
"312"	"(07/22/58)"	"Mother is telling me she doesn't think R. and I should.... Since it leads to quarrels. We are sitting at a table. I ask her what I'm accused of. I can't hear her answer. I repeat question pressing her as to my fault until she bows her head and is crying. Still she won't talk further."
"313"	"(08/05/58)"	"We are calling the boys to hurry up so we can catch the bus. We are leaving a feast. One little boy is in the toilet. As we leave the church, I see R. has left her big tan bag and return for it. Ask the woman in pew behind if she's sure it isn't hers. The bag is very heavy and I decide to leave it at the church office so R. won't have to return so far for it as I'm sure it's hers. The secretary tells me she will look after the bag and that out that door is a short cut. I start out and find I've left my white and green umbrella which was hanging on my arm and start back for it. Afraid I will miss the train. Maybe if I leave through main entrance it will be quicker. Oh, I needn't worry about missing the train. This is all a dream."
"314"	"(08/06/58)"	"I take a vacated seat at the long picnic table but only soiled dishes are there. Someone passes me a yellow slice of lemon pie but I want some of the small cookies and sandwiches the others have. There are sandwiches on a shelf across from the table and a lady next to me keeps getting some but I can't reach it. Her arm seems to be lengthening when she reaches. "
"315"	"(08/09/58)"	"H. is afraid Clar isn't going to meet her at the corner as planned. I assured the train hasn't arrived yet and he will come. I talk to the 2 foot high doll I'm leading and try to make it stand up. "
"316"	"(08/10/58)"	"I have just packed my smaller black suitcase and now put two dresses in my large gray fortnight. Think I'll check it because it's so large for me to carry but remember it is weak. While wondering what to do. The boy calls from downstairs that we will miss the train if we don't hurry. It leaves at 7:30. I come down but we must wait for H. The yellow bus with Cedar Rapids in big letters on the side is leaving the front door. When I see we missed it and won't make the train, I hurry to station window and ask when the next train leaves. Think it's tomorrow. Much distressed."
"317"	"(08/11/58)"	"Looking for someone. Ask A.M. for the names of the new people who moved in on her side. She gives me a long list but I can't hear them clearly. She tells me they are playing cards on the patio. Did I want to join them?"
"318"	"(08/26/58)"	"I told R. I hoped they'd make some repairs on my apartment. At least they should fix the uneven card table legs. Try them and think they'd not be so bad if they could be unfolded better. Then there's the closet door to fix. But I find it has no door only a fine velvet curtain which I feel. One side is plain color, the other is flowered. R. tells the little child she'll make her a table cloth for her doll from the black velvet material on which she is sewing. I say, ""But you had a square already here,"" and I look for it but can't find it. Even when R. leaves and I shake out the material yard by yard, I can't find it."
"319"	"(09/01/58)"	"As I stepped from the shower wrapped in a towel, a man came in and said he wanted me. I said, ""I'm all wet."" He said, ""That's all right"" and led me to my bedroom. I threw off the towels as he began to undress, I find my lavender shortly top was still on and tell him he'd better close the door less some one sees him and lay down on the bed on my back. He lay down with head in the opposite direction. I felt I wasn't doing so wrong since I couldn't become pregnant. Then he was on top of me. I felt his muscles moving like a rod up my vagina. Wondered if it was his penis inside."
"320"	"(09/05/58)"	"I was in a large classroom, exam going on, but I had a form to fill out and didn't know if it was the right one for a retired person. In a dining room with table set for three. I joined them and the waiter set a fourth place. Then a man came in to call for the forms. I said yes and produced them and asked if this was the right one for a retired person. He said yes and I asked him how to answer one question. He said he couldn't wait. I'd have to return in the afternoon and he walked off while I called after him, ""You're an old meany."""
"321"	"(10/19/58)"	"I open a door and find a table with several dressing articles on it. They are blue and not mine and I start to clear them off when I see that this is really an alcove, part of another apartment. I see two women in it. Start to close off the two apartments. Pull down along high glass partition but find there's a knee high one before it to close also."

"324"	"(10/23/58)"	"Am in the water at the beach. The sea is rough and white with foam. See the heads of several swimming children. I get out and start up a steep path thru a garden. I pick up a bunch of yellow discarded daisies and orange marigolds as I enter the house and offer them to mother. She thanks me and suggests I help her make the beds. I say that I had been going swimming again in _ an hour. Go on upstairs where she told me she had put the bathing caps. Find mine but must go to toilet even if hard to manage in a bathing suit."
"325"	"(11/07/58)"	"We were talking about a lot of dishes and glassware. I see the table with piles on it. Warn that they should be packed more carefully. Need more paper to do so. I notice particularly some green glass dishes."
"326"	"(11/07/58)"	"Trying to get out of a black gate. (Like those in China.) I was in stocking feet and walking on the garden path, felt gravel hurting my feet. Father came out and said I shouldn't go out on the street so late. ""But I have to go to Silsby's to sleep so she won't be alone"" but father said he'd walk over with me. ""I must get my shoes first while you are getting the key to the gate. I can't find shoes in the house and start on the street in the opposite direction to hunt for them."
"327"	"(11/14/58)"	"I pass two people sitting in the patio and start up the very wide steps of the Home (King's Daughter's home where I am now and where Miss Drum has lived and where I then visited other friends. Quiet hour really 1 to 2:30 p.m.) to see my fiend. They call to me I can't visit now. It's quiet hour until 4 p.m. I thought it was over at three. I came back and said I wanted to find out if Miss Drum (now dead) was still in 132. They said I could ask at the office. I find no one there and tell them so. One of them rises and says she will phone Emily, does so and I learn that Miss Drum is still in 132. "
"328"	"(11/14/58)"	"I am arguing with a woman on the value of intelligence tests. She says they are just a conglomeration of stunts. I protest that their correlations are too high to be meaningless."
"329"	"(11/15/58)"	"Waiting to be picked up after a swim. Jo. Not here yet but start with H. He leads mother and me across a muddy court, pauses at a privy and asks if we need to stop there. First I say yes then no. I think I can wait until we get home."
"330"	"(11/15/58)"	"I am on the top edge of a bowl. As I climb down I say, ""Since I got my PH.D, I will take no more courses."" Of course I've done a few since, mostly as an auditor. "
"331"	"(12/17/58)"	"Trying to find my way thru alleys which turn out to be dead ends, under scaffoldings, etc. Want to get to May's Grocery."
"332"	"(12/20/58)"	"[I was working on my repeat study of bilingualism in preschool children and we were having difficulty in keeping Filipino and Japanese speaking recorders for the project.] I am distressed because my Filipino recorder is quitting. Go to find her and tell her of the fix I'm in. Three Japanese helpers have quit."
"333"	"(12/21/58)"	"Hunting for a brown pocketbook which had been left behind. Wake as I realize it is a dream."
"334"	"(12/--/58)"	"There was a long piece of tinsel lying diagonally on the table, but there had been something supporting it in the middle. What was it? A clock? I started looking for it but what was missing was my little tree. I asked the steward on the ship if I had left it in the dining room. He said no. I continued to hunt. Then asked conductor on train if we were at C.R. yet for the train had stopped. He said no we were at Longview. Someone asked me where I lived. I answer 610 So. 5th St. C. R. Iowa. When hunting for tree saw its colored ornaments."
"335"	"(01/03/59)"	"Haru came. I asked how she knew I needed a maid. We discussed days etc. (A wish fulfillment.)"
"336"	"(01/--/59)"	"My wicker chairs was missing. Went to ask Dr. Jac. if anyone had seen it. I had washed it and put it out to dry and it might have been though discarded. My room looks square with a dark green upholstered couch and chair."
"337"	"(01/25/59)"	"Waiting for a meeting. A plump woman had a sort of program. He said his brother had prayed for a certain question on his exam. I asked if he got it. He said no. I say, ""When I was a child, I prayed for a certain question on the book my mother had been reading to us. But even though I prayed aloud at her knee (she was our teacher and would set the exam) it did no good."" But they didn't really listen to my tale."
"338"	"(01/31/59)"	"R. was looking over my old lavender dress to see if she could fix the collar. I was so worn. We discuss it a bit. Then, a sudden thought, ""Why not use a neckerchief?"" I began to look thru my drawers but couldn't find the right color. I said to others of the family, ""Remember tomorrow is our January birthday."" (R's is on Jan. 23.) At first they were puzzled but then remembered. I thought I'd get R. a neckerchief for present."
"339"	"(01/31/59)"	"Quite a number were walking to church. I followed them but special groups were in front seats. I found one on the left side about halfway back where a ramp started. Then I saw a seat in a pew ahead but when I got there, a man's coat was in it so I returned to my former seat. There was singing but I could see no man. There was a curtain and men's feet and blue trousered legs shown beneath. I thought they're getting ready to dramatize family prayers. A child next to me tried and asked to get down. I told her I didn't think her mother would like her to."
"340"	"(02/01/59)"	"Talking with some people about our summers in Dalaensaen (when I was a child in China). Described house as well as if I had been awake and tell how we shared it one summer. Mr. Shoe asks, ""Where was I?"" I say, ""You came to China a year after we went to Ningpo."""
"341"	"(02/01/59)"	"I had come to a large house to play bridge. First we sat at a table for tea. The cookies were odd looking things and there were rolls and graham muffins. I asked for butter and apologized saying that I thought I had seen butter over there when the hostess said she had none. There were tempting cups of fruitcake but they weren't passed to my regret and all of a sudden the table was cleared and all the other guests had gone to Mrs. Fonda. Hostess said she'd take me over but she took me to her house instead. In her bedroom upstairs she showed me a bedspread made of cross-stitch on canvas in red, brown and dull green with one lighter piece. She said her mother had made it and after death she had found other squares and put them together. I told her of father's slippers (we had made them when I was 10). Then we were downstairs and I didn't know how to get to Mrs. Fonda's. The hostess was gone but two women in colored prints were there, evidently maids. One started to show me the way, going thru kitchen, outdoors and upstairs to a workshop. I fall and find dress hem full of Spanish needles. Pick them out. One of the two or three children asks, ""wash hands?"" I see mine are brown with mud and wash them under the faucet. I notice my blue skirt is quite wet."
"342"	"(02/11/59)"	"I went into the small classroom and laid down my two small heads, one of which has a hole in the crown, and my handbag to hold a seat and went to the toilet. First stall had no latch so went to one on the left but came back to first to finish. Then I went down to cafeteria and back to classroom to take exam. Bag is missing. I ask permission to leave to hunt for bag. Return to cafeteria to see if bag left there. Receive some large oatmeal cookies in a paper. Ask for bag. They hadn't seen it. Quite worried. But then I know this is a dream. In the big classroom. I tell students about the exam room in Stockholm with desks marked with red, yellow and green rings e.g. 7th grade arith. are told to take red seats, 8th grade English yellow and 9th grade green. Seats so marked so members of same class would be separated thus cheating more difficult. I ask class what they think of the plan."
"343"	"(02/12/59)"	"I come from the garden carrying a large twig of a Christmas Berry tree. See dark bunchy stuff as well as the red berries. See J. who lifts a brown, nude 2 year old boy down and we walk on together, he carrying the child. I ask, ""Can't the big boy walk by himself?"" He says, ""Yes, he can"" and puts the child down. I wonder, ""Why is the child naked?"" I won't have to go to the mainland if J. is there. Where is he staying? I didn't know he was coming. I'll have to have him in to eat."
"344"	"(02/27/59)"	"I had come to the mainland to enter a swimming contest. As we filed by the desk, I gave my name and ""from Hawaii."" She asked for my application form. I said I had received none. She, ""I mailed it."" I say, ""Probably not in time. Remember it takes a long tom if not by air."" She, ""I sent it by air. Two days should have been enough."" I asked for form now. She, ""must pass test first."" One test is to build a boat. She passed out clever two headed screws and told us to find our boards. He and I started. He found an old packing box and screwed two boards together. I picked up two slender pieces. We came out to the light. He said he had built a boat with twin beds for the boys and three other bunks for the rest. We stood on the beach near a scaffold like structure. The sand breaking gently on it so white and the sky so blue. I say, ""let's try the boat."""
"345"	"(03/02/59)"	"I was at a banquet sitting at the right side of the hall facing the wall. They were passing pink and white ice-cream but left me out. I complained and a waiter slammed a plate before me saying, ""there you are."" But it was a cake like pudding with a yellow sauce. I went out to the kitchen to get ice-cream but no one was there. Out of the door were three men in dark blue work clothes working. I returned. Now I had three plates of cake bot no ice-cream. "
"346"	"(03/04/59)"	"R. and I are making the bed in my apartment. She with head at foot is smoothing out sheets and tucking them in. I tell her not to tuck them in as springs are bad and will tear sheets, show her small holes in sheet's edge and she desists."
"347"	"(03/04/59)"	"I return to Hawaii and find H. and CA. are planning to be gone in November and December. I ask, ""where to?"" H. replies, ""Oh, Europe or around the world, I haven't decided."" Since you are in Hawaii I advise to go to Asia first. I say, ""J. also will not be here in November and December."" I think it's too bad since I had counted on spending Christmas with some of the family. Well there will be D. I can visit that day and probably friends will invite me when they know I'm alone."
"348"	"(03/05/59)"	"N., R. and I are starting down to church in the evening. R. wants to go around King Street to avoid the broken sidewalk. I protest it's too far that way. I am tired and will go via P. Street even if they don't. N. is holding me by the arm. I insist I will go down P. Street. Finally N. goes with me and the others via King Street. On the way, we pass an eight year old boy building with blocks. He has two castle facades and a plan built. I ask if he's building a castle. ""No, it's a big house for a cattleman."" I notice a 4 inch long rubber cow. We go on and I say, ""Let's go in."" It's a large near empty auditorium with a slanting door. N. goes to front row next to piano at left. I ask if she'd mind going one row behind since there are only two seats in front and pianist might want to sit there when off stool. N. changes. I look back, the room is nearly filled now and I see R. and the rest high up near the rear wearing flowered hats."
"349"	"(03/--/59)"	"Three orange new style dresses."
"350"	"(03/--/59)"	"W. was not in his usual classroom so I come downstairs to hunt for him. Ask at office and was given a catalog. Now I thought I can follow my schedule and find where each class meets so I unfold the folder."
"351"	"(03/22/59)"	"Looking for a toilet. J. in shower. I come too. Think to go to parents' but go across hall instead. Sit on toilet. Notice hold in floor. Lucky I didn't fall in it. If I did I should open my arms wide and I'd catch by armpits."
"352"	"(04/04/59)"	"At a meeting of the legislature, mostly women were there. Roll call showed many absent. Discussion bores me. After dinner, a very large casserole filled with sliced meat under a crust. I look for a smaller casserole to put the food in, there is enough for another day. Cupboard is crowded and can't find dish. Bread is spilling out of the breadbox. I complain, ""why can't they put the bread back when they've got what they wanted."""
"353"	"(04/06/59)"	"Elsie had come and we went to a neighbor's and talked with her in the kitchen. She brought out cards with messages on them. The second was from Coa. Asking for me to call them. They wanted to take us to Barber's Point. I said we'd better go home to phone and we left. We went across the street and then down but I couldn't see. Realized I had gone over with sleep shade on pushed up and felt embarrassed. Now it had slipped down and I stumbled and bumped into someone.  "
"354"	"(04/13/59)"	"The church was nearly empty when we arrived but we sat down on a bench outside where we could hear. A man and two women came up and asked the time. I looked at my watch and said 8:30. My friend said she thought there'd be time to go and went off with them. I went back thru the church. A 3 or 4 year old boy asked for TV. I said I didn't know how to turn it on. He went up and turned it on. I missed my tan handbag and went back thru church to pew outside but it wasn't there. Returned to child and told him we should keep door to church shut so as not to disturb the service by TV and closed the door. Room looked like a kitchen dining room. I found two bunches of my keys on the cupboard shelf and other items from my bag and then I spotted the bag on the floor. "
"355"	"(06/17/59)"	"I was in a neighbor's room. Could not open my eyes. L.K. came and touched me on the back of my shoulders and said that the man doing our statistics was getting on nicely. I was glad but warned him if he was not finished by the end of August, the lag in publication would be more than six months greater than if our article was ready the first of July."
"356"	"(07/18/59)"	"She was drinking milk and eating. I suggested ice cream sodas and will get them. What kind does she want? Vanilla and chocolate. She tells me to get money from her purse. I find $1/2 and 4 _'s, take the former and $1/2 of my own and will get a chocolate too. Go to the store, watch the filling of the order and wonder how i can carry back three orders. Ask how much. $5. That's far too much. I won't pay it. I begin to calculate. Three ladies ice cream, 45c, 3 soda pops, 30c and then there's overhead and labor."
"357"	"(08/04/59)"	"We had left our seats in the rear row and returned to find them gone. I drew back a seat further and told the others to do so. We are hearing a lecture on personal relations in dealing with workers to come from the other islands. In the large sitting room they were here and the three year old girl was crying loudly. I ask her mother why and we try to quiet her. Then my mother takes the child away."
"358"	"(08/06/59)"	"I started to wash a white article when a woman came by with a load of laundry and this article and tub was for her. I made a lame apology and went to get my clothes together but the cement floor was dirty with a dog's or cat's feces which I cleaned up. I got my pan but now there were two more with laundry to wash. I wondered if there would be space but I wanted only to wash a few articles. Then I was washing a red figured dress by pouring water about two inches deep on it as it lay spread out on the bed. I told a woman to remove her yellow dress from beside it lest it get wet. She said, ""yes, it might discolor your dress."" I said, ""I was thinking about your dress, not mine."""
"359"	"(08/09/59)"	"We left the meeting and as he locked the front door, I missed my brown handbag. ""Lucky you have a key."" He let me in and I went to the assembly room. In the front seats there was no bag. Then I remembered I had had to sit further back and going back found the bag. It was much fatter then usual."
"360"	"(08/09/59)"	"I came a little late to the spread. It was not served but lady at end asked me to pass the bread. I asked her to serve me. She said, ""this is only bread here, but you can have toast."" I then helped myself, reached into one dish and got almost half of a small chick, missed it, found it on the floor. I got other things, one small chicken thigh which a young girl tried to take from me when I got up to get small green pickles, for most were leaving. I held onto the chicken and kept it. I also got 3 or 4-inch cubes of jellied salad. (in color)"
"361"	"(08/10/59)"	"I was helping two little girls with arithmetic but instead tried positive and negative numbers thru temperatures. After easier problems, I asked what the temperature would be if from -20 it grew 30 degrees colder. Judy answered, ""add them."" Then time for lunch. ""We have some of that rice dish you fixed left."" That was so long ago, we had better heat it, put some butter in the pan and put the rice in."" Then some woman brought a rice pudding, I thought, ""so much rice."""
"362"	"(08/20/59)"	"I was laying on the couch when two ladies came up the stairs very noisily and looked in at me half clad. And decided I was asleep. Then I wanted to return to my bed but when I got up I was dizzy and tottered and began walking, holding onto things. I was blindfolded and fumbling for support and wondered why mother who was behind me didn't come to my support. Just as I found the bed, I awoke."
"363"	"(09/07/59)"	"We were in the hall. I saw two men carrying in plates of jello, piled with whipped cream. I thought I'd like some too so went into the dining room. Saw three long trestle tables piled with food but couldn't find jello until after asking. Two dishes, one white, one red. Helped self to first and small amount of second, then to two ladles of whipped cream."
"364"	"(10/09/59)"	"At a lecture. Had left green umbrella but some one brought it to me and I laid it on the next seat, but when I got up, a lady picked it up and walked off with it. Hurrying after her in a crowd, I managed to retrieve it. I told my friend she may have taken it on purpose but probably in error for her own."
"365"	"(09/10/59)"	"I found colored Xmas cards and started cutting them for a charity when mother came and picked up a box and told me this was the sample of cards she was selling. In distress, I told her about cutting a card up and finding the pieces tried to mend it. She told me she had had them out last Sunday and tried to sell them but hadn't sold much."
"366"	"(10/06/59)"	"I knocked on the front door, no response, on back door, none either. Went to side window and by gestures told R. I wanted in. They were at table but when I came there was nothing for me to eat but a little desert, cornstarch pudding with fruit."
"367"	"(10/07/59)"	"One of my students had won an honor. Her name was checked on a newspaper list. She told me there was a fuller account in the paper and handed me a sheet of it printed in many colors, mainly red and green. I couldn't find the account and when she told me where to look I couldn't see it and when she explained further I couldn't hear."
"368"	"(10/11/59)"	"I was at a sewing school sent a machine where I finished a long, black sleeveless dress. Took it off the machine, looked at it, wondering if I could keep it. I had to get somewhere at 11 and wasn't dressed for it. Looked for her to find out when I was to be ready. We should leave at 10:30. It was 8:45. I had time enough. I told H. I had been initiated into KS at the meeting last evening at Mrs. C.L. She was walking quiet well without her wheelchair."
"369"	"(10/11/59)"	"A man was showing me over his college which adjoined S.U.I. One building was partly his college's and partly S.U.I.'s. I remarked on how close the schools were. ""I got my Ph.D. in 1925 in Psychology there."" ""My wife got hers last year in Psychology."" ""What was her name?"" ""Haviland."" ""I have heard of her."" He made a remark about a child's neologism. I told him about the many languages used in Hawaii, of one child who used four in a single sentence and of the 'cut-hair shop'. He was a thickset, rather coarse-looking man."
"370"	"(10/30/59)"	"I went to the door to get the paper but none were there. Two men were working next door tearing down and enclosed porch and rebuilding it. Saw it was termite ridden, as much of the building was. I asked them where my paper was. They hadn't seen it. Then I saw it on a stand at the left as I turned back into the house but when I brought the paper in there was only one of the two sections. Two children, less then three years were seated on my buffet. One was dressed in white, trimmed prettily in blue that matched her eyes. I lifted them down, put them out, telling them not to come in. Then the Rich. boy came in. I told him he shouldn't without knocking. Meantime I was wondering what to do about my deficient paper."
"371"	"(11/03/59)"	"R. asked me for directions for my typewriter as hers was giving her trouble. I said, ""yes, I had them."" and looked in my desk cubbyhole for them, no luck, pulled out all the papers, not among them. Then I remembered I had removed them from desk and put them in the typewriter case. I was visiting some of my family and had planned to go to the Strongs who were on the other side of city on Wednesday. But M. told me they were expecting their children on Thursday who'd leave Friday so I decided to wait until Saturday. "
"372"	"(11/13/59)"	"I was visiting R. After chatting, I said I must leave now and went to get my things. Found my handbag but not my black coat. I couldn't remember how I had brought my nightgown. I was to go to stay at the Y.W. Perhaps they would not have room for me so R. gave me two addresses. I had trouble in hearing them."
"373"	"(11/24/59)"	"Mr. Florida removes his shoes and tells me of how he had injured one foot and now it puffs out. Both insteps look red and puffy. Mr. Black enters and Fla. Introduces himself and Black does too. But Dave B. had really come to see me and asked for an appointment. I say, ""not today but tomorrow. A girl is coming. I don't know when, but you can see me any time between 9 and 12 a.m."" He says 9 is too early. Leaves. I wonder where we'll meet, in this lounge, my room or at the university. I should have told him."
"374"	"(11/24/59)"	"Mrs. ? says she has invited us to stay. I think she thinks I'm trying to ? her. I explain about N.D.'s cake and then she's really hinting about our paying. I go to bathroom picking up a cake of white soap. Lock door but a girl enters. I ask her how. She leaves, others try to enter. I push one out, find doorway has two doors, bolt the other but others keep crowding in. Much trouble pushing one out. Then I wonder shall I bathe or sponge as Doctor said last week."

"376"	"(01/04/60)"	"On a 3 cabin houseboat (as in China). Girl on chamberpot can defecate only a bit but as she gets up I see her buttocks and panties all smeared. I try wiping her off though she cries out, tossing gobs into the pot until there is quite a pile of black feces."
"377"	"(01/04/60)"	"As I enter the house where the party is, I see Mrs. Gariaga and sit beside her on the sofa, and ask, ""when did you come?"" ""I've been here since 1919."" ""But haven't you been away?"" ""Yes."" Further conversation, then I say, ""I must see our hostess."" But I can't remember her name. Pass into second room where a table is set up but they are not serving yet. Go on to third room and find hostess before a charcoal brazier, red flames, warming up an elderly lady. Ask or think, ""why use charcoal when there is a fireplace in the room."" I take a vacant seat and start eating. Does it warm better? Go back to middle room. Some people are sitting at the table. There are hard candies and I think I'll slip them in my bag to take them home but the bag is missing. I hurry off explaining why to third room for bag. Ask hostess if she found it. She shows me my black bag on a table."
"378"	"(10/11/60)"	"At one side of the room a lecturer is demonstrating. He has five glass tubes with red liquid in each. Asks which tube is brightest or darkest. His class doesn't answer. He comes around the separating high counter and asks me. I tell him it depends on the background and show him how the tubes change shade when the blackboard or white hall is behind them."
"379"	"(01/16/60)"	"We went to the bus stop to wait for the bus. I saw I was on the wrong side for the bus going up the street and crossed over. Soon I was back on the wrong side. Mary remarked it was a lonely road. I told her it seemed so because she had lived in the city so long. It looked like a country dirt road. We waited long for transportation. Then down the street a ways near some low buildings., we spied a couple of idle jinrichas. I went to negotiate with one of them. The rest of us would walk."
"380"	"(01/30/60)"	"I was sorting and packing boxes and trunks and hunting for certain articles in an attic full of boxes and trunks. Mother told me clothes for the oldest should be in the oldest trunk, those for the next oldest in the middle and those for the youngest in the newest. I asked, ""which is it, the tan or the brown?"" I knew the blue gray was the oldest. I kept on looking for the lost articles and then learned mother had placed them on top of a box. ""Why didn't you tell me you'd found them?"" I demanded angrily and R. chimed in, ""she (that is I) ought to be whipped repeatedly."" "
"381"	"(02/22/60)"	"We went upstairs to a long hall with several doors on each side. Passing the first two on the right they told me that Livesay's children lived there. In the first apartment was Mary Livesay, now 40 years old and the only child of both parents. I though the others were theirs by previous marriages; but where is he? But the others had gone. In a room at the left, I saw many people seated in chairs. Concluded it must be a doctor's waiting room. I tried the door. Then someone was trying to get out. I pressed more then one part of a complicated lock, and finally she could get out. She thanked me and I asked if that was Dr. Livesay's office. She said ""yes"". I went in but now the room was dark and bare and a double door was at the far end. Another person and the nurse coming out took him first. I felt annoyed. Then I thought, ""but why do I want to see him? He is not an M.D. Perhaps for psychotherapy but he doesn't do that."" Anyway, why see an M.D. I've passed that exam for King's Daughter's home. (I did pass that physical exam soon after and moved to Home Apr. 1, 1960.)"
"382"	"(04/29/60)"	"I entered the room where the program was to be. Chairs and a small table were in a random order. I inquired where the speaker was to be so that I could sit where I could hear. (Being deaf in one ear I have to ask just that often.)"
"383"	"(04/19/60)"	"At long tables. My plate had just been served when the waiter took it away. I called for him to bring it back. Even when I called at kitchen door filled with waiters, no luck. So I began to fill my plate again, fish with sauce mashed potatoes and gravy, green peas. As I started back to seat, a child on crutches called, ""Look out!"" The peas were sliding off. I retrieved some and replenished the fish."
"384"	"(05/24/60)"	"We came into the dining room which was crowded with round and square tables for four. At our places were bouquets of purple lilacs but I couldn't think why. The person who had entered with me disappeared. I sat down and Mrs. McRae, the only one at the table said, ""so, it's your birthday."" I said, ""no, it's my wedding day."" Then I thought I'd better sit with my husband but I remembered this home is only for women. Saw a man briefly in front of another table but he went away. I wondered where Mrs. Kn., my tablemate, was. We should be at the same table, saw her at another table. Was I at the right table? Yes, there was my napkin ring. I heard Mrs. McRae say, ""it's her birthday and her wedding day both today."" I thought that won't do. They'll expect my wedding but it has already taken place. Where can I meet my husband to sleep with him? Then I realized at last I had gotten to sleep and was dreaming so I needn't worry about Mrs. McRae spreading the news or my husband.  "
"385"	"(06/03/60)"	"Three ladies are in my room fixing it up. They keep interfering with my belongings and I, near tears, keep wishing they'd go. I want to dress and tell them they shouldn't come before breakfast. I look for glue to mend something. Finally find it on shelf in toilet. Poured out too much and it spills but it is rather thick and I pick up the yellow semi liquid in strings. Then I pick up a book, The life of Dickens, which I had forgotten to return to the library. I hunt for the card to find out when it was due but can't find date and am worrying if I'll have to pay more than the book is worth when I realize I'm dreaming and have no such book."
"386"	"(06/10/60)"	"Mother came into my room while I was abed and said, ""It's only six so you can sleep longer."" She kept on talking so I couldn't get back to sleep."
"387"	"(06/10/60)"	"I went to a program and tried to find a seat where I could hear."
"388"	"(06/18/60)"	"A young girl and boy, shabby and pale, came to the door and I asked them in and gave them most of a large roll of pancakes that M. hadn't wanted. Ate a bit of it with them but thought, ""that's not much of a lunch when we have such a light supper."" They had no money, had had none for some days. I thought I'd ask mother if we could keep them overnight or until he found work. I went to look for her. R. told me mother had gone somewhere for a few weeks but planned to visit home occasionally. R. thought we could put up the children. I asked the boy how old he was. ""16"" and how far in school? I told R. I thought we could put up the boy all right. He could sleep with one of the boys in their room. I tried to think where we could put the girl for the girl's room was so crowded."
"389"	"(06/19/60)"	"Get X. to deliver a package for me so I can pour at a party. Start pouring a red fruit juice but the spout is bad and it pours on the tablecloth. Then I pour tea, asking if sugar and milk are wanted, but later I am asking and using yellow lemon instead of milk."
"390"	"(07/12/60)"	"We are preparing the children for bed. I put one doll in blue in a basket and tried to put in another but it wouldn't fit. Put one celluloid one in a folded paper flower. No more blankets. Where are we to sleep?  "
"391"	"(07/16/60)"	"I was to work for Mrs. Kn. Wondered how I could find time for it. Asked her if she'd like me to wear my white dress. Yes. I went to my room. The three tabletops were all cluttered. Wondered how much pay I'd get."
"392"	"(08/10/60)"	"Hunting for clock to learn time. Rather dark but i hear mother's clock ticking loudly. Search for it and finally find black Baby Ben. With such a dark dial, I wonder how she can see it. (Wakened by nurse's clock.)"
"393"	"(08/14/60)"	"A white package, pencil addressed for me of medicine is delivered; but medicine now is to be kept by the home. (and doled out which I didn't like.) At last I open the package which contains two bottles of yellow liquid. This is not what I've been taking."
"394"	"(08/16/60)"	"Come to long table. At my place is a large plate of hash. I say, ""I'd rather they'd have dessert for me."" ""So'd I"" he said. Although this is K.D, there are many men there."
"395"	"(08/29/60)"	"Stacking up clean dishes at the sink. As I pick up last plate think I'll have to take them to the kitchen to scald them and put them in the rack. I pick up the newspaper to finish it but the light in the room is inadequate. Top of lamp is missing. Living room too cool. While trying to find light enough, I see on table two brown wrappers with 4c red stamps. Think I must save them for Miss Ko. (Mrs. Ko. collected stamps for a charity) but examining them more closely see one is slightly torn, the other is printed on."
"396"	"(09/05/60)"	"I go into the next room and see several making leis. One lady in a blue and white dress is wearing one lei just finished with bunches of small blue flowers on it. "
"397"	"(09/05/60)"	"I wake and it's past 8 a.m. I cab not have heard the nurse clock. I'll be late but perhaps I can get something to eat if I hurry. Start dressing. Now where's my dress? Why I have it on and also my blue and green apron? Take that off. In dining room only one person. The Chinese waiter will please bring me toast and papaya. I go after him to ask for two pieces of toast. I go to the other guest in the dining room. She has a baking tin of three rolls before her. I ask for the crusty piece on the edge. She let me have it and I eat it. Some time during this episode, I realize that breakfast is earlier then 8, and decide nurse did not knock at my door because I had gone to sleep in an empty room across the hall, wonder if I'll be scolded (we often were for trivialities) for doing so. We'll pay for laundering the sheets."
"398"	"(09/05/60)"	"I return to my room which I share with R. Find furniture all moved around. I'd dropped clothes on the floor as I dressed. Others had moved things. I scold those responsible and told them to move things back as they were."
"399"	"(09/07/60)"	"I'd been in far wing, when three or four in print dresses come out and tell me I had better get dressed for breakfast. I'm embarrassed, returning in my nighty but get thru darkened dining room and lanai. OK. Dress hurriedly. Start back and but over grass and get to a rocky ledge about 6 or 8 ft. High, decide against returning and clamber down singing, ""I love you by day, I love you by night."" (Forget the rest but thought it quire a song.) When I reach dining room, I am surprised to find it all changed with stove in room and a few round tables. While I'm wondering where to sit some small children arrive. One asks a child already there if she has any brothers and sisters. Child says she had two older sisters and Brother John. Her mother interrupts to say he is John Brothers and to tell of his recent graduation in the presence of somebody. I think what a showoff."
"400"	"(09/07/60)"	"I'm in my room filled with comfortable dark wood chairs. Some one asks, ""where is your wicker chair?"" I assure her I don't need it."
"401"	"(10/04/60)"	"I come out of my room to find three or four sitting at my door talking."
"402"	"(10/04/60)"	"Miss D. complains that she is to be moved to share a room. At first I think it is only she, then I learn it's all of us in the wing when they finish the new building. All rooms in that are for two. I think I'd have never bought in if I'd known I'd have to share a room. I shall protest."
"403"	"(10/26/60)"	"I start to take some red grapes from the sugar bowl and am told they are R's who put them there. I protest that they were given to us all and when no one is looking, take two. Start eating at table and help myself to center dish. I'm getting potato under a pile of vegetables but none under 10 or 12 slices of bread. As I help myself to the last of the green vegetable R. asks if there are any more vegetables. I say there are only small pieces of meat. She starts to take meat which is now on long strips of paper. I warn her she is spilling on the floor."

"407"	"(11/05/60)"	"At long table waiting for the second course. No waitress comes. At last I get up and ring a bell. No one comes. Then I get up and pass medicines to all. Lady at head drops 3 or 4 pills into her sauce. I expostulate. Then they are pushing back from the table. I ask man to pass me the medicine bottle and take my pill. It's hard to swallow without water so I go back to dining room. Now sliced peaches are at each table. I eat mine and also slices from which were spilling over on the cloth."

"410"	"(11/17/60)"	"As I opened a package at the table I found it full of soda crackers. Offered some to a neighbor. Then found some were cookies. After a while I ate one sweet roll from the package. Then I went on with Shir, 7 or 8 years old, and her half brother, 19 years, to catch a bus. Just missed one. I said, ""let's walk. I've done it before."" So we started down the graveled road. As we came to a branch, Shir said, ""this is a shortcut."" But it was muddy and full of puddles. So her _ brother and I persuaded her to remain on the graveled road. (Shir, my niece, now 40 years has no half siblings.)"

I told her I was waiting for an assignment. A man came in and he was assigned his bed. I protested I was there first. A second woman in a blue print dress said she didn't know if there was any left. I looked over rumpled beds, partly occupied."
"412"	"(11/20/60)"	"There was a monkey crying to be taken on her lap, but the lady who had acted as its mother was gone. I had asked him to type my manuscript or he had offered to and he was reading from handwritten copy to check. I told him to insert 'the' in one place and why. Then I saw the typescript was _ inch thick but alas it was single spaced with inadequate margins. I was trying to decide whether I should ask him to do it over or take it to a professional typist and feeling quite annoyed when I realized it was a dream and awoke."

"415"	"(12/06/60)"	"They guesses my weight as 126 lbs. I protested just last week it was 117 lbs. I went to the scales to weigh. The hand spun around for some time, went down left side which was numbered across the bottom and stopped in middle where there were no numbers but counting marks, perhaps it was 120. A girl comes along and changes it to an easier to read dial. I move the scales and the other woman also. She says, ""you go first. I can any time."" I get on but the hand stays at half past 12. Then J. gets on but the hand doesn't move."

Said I had tried to get average IQ's of 100 and how. I didn't remember the exact averages but my thesis had been published and there was z copy in the Univ. Of Hawaii's library. Then I was going to a psychological meeting in N.C. Suddenly I realized I should have started before. Already it was afternoon and a train from Iowa wouldn't get me there by evening. At first I tried to get the railroad for time, then shifted to United Airlines. "
"418"	"(02/14/61)"	"We came down the hill. Many groups were on the picnic grounds. I went to a shady place on the left and tried to settle there. People next objected but I showed there was room. A boy offered to bring a chair, a low red rocker. You can't sit in these small bamboo chairs. I wondered where the rest were. Only Jo. present. Then I spied mother in lavender and pink print. ""Now I can find out where the rest are."" Mother tells me she had come down for baby chits. She could then get gifts for new children. She told me all the rest had been invited to a big dinner and wouldn't be coming. I said we had much food ready and what should we do with it? ""Why aren't Jo. and I invited?"" ""I thought they wouldn't have room for all and their own family too."" Then I ate a thick chicken sandwich and said I'd like half a one of beef."

J. says I did and continues re: her plans. The mailman comes and mother takes a large parcel from him. At first I think it's a letter for M. and why is mother opening it, but it is the large package whose condition she's examining. It is J's bed cover. I think it's big enough for a mattress. Mother asks me, ""If J. is going, you come and sleep with the little boys, you won't mind will you?"" I say, ""but I do mind. The boys are too old now."" ""Where were you sleeping, J.?"" ""In the attic, it's pretty cold up there."""

R. said he turned down one of her ideas. I asked her what she planned to write. She said she was going to look over some old letters. I said I couldn't because mine were up attic. Thought of asking for access. Thought I might find something to use in Little Foreign Devils, a child's story I had written. R. advised me not to as he wouldn't take it.

At last told we'd find Ishizawa at dining room door. It was in the basement. I said, ""I've been there before. I know the way."" We went down. No Ishizawa, but we went in and sat at the table. I sat next to a large fat man, the others across the table. Two little girls in pink dresses were between me and the end of the table. Then I asked the nearest child if it was her first year. ""Here, yes."" But she had been in Chefoo. ""You wanted an American school."" ""Yes."" ""Is the other girl your sister?"" ""No, but she has been with us a long time. Her mother died and mine took her."" I see Miss W. get up and carry plate to kitchen at right. Other persons have plates with rice topped with tomato. I have none. I go to kitchen, find a whole row of waitresses eating. I complain, ""I've had nothing, not one thing to eat."" At last one gets up. I return to table. Child has no knife.

I protested and she thanked me for helping her clean. I remembered I had picked up small objects from the floor. There was a half-filled glass of water at my place. She brought me a well-browned piece of chicken on a long roll. It tasted good even if I had nothing to put on bread. I mustn't eat butter.

Realize I'm not talking to him but to a woman in a homoluu, flowered pattern, his nurse? I go on telling her about my nose. ""It's stuffy, especially in the early morning and when I clear it out, it bleeds half the time. I think my ear and nose must be connected. Which medicine I'm taking might cause it? I get no answer and angrily complain."
"444"	"(05/13/61)"	"I go to call knock on door. K.W. comes and tells me they're coming to cut off a room from the living room (as in sketch). I ask how doors will be set.

I see him bending over it before sitting down. I start to eat the vegetable, which is now spinach and which leaves an uncomfortable feel, and little taste in my mouth."
"447"	"(05/20/61)"	"Miss W. told me to do my hair another way. I angrily resorted it was none of her business. She had no right to direct us as if we were children. If she continued to do so, I would complain to the board."

I pick up machine or typewriter, one full or empty bag and try to get a long piece of tape but can't break it loose. Look over the banisters down three flights of stairs and see boys coming up. One has a knife and cuts the tape. I wind it up asking one of them to hold the bag so I can. One asks if I haven't something for him. Can't remember what I had promised. One offers to help me to station. I had wanted to go to toilet first but decided I could wait. Had thought of calling a taxi with so much to take. Wondered why R. had left so much. There were also old garments and an old briefcase, but better then mine, which I didn't take."

Then she got her problem correctly. As she finished each one, she went into another room to put it away. I suggested she'd wait until all were done. We were in another apartment her parents were planning to take. We looked about and she told which room she would have. I asked if she slept in her parents' room now. She said, ""no"", she had her own room. Then we were back in the former room. Her mother told some one I had dinner and supper with them now.

"575"	"(11/10/62)"	"I start downstairs to toilet but decide I should go to my own and stop to tell a maid that I shall be out for lunch. I got up to my room. Another maid is in my room. I tell her I'll not be in for lunch and start to help make bed. There are extra spring and yellow blankets to put on."
"576"	"(11/11/62)"	"While looking over a large scrapbook, I see two cancellations which I say I want because I collect them and I proceed to detach them. One is ""occupation"" and the other star-shaped says, ""victory."" Both are in clear black letters on manila paper."
"577"	"(11/13/62)"	"I saw the train coming. Then we all got on. A lady across the aisle was working on numberous slips of paper about 1 x 2 inches. A man came to help her. He was to take the slips off the train and needed a bag for them. The train didn't start and finally I got up and asked if this wasn't the train for Cedar Rapids. It was."
"578"	"(10/29/62)"	"As I sat at the table, there were no dishes or utensils at my place. I took a piece of bread to spread with potted meat. There was no one at the place next to me. I started to remove the setting to my place, then thought perhaps they wanted me there so mother wouldn't be alone. ...No food. I call to F. at end of table but it is hard to make him hear but finally he passes me a heaping dish of rice sprinkled with red peppers, etc. As I eat large pieces of red and green gelatin appear."
"579"	"(11/15/99)"	"Talking to Miss. W. She complains she can't hear. I tell her she should wear her hearing aid all the time. I get tired standing over her all the time which seems to be the only time she hears me."
"580"	"(11/21/62)"	"But I should be paid after January 1st if I still work. He told me, ""You almost got moved to another island but weren't."" ""Then I'll still have work here?"" ""But Canton wants you."" ""That wouldn't do. I know no Cantonese at all."""

"582"	"(11/27/62)"	"The baby was picked up by a strange man at the post office. When I began to undo the bundle, I found it was only a big white sheet around a three-month-old baby who looked bluish and began to cry."
"583"	"(11/28/62)"	"When I went into the dining room, a table for six decorated with colored flowers was set up in the living room. There were muddy-looking place cards but I couldn't read the names. I went to a larger table outside and asked Miss W. if there was room for all of us. ""No."" ""Are there place cards here?"" I ask. ""No, I had no money for that."" I explain I had gone in for a book and finally sit down at the larger table for she would have set up place cards for her pets. Some one comes in and says Miss Hens. had passed away. I am surprised because I had seen her well the evening before. I start to eat nuts and another person repeats the news. Miss W. points to another table where two men sit although it is not set and says, ""Others can sit there. The tables are decorated for Thanksgiving."" But it is the Sunday after."
"584"	"(12/01/62)"	"Then I asked if she would like to see my Chinese chessboard and I went upstairs to hunt for it. I found it among some papers and took it down. It didn't look like father's neat copy. Some one must have copied it on this heavy brown paper. Then I asked father about it and he said that the men and board had been given to different ones of us and the last one was L."
"585"	"(12/02/62)"	"She asked us five children (both boys and girls) which was right 4, 5, or 6. The one who guessed right would get 5 x 75 cents. I insisted it was 5, wondering how only one could be right when there were only three possible answers but five children to guess. She gave me the prize and told one of the boys he could keep his dollar and the others could keep lesser amounts. Then it was time to catch our bus which would leave in 20 minutes and it would take 10 or more to make it. I said goodbye and told him to tell his mother goodbye for me. As we walk along I see the yellow and red bus through the green trees. ""Oh, we'll miss it."" ""No, that's going the other way."" When we get on the bus, the conductor asks where we are going. ""To ___?"" ""Yes."" ""To ___?"" ""Yes."" ""Don't keep agreeing. I can't tell which. I said, ""It's the second stop."""

"589"	"(12/12/62)"	"The sun shines in my eyes so I change from the small rocker to the large armchair. I continue correcting the paper but I have only the first sheet so I go to the office for the rest. No one is there so after awhile I pick up and hunt through a pile of papers. They are in alphabetical order but backwards. I find a King but not a King Knip. Quite provoked at the waste of time. At last hear him coming with some other man. Before finding the paper he tells them, ""Wist said there was two ways in which I was better than any of the other teachers. The first I couldn't hear. She whizzes right through things."""
"590"	"(12/14/62)"	"We went on a hike. As we walked along a country road, R said to me, ""You woke us up to go too early. It's only six now."" We walked along further and I looked at my watch. It was still only six. I called back to the priest for the time. He said 6:45. R insisted he had not said it was that late; but I said I plainly heard five. After a bit I asked for the time again. He was now resting with another man on a ledge against a cliff. We said ""8 minutes after 7."" I said that we would have to turn back or be late for breakfast. So we did and I said to J. we'd better get a taxi the first chance we had. He didn't think so. We passed two cars and then four but they weren't taxis. At last we came to some stairs. I said, ""Now I know we're nearly back."" Mother will worry. I didn't tell the nurse we were going. J. said, ""Don't bother about mother. She is selfish, only thinking of herself."" The stairs were pairs. I asked J. which to take. ""Either. Why don't you start up?"" ""You go first."" I think he is planning to trick me."
"591"	"(12/15/62)"	"We were at a restaurant, H. A. and I. I started to speak to H. who had papers spread on the table before me but she said, ""I am talking"" and when I stood before her waiting to speak, she repeated, ""Even if you keep standing there, I am still talking."" I feel hurt but sat down waiting to be served and trying to catch a waitress's eye to tell her I had no dessert. Several people pass by before a waitress comes and I can tell her."
"592"	"(12/18/62)"	"We were going to Hilo. Only 25 minutes left and I had to finish dressing and see the doctor. I open a door. A strange man is within. I apologize and tell him to go out, find Dr.'s office but he is not in. I must go to the beat; but what shall I do? I have no medicine and we'll be gone several days. Maybe I could write and ask him to sent the prescriptions."
"593"	"(12/18/62)"	"Our family is going on a picnic. I must change from my blue velvet dress. Others come in dressed up. ""I thought you'd be wearing slacks and muumuus. Well I'll wear my red and black print."""

When the second one's turn is over I tell him to go outdoors and play a marble game by himself. The youngest will join him. They go out in the bright sunlight."
"595"	"(12/21/62)"	"I am working with L.K. at analyzing our records in our research. I show another person a pencil stub, saying ""See what he gave me to work with"" and pick up to use instead a well-sharpened red pencil."
"596"	"(12/29/62)"	"Several of the ladies were sitting around reading newspapers but my copy was gone. I asked each one if she had it but none had. Mrs. Hens. said she had borrowed mine but had returned it. I was irritated and scolded her for taking it before I had read it. Finally I found Mrs. Bell had it and she returned it to me. I had my purse under a box of candy and put the newspaper on top. It was 7:45 almost time for breakfast but first there was a meeting. Beyond the folding doors several were seated in a semicircle waiting for the meeting. Then he (an unidentified friend) came to take me to the program. He remarked on my green dress and then said, ""I like dresses."" ""Then you should go to a country where men wear skirts."" He started to get us seats on the right side of the hall but I said that on account of my deaf ear, I wanted to sit on the other side so my good ear would be toward the speaker. He told me to find our seats. I found seats in the balcony on the far left side. Waved to him. Some one had put a hat on the seat next to ours to hold it and as he joined me, a family of four or five came in pushing us over too far so we went two rows further front and found seats."
"597"	"(01/03/63)"	"The little girl was showing a colored Christmas picture and talking about it to her mother. I thought she might like to see my book of religious pictures and went to the bookcase to look for it but first picked out three or four photo albums and one of them of snaps I didn't recognize I decided to throw away."
"598"	"(01/04/63)"	"There were three or four green plants in my room, gifts or put there by management. I neither thought them pretty nor wanted them. I was waiting at the bus stop on my way to a university convocation and was wearing academic regalia. A woman put on my cap and wanted me to wear the tassel on the left. I said that side was only until degree was granted. I would wear it on the right. She continued to urge her point but I said I must follow the University's rule not her request. More people came to the bus stop. I kept losing and finding my handbag, newspaper, etc. Then some one produced a corset and asked if it were mine. I couldn't see how I could have lost it but examined it carefully."
"599"	"(01/05/63)"	"I heard that I was listed on the commencement program to receive a master's degree. I already had an M.A. so it should be a Ph.D. In a car with several others. Told the child to come to the program at 3 p.m At home with a crowd of guests. One woman is writing at a yellow table on which is a white runner. I tell her to remove the cloth as it would be easier to write on the bare surface. She asks which woman here had the largest family. I point to Mother and say, ""Your hostess. She had 8 children, 7 are still living, and she had 35 great-grandchildren."
"600"	"(01/06/63)"	"I was visiting friends. They were going to put on a show. Stat was drawing a plan of the grounds. ""There's a tree there,"" said her mother. As Stat finished, I said, ""You are quite an artist, but where is it? That's not your court."" There were purple violets in her plan. ""No, it is ___ school,"" she said. I ask, ""When are we to go?"" ""At a quarter to six?"" ""But it is 6:05 now."" ""No, just six."" ""No, 6:05."" So I start to dress, going to the bathroom and locking the door. Just as I was about to use the toilet, I see the door open and Stat about to enter. Tell her to come on in; it is all right for us both. Start to get dress to wear but as I reach for russett dress, the others tumble on the floor. Stat starts out door with a baby in her arms. I ask George if Alma has gone already. He tells me that she is in the hospital with pneumonia."
"601"	"(01/08/63)"	"I fall off the boat but float with a camera on my breast trying to take pictures as a lifeboat approaches to rescue me. Then I am taken to receive third polio immunization. This time the doctor puts drops up my nose instead of giving me a swallow. Dr. asks me to give him a ____. I think he means to spit up phlegm, but he says, ""Your nose is bleeding."" I try to stanch it with paper and see the red stains growing less and less."
"602"	"(01/08/63)"	"I am going with Kay and Ed to look at house they wish to buy. The first one we come to has an AAUW clubhouse on the corner and blacktop paving over the rest of the lot. It won't do as it lacks garden space. I ask how much they'll get from the house they will sell. ""$6,000."" Why so little? Oh yes, it's termite ridden."
"603"	"(01/11/63)"	"There were several bicycles. They were talking of going cycling. I decided I wouldn't go as I never had cycled. I asked L if she had ever seen Betty's Sun, Wind and Cycling.

"606"	"(01/17/63)"	"The nurse said that I was to leave the hospital immediately now that the minor surgery was over and she had called a taxi for me. I saw a car drive up past the door and went out with suitcase but the car was a dray with a blue-lined wagon bed. I said twice that I wanted a taxi. The driver said there was one and pointed it out under the front of the wagon bed. I gave him the address of the K. D. Home and we started off but he took a very round-about way. Upon arrival I asked for my bill. $1.25 but my money was all in my room so I went in for it after protesting it was too high as he need not have taken so long a way. His helper suddenly appearing had helped me off with my suitcase. When I got in Mother asked me what I had been doing for these postals had come. I settled with the driver for $1.00 after hunting through my billfold and then asked for the postals."
"607"	"(01/24/63)"	"Mother was going to do the dishes but first we'd get the dolls dressed. Their dresses should be washed and ironed. Mother said she'd finished with that at 6:50 and that the blue dress didn't need washing. I pointed out three spots on it."

"609"	"(02/01/63)"	"So I could go along on the tour. I ask what means of travel. Three days by steamer, three by train and three by . . . I ask how far by sea. To Trondheim. I think it will be fun to see the finished cathedral and other changes since 1939. Looking off the deck I see a steamer approaching us and aft is Diamond Head, now bluish in color but it seems to be pointing the wrong way."
"610"	"(02/02/63)"	"I am sorting papers and settling things in my new room. I put a scrub brush and other things of some height to make a foundation for a large cardboard box. I pick up a folder and think I must have forgotten it for some time when I find it in two maroon-colored three-cent stamps and I discard the bit of waxed paper in which they were wrapped but I keep a small pad of waxed paper to keep stamps in ... Then M. R. enters and starts our circle meeting. Only R and I are here. Where are the others. I see sewing supplies and think I can't help with that. M.R. tells us she will divide us in groups of four and asks us to come into the other room."
"611"	"(02/07/63)"	"The girl complains to the child of the noise he is making moving chairs and tables around and tells him to leave. I explain that he has settled down now and can stay. I try to continue reading to her but she wants to do other things first. I tell her I get tired waiting for her, then she gets so impudent that I turn her across my knee and spank her. After a few hits, I lift her skirts."
"612"	"(02/08/63)"	"At league meeting, making plans. They say when the new religious director, Miss Bayliss, comes she wants the church and League entirely separate."

"615"	"(02/12/63)"	"He brings two pieces of wrapping paper for my small boxes and suggests ones for this box but I show him it is the larger box. Trim one piece of paper and start to wrap my round inlay box. I say its contents will have to be rearranged. Then it is full of small stones and bits of lava. Couldn't the stones by thrown away? I don't want that box wrapped now. It has my keys in it and I don't want to move the keys lest I forget where they are."
"616"	"(02/13/63)"	"Something about hats."
"617"	"(02/16/63)"	"Trying to find way to bus stop through courtyards and narrow streets."
"618"	"(02/19/63)"	"I have been sent to a woman doctor. She gives me a prescription and takes my blood pressure but does not tell me what it is. I should know so I can tell my own doctor on next appointment. She tells me to get my x-ray from Dr. A."
"619"	"(02/21/63)"	"I am reading my newspaper. Mrs. Martin points to sections on floor and wants me to take them but they aren't my mess. The librarian has a list of missing magazines. I offer her my psychological ones. I go to the auditorium to a lecture but a dog on the stairway keeps blocking my way. When I reach the lobby, I see it is after six. I must be late and opening the door I see the janitor is cleaning. I am too late. It is 6:45 as I leave. If I don't get a bus soon I'll walk to King Street. Near the bus stop are two rows of people; in front are all small children. But as this isn't the stop, I start walking to King Street but I'm not on the main road and this one is blocked with trucks and men building the road. I get by and three men join me and we hunt the way to the main road but have to leap ditches, climb ruins, and still don't get to the road. Then we see a gray-haired old man with a scanty beard with his head and hands through a stone disk and near him are three dead bodies."
"620"	"(03/01/63)"	"I went to the other court to tell guests we could play tennis now. I hoped he (Fo) would ask me to be his partner but he'd probably ask one of the two women seated at either end of the court. One was rather fat. (LG)"
"621"	"(03/03/63)"	"I noticed the few poinsettias growing higher against the wall were white but all those lower down were red. It must be the former are shaded by the eaves. Then I noticed some youths were trying to plant more white ones in the crevices of the wall. I noticed table companions were being served pancakes as dessert. I declared I wanted some too. Pouring some powder into milk, too much. Couldn't stir it all in. Must add water, a little wouldn't hurt. H. wanted the window open. Handed me a small rock to prop it up. The woman with a baby to whom I handed it tried to put it on the sill but it rolled to the edge. Then she put the baby's arms through holes in a turkish towel so he wouldn't feel cold and he was delighted."
"622"	"(03/12/63)"	"After I left the AAUW meeting, I told my friends the Chinese members were withdrawing to form their own club. Mrs. L.W. came up and I told her I was leaving tomorrow for Iowa City for a medical examination."
"623"	"(03/15/63)"	"I went down a long grassy-lined trench and parked the small car on a gravelly turn into the road. Near the close of the meeting, I passed out long strips of cloth stretching them to extend over the knees of all in each row. People were told to take the roles of one in each pair trying to sell to the other. Two men stood up and tried to sell stock. When the program was finished I thought Kas. was going to take me home. While I was gathering up cartons of supplies I was told he had gone without me. I asked his other passengers if they'd take me. One said, ""We could share a taxi."""
"624"	"(03/22/63)"	"I couldn't make the elevator work. Had trouble first to bring it down and then even when I pressed three buttons, it didn't move. Two men came to help. Then I am walking along a slippery grass path on the high bank of a stream. Then I cross a gravelly field thinking it's lucky I have on my old shoes. I ask the woman with me how much further. Is it to that new building over there? ""Yes."" As we approach I see indications that the field is being prepared for a lawn."
"625"	"(03/24/63)"	"I went to the nurse and told her my deaf ear hurt. She put some drops in. Then I went to three different rooms. One was Miss W's, a large L-shaped one. I thought now she can entertain her brother in her room by screening off one arm of the L. Noting there was still 20 minutes to lunch time, I decided to call on R. When I knocked on her door, she was not dressed but I told her it was Madorah come to call since we no longer shared a room. So she let me in. A plump stranger in a bright colored figured gown was with her. She spoke to R. in Spanish and R. answered to my surprise as I didn't know R spoke Spanish. In the third room were three women. I sat down but soon got up and asked whose room it was. No answer."
"626"	"(03/26/63)"	"I am taking some new medicine in drops and ask if I should take my regular medicine also. ""Yes."" I hunt for it among several small articles and packages of candy, which last I sample as I hunt. When I tell Miss W. I have lost the medicine, she phones to Dr. J. ""That's not my doctor's name."" His daughter answers the phone and the doctor is out. ""I'll see my own doctor tomorrow and I can get the medicine then."""
"627"	"(03/30/63)"	"As J. and I leave the hotel, father tells us to be sure to phone La Grange. J. does. I have a book and my handbag and wonder about the rest of our baggage. Oh it is all in the car. J. is annoyed because they want us to do too much, e.g. a nine-mile hike. I ask if we shouldn't go to eat. ""Yes we three will go to a restaurant."" ""Three?"" I say, ""You and me and this one"" and he points to an 18-year-old boy nearby."
"628"	"(04/03/63)"	"The strange man was to have intercourse with a woman in public. She was shielded by a plastic sheet."
"629"	"(04/04/63)"	"When I got to the clinic, a woman doctor in a light green smock asked me what else I wanted. I answered that I had forgotten to tell Dr. B. I wanted phenobarbital. She gave me a bottle of two kinds of white tablets. I told her he had given me enough other medicine and couldn't take these. They might not go with his. ""He will be gone all February,"" she said. I asked for her bill since the K. D. Home wouldn't like my going to the clinic so soon. Finally she said that the sailor would give me phenobarbital and he did. I went down to pay the bill but they hadn't received it yet so I left my address and told them to be sure to mail the bill to me not to the Home. When I got back to the Home, the doctor came in. We tried to talk in the living room but the other ladies kept interrupting. I showed her my room. She asked how much I owed her and if she could borrow money until that was settled. I demurred thinking I didn't have enough but looked in my billfold and found $3 for her."
"630"	"(04/05/63)"	"Two more sick. Must have caught her illness. I must change the time she was sick to February. One has fever and the other is so cold put her between feather beds."

"633"	"(04/10/63)"	"I asked her where to find a cloth to wipe up what I had spilled when serving her. She started with me to find one."
"634"	"(04/11/63)"	"Now all the people were gone and H. hadn't come for me. Probably she thought Star wouldn't be out so soon. Then the host came and asked me how I was getting home. I said that H. was to have come for me. Perhaps I had better phone and I started to look for a phone. I saw the host and two strangers trying to climb up the steep bank on which the house was built but they could get up only a few feet."
"635"	"(04/11/63)"	"The service ended. I tried to leave but the center aisle was crowded with children and a bench lengthwise in the side aisle was still crowded with street urchins."
"636"	"(04/12/63)"	"I see two red kites caught in a tree. One is shaped like a liner. As J. and I turn into a side road, I point out a path thru the trees we are to take on our return. J. is telling what he would like to eat on his travels. He has had ice cream three or four times a week. I ask, ""Would you prefer pies?"" ""Yes and the crust."" And he names other articles of food but no meat. I ask, ""Don't you care for meat any more?"" ""No."""
"637"	"(04/13/63)"	"Mentioned the seating at a formal dinner party and said it was a long time since I had been to one. A strange woman began to describe one she had attended and the dress of another woman there."
"638"	"(04/14/63)"	"I was to help a student study a test. It disturbed me that the beds were not made yet. Well mine had been made. The pink blanket had been pulled out at the foot when hunting for something. The data for the test was printed on a loose sheet. The girl asked if she could write notes on it. I told her no but that she might borrow the sheet but I wanted it returned. There were four points to be made. Name or purpose of test. I illustrate why the name is not always explicit. If it was called a test of selfishness and you did not want to acknowledge that you were selfish, you would not be honest in your answers. Then we were looking in a large pot of various flowers finding small yellow ones. Then we returned to the test. I asked her if she had studied Tests and Measurements. ""No."" The third point, administration or directions, is discussed. Validity next (But I woke then)."
"639"	"(04/20/63)"	"I went along to help a woman who was taking a number of small children to swim."
"640"	"(04/20/63)"	"As we approached our destination, Mother stood up in the car. I urged her to be careful. She spread a rug over my knees. I was amused that she should do so when we had only a block yet to go."
"641"	"(04/21/63)"	"I moved from one window to the next where there was a larger counter on which to write and on one side of which a woman had laid her baby. I told her to lay the child on hers. I went to lie down myself after lunch. Then I went back to my room but the two beds were unmade, the toilet gone, a chamber pot and slop jar by the door. I wanted to change my dress but I must lock the door since they must have let others use it while I was gone. Where was my key? Then I saw Miss W. in a yellow dress at the door of the room opposite. I called to her, ""My toilet is gone."" But she kept on talking to some woman in the next room. Finally she paid attention to me and said the toilet was full of gravel. I wondered if she was going to blame me. I woke up trying to count in Chinese in both dialects I had known."
"642"	"(04/25/63)"	"We got into the car, three in the back seat, and the driver said, ""Call Mr. Phim. He can sit in the vacant seat by me."" But when he, a thin, dark man, came and was introduced, F. came and where could he ride?"
"643"	"(04/30/63)"	"Mother said she'd be back in ten minutes and I was to fix the beets. I didn't know how for there was a big bowl of sliced red beets, another of peeled whole ones only they were potatoes and some were unpeeled so I peeled one and decided to wait mother's return."
"644"	"(04/30/63)"	"Mother, Mrs. G. and I waited for dinner at a bare table in the rear of the room. At last the waiters finished setting the table for ten at the other end of the room and we move up to take the empty seats on the nearer side. The waiter began calling out the items on a long menu, ""Rice dinner, veal cutlet, chicken cutlet."" I think I'll take the last."
"645"	"(05/02/63)"	"It is noon and I wasn't ready when Mrs. P would call for me. Then I remember she wasn't to come until tomorrow. (She did.)"
"646"	"(01/05/63)"	"[2nd dream] At home with crowd of guests. One woman is writing at a yellow table on whch is a white runner. I tell her to remove the cloth as it would be easier to write on the bare surface. She asks which woman here has the largest family. I point to Mother and say, ""Your hostess. She had 8 children, 7 are still living and she has 35 great-grandchildren."""
"647"	"(03/08/63)"	"Pouring some powder into milk, too much, couldn't stir it all in, must add water, a little wouldn't hurt. ... H. wanted the window open. Handed me a small rock to prop it up. The woman with a baby to whom I handed it tried to put it on the sill but it rolled to the edge. Then she put the baby's arms thru holes in a turkish towel so he wouldn't feel cold and he was delighted."
"648"	"(04/25/63)"	"[2nd dream] Sorting things, ""Where was the wastebasket for these scraps of paper?"" ""At the depot."" ""Why there?"" I'll put them in the box with old ... Then I find an old pogee waist and try it on: but the sleeves are too tight even if I had taken off my other blouse. I ask mother if her arms are thinner. She thinks she could wear the waist but then we find a dirty spot."
"649"	"(05/07/63)"	"I brought a mattress pad to lay on the floor to sleep on since there wasn't room on mother's bed. Mother pointed out place to lay it. I said that I must get my own pillow. She asked when I got such a nice fat one. I told her she had given it to me when I went to China and I had had it refilled there and more recently had it washed at a laundry."
"650"	"(05/07/63)"	"[2nd dream] I remembered the lock of my door had sounded differently so returned to my room to check but went first to the door beyond mine. My key went in but there was no knob to press to relock it. Realized I was at wrong door and went to my own and relocked it."
"651"	"(05/08/63)"	"I was working a crossword puzzle, had solved one long word down and three across."
"652"	"(05/13/63)"	"At last the service came to an end. I could hear the singing of two stanzas of well-known closing hymn but then the other two stanzas were mixed in one and I couldn't tell which words were being sung. We closed with the Mizpah benediction. Now I walked down to meet my Hayes cousin's son, introducing myself by name. I said he would not remember me well. He said, ""No, I was such a tiny tot when you visited us."" Then I saw a little 5-year-old girl in a blue dress and asked, ""Is it your daughter?"" ""Yes."" Then we talked about why we had come to the islands. He said he had to be careful about stairs. I asked how he had managed the big flight of stairs to the entrance. The elevator came down to the basement which could be entered by a side door. We talked about elevators. Then I pointed to the house across the street and said, ""That is where I live."""
"653"	"(05/21/63)"	"Entering my room, I try to turn on the overhead light but it flashed on for only a second and then went off. I tried it again and then another light and then my old table light. No good, I must tell them. I go out and look for the books I had laid on a table outside. Ask several people about them and see several piles of old books but not mine. Who could have taken them? I see a little girl throw something on the floor. I go to her, rest my hand on her shoulder and sternly say, ""Pick it up."" Repeat 3 or 4 times until she does. ""Now throw it in here."" She reluctantly obeys."
"654"	"(05/26/63)"	"(I seemed to be reading this dream. All persons were strangers, and even the reader was not surely myself) ... I (?) was on an open loft with two men. I feared them. One stood unsteadily on the edge and I pushed him over. When the other man returned, I said to him, ""Mr. _ had a fall and when he went to see to him, I ran down the stairs out the back door and away turning at every corner so he wouldn't know which way to go to overtake me. The streets looked as if seen in a chart."
"655"	"(06/02/63)"	"Talking with __ about a plate. It had an elaborate inch-wide gold border, and cost $4. I tell of my plates with narrow gold border, forget what became of them.

I am looking at a very poorly written page, give up and say, ""Let me speak to Miss Yamamura."""
"657"	"(06/06/63)"	"I began to distribute the bathing suits to my family (?) two men and three women. Gave the first woman a wrinkled pink suit. When I came to the men found stiff white brassieres in their suits. At first threw them away, then thought they might be changed to eyeshades for Miss Couch. Went back to find suits but couldn't find them."

"662"	"(06/14/63)"	"[2nd dream] As I got out of the ricsha, a button came off the lap robe and I handed it to Dr. C. who pulled the ricsha to the side of the road just outside the gate. As we went in, he said, ""I thought we might have a swim. We passed thru Uluniu and then Outrigger for I now belong to that club. Dr. C. asks for the Waikiki room and is told it hasn't yet been cleaned. Very few on the beach but I can go to my dressing stall and sign for Coales as my guests. A woman brings me a board on. I do and ask where to sign for my guests. I have trouble getting into the pants of my two-piece suit, finish after leaving stall. I haven't my dark swimming glasses with me and the light hurts my eyes."
"663"	"(06/15/63)"	"She said I had been talking as if I read a book. R said she knew that was so. I said yes, I had written a book about my childhood in China and has based talks on it. Then they asked about differences in China. (I forget the rest.)"
"664"	"(06/16/63)"	"I was told, ""On your paper, the Haole child is calm, you had better add ""when"" before the first word."
"665"	"(06/19/63)"	"I had worked a crossword puzzle all the horizontal words but not the vertical and couldn't find the definitions for the vertical words. I hunted thru a pile of clothes. I hunted thru the book and found some puzzles I had skipped. Then I saw six nails in the wall on which R had hung some shoes in bags. I knocked off one and hung up my shoes. I wished I had a place to put things, had two or three garments in my arms. Told mother R shouldn't have driven in the nails since it was against the rules."
"666"	"(06/20/63)"	"Then I saw Mr. K. and asked him to help me hang my pictures. He thought two others ought to be moved to make better balance. There were many pictures on a long, low wall. The hangers were sticky tape that peeled off and yet stuck again when the pictures were moved, but those on one picture were wearing out so I cut some off from an extra long piece on another picture. When Mr. K. finished and all the pictures were hung, I started off to take the bus. I walked along over a gravelly waste."
"667"	"(06/23/63)"	"Mrs. Ch. was looking for the old magazines to be thrown away. I pointed to the carton. People were in the way but at last she found it. I could see on the top carton ""July 2"" in big letters on the red and black cover."
"668"	"(06/22/63)"	"Mrs. St. left a roll of napkins on the ironing board. At last I decided to do my handkerchiefs and lifted off her clothes. I first ironed a couple of red-bordered napkins and then began on the handkerchiefs."

"670"	"(06/27/63)"	"[2nd dream] So I went to the dining room barefooted carrying two pairs of shoes. Found my place at the table but no one brought me anything to eat although I was only a little bit late. I complained to Mrs. McC. ""Could I go to the kitchen at the far end of the dining room and ask for food?"" She said she had better go and started but some woman in white across the table stopped her to talk. I grew more and more impatient and again interrupted them to insist that I was hungry. I had come as quickly as I could, even barefooted and hadn't heard the bell. Would I have to go to the restaurant?"
"671"	"(07/01/63)"	"Three bells or breakfast rang and we went into the dining room but the girls were still setting the tables. I saw a plate with two pieces of bread on it and said, ""That must be mine."" Took it and went to the toaster but it was gone. Girls said it had been taken away. There were hot rolls but I complained that I preferred toast."
"672"	"(07/02/63)"	"J got in line first and I second for tickets for the boat ride. Others came. H or R told us it was 12 cents to ride out to the ship. She told us how to go to the pier. We waited a long time and I sat down in a chair. At last the man came and said we need to pay now but finally said the 12 cents would clinch the bargain for the longer ride. H paid him for her two daughters and husband. When I started to the pier, I missed my brown handbag. Where had I had it last? It was Sunday at church."
"673"	"(07/04/63)"	"At one side of the room were piles of clothing. I asked how many psychotics were in the room. He and I were looking over her record. He said we could combine bits of it to make a better article, omitting much. She has much to say of her bag and yours. If she has an old bag we could use it when reporting. ""Yes, I used to wear my mandarin robe when asked to talk on China, as often happened when I first returned from there."""
"674"	"(07/06/63)"	"The blue paper was a form for nominating a new president for Simpson College as the present one had resigned so the paper said. I could think of no suitable person. I asked an alumnus if the president must be a Methodist. He didn't know. We then noticed little packets under certain questions marked, ""Do not open."" We felt them. Must be full of slips, votes of others."
"675"	"(07/07/63)"	"I asked his wife if I could see J. ""He is talking with two men."" I will wait. She didn't seem to want me to ...I asked J. if I could go with him and the other man. So I followed. It seemed as if we got into a small boat, yet we were walking. ...A man and I hid in a vacant house but one day a furniture van came and we knew we would have to leave. We went to make plans. One of the men on the truck said we could go in here so we went in by the closed door. (July 8-12 dreamed but forgot as I woke.)"
"676"	"(07/13/63)"	"I put drops in the sore eye while a child watched. Marg. Str. said, ""We have decided to file it under La Ruth."" I don't think she'll find it then. At first I am puzzled but then I know she is talking about the paper Jean wrote. We discuss it but differ as to its significance and the mental health of the subject and writer of the paper."
"677"	"(07/14/63)"	"As I finish dressing, I begin to work a long division problem."
"678"	"(07/15/63)"	"Hunting for a dress in my closet, push aside three gaily-colored prints. I want one to wear when working. Where is that red and white seersucker? Would that green dress do? I say to my roommate, ""I will put this box (small, round, blue and white) on the dresser. It had been bare but now there were several bottles and a couple of refrigerator dishes containing food on it. Now I am emptying a chest, lay out hangers and hang the dresses as I take them out but decide to leave the linen and other things in the chest."
"679"	"(07/16/63)"	"She said Hall no longer lived there. I asked where then and we went to that house and found Hall, a redhead wearing a uniform on which was much gold braid. Yes, he was Hall but I asked for initials and learned he was the son of the man I wanted. Some talk about how well I knew his mother."
"680"	"(07/18/63)"	"The man at the counter turned and asked me why I didn't sit down. I said I was just waiting for the clerk to be thru waiting on him. Soon the clerk was thru and checked out my piece of pumpkin pie. As we walked out he remarked on the weather. I said, ""Yes, it's just like a spring day."""

"684"	"(07/26/63)"	"Mother and I were starting off to look at houses. I remarked a three-bedroom house was needed, one bedroom for the boys, one for the girls.

"687"	"(08/01/63)"	"She told him to bring back my chair instead of the one I was in as I wasn't feeling well. So he brought the green chair. I said all the others were too deep for me. When I sat in the green chair, it rocked so far back that I almost tipped over."

"689"	"(08/05/63)"	"As I started out to teach my class, I realized I had left my notes and it was too late to return for them. What should I do? I could tell them about the percentages of each family member in my dreams. Started for former classroom to find my class had been moved to another room. Went there and students came in until the room was crowded. Two got very noisy running about and I opened the door and told them to get out. I began my talk by explaining briefly why the percentages of each member of my family differed in my dreams. Didn't give exact figures except the 41 percent of unpleasant ones for L. The room and number present changed more than once. Then I asked the students if they dreamed of their family members. Only one woman responded. I couldn't hear her very well and asked if that were her family. ""Yes, in England,"" she replied."
"690"	"(08/12/63)"	"About a dozen visiting women sitting around. Several especially friendly, talking to me. I noticed the clock said 10. I said, ""Sorry ladies, it is 10 p.m. and we are supposed to be in our rooms by 9 p.m. so goodnight."" I start upstairs wondering why the nurse had not sent them home. But in another room upstairs I hear singing and dancing. As I reach the upper hall, I hear someone walking below and look down the stairwell but the walker is out of sight. I enter a bathroom but a boy is trying to get in thru the curtain and I push him back."
"691"	"(08/12/63)"	"What can I do with this heavy pack of old magazines? Perhaps under the bed. A woman and a small boy enter. He tries to play under my chair. I push at him with my foot and tell him to go to his mother at the far end of the car."
"692"	"(08/13/63)"	"We should start for the church supper. It is almost six. They didn't want to leave the other affair. Finally J. started with me. As we walked along the dirt road, Misses Weeks and Cun. in a car passed us. J left me half way. I started in the side door of the parish house then to the front. There were very few at the tables. Trays of food were being brought in. I got a glass filled with water to take to my place. Glasses were on a cart. A passing child grabbed a glass and sipped from it. I told her she shouldn't take from the cart. The water was mine."
"693"	"(08/14/63)"	"Perhaps he can tell us where the Manoa bus leaves Waialae. ""Don't disturb him. He's reading the paper."" But I did ask him and told the couple they could go on the Manoa bus as far as 10th Avenue and then it would not be far to walk the rest of their way."
"694"	"(08/17/63)"	"I brought back the red wastebasket and set it near my chair and told them to leave it there. We had no other at the end of our room. There were men and women in the circle. ...We searched in the pile of clothing and I pulled out a dress. This must be the one the woman was hunting. Feeling in the pockets, I found a rag doll. Yes indeed, this must be her dress. Here is her baby's toy. Then I told the woman, ""I don't see Dean Wist. It is 9:20. Can you be ready by a quarter of?"" She was sorting a pile of clothes."

I come back again but she's gone. ...Showing off my long shoehorn ...At a Chinese restaurant with two women. Waiter comes. Neither want rice but I do and I say so but the waiter has gone leaving a bowl with one grain of rice in it. Why don't they bring us something to eat."
"697"	"(08/25/63)"	"At the next table I hear someone say something about potato chips. I go over and pick up a chip to sample. She said, ""That's not the one. Take this half size."" I did. Later she brought the other chip. I ate both thinking it wouldn't hurt even if I shouldn't eat salt. ...Taking my clothes from the line to carry upstairs. ...In the hall I am directed to one of three empty seats but that is in the wrong direction for my good ear."

"699"	"(08/27/63)"	"I was reading an article about an army post and why it was so well liked. Forgot all but the end where it said ...""and when your children go to college, a complete new outfit for them."" I wondered if that was only for officers."

Then she said something about Mr. Cassels. I saw the name in large white letters and told her so but asked if she hadn't meant Mr. Castle."
"701"	"(08/30/63)"	"[2nd dream] My guest kept asking if I had certain articles of food for dinner. Carrots would be so good. I told her I had my groceries delivered because the nearest grocery was down that hill and it was too steep to climb carrying much of a load. We sat but all I had was coffee and toast. I looked in the refrigerator for fruit and jams but there was only slices of chicken in it. I asked the young boy to pass on the jam he was digging into."
"702"	"(09/01/63)"	"The tables were cleared. I asked Miss W. if I could have some pancakes if there were any left. No one had knocked to awaken me. She questioned that but said I could have something to eat in that corner."
"703"	"(09/02/63)"	"I tipped out the anagram letters and fragments of wood on the table. I wanted to build the word ""Remember"" but the letters had disappeared. She told me to look in the box I had emptied."
"704"	"(09/05/63)"	"I should have bid her goodbye before I left K.D. Home. Now I can trim my hair myself again since I won't see Miss Per."
"705"	"(09/07/63)"	"Awakened by Mrs. Chal. and her grandniece as they left. I came down for breakfast and hunted thru a pile of magazines for something to read. Mrs. McC sitting by stove said how nice I looked and asked me to come nearer. She said one of the board had said they wanted the ladies to get out and have a good time and hoped I would go to a school children's exhibit on Saturday. I told her I had three engagements; church bazaar 10 to 4, Star luncheon at noon out in the country, and another. I was looking at a map of Civil War times, Confederates in gray, rest in green. But why no breakfast. Saw clock read 6:35. Wasn't it breakfast time yet? If it was an hour yet, I would return to my room. One of the ladies told me my red-patterned dress was very pretty."
"706"	"(09/08/63)"	"Looking down into the pit, I saw in the bottom what looked like a big poached egg. Walking past a second time I tried to see it again."

"708"	"(09/10/63)"	"[2nd dream] I came to the table set up on the lanai Sunday eve. The rest had eaten and complained that I hadn't told them I'd not be there. I said I had told Mrs. M. and the waitresses but then I saw my orange and sandwich in a white bowl and said I must have forgotten for I took my supper. Then I found that they had been at my things opening cans etc. From one I took a cookie. I complained they had no right to do so and tried to fit lids on again. Asked about a can of tea on my shelves which was not mine."
"709"	"(09/15/63)"	"My door was open again. I tried to close it but couldn't so the latch would click. Decided to lock it even if it was against the rules. Then I went to the bathroom. My towels were gone and I couldn't dry my hands. Complained to X. She said Mrs. Wilson had taken them to wash, why not? Didn't I put them in the Home's wash? Not when they were mine. I had lost a pillowslip by doing so."
"710"	"(09/17/63)"	"When we returned, I went into the dining room for my mail. There was an envelope containing two reprints on language. The author seemed to think Hawaiians didn't use English. I asked if the Scotalene I received would be Scotland in Hawaiian."
"711"	"(09/19/63)"	"(Answering her) I never add salt at the table since the doctor told me in '43 to go slow on salt and that way I can eat most things as served and my blood pressure has been under control most of the time."
"712"	"(09/19/63)"	"[2nd dream] We'll have the leftovers for a picnic. So I took her around to the different tables and we picked up for her plate two kinds of cheese, peanut brittle, and a leg of fried chicken. She turned down the soda crackers."
"713"	"(09/21/63)"	"I asked him to whom to send the letter re the dispute between Joe Atherton and ___. He said to them. I said then I'll have to use ditto. Typing would be best for that but I prefer to write. Hunt for paper."
"714"	"(09/21/63)"	"[2nd dream] We went out for the picnic. We came around the bushes and the sun was too bright. We went up under the trees. We placed a piece of canvas on the grass. I sat down on it and began to unpack."
"715"	"(09/25/63)"	"Mrs. McC. was passing down the aisle pouring a yellow liquid into our paper cups. She passed me up. The man in front said sincere, his wife said sincerity. Mrs. McC. having served all went to a table at the left rear and poured herself a big glass. She told me to pour myself a drink. That wasn't enough for this had seemed to be a rite."
"716"	"(09/29/63)"	"His name is Welsh they say. I suggest, ""Ian."" He asks, ""Has the S. M. society sent to Congress yet?"" I say that I think that group has dissolved. Then we notice through the picture window a crowd by the tracks waiting for the first bus. It comes and a large woman in an elaborate hat and several men in uniform get on. ""Which language is hardest to learn?"" ""No difference in the languages, only in the learner. My pitch discrimination is poor so I have trouble with French. Chinese is a tonal language. When I taught in China I must have made many funny errors."""
"717"	"(10/02/63)"	"Up Manoa Valley would be a good investment."
"718"	"(10/03/63)"	"My friend and I got in the car. She spoke of an old building. He said that was before my time. I thought Dr. And was older than that; but looking at the man more closely, I saw that it wasn't Dr. And though it looked like him, redheaded also; perhaps it was his son. Two more strange men came. Where could they sit in this small car? Then I saw two women in chairs beside us. I thought I'd read my paper but then a girl was passing refreshments. She gave me a rich cake. I wondered who our host was. There were other delicious-looking refreshments. The girl told me one was a peanut butter kind. I asked for its recipe. Then a man brought some 4' by 1' pieces of toast and some cheese. I tore off a similar length of cheese."
"719"	"(10/06/63)"	"I was relieved to see Mrs. Brown at the next table since I was to join a group of four women who were to cook and eat together. Mrs. Brown explained to me that the paln was that each of us would take turns a day at a time. My turn would come next Thursday. I was worried since I am not much of a cook and wondered what they'd want for breakfast, asked for a recipe. Well I'd have four days to observe what the others prepared."
"720"	"(10/07/63)"	"He and I found places together at the table. I found I had no water, then that there was water poured into a small cut-glass sugar bowl with scalloped edges. Our hostess passed the plate of small cakes again. There were just enough for us six but when I took one, a second piece stuck to it. One piece was chocolate and mussed up my fingers."
"721"	"(10/14/63)"	"Opening the hall closet door, there were lots of swords, slender rods, etc. piled in a corner. My pink crepe dress was on the floor. I picked it up and my small scissors. I asked R. why. She said Coco Young had demanded it. Coco had just been married and moved in."
"722"	"(10/15/63)"	"The bus had stalled and I asked a woman if they were going to send a taxi for us. She said no. I hadn't far to go but I couldn't remember at which part of the beach I was to meet Cara Y. I started off and saw the boy (her son?). We went on together. He told me about the funny plates his mother was bringing. We met her and went to a bathhouse and on the wooden table set out our picnic. She passed out large yellow vinyl plates, dishing out something on each. I thought my portion too small and she gave me more. I arranged loose leaves, pages 7, 9, 11 and 13 in my library book and asked her when she was leaving for Japan. ""In February,"" and she talked of her teaching here. Then we began to pack up to go home."
"723"	"(10/18/63)"	"As I finished packing the hats, she came up and said she wanted to put some books also in the crate. I told her I was afraid they'd crush the hats but picked up the little telescope and told her to put all she wanted in it showing her it would go in the crate even if opened out to its fullest."
"724"	"(10/20/63)"	"The man reached up to catch the boy on the roof but he got away."

"728"	"(10/25/63)"	"Thinking how I could manage to get around the rule to take effect January 1 that any woman at the home must always have another with her whenever she went out. I couldn't get to the University to read then. I decided to write to Mrs. Bak. and began to plan the letter."
"729"	"(10/26/63)"	"But this hymn doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Negro problem as I thought all in the book did, so I turned back to reread the preface."

When the waitress came near again, I told her I had no ice cream. As she went to get some, I told her I also had no water. She said I'd been away so I didn't get any water and should have milk instead. I protested that I had not been away and that I never got milk."
"731"	"(10/29/63)"	"We were sitting in a circle and were to read a verse around from the Bible. I was slow opening my Bible and Father sitting next to me showed me the passage in Ephesians but I couldn't find it and he nodded to the next to read but she sang something instead. I explained my slowness in locating passage by the fact that I had forgotten that my Bible contained the Apochrypha. I started to church but when I got there it was entirely empty. As I had stopped to talk, I was 15 minutes late. I went to the Parish House and found some people there. The leader said there were no more classrooms but groups met in different parts of the auditorium."
"732"	"(10/29/63)"	"[2nd dream] Get ready and we'll go for a ride so I started to toilet but a young boy did too so I waved him on and went downstairs to look for the Bible I had left there. When I came back and got in the toilet, I couldn't do anything and the door was open. I asked the boy standing there looking at me not to watch and I'd get through sooner."
"733"	"(10/30/63)"	"I pressed the switch as I entered the dark room but the light didn't go on and I walked about the room trying three other switches with no result; but the table light was on. Then she came in and turned on the overhead light. I asked where the switch was and she showed me. It was a different kind that I hadn't recognized as such."

Each was telling who they were. He was English born but came from Indiana. I told the class the text would be Hart's Sociology, but I couldn't remember the rest of the title. It was 4:45 and the class began to disperse although the time wasn't up. I went to the bookcase to hunt for a book needed as the text but couldn't find it."
"737"	"(11/--/63)"	"I fixed my plate with rice and meat paste then began to play cards. One person was missing. ""Whose turn?"" I am No. 8 so it must be one's. ""She's gone."" A baby calls her mother. ""You play this hand and I'll take her turn next."" The older woman sits down and begins to shuffle cards, two decks together. I call her attention to that and go to look for my plate. Can't find it in the refrigerator. Take out a slice of cold ham. Hear some one say she wasn't a star so I remind her that when she and I got ready together, she combed my hair."

Breakfast was over. I go to ask Miss M. for something to eat but she hurries off. Will see me later. A Chinese girl invites me to her room. I go in and she tells me she has been here only four days. A young man comes bringing a large package. I tell her I'm hungry. Must find Miss M. and get something to eat. Will visit her another time. I go in search of Miss M. thinking when she called me, if she did, she didn't notice I failed to answer."
"740"	"(11/24/63)"	"""But I liked the old house better."" And I like this one. The rooms in the wing that you rented to that couple, whose name I can't remember would make a nice suite for you when H. marries and she could live in the rest of the house."

"746"	"(12/07/63)"	"The tube was too long for him. We asked her to chop it short with her ax so that he would stick out at both ends. We indicated three knobs as the line to cut. When she did his feet were cut off. He complained that he couldn't play football now. I suggested that as quarterback he could call the plays."
"747"	"(12/02/63)"	"As I finished, I came downstairs. He followed and called me back to answer some questions. First where were you born? I said, ""Shanghai."" Then he asked re my attitude to Hitler and the Germans."
"748"	"(12/09/63)"	"I counted out my wash: 4 pillowslips, 2 sheets, 2 dresses, 2 handkerchiefs, 12 wash clothes and stuffed them all into one of the navy-blue pillowslips. Some one was using the machine so I put my wash in a corner and went to the dining room to ask for water. The waitress took a sip from my glass of tomato juice and took it away to get another glass. When could I wash? How could my clothes dry today since it was already quite late Saturday afternoon and Miss W. won't permit clothes hanging on the line on Sunday."
"749"	"(12/16/63)"	"The smaller girl, a blond in pink, was carried in to take part in the pageant. The taller brunette began to cry and say she wouldn't take part because she should have been first.

"753"	"(12/20/63)"	"The yardman burst into the room where we were dressing. He wanted something but couldn't name the article properly. With the aid of his gestures, we learned he wanted a dishcloth. We told him he'd have to ask Miss W. for it. Looking over my clothes, I found a panty girdle I had forgotten I had. We went to the dining room. I caught on another resident's green net dress. It didn't seem to be torn but I told her of how torn my green lace had been before it was noticeable. Then I put some things in a chest but left out one article. Asked why, I said it was not mine. I'd leave it out for the owner to find. Then I asked Mrs. St. if she had stayed until the promised carolers arrived."
"754"	"(12/28/63)"	"I tore off a bit of paper and voted ""Yes"" but when I found the question as to whether the AAUW would have no more meetings until fall was worded so that an affirmative vote would mean I agreed to the discontinuance, I wanted to change and went to ask for a ballot but the two tellers had none ready. I went looking for more paper. C.H. said I would find some on her shelves. Looked but found none. I was walking along the verandah and as we turned the corner, I remarked that I didn't remember the verandah ran on all four sides of the house but then we hadn't lived there since I was seven."
"755"	"(12/29/63)"	"But where is my briefcase? I know I brought it. I go back to the door and find I had left it there.

"763"	"(01/08/64)"	"Holding the change, I hurry to the front of the church but there was no plate for offerings there. Going out the side door I tried without result to use a chamber pot pushing it out of sight. I returned by the outer aisle to my pew. Fellow worshipper asked if I was all right now. I was glad she thought I'd left because I felt ill."
"764"	"(01/08/64)"	"[2nd dream] The two rubber dolls will be nice for my youngest grandnieces. I'll give this one with the squeak to the baby, the other to the three-year-old.

At last they were gone and I took my temperature but one thermometer was broken and I had trouble getting the other back in its case. It read 99.2. Perhaps I was getting sick. I started to dress but my girdle was already on. Had I worn it to bed? I looked at the clock: 7:30. At my watch: 7:10. Why, I was too late for breakfast."
"767"	"(01/11/64)"	"This picture is too large to hang there. It will hide the cards on the shelf. It will have to be hung outside."

Go on but ask way of man who points it out ""just over there where a girl is standing in the door, then a little to the right."" About six students and teacher are in the room. I sit in one of the large seats to wait."
"769"	"(01/11/64)"	"[3rd dream] Getting dressed to go with mother to lunch. The shower has some junk in it which I remove. Start showering without closing the door and see L. coming upstairs. It's 11:30. I'll have to hurry. A maid comes in the room and drops towels in the shower so the towel gets too wet to use. I try to dress, use toilet but make little progress. Maid comes in with letters, which she throws into the tub. I tell her to get them out immediately or the ink will run. She picks out a Chinese copybook with large characters. It's Rae's."
"770"	"(01/12/64)"	"The small boy at the foot of the bed kept pulling the blue blanket away from me to wrap himself in. I looked at both clocks. By one it was too early to get up, by the other not. I went to the shower which was different than my former one. Someone wanted me to use her combination soap and washcloth, but I preferred mine."
"771"	"(01/12/64)"	"[2nd dream] Dr. B. said he wanted to give me a trial of no medicine. I said he'd have to let the Home know or they'd insist I keep on until all of an order was gone. He gave me a sample of dark tablets to use instead."

If a baby cries, it disturbs at least one person; and if another baby hears it, it will cry too."" He tries to tell me about the railroad but I have lived here a long time and know the way. So I start out. Look out one door; that's not right, then go out the other and down narrow streets between high walls turning to the left and ahead until the last turn brings me to a street and house I recognize and I go in. It is nearly 11 a.m. and I must get back by noon. I've had no breakfast and the waiters are setting tables, only raisin bread. I take a piece and spread it lightly explaining I had had nothing to eat and was hungry."
"774"	"(01/27/64)"	"The manicurist said I needed calcium for my nails. I tell her Dr. B. is my physician and that the clinic once gave me calcium. She offered me two pills for 25 cents. I consider buying my own and trying to eat cottage cheese. Then I'm at the table and getting a double serving of sliced tomato salad."
"775"	"(01/29/64)"	"I then saw Dr. Brewster sitting on the stone balustrade of the steps to the church. I told him, ""I was interested to read in the Spire that you had preached in Yankton for I am counted as an alumna of the college there although I've never been in South Dakota. I graduated from Fargo College which later was absorbed by Yankton."""
"776"	"(02/01/64)"	"I left the group saying, ""I must take these papers to D. who wants them immediately, but when I entered his room, he was lying on the bed in a dark suit and when I handed him the papers he crumpled them up. I said, ""You wouldn't want to turn them into the board all wrinkled."" He said that wouldn't matter and stuck his elbow thru a sheet."
"777"	"(02/01/64)"	"[2nd dream] The newsboy said he had forgotten the charge for opening an account. I said that I'd sent a check to the office and should have a bill from them and refused to pay the extra amount. He said he wanted pictures of Waikiki. I offered to show him the short cut from my house which was separated from the beach by a single house. So I began hunting for my dark glasses."

"780"	"(02/15/64)"	"I tried to find my friends in the crowded hall, but got a seat in the front row. When the man moved over, I told him I was looking for my handbag. It had considerable money in it. Then I saw one of my friends and asked her if she had seen my bag. No but I had a phone call upstairs waiting for me. I wanted to hear the next speaker. She told me I was to wait until 10 a.m. to phone. The number was 35804. I began to dial it."

"785"	"(03/01/64)"	"There are two papers to pass on, this sheet to teachers and the brochure to parents. I ask if I may take more than one as so many of my brothers and sisters are teachers. Another lady and child enter but there are no empty seats. I point out a sofa filled with dolls and suggest picking up the dolls so they could sit there."

"788"	"(03/02/64)"	"The curtains were blowing against the screens wet with rain. I asked mother if I hadn't better close the window. Then it seemed as if it were too warm and I had better open wider the two opposite windows as we were going out. I went upstairs for my raincoat. My parents and R were ready to go but I had to stop in the bathroom. When done I found they had gone but a short way and were waiting for me. When we got to the bus stop a two-year-old child appeared in father's car. Where did he belong? We asked several people including children in the houses there. The child started walking back. Perhaps he could find his way home."
"789"	"(03/06/64)"	"There will be no congregational singing because there are no hymnbooks in the renovated church. I had been ill and couldn't remember my schedule and where my classes met. But chapel came first so I went there but there was only a priest praying alone. When I returned a woman asked me where she should go to have her son's classes arranged. I asked and learned he was in high school. I told her the secondary school was cross the street but there were grade school buildings also there so she had better ask the way. I wanted to point out the building but there was now a closed door in the way."

"792"	"(03/14/64)"	"Come see my boat, the small boy said. His father and I went floating. On the pond was a board about a foot square. I stepped on it and felt it sway.

"793"	"(03/14/64)"	"[2nd dream] J wanted to show me his favorite lake. So I followed him up steep ridges and a bare hillside to the top where under green trees I saw a patch of beautiful blue water. Is this your lake? Yes."

"795"	"(03/15/64)"	"We will look in my concordance for that verse, ""There's a time to sow and a time to reap."" I turn the pages, what a lot re time, nearly two pages but we don't need to read all thru that. Can't find it and I go to get my other concordance."
"796"	"(03/16/64)"	"Now if you (a man and woman) will hike along that new trail for an hour and then turn back, we'll meet in time for dinner. Now I'm in R's room across the hall from mine. She is rearranging cartons to be placed on a wire rack at one side of her room. She offers me a taste of her peach preserve to which she has added something that she thinks makes it much sweeter. I take two bites. Then I start across to my room. Miss G. tells me to shut the hall door. I ask why so soon. I need the extra air. F. G. can't remember or find what it means. ""Well I don't have to cover that point with my class."" As I go to my room, a little girl is entering it. I ask, ""What are you doing in my room?"" She says she wants her aunt's room. I ask her aunt's last name and tell her that she's in the next room. I hang up my purple dress and start to change to go for a walk. Won't have much time for it for it's four o'clock and supper is at five. Mrs. Mc and another lady barge in when my dress is off. I protest, ""Please don't come in my room without knocking."""
"797"	"(03/19/64)"	"I notice the young girl wears a DSM pin. I ask her why. It's a club symbol. I tell her of my DSM pin and that it was the Latin Club pin when I was at college."

"799"	"(03/21/64)"	"I looked at the clock; almost 10 a.m. Must have slept after I woke at 4 a.m. Why did not they wake me? Then mother came in and I asked her if it was really 10 a.m. She said it was. I said at the Home they always came around knocking at each door to wake us. Probably I was used to that so hadn't wakened. I was nearly dressed now and asked if I could help her. Something said about bathrooms, several in this large house but I had my own. Yet I went to another and started to wash my hands but the bowl was dirty and toilet not flushed. So carrying my soap, I went to another. Came back and tossed soap into the basin. Saw father there and started to help sister with several cartons of various materials but when I left one off she told me that wasn't the one. Then she snatched up an apron for me to wear."
"801"	"(03/27/64)"	"I tell a woman, ""I have four books ready to send. The doll had better go separately because book postage is so much cheaper."" (To my brother?) ""If you'd like one of the books, take it to read. I have here the first volume of ""The Middle Kingdom"" and I name two others."

"803"	"(04/02/64)"	"When I entered the dining room with two long tables, Dora beckoned me to a seat next to her. As I faced a window, I hesitated but decided it would soon be less light and I could stand it. After I sat down, I realized I must get my medicine and went to the other table but a man and a woman were at my usual place and there was no medicine on the table. I saw a saucer of pills like mine on the sideboard which I took to Mrs. Mag. for identification because the larger tablets weren't quite white. She said they weren't mine and went with me to the nurse's room to look for mine."

"806"	"(04/16/64)"	"As she left, I said, ""I hope you are prepared for rain as it is raining now."" But it had stopped raining so we went to the meeting at the church next door by the side entrance. We took armchairs in the front row and R. was to have a part in the service. There were four chairs vacant so I asked Jo and F if they couldn't share one so as to leave one for mother. I thought I saw Miss Wh. coming with her crutch but as she drew nearer, I saw it was a stranger. After a while R went looking for mother and on her return said she was back there with L. I thought I should sit with them but when I went back, their pew was full so I returned but then my deaf ear was towards the speaker so we went to a pew nearby."

"809"	"(04/25/64)"	"She was asked to move the small many-colored candies from father's plate at the head of the table and I carried them now in a paper plate and poured them into another at the center of the table. Some spilled and as I picked them up I was told to take some and I tasted several. As I passed mother I squeezed her shoulder tenderly."
"810"	"(04/29/64)"	"He said my pin was like a TV medal. I said I'd have to hurry on because Miss W. didn't like us to be late. In the dining room I poured a glass of water for myself and then started to pour some jelly-like mix which began to drip and I called for a plate to catch it, went to a drawer to get a grapefruit knife, returned to the table to find my glass gone and an empty cup and plate instead. I complained and returned to find and fill the other glass."

"814"	"(05/12/64)"	"I started to the machine with a load of laundry. Some woman piled all mine in while I was talking to another. I thanked her but asked her not to do so again as I wanted to let water in first as per directions."
"815"	"(05/23/64)"	"I asked the blond young man sitting in the second of the row of chairs, ""Have you finished dinner and are you now in line?"" He said, ""Yes.""

When I picked up the paper the front page was missing. I asked if he had it. He said no the paper had not yet been delivered. I offered to divide the sections with him. Then the maid who was cleaning the room said she had taken it and was so sorry and wouldn't do so again. I said, ""That's all right. You didn't know everything the first time you cleaned here."" We looked in the wastebasket, found the crumpled paper, and smoothed it out."

I asked if we could put the cloth on the table now. She asked me which of the old ladies I'd like to have sit next to me. I insisted that I couldn't say if she didn't tell me their names. Then another lady came and asked me to play tennis. At first I said I would but then I remembered and said ""No, I've had warnings. Don't urge me or I might yield and I can't because I've sold my racquet."" Then the station wagon was full and I asked if there was room for me. He said that I could sit in front with him.

I was upstairs and went down to my room. No one was there, so I looked elsewhere, then returned and there were Mrs. C. and Mrs. Ed. In cleaning my room, the maid had pulled down my garment bags and tossed them in a pile on my bed. My dresses would be mussed. The bell rang and I started to lead my guest to the dining room. I told Mrs. Ed. I had not invited her and she went away. In the dining room, others had started to eat. No place was set for four and Miss Mc had pushed into the center of the vacant space. I got chairs for us and she moved over. Then I went to the drawer and got silver. We sat down and I introduced Mrs. C. and Mrs. Chal. but the others kept telling their names before I could."

She handed me a card with several slots in it but I didn't want to thread the tape thru the card so tore it in two and wound the card around it using slots to keep it in place. Then we were eating and the waitress asked if we would like the lemondrops. At first I said ""No"" then ""Yes."" She brought some that looked and tasted more like sweet applesauce. It is 1 p.m. and he said to catch the train we must leave at 5 past. Hurried but didn't get off until 10 past and then I realized I hadn't packed a suitcase or brought a handbag.

I said that was on a former trip and we were late arriving in Shanghai so passengers were transferred to planes but I felt no rush since my destination was so close to the wharf.

I went to the door to wait for him. Then I couldn't locate her. I sat on a chair at the side of the pews. Thought maybe he didn't know the way. A woman came to an empty seat in a rear pew and began to talk. Then a bus loaded with children came to the far side of the church. Then the building was empty. We were swimming.
