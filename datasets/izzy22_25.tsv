"3976"	"(2013-01-26 (22)) Somehow, Tyrion (Game of Thrones) and I were romantically involved. We would sneak off to these other castle buildings -- there was a big castle thing which was the main place and then there were lots of little buildings around. We were sitting in one, holding each other and talking. He wanted to give up his inheritance to run off with me. Later, we walked out of the castle together and people were watching, so I said ""I'll go walk around and meet you"" and smiled. We split up and I walked to the right to walk around the buildings and go through a back entrance. Some people followed me though."
"3977"	"(2013-01-26 (22)) I had a job at 4.30am. I was telling Mom that I needed 'Aero Grad' and a thing to kill bugs. Darren was in bed and saying they would get some and I was like 'before 4.30am?'. Mom was getting ready to meet someone. I realized it was 6.30am and that it was too late now. Then I realized the job was actually next week. We lived in an apartment block and there was some dodgy guy on the roof and the police had the building surrounded."
"3978"	"(2013-02-01 (22)) I woke up with my tooth loose in my mouth. I ran my tongue over my teeth, but couldn't work out where it had come from. I looked in the mirror and half of my bottom teeth were missing -- on the right side, I had a back tooth and the first non-molar, and on the left side I had random gaps. I couldn't feel any difference with my tongue though. I went to Mom and was telling her and I broke down, crying. She hugged me and seemed visibly distressed for me."
"3979"	"(2013-02-03 (22)) I was at home, alone, at night. I heard weird noises and caught a glimpse of someone out the back. I text Mom and told her to hurry home. I was sitting on my bed. Then I heard more noise and a guy came into my room. He was quite tall and blonde and was wearing a silver wedding ring and had big hands. He crouched at the bottom of my bed and said he wasn't going to hurt me. He started talking about something random that seemed vaguely familiar. I heard Darren's scooter pull up outside and he asked what it was and I asked if I could check if the light had gone on outside. I opened my curtain and said that Darren was back. He took my mouse as a 'hostage' and walked off. I pulled it out of the computer as he walked away so it wouldn't pull and said 'no, please'. He went out the back and said he needed to stay for a while. I went out to greet Darren. The guy turned on the back light and walked outside the window in the back room. Darren didn't seem fazed. He stayed a while (days or something), and he was kind of cute and I would keep looking at him and he'd look at me and I'd look away. There was some tension there. One night he kissed me and I resisted, but he kept going and I gave in and we had sex. There was some movie set on this boat. The people finally managed to escape and got onto a lifeboat and started going towards this thing, but someone shot it and it exploded. Some people landed in the water and they got trapped by this spiky defense mechanism."
"3980"	"(2013-02-09 (22)) I was at the shops and it was busy. Nana was there, but she was going senile or something and kept staring into the distance or would just walk off. I kept losing her. We went down to the carpark and I tried to get her to stay in the car. Then I was home, but it was different. There was a pink and nicely decorated letter at the door for me. It was from Zander. I then had a 6 year old daughter, which I'd had with Zander -- we had had sex at school and I'd had an abortion by taking a bunch of pills, but somehow the kid came back. Some guy was wearing a shirt from The Mercenary. I thought it was cool and was talking to him outside."
"3981"	"(2013-02-17 (22)) I was at a stocktaking job at an IGA. I had done this one before but didn't realize until I went in. There was a muffin shop next door and there was a guy dressed as a muffin and dancing around. Esther joked that this job would take 30 hours. We had trolleys to take around with us. Elijah was there. I went to an aisle but had forgotten to put my stuff down and get a scanner."
"3982"	"(2013-02-23 (22)) I was at Leederville IGA [I had to cancel the job which was tomorrow] . I was having trouble with my sore arm and after 2 hours I was still stuck on the same shelf and kept knocking stuff off. I was having problems with the ladder too. Calvin was there. I went to get Co-Worker-F-02 to ask her to go home. She was upstairs at the back of the store. There were bedrooms and hers was empty and the light was off. I heard a noise and went back to the stairs but then she came out of one of the other rooms in a costume -- it was Halloween? She said she would normally cover up with makeup when she was dressed up, but this costume covered up her face and I said ""it saves time"". I explained to her about my arm, but she just got some other people to do my shelf and I was unsure of whether I could leave or not."
"3983"	"(2013-03-01 (22)) I was working at the bar, which was different. A guy asked for a Corona with lemon, and it was actually this weird thing that I had to mix with baked beans, but I think he just wanted lemonade and a cake. The queue was building up and I saw Cute Irish Guy (Kieran) there. He had a name badge on saying 'Lincoln F', which I thought was a weird name for an Irish bloke and wondered what his last name was. I finished making the Corona and left it. I gave Kieran his Budweiser and as he gave me a $20 note, his fingers lingered on mine. He said his usual ""thank you very much"" and walked off without his change. I put it aside. There was a gambling thing going on upstairs. The guy hadn't come back for his Corona thing and someone said he'd won the jackpot and left. An Asian lady told me to follow her through what looked like a ventilation system. I tied my hair back and people queued up behind me impatiently. I started climbing through and some parts squished my head. Climbing down pipes was easier and then it was like a game. I got to the bottom and then the lady was like 'just up here' and it was a long way up. I couldn't be bothered with it and 'paused' the game for now."
"3984"	"(2013-03-05 (22)) I lived at a house with Mom near some woods. Outside we had a self-serve petrol station. It was night. I pulled in and filled up my tank. The neighbours across the road were outside in groups complaining to themselves loudly about our porch light. We turned it off and yelled out 'you could've just asked us, retards!'. Then they left their porch light on. Later, we were both in bed (we were sharing a bed) and Rover was there too. I heard a guy outside talking with a young girl (6 years old or so). I nudged Mom and told her the window was open. She didn't get up, so I finally got up and closed it. The voice was Stephen Merchant's, but it was the past, before he got famous and he was kind of insane. He was saying that he was going to let everyone know the difference between 'a condor and a girl getting raped'. Mom didn't stir and I thought that was weird. I thought about offering myself up because I wouldn't mind getting in bed with him, but then thought he might be violent/crazy etc. At one point he said he graduated here with comedy honours."
"3985"	"(2013-03-14 (22)) I was at a shop or something. Trey Parker and Matt Stone were there, signing stuff. Someone had a Cartman plush toy and I had the same one. They made fun of my accent. Dad was elsewhere and I was waiting for him."
"3986"	"(2013-03-14 (22)) I was on a beach and I was thinking about getting in the water, when there was a tidal wave. It started getting higher and higher and Ezra and I climbed up this big step thing. Waves kept coming higher each time, and we climbed up higher. Eventually it went right over us at the top step. I climbed down and ran to these steps attached to a building which were surrounded by glass. I realized I was trapped there, so I got down and tried to find a car. I found a golf buggy, but it was really slow. A girl was following me. I got off and there was a tent on some grass. There were two weird looking babies in there with big heads. An insane lady grabbed one and bit out its throat and started eating it. Blood went everywhere and I ran. The waves were finally over and I started looking for everyone I had been there with."
"3987"	"(2013-03-21 (22)) I was part of an underground movement during World War 2 and the SS were looking for us. The leader guy was basically Hans Landa (Inglorious Basterds) (his personality was very similar), but looked different. He had a wide nose. Calvin was part of the group and we went into a house where there were lots of old people. It was well furnished and looked of the times. We saw him come through the door and we got on our knees and were crawling around trying to find a way out and avoid him. He found us though and took us outside. He told me to dig a grave in the snow for Calvin, who was now someone else. I was wearing a shirt and shorts and had no shoes on and I had to use my hands. It was very cold and I started scooping it. I was a few feet away from him and I chose a moment to start running away. He followed me, but walked. I never stopped running, and went through a field with lots of abandoned, ruined castle looking buildings. I ended up in a building which was full of stuff and had lots of shelves and I ducked in between them trying to find a way out. He followed me in there, still calmly walking down the middle of the building. I climbed up some shelves and boards to a door leading outside (but it was like the equivalent of a balcony). I climbed down a ladder down the side and ended up back in the room. Any exit I went through was a dead end or brought me back to the room. The guy said something like 'you really want to live', but was getting annoyed with me. He ended up cornering me and held a gun up to my head and I was saying 'please don't, I'll do anything' etc. He seemed to hesitate and I was hoping he would have some respect for my will to leave from having escaped him so long."
"3988"	"(2013-03-22 (22)) I was staying at Nana's, though lots of other random people were too. Kieran was there. He was sitting on the lounge across from Dad. They were talking and I heard Dad call him Andrew. I was staying in a room down the hall. There were 4 single beds. I got in one to go to sleep, when 3 other girls came in and said they were sharing the room. They weren't ready to go to bed and were talking and messing about. I was annoyed."
"3989"	"(2013-03-26 (22)) Dad still lived at the old house. I was staying over. Ezra and Roland were there too, along with Stephen Merchant. We were out the front. Roland said he could hear a noise from the woodshed and said that 'someone was in there', but we ignored him. Then we were out the back sitting at a table. Stephen wrote on a bit of paper and signed it Stephen MerchanT -- the S and T being significantly bigger, especially the T, and I said 'the T's almost as tall as him'. He laughed. Then we were out the front again and Steve said he heard something in the woodshed. Dad went to check it out and came back with a bruise on his face, saying 'he hit me'. Apparently there was a family of around 20 Chinese people living in there. There was a hole in the laundry window that they came in through. I went to look and saw a lady using the sink in the laundry. I screamed. I went to the living room and another one came out and put her hands on my face. Someone said it was some ritual and so I stood there, stiff, and she made me kneel, then she bowed and I bowed back and I was thinking 'I thought that was a Japanese thing', but just went along with it."
"3990"	"(2013-04-02 (22)) I don't know why, but I was in bed and had a vibrator that was very penis like, and was giving it a blowjob. I was thinking it was not as bad as I expected. I put it under my bedside table and fell asleep. I woke up with stuff on my chair and desk that I assumed Mom put there while I was asleep. I was worried that she had seen it. Later, someone was asking sex questions and Mom and Darren answered one about 'most boring sex'; they had been trapped in a car on the freeway during a storm and got bored. Also, you could collect this alternative money, which I was thinking as being like EVE from BioShock and you could purchase upgrades with it. I had about 3000 and bought two things worth 1000 each and then thought I shouldn't have spent that much (most things were around 15-50)."
"3991"	"(2013-05-15 (22)) This guy and I had some friends. I was going down a path at some point and Ezra and some others pretended they were zombies and then I was like 'you're slow', 'you can't touch the pavement' 'you can't climb' etc as we walked away from them. I climbed these ropes which were stretchy. One felt weak and it was really high so I got off. The some girl friend of ours went crazy and all these people were after us. The guy was now Leonard (The Big Bang Theory) and we ran. We ended up in this house with cats, kittens and this fat, hard cat in a wardrobe and I think they were sick. We got to this place and Leonard said we had to find this game called something like 'huku fuku hakka nad' and it was a GameBoy game. We found it and it had a picture of the Hulk on it. We had to assemble the player and win the game to defeat the bad guys. They attacked us and I ran into a small room with was like a safe room and emptied all the parts onto the floor. Leonard defeated them and then came to the room and I told him to get in and we assembled it together. It was a very tight fit. We finished assembling it and I tried to Google how to win the game but then they came again. They got us and I hid the game between my butt cheeks. Then it was some time later and we were in their community. At the beginning, Leonard had written a shorthand message to me but I couldn't read it. It kept expanding on a blackboard until it basically spelt out the entire plan before I understood. We pretended to fit in with them. They were a similar race to Macedonian and I pointed out that I was too. Someone asked if Leonard was my boyfriend and I hesitated wondering what the best response would be and then I said no, but she said 'so he is' and winked. I asked a security guy for a smoke and he gave me an extra butt and it made me choke and it tasted horrible and made my mouth dry."
"3992"	"(2013-05-21 (22)) I was staying in a hostel thing. I opened my suitcase and a girl saw my stripey pink pants and made a comment and I said they're soft and she tried them on and agreed. Dad and Ezra had a fight at a museum and knocked over a zebra and lost 8 bones. I had some Turkish food for dinner and then ate back at the hostel. I had a diary protected by a key which also needed answers to questions. People were desperate to see it. I knew Ted (How I Met Your Mother) and was in love with him. At some point Lily said that she 'noticed how cute Ted was, and had to go home with my toothbrush for a bit'. We were lying on a bed and heard a hiss. There was a big yellow snake that he called an 'adder'. The girl said 'don't act scared', but I threw the blanket over us and we lifted it up and the snake climbed on her. I ran and she followed. It was night and I was outside in a park with a bus shelter. I ran down one side and she ran down the other. The snake ran down the path towards her but ate a lizard."
"3993"	"(2013-05-31 (22)) I was somewhere where there was lots of water with various things to climb on. I got quite far and there was a congested tunnel. I waited for people to push through so I could go through myself. I heard people screaming and someone said there was a shark. We all hurriedly swam back and tried to climb on something. The first thing I found was too low down so kept going. The next thing I found was wobbly. I finally climbed on something and someone else was a bit lower. We saw a shark fin come and went towards the the person on the lower bit. The thing we were on lost balance and wobbled. It got distracted and I managed to find another bit to climb on. Then later I was in the car with Mom and I was telling her about it being a dream and it was a crocodile and she said 'and then it [did something] and something to do with Amelia' and I said 'yeah, how did you know' and she refused to answer but then finally said I talked in my sleep. People were making short films and I went to this place to watch one. We got into a 'cage' and then it was swinging and chucked us to the other side of the room (it was a ride). Ezra was there too and I laughed because he'd probably be freaking out. When it was done we left and I realized I'd forgotten my jacket which had my wallet and keys in it. I went back and had to run into the employee area to get back to it. They didn't mind. I bought a chocolate and it was £6. Later I was at a park. It was pretty and there was a huge water area which was green-ish. It was only like 1cm deep though. I was eating lunch. Sailing on the Seven Seas was playing on a radio and Mom and Darren said it was lame."
"3994"	"(2013-06-19 (22)) I held a school reunion at the old house. Some people there were people who were strangers, but I'm not sure if I knew them in the dream or if they were strangers to me in the dream. Dmitri was there and looked really hot. Eugene and Bradley were also there. People were sleeping over too. I put a glass in the fridge and there was a countdown from five and it exploded. Dad yelled and said to never put a glass directly in the fridge. Later, I went to the toilet which was facing 90 degrees counter clockwise from where it does face and left the door pulled to. I peed and went to wipe, when Dmitri started talking to me and someone else came along as well. Later, this girl and I got into an argument and she was being bitchy to everyone. Her friend was also bitching with her. Everyone was then gone except those two, and she was still carrying on and I turned around and started yelling at her calling her a bitch. She got up angrily and I had this butcher knife and I hit her and her friend with it, and then ate them. I went out to Dad and said I ate them ""not in a weird sex way"" and he started helping clean up the evidence. They had been on a mattress with blankets and had left some spots of blood. I put the blankets in a basket. I put her suitcase and stuff together. Dad went out to do something. There was a knock on the door and some salesmen were there. They gave me a card and a paper bag and left smiling. The card said 'to Izzy' and then had some crap about donating to poor people. They returned not long after and I gave it back and said 'sorry, not interested'. They were bothered by this. The girl's phone on was the bed and kept vibrating because a friend was ringing. There was a voicemail from me, which I'd left earlier, of me yelling at her. I took the suitcase and a bag outside, and got a few houses down but then I saw people from the reunion across the street and the salesmen coming back, so I left it and went back. The salesmen had gone inside, but I couldn't find them. Then there were kids in the house demanding donations. I was thinking this was ridiculous and that we weren't going to get away with this at all now. Then it changed to a father and young son. He had 'made' friends, but they had died. Then they were escaping from something, and the kid got new friends and a dog (all created) and then they walked away happily."
"3995"	"(2013-06-27 (22)) I was with The Doctor (David Tennant) and we ended up at this place where there were these mini volcanoes in barrels over the water. We had to win to prevent the volcanoes going in the ocean, which would be even more dangerous. We needed 11 and we had 11, but still had to answer questions. There was a buzzer sound and The Doctor pointed out that it was ""from Pointless"" at the same time. They asked what most people said came after 'Twinkies'. I said roll, because I couldn't remember what they were and she looked at me in confusion and said 'no'. A black guy called Nate asked me out and I agreed and then changed my Facebook status to 'in a relationship' and then I was like 'I don't even like this guy' and cancelled it and unfriended him. I was with Benjamin later and we were either dating or just flirty."
"3996"	"(2013-06-29 (22)) I was at a shop (it was big; smaller than Westfield, but it had more floors) and then I left and went to find a car. I couldn't remember where I had parked. Then it was like a game and zombies suddenly appeared. They were weird and green and slow. Then I was in a pub. Lots of celebs were there. Martin Scorsese was one of them. The guy behind the bar made a joke to me but I couldn't remember who he was. I saw Nathan Fillion and I said 'ooh, can I get a photo' and he was like sure and really chilled about it. He put his arm around me, tightly, and I took a phot, but he was out of shot. I went to find someone else to take the photo. It took a while to find someone else and Dmitri was dancing to the music. After they took the photo, this girl was like ""I LOVE him"". Then I turned to see Alexander Skarsgard with 'nerd Eric' hair and I asked for a photo too and then I woke up."
"3997"	"(2013-07-24 (22)) I was at The Janitor's (Scrubs) house, and there was like a party but in this shop area. He collected old books/art and fixed them up. He kept offline records of things people bought/what he spent (he also owned this shop thing) and noticed he was spending too much and he announced to everyone that he was quitting his job of being a janitor and doing something else instead. Then there was like an explosion and a panic in the streets. People were trying to get in and we tried to keep the doors shut. Then we either got on a train, or it just changed to being on a train [note: I watched Snowpiercer recently] , which was owned by The Janitor. There were a few other friends/acquaintances on there. There were about 8 carriages and they were separated by sliding doors. Each carriage also had a door to the outside which was open and zombies were climbing in; even though the train was going very fast. The Janitor knew of a way to shut the doors so they wouldn't open from outside. There was an emergency latch to the right of every door and we had to pull it towards us. There were 5 of us and I said that 3 of us would go through and start clearing out/closing the carriages and told one to stay behind and the other to trail us. It was mostly easy and then there was a whole bunch in the next carriage. A guy was standing right at the door and we told him to move because there were lots of zombies and he was being cocky and then it opened and they surrounded him. He got out, but I think he was bitten (or maybe just scratched). We only had these guns which shot arrows and they had a slight reload time. We were shooting them in the head, and had good aim. We cleared the carriage and kept moving. The carriage at the end had humans in it -- a teacher and children. We saw them climbing in. I yelled 'get off our train' but then a female 'friend' of ours was with me and opened the vent and said that they needed to close and secure the door. She somehow got in there and started doing it and then something pulled her up through the vent. I was like 'holy feck' and then a dog came in and it started attacking the group, but then I saw it coming towards me and I ran. It was getting through these holes below/above the doors. I got to the first carriage, where everyone was armed and waiting up high. I climbed up and waited with them."
"3998"	"(2013-08-07 (22)) Our IMDb film credits were up. There were lots of associate producers. Benjamin's last name was 'Demon' and listed above me so I was annoyed. There was also a guy called Philippe."
"3999"	"(2013-08-07 (22)) There was a new movie with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Frost's last name was also Pegg (which wasn't 'real' but was like a nickname that had happened before they met). It involved time travel. When Frost was a kid he had a toy called 'Pegg' and it was something that he liked and that was how he got the name. Pegg went back in time to stop it and see what happened but he died and then it showed Frost as an adult 'die' and Pegg was upset and crying and everyone was saying it was like the most depressing movie ever."
"4000"	"(2013-08-10 (22)) Benjamin came to London and we met up the same day. I was talking to him with no issues and was like yay it's finally working out. Then out of nowhere, he had a girlfriend who was American. She was blonde and wore lots of makeup. I didn't like her at all. I put up with her, but when she came and they went to kiss, I just walked on ahead and didn't look back. Then they started getting really into the PDA and I just walked off. We were in a shop or something. Benjamin dissed me for playing Pokemon at some point and I said it was only because he hadn't played it. There was a weird thing with ropes and you had to climb to get to different shops and displays. I did that for a while and then checked my forum messages. Benjamin sent me one saying his girlfriend had broken up with him saying that it was my fault and she had sent me a message saying the same thing and said 'yes, you guys might be perfect for each other and you might always be interesting to him and he'll never be bored, but blah blah'. I messaged him saying I never said anything to her and I thought she was a 'personality-less bore' but was perfectly polite. I thought he'd chuck a spaz over that, but he didn't. He didn't seem too upset."
"4001"	"(2013-08-10 (22)) Lydia posted a status on Facebook saying she got in trouble for having lesbian porn and videos of her and her girlfriend having sex on a USB. I thought it was TMI. I was watching Supernatural and Dean's girlfriend was crying at him. It was an emotional scene and she had to sacrifice herself for something. She had to become a vampire. It turned to day and she was burning and threw herself in a fountain, falling a few levels to the bottom. I don't know what she had to do but then I was there too. People were coming in and we went outside and she wasn't a vampire anymore and hid behind a statue. I climbed up to the roof to lie on this thing sticking out, but it wasn't hidden enough so I climbed over a fence and went out the front again. Then I was at some performance thing. I was sitting with people from school at a cafeteria. Lydia was there and had found out I like Eugene and she had pretty much told everyone and I was avoiding him. Then I was with Benjamin and we went to the performance. We were sitting together at the end of a row. Colin Mochrie was in the row next to us and there were some other famous people. Some people from FilmForum were there too. SuperGuy was behind us -- he had dreadlocks and gold teeth and looked sort of like an early 20s drop-out addict -- then someone was next to him and then FlyingSquirrel was supposed to be sitting at the end, but a girl was there. She got up and then FlyingSquirrel came back and he was kind of hot. Benjamin was pointing out some of the others, as well as Local and Gunnar. People got umbrellas out and I wondered why there were umbrellas and then I saw the show on the screen with umbrellas and water came from the ceiling. I was wearing my orange beanie and I laughed and Benjamin ducked under another umbrella."
"4002"	"(2013-08-18 (22)) Stephen Merchant married Rose Byrne and I was peed off about it. There were pictures of them kissing and moving in together. They hadn't been dating very long and Stephen had asked her and she said yes. I was thinking 'I knew I hated her for a reason!'."
"4003"	"(2013-08-31 (22)) I was at this like 'camp' and we had a hotel thing, but it was in the middle of a village and it was run by the same people. I think I had bought the McDonald's? Except it was like a supermarket and I owned like half of it/invested in it or something. We had to line up and we were at the end of the last queue and I said ""I thought it would be a good idea to invest in McDonald's, because you know it's not going anywhere"" and joking about having to line up. There was something weird going on there, like people were going missing. I was with Dan Palmer, and we were investigating. We went into one building where we thought the dodgy stuff was going on. I can't remember why, but there ended up being a lot of severed fingers [reference to Stalled] - I think there was a 'rite of passage' and people were turning into something else and part of this was having their fingers severed. We managed to escape from there and went back to the hotel. One lady kept going on about needing lights in the bottom row of the store and continued going on about it even at the hotel. We went back to our room, which was next to their room. Dan got into bed and I reached over him to reach something and he grabbed me and I laughed and jumped back. I got onto the bed and leaned over and started kissing him. I went on top of him and I felt him get hard. We took our pants off and started having sex. I heard some noises and could see shadows of people behind the door and I tried to tell him, but he waved it off and we continued. I woke up part way through."
"4004"	"(2013-09-05 (22)) I had this box thing and the only way to open it was using high temperatures. I was running and then I jumped into the water. There were all these danger/warning signs because it was hot there. I started swimming to the cooler side and stopped when it was tolerable. A friend or something came to help me and then I died. Then it was 2 years later and I was like a ghost. Apparently what I'd done had something to do with work and Howard wasn't letting me out of the contract. I complained to someone that I'd died and he was still keeping me here and he heard and I went invisible and walked away as he started yelling at me. It was Independence Day and I realised I'd forgotten and had also forgotten my birthday the day before. I was at an office building which had a weird elevator with multiple sections. I ordered a water from a little booth thing."
"4005"	"(2013-09-06 (22)) I had another job that I went to two times a week. There was a small platform for the tube with only one carriage door. It was always late. I got to the place where the office was and Howard was there and said 'you're here early' or something and was wearing his Pink Floyd shirt and I said 'I have the day off' and he said that he had a 'job interview for the first time in years' and he walked into McDonald's and I went up the escalator. I went to eat and asked for this salad but the lady said I should get the chicken because it's healthier and it was like £9.80, but I said ok. I ate it quickly and then ran to the office and was like 15 minutes late. I signed in and someone asked me when I got there and they said 'you should've been here early, you missed [some amusing incident] '. I said the tube was always late and he said that he knew. It was a place where they made all these inventions. One was a scent detecting lock. Another had a cupboard that looked like it had shadows on it, but it opened to nothing except shadows (I think it had something to do with invisibility). I sat at my desk. Each desk had a curtain that could be pulled 3/4 the way around. I had a pink rabbit vibrator in my drawer and I put it in my bag to take away. I got up for a bit and later it was gone, as well as some other stuff. Someone had put a bunch of stuff in a fridge/freeze and it was in there. I quickly took it before anyone saw. There were also a few other things in there. The girl that had done it was sleeping and I wondered if she had been sleepwalking."
"4006"	"(2013-09-15 (22)) Had a text from Kiersten saying 'hey chic' and said Beatrix had said I was really noisy after 11pm. I also got a message from Benjamin saying something like 'I should've told you by now but I'm still a virgin'. I thought it was an odd comment but I was glad that he was and wondered if he'd told me because of that."
"4007"	"(2013-09-19 (22)) I went to a second 'FrightFest'. I had a full pass but it was a different image. There were not as many films and didn't go for as many days. I was seeing Stalled again. The cinemas weren't enclosed and it was like a screen, some chairs and then two rows of chairs right at the back. I saw Dan Palmer and some other people involved there. There was a girl second from the end in the first row and I sat next to her, but didn't sit entirely on the chair. I asked if someone was sitting there and she said no and she seemed friendly. I got comfortable. Something was playing on the screen but it was like trailers and interviews. Something happened and Dan got on a bike and was chasing after someone. I had something and he took it off me and I was squeeing inside and Christian James and the girl started recording it -- he recorded with his phone and she recorded with her iPad. A fat guy was there too. Somehow I got involved with the short film and then it was edited and done. We missed the film though. Dan was walking up to me and I was getting nervous and excited. He was just chatting to me about stuff. They also got my name for the credits of the short and I was excited about getting something else on IMDb and being right under Dan's name on the short."
"4008"	"(2013-09-23 (22)) I went to this place with a group on a tour thing. There were footprints in the wall that were massive but were David Bowie's. There were hands of celebrities as part of the decor as well. I went to the place where they were filming Stalled except it was like a classroom. They set us up so we were sitting along the wall. I was looking for Dan Palmer. Somehow later, I was talking to a lady about a project and she said yes and then I went to a place and opened the door and went in and Dan Palmer and Christian James were there. I said 'she said yes' and we all sighed with relief and it was a producer for a film/TV show we were doing together. The place was empty and square with a rectangular shaped kitchen to the side. Christian James got a blanket thing and folded it up in a corner like a bed, then got this sheet and stretched it over the kitchen. I wanted a bean bag for the corner."
"4009"	"(2013-09-24 (22)) Bullfrog was my boss. He had recently taken over my work (which I think was a supermarket). He was really tall and slim and bald and spoke perfect English with an English accent. He was always mean to me and had cut down my hours so I was barely working. There was a poll about who the killer in Friday the 13th was and 60% of people had voted for Jason Voorhees and I complained because it was his mother and Bullfrog started attacking me for some reason. I fell down some stairs and was lying on my back. I was shouting at Bullfrog and he stabbed another guy. As he was pulling out the knife I was like 'just do it!' and he stabbed me and chopped my head off."
"4010"	"(2013-09-25 (22)) I found a short film that Dan Palmer did. It kept becoming real life though and Co-Worker-F-06 was in it and she was with her boyfriend. We were using this room, playing music which was The National. I was playing GTA V on the TV. There was a pool just outside. Some other people came and looked like they were going to turn the music off and I said ""don't even think of turning the music off"" and this black guy looked at me like 'whatever' but I just stared angrily and his face softened. They didn't do anything. Co-Worker-F-06 stripped down and went for a swim. Later, she was talking to some guy with her boyfriend and he asked her who he was and she said 'my brother' and he was like 'what'. It was her breaking up with him. Later I was going back to somewhere and went in and there were zombies everywhere. Then it was back to it being a short and it had been a really tense kind of build-up and you wanted to know how it ended and then it just turned to zombies. I really liked it and gave it an 8/10 and favourited it on FilmForum. Jordy had watched it ages ago and had posted a positive review. The short had been made years ago but was only recently added to IMDb. I was thinking that those guys really loved their zombies. There was also a glimpse of Stalled at the end and Dan Palmer looked really hot and I was excited about Stalled. Also at some point I was on the Eiffel Tower and you had to win tickets from games to get higher. I got a burger and it took me 2 hours to eat it. When I realised how long it'd been I wondered how it was still warm. People kept talking to me and annoying me."
"4011"	"(2013-10-01 (22)) Dan Palmer joined the forum. His username was Dan Palmer. He posted on the Welcome thread with a nice little introduction and said his birthday was 7 Jan 1978? Maybe the 9th. Anyway, he posted on a few threads and I was worried about him seeing my posts about him. Benjamin sent me a message on Skype saying like 'he sounds like you' because he'd said 'I'm awesome' and similar stuff in his intro."
"4012"	"(2013-10-02 (22)) There were zombies. I don't really remember what it was like but we'd had some massive fight against them where we felt like we were safe and went to sleep. We were in this big building which didn't really make any logical sense, because sometimes it was like a massive mansion or an office or a mall. I woke up and heard people. I looked outside and saw normal people just doing normal stuff. I went to find my friends. I looked in a room and saw a hand lying on the floor from behind a desk. I went in and Hank (Breaking Bad) was lying under there sleeping. I shook him and he said like 'that was the best sleep ever' and I nodded and grinned and then said 'there are people outside'. I opened the curtains and outside were tons of people coming into the building. It was like there were no zombies/nothing had happened. He went to find his mate by opening the drawers of the desk. He wasn't in there. Two cupboards were at other side of room. I opened a drawer and he was sleeping in there - it was Simon Pegg. He jumped out and we explained and went to investigate. Outside the room it was now a mall, and tons of people were coming our way. I was doing like karate poses when they came near but realised they weren't zombies. People were running shops etc. We went to one shop and Silas was yelling at the lady about a 'doll rack' in the back and she was like 'how do you know about the doll rack' and I said exasperated 'someone told us about it, please would you just check if it's there' and she went and checked and said yes. I didn't know what the relevance was. Then there was something about a 'vampire' thing and there was a container of these like bottle holders, but they were squishy and had like bubble wrap on the inside. One had fangs on it. They were like £53 pounds or something though because it was some charity thing. I wasn't sure if that's what we needed but I was like 'too bad it's so expensive'. Someone said that centuries had passed after the zombie invasion had died down but I didn't think that was right because no-one was acting like a zombie invasion had happened."
"4013"	"(2013-10-15 (22)) I was at a table in a restaurant (like a big one, ball room type of thing). It was a place where some play or something was going on. The other people at the table were the actors in it.  I think I was friends with one of the actresses. Then I was at home and I lived with Dan Palmer and we had a son who was about 5. We were in bed and I was waking up. I was on my back and he had his arm over me, sleeping. It was our son's birthday or something and we were in his bedroom and Dan was joking around as you would with a kid and then gave him a Caramello Koala from behind his back which was apparently his favourite chocolate. And I continued joking around like 'gasp, he doesn't like Caramello Koala's' and then I pulled another one out from behind my back. The kid was really happy about it. Also the Caramello Koala's were more like small Easter bunny chocolates with just tons of caramel in them. Then these 'officer' types came and demanded to look inside and we let them. They looked for 'illegal' animals, like you needed permission for all the animals on your property and I was like 'what if a random animal just wanders in', but apparently that was ok. I looked out the window and there was this bizarre lizard creature, it was like two animals together; one was this lizard thing and the other was brown and had a long neck and a sort of ET looking face. The lizard had an iguana-ish face and would drape itself over the brown thing and it would like carry it along. I said 'we don't own THAT' and they were like 'yeah we know'. Then there was this species of chicken which was pretty but dumb. They gathered us all in the backyard (which was massive and there were a bunch of other people but I don't know who they were). They tossed forks in front of the normal chickens which picked them up and the stupid chicken just started running around like a fool. They wanted the other chickens to attack it, and they started chasing it around. I was like 'I don't want to watch this' and gathered my son and Dan and we went and placed ourselves in a position to not see it. Another lady had done the same with her son and on the way to the place to sit she looked at us in disgust and was like 'I'm not subjecting my son to this' but I was too sad to have a go at her. I had the feeling that the son was confused and not bothered about the whole thing and I was thinking 'I hope he doesn't end up a serial killer'."
"4014"	"(2013-10-16 (22)) I somehow ended up in one of those crop plane things with someone else. Either he or I was the only one who knew how to land it. We were messing around for a while when it started getting really windy, so we put it down. In the distance there was a bunch of smoke. We landed on a strip that was near this like cabin thing (like in horror films when they stop in at a petrol station or something in the middle of nowhere, it was that kind of look). There was just sand everywhere too, no roads nearby. It was dead quiet and there was no-one around. The guy was now Dan Palmer and we were suspicious, so hid behind this thing in the middle of the path leading up to the cabin thing. There was another building to the right and I saw a zombie stumble out from behind it. It started coming towards us and we moved around the thing we were hiding behind and as it came near I think I wrapped my arm around it and broke its neck. Another zombie from near the cabin saw us and started coming towards us and I did the same thing. We moved closer and Dan was peeking out and I said 'stop, don't move' because this big green monster (which I referred to as The Hulk) was lurking behind the cabin/near a tree. It was just a little taller than the cabin and was slim-ish, not like a massive thing like Hulk. It saw him anyway and I think it just left. I can't remember what the deal was but I had to chop off someone's hand and I chopped off their right hand and there was lots of blood; it was quite graphic. Then I had to chop off Dan's hand and he said to get rid of the left one and I found an axe and started chopping it. There was lots of blood and it was fairly easy to cut through although it took a few hits. I also chopped off some zombie's head with the axe. Then I was at some like beachside town and there were jetties and whatnot and stuff decorated for Halloween. I saw some kids wearing costumes and I realised it was Halloween. It was dusk and I was on my way home and I thought I might come back down to check out the festivities, but needed to get some movies watched for challenge first."
"4015"	"(2013-11-05 (22)) I went to see The Lords of Salem which was actually a live show. Rob Zombie was hosting but he didn't look like him and he also had a Northern accent and mentioned he was from Yorkshire. The show was held outside in a field thing. There was a big stage. I can't remember what happened at all, but it was pretty fun. There were lots of lights and stuff. Then it was inside. There were lots of kids in the show. Something weird was happening and they were taking people? I either went on stage or was talking to Zombie and he took my wallet? I went to leave coz I thought they were going to take me and I went out the exit and then realised he had my wallet. I went back in and wondered how I was going to get it. I was with the kids and they seemed to think something was going on too. A lady came and said they were looking for Eleanor or something similar to that, which was a codename thing. I said confidently, 'It's me,' even though I knew it meant they were going to take me (it was to save the kids??). She said to follow her and we got to the edge of the stairs at the stage and she said they'd be a while and asked if I wanted to sit. So I did. I also needed to pee. I was trying to work out how to make a run for it, when I realised they weren't even guarding me or whatever, so I walked out. I started running for the tube station (it was night) and the lady came running after me. I think I tripped over or ran into something and they caught me. They took me to this place and made me stay outside. It was fenced off and guarded by this one dude. The lady, who was now Jeb, told him to not let me through. I was crying and saying let me out and he started crying but wouldn't budge and said he had to follow orders. The only thing outside was one of those small rectangle plastic bin things, so I grabbed that to use as a pillow and curled up, trying to sleep. Then the guard was talking to another guy, so I got up and slipped out and he gave me a look like he'd done it on purpose. I ran, and they didn't follow. I got to the tube station and you had to scan the Oyster card and then your ID. Another guy was having problems with it, but it finally worked. I did mine but my ID said 'CONNED', and I realised they tricked me with a new licence thing. I had another one in a pocket, so I used that. I ran to the elevator and a fat guy was behind me so I tried to keep it open but he just stood there, so I went in. I ran to the first train I saw but I didn't recognise the next stop and realised I had taken the wrong line (a lady said it was the ""Green"" line). I got out and tried to work out where to go. It was like 1.30am so I wondered why the tube was even running."
"4016"	"(2013-11-07 (22)) I was watching How I Met Your Mother. Lily and Marshall were getting a divorce or something and she and Ted decided to give it a go. Ted had inherited the 'property' of something and had this small, but nice, house in a quiet street. It then cut to him and Lily lying in bed after 3 days. He was right next to the wall and obviously not interested in her. She complained they had nothing in common. She stormed out of house and he followed and then was shown whispering to Marshall who was waiting outside. It was a set-up so she'd go back to Marshall. He caught up with her and they seemed happy to see each other. Then I was there and there was a car waiting. As they were coming back he said 'run', and I struggled to lock the door and then ran. The doors were open and he got in the left side and I got in the right (though the car was facing us). We were driving for a while and then The Mother was in the front. She was wearing a white, fitted dress with white heels. She got up to change stations and had to bend over and Ted perved on her. She turned to us and saw what I was wearing and went off, like 'what the hell are you wearing?', 'you need to change' etc and I yelled back saying 'I'm wearing what I'm comfortable in and I am comfortable. You're dressed like you're modelling or going to a ball, I don't need to dress for attention every second of my life' or something. I realised I hadn't put my shoes on and we pulled into a shop to get some. They seemed to be out of clothes everywhere. The Mother dissed my clothes again and I was like 'I'm just wearing jeans' and saw I had a hole, then saw they'd been like slashed across the front and back of the knee and at the bottom. I was like wtf and accused The Mother. She didn't deny it but I didn't know if it was actually her. I was looking for jeans too. Ted seemed to be getting annoyed and I was annoyed and worried that he was going to ditch me for her. She ended up buying me this little fish. She gave me the bag and I saw the fish (it was red and white) but then it was gone. I couldn't find it and she took it back and there was also a Korean family staring at the fish and we assumed they were going to eat them. The Mother went to this old lady and came back with my pants 'fixed' - the lady chose between 'bringing the fish back' or fixing my pants. I was annoyed but like I didn't need a fish and I was going to get new pants anyway."
"4017"	"(2013-11-19 (22)) I went back home to visit. Mom, Dad and Granma greeted me. I was friends with Dan Palmer and we were somewhere. I'm not even sure where we were, but it was inside. He had the Stalled hat on, and he was near me and I took it off and put it on."
"4018"	"(2013-11-23 (22)) I went back home for a bit. It was hot and humid. The air-con wasn't really working. The cold air-con was the only thing helping. Home was different. Mom, Darren and Ezra were there. I said I'd have to stay in lounge and have a 'movie marathon' to keep cool. I decided to play games instead. I was telling Mom I'd have to go back soon because I couldn't handle the weather. Also there was a movie which kept changing to real life, where some weird stuff had happened and this lady was saying a spell calling 'Cloverfield' and then it showed this bridge and a giant foot step on it and start walking that way. We were going the other way through a tunnel. Clovie got there and it was actually a dinosaur and big, but not as big as Clovie. Then I was actually there and it roared at us and we ran and hid, but it found us and we continued running. Then I was at this house. A person gave me a key and said it was for the door in the kitchen -- there was a trapdoor in the ceiling. A clone of this girl was there. There was something to do with Lost."
"4019"	"(2013-11-27 (22)) I was staying at a hotel thing with Granma and others, but I was sharing a room with her. I walked out at one point and then came back in and saw Simon Pegg leaving looking a bit dishevelled. I went to walk down some stairs and I saw Stephen Merchant. He was very tall. He was with a lady and picked her up and carried her down the stairs. I took pics and was excited about seeing him. I ran to the room and got the number wrong - went to 140 - and knocked and then quickly ran to 145 and knocked. A lady came out of 140 and looked around and went back in. I went into the room and it kept changing between Mom and Granma. I told her about the people I'd seen. I also saw Robert Webb at one point and there'd been some scandal video thing - someone told me that some actress had given him a blowjob, but I looked it up and it was actually him being forced to give another guy a blowjob. He started crying during it and I was like 'how is this porn, this is a torture video'. Then Mom had a room there and we could see into it. I had a flask thing that was steaming. Granma was like wtf and it was some illegal thing, so I tried to give a signal to Mom and she realised. Granma realised and called me like a traitor. I went on Facebook and was looking at photos of Dan Palmer and there was a comment by a girl called Christine Murray saying 'I'm his girlfriend' and my heart sank. I was looking at her photos and there were heaps of them together and also check-in's in London - at her place, I assumed. There was also this weird little frog and when I waved at it, it smiled excitedly and then jumped on me. It was then a frog-cat thing and I was wondering when it became possible for those to breed."
"4020"	"(2013-12-01 (22)) I was on Facebook and someone had commented on a status saying something about me liking Dan Palmer, Kit Harington and Benjamin - but not quite so obviously and then Dad posted saying something like 'you like Dan Palmer, Kit Harington and Benjamin at the same time?' but had tagged Dan Palmer and had also said something about the number of people. I untagged Dan Palmer and it showed who had seen the post and he hadn't and I was like thank god. I went to add him to people who couldn't see the post but he didn't come up. I went to search for him and he didn't come up. I checked my friend count and it was 61 (one less) and I realised he must've deleted and blocked me and I assumed it was because of that and I was really annoyed."
"4021"	"(2013-12-05 (22)) I was out with Benjamin at like a cinema, or a place where there was one cinema. He had found some film club which was like £100 a movie that he wanted to go to. One was on today -- it was Les Miserables. I was annoyed because I didn't want him doing it. We were in a building but just outside the cinema thing, eating at a table. He got up and was gone for ages and I went into the cinema to find him. I couldn't, so I went back out and he came back like what's up. I felt silly. We went to some cafeteria type place which had lots of tourists. They kept moving the tables and chairs around. I sat down and Benjamin was still standing and two girls started talking to him. One sat next to me and started talking. He asked where she was from and how long she'd been here. She said '2 weeks and for 6 weeks altogether'. I said I'd been here 6 months and she asked if I had a passport and I said yes and she was like 'oh you're lucky'. Eventually, Benjamin and I sat together somewhere. He signed his name with his right hand and I was like 'why are you using your right hand'. He looked at me incredulously and said he signed his name with his right hand, but it looked like he was embarrassed about being left handed? We were talking and joking etc. At some point we kissed but nothing seemed weird and we were walking around flirting and messing about. It was nice and I was happy."
"4022"	"(2013-12-13 (22)) I was at a cinema or bar thing. I might've worked there? But maybe not working at the moment. A group of four guys came in and stood in front of me, looking nervous. They had hats/sunnies on. I recognised them - one was Bradley Cooper, and the other three were famous friends of his. I waved and joked about them looking dodgy (though it was something witty). I chatted to them and said there was a little booth thing away from everyone else and showed them where. They started messing about in there. It was dark, but I tried to get a sneaky pic. Bradley Cooper got peed off at some point and stormed out. Someone suggested it was because I took a pic, but I showed them my phone which was on the forum and said I hadn't (they believed me - though I actually hadn't managed to get a pic). On the way out, I saw Richard Ayoade and a bunch of people said his name in this weird way as some kind of in-joke. I went outside. A lady was walking around and one side of her face looked weird, like she had a really sagging eye. Someone called out 'Deborah [something] ' and she was an actress who had been in low-budget horror films, one was a cult favourite that I hadn't seen but had heard of. She was still young though. Someone asked if it was her and I said something about Dan Palmer having said something about her. Then Dan Palmer was there but I didn't recognise him at first because he was dressed up like a goth/tranny? It wasn't until he started talking that I realised it was him (the 'r' impediment). Also, I got a text from Kiersten saying the room had been booked and was really nice (we staying somewhere overnight/couple nights). There was one big bed and then on the other side of the room there were two smaller, but slightly bigger than single, beds. Lukas also text me about it."
"4023"	"(2013-12-14 (22)) I lived in a weird house with Julian Barratt and two others (one was a girl, but I can't remember the other one). I had a huge crush on Julian and everyone knew (including him), but he didn't seem to be interested. There were also these people who sat outside my window all the time, two were dressed in animal costumes (a cat and a fox?). They creeped me out and I always kept my curtains pulled to, but each window had its own curtain and it didn't fill the entire window. Mostly I just ignored them. My room was big and had two single beds over each side (one next to the windows and the other one next to wall, where door was). One day something happened and we had sex, but I think he was forced into it? We didn't speak about it and kept on as usual. Two of these people were girls, one who did stuff for me and one who was nice and perky, but she kept flirting with Julian. One day I got sick of it and I told the other girl to get rid of her. Then these chimes kept going all night, so I had to take them down and put them away. I also talked to the people outside once and asked why they were here. They said to monitor the relationship with Julian? The guy in the fox suit was called Tom. I went out and walked down street and hadn't really paid attention to what was around before. There was this big gelato shop with weird flavours and stuff was around £2.50-3.00. Some blue ice-cream, other weird colours and flavours. Nothing really interested me though, so I left. Back home, Julian was complaining to one of the girl's about something and I walked in and was like what and he was like 'I NEED TO FUCK' and he seemed frustrated and annoyed. I was thinking like 'dude, I'm right here and up for it'. He then seemed to realise and started motioning for me to go into my room."
"4024"	"(2014-01-16 (22)) I was with Ezra and someone. We were in a car and Mom was driving. I was in the front. I was doing some project where we had to ask people for stories and determine the theme. We knew Michael Fassbender somehow. We pulled up at a house and Ezra asked him for a story and he started telling one but it sounded weird and Mom picked up that it was a joke or film or something. I was then like 'oh no, it has to be about balance'. They all went back to the car and I was still inside with Fassbender. He asked me a few things about the project. My question was to either write about a western or a Yoshida film (it wasn't the actual Yoshida, though I went on Skype later and was like 'guess who I have to write about?'). I walked back to the car and went around to the passenger side and Fassbender went to the other side and I asked if he wanted to sit in the front and Ezra said 'yeah' and I said 'I'm not talking to you', but Fassbender was fine being in the back."
"4025"	"(2014-01-17 (22)) I was on Skype with Benjamin and he changed his profile picture to one of him which he had taken with his laptop and at a low angle, with a weird smirk on his face and looked a bit different. Behind him was a cupboard/shelf thing with a few bits and pieces on it -- one of them was a trophy of a hand giving the finger. Later, the picture changed to a video in real time and I clicked on it trying to work out what was happening and it tried to video call him and I cancelled it. Then it changed to this film he had been in. It was set in older times with farmers. He was in those ratty farmer type clothes [Hobbit-like] and he was lying on the grass with one of those wheat things in his mouth talking about how great the day had been. There was a girl lying next to him. Then it was real life, but it was in the present and I was there. He was talking to these two girls and I kind of walked off, but he re-joined me. It was night. We walked for a bit and then I was suddenly in this long dark hall at the door. Benjamin was outside on the porch and knocked. I looked out this little slot in the side but saw there were these two ghosts. They were cartoonish but had armour and swords. He was fighting them off and I was too scared to let him in. I saw this furnace in the door and switched it on and they melted. I let him in, but it was pitch black inside and spooky. I found the light and then we went into this room and there were computers and computer parts everywhere, as well as books. At some point, I realised it was a dream and was looking at this shelf of books and noted how similar they all were -- they also all had the same title, but I've forgotten what it was."
"4026"	"(2014-01-19 (22)) I was a hobbit? I was with some other hobbits or whatever and we were at the place they meet Bard in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The boat was there and we went into the water and hid behind a ledge, but when he came he saw them and started swimming out to them. I stayed hidden and when he came past, I grabbed him. He was heavy and bigger than me so I had trouble and kept falling underwater. There was an underwater tunnel that the others went through and I pulled him through with me. Somehow he realised I wasn't going to hurt him but he was still cautious. We were in this underground little house thing. I was sitting with him in a bath (both clothed) explaining that we needed him to help us and he agreed to help. We left and walked up this big ledge thing and had to jump to the other side. One guy did and missed and fell but was ok, even though it was high. I grabbed the ledge and pulled it down and landed on the ground and flung back up. It was then a game which was like an advert I'd seen on TV that was set on a beach. One side had this pecking bird thing and has three holes where some animal thing would pop its head out and you would hit it. The other side had a cat which would hit them with its paw. It said you could win money, though I figured it would be like 'you win this much if you sign up with this site and pay money'. I did it anyway and it said I won over £100 (I had a bunch of them to hit, maybe eight, and each one said the amount I earned; I saw £30 for a few of them. I opened the thing to get my prize and it was all coins. I was with another person trying to work out how to carry the money -- we put it in a bag, which we put into another bag."
"4027"	"(2014-01-19 (22)) John Cusack and I were in some group of thieves or something. Catherine Zeta Jones was also part of our group. Cusack was supposed to grab like $78 million for us, but he took it and ran. Sometimes it changed into a movie and there was a scene of him driving down a road in a car at full speed and then leaping into another one, with the old car crashing. We caught up with him at this place. We searched everywhere for him but couldn't find him. Finally we were at the last place to look. There were two playgrounds, but they were like houses. He wasn't there. The guy that was in charge was getting angry. In the smaller playground, we found Cusack's 'wallet', and the guy got excited and thought he found cash but it was just cut outs of puzzles from newspapers. I saw a ladder leading up to a window in the house next door. I wanted to wait until the others left before going up, but they seemed determined to stay and search the place. It got later and I heard old video game noises (pew pew pew) coming from the room. I gave the impression I was leaving and went behind this thing and then climbed up the ladder into this boy's room. He asked if I was looking for the other person that had climbed through and I said yes and he said he was in the basement under the bed and was bleeding. I lifted the carpet up and slid under it and went under the bed to find him. But then it was just under this bed and he said hi. A younger kid came in and said ""What are the shadows doing? I can't sleep"" and we tried to be quiet. He asked if the others knew he was there and I said no. I saw blood under him. There were pads and I opened one and he said they were noisy and I tried putting it on the cut but realised I had it around the wrong way. Then I heard a noise like people climbing through a window. We were now downstairs under a bed. He jumped up and walked to the front door. He looked out the window and saw them. It was now night. He got ready to open the door and we ran out -- it was now day. They shot at us and we ran for this van thing. I yelled asking how to get in and he said 'the window' and I shouted 'which window?'. I smashed one and tried to jump in (it was in slo-mo) but my boobs were too big to fit in, so I unlocked the lock and got in. He drove off. I was bleeding from the broken glass. Then it was raining and I was washing away some of the blood. He said 'you're not going to die, are you?' half joking and I said I was fine."
"4028"	"(2014-01-22 (22)) I was on PirateBay but it was the freeway. There was a guy advertising his game, not a torrent, but for like $6. I watched a trailer and it was a racing game so I wasn't interested, but then I saw it had Diddy Kong Racing characters, so I bought it. There was a bit where you race these hovercraft things over water and then a giant lizard tries to get you (the 'boss' was called Swamp Thing 2). At the start of the game you are in a room with shelves and empty boxes. The game was all happening in real life. The lizard attacked and the controls were weird. I killed it and then nudged it, but it was just sleeping. Then I had to tiptoe through a room full of dogs and cats sleeping. I got outside and a kitten came up to me. It looked sick so I was careful patting it. I talked to Layla and she said she had played it and it was hard. I was messing around with the settings and then Mom came running out in a towel saying 'you're up?' and ran into this dark building/room which was a bathroom, and threw her towel off and ran into the darkness. Then it was real life and I was near a store which was called Svengen. There were mailboxes and I'd left some Maltesers in one. I went up to it and it was number 361. A guy was opening 360. I pulled out the Maltesers and he handed me a $5 note and I went 'huh?' and he smoothly put it into his box and said 'what, I'm just putting $5 into my box'. I said ok and left. Julian Barratt was my boyfriend and I went up to him and he said it was probably a drug deal and said to be careful (to 'act natural' because the guy looked dangerous). We had an arm around each other and we were talking and giggling and he kissed me a few times. The guy was nearby and I felt uncomfortable. We went into the store and walked to the other side and then heard it was getting held up. A guy was talking about how he'd rape some woman 'even though she was Native' and I was worried they would rape me, so I ran to this door and ran out. I ran down one way but then back tracked and snuck past. I had no pants on. Julian was still in there and slowly edging towards the door and I wondered why I left him. I was walking past the first road I'd been on so I didn't walk past the front of the store and get the guy's attention. I saw a bunch of people run out of the store and realised they were free. They kept running though. It was getting dark (dusk-ish). A cute, but odd-looking, guy was walking down the street. He stared at me with a grin and came over to me. I started panicking but then I saw Julian at the end of the street and he ran towards me and the guy left. We hugged and I apologised for leaving. Then I was at home which was like the old house. It was dark and apparently a murderer was around. I found Mom's head and a brain in the microwave. I assumed it was fake and was looking for a trickster. I found Ezra and I told him and he looked at them and the microwave was on and he stopped it and implied there was a murderer around and that they were real. I freaked out and grabbed a knife from the kitchen. There was something to do with a horror film which was fairly popular and well-known within the horror crowd. It was playing on TV. Ezra cut out some carpet and found a hole full of horror movie posters selling for £70. We weren't really talking because Ezra said the killer was probably around. We got split up and I text him saying we should meet somewhere to talk. I got a text later from 'Lukas' saying we should meet at Svengen, 'it's where everyone used to meet before Facebook' and I was like wtf. Then I had another text from an unknown number about something related, but different. I assumed this meant either Ezra was the killer or the killer was taunting me by having many people's phones (having killed them). I was hiding in my room and all the lights were off now and it was very dim. The door kept getting gently pushed open. I was really scared and started crying. I got the knife ready and the next time it happened I stabbed them and got them. They started crying out and it was Ezra. I opened the door and he'd gone into Dad's room and was sitting on the bed. I kept stabbing him and he kept saying stop and then the lights came on and he had stab wounds all over him and one big upward gash across his stomach/chest. He said he thought I was the killer and then there was a creepy laugh in the distance and a light turned off and I realised he wasn't the killer and I'd just injured the only help that I had. I had an intense feeling of dread and fear."
"4029"	"(2014-01-26 (23)) I got a message from Dan Palmer all in lower case like 'after that naughty post you need a spanking'. I was confused. I was talking to Benjamin on Skype and said I got a bizarre message but he ignored me and kept talking about Spain. I tried to post on Skype crew and no-one was replying and I didn't know how to respond."
"4030"	"(2014-02-04 (23)) I went to The Room screening [going to one this week] . I got there early before the movie to get autographs and photos. I got Tommy Wiseau to sign my stuff and Dad's stuff. I had a photo with him and he had his face pressed against mine and drooled on my face. He was really strange. Later there was a big crowd and Greg Sestero wandered in. I was stalking to him and gave him Dad's stuff to sign -- Wiseau had written 'happy birthday Dad!' and Sestero copied it. I gave Greg the book to sign. James Spader was on the cover. He started tracing his face quickly and also wrote 'James Spader' and did all this weird stuff to it. He was joking around and laughing and then Mom came in and I told her who he was and she said 'oh yeah, The Room sounds good'. I said it was. I was making jokes about that and laughing. I wanted to ask for a photo but I felt awkward now."
"4031"	"(2014-02-22 (23)) I was out with Ron and Hermione from Harry Potter, and someone else. There was a waterfall with water going 'in' (it was going straight down, but then there was a gap and then more water). There was also some rope going across up high and I said I dreamt I walked it. There was a fruit section and I put a fork in the bit where the prices go and ants started climbing all over it. I went 'urgh' and chucked it away and told Hermione. She said that's where the ants came from. Somehow I got her and Ron to realise they liked each other and they had this long stare and then as we walked back to the car she pecked him behind a bush. We got in the car silently. We were all sitting in the back. Another person was driving. We took off and they took their seat belts off and started making out. The person in the front saw and was shocked but didn't say anything and I tried not to laugh. Then he told them to put their seatbelt back on. Then Dad and I had a month left in the UK to do stuff. I was annoyed because I had nowhere to stay. We were walking around and I forgot my suitcases. I kept telling Dad we needed somewhere to stay and he was like 'we can just keep walking around'. We went to the Prince Charles and it was different. The Room was still showing. The place was massive and I had heard The Evil Dead was playing soon and I wondered if we'd be there for it. I went looking for my suitcase and found a plastic bag outside a flat with a power cord in it. A lady answered the door and needed to go to the hospital so we took her. She thanked us and said she'd found my suitcase and kept it for us and would let us stay with her."
"4032"	"(2014-02-28 (23)) The Queen and the rest of the royal family were staying at Target. I was in there for some reason and talking to Harry and for some reason we liked each other so he asked me to stay too. I can't remember the exact details, but I met the Queen and was just casual with her. Later, someone had planted a bomb. I got out and ran and got in a car and drove off and then in the background this massive store collapsed."
"4033"	"(2014-03-01 (23)) Dan Palmer announced on Facebook that he was moving to the USA with his fiancee/wife to start a family."
"4034"	"(2014-03-02 (23)) I stepped on this thing and it hurt my foot. I was screaming in pain and Mom pulled it out and it was just this little hook on a metal rod and she asked why I was crying so much. Then she pulled out more and it turned into this big metal grabber thing [I watched Doctor Who last night, the episode with the metal things] . I wondered what I'd stepped on. I was later in this room with a few bees. I built a fake bee hive outside to draw them out but someone opened the door and they came in. I tried to get the cats away so they didn't get stung. I was looking after a bag of GBCS ID's and someone put them over the important bee thing and when I took it off more came. Hector was around."
"4035"	"(2014-03-02 (23)) I found a poster for Frozen 2 -- which had ice, someone hanging from a chairlift and Rover standing on the ice. I showed it to Mom and she was like 'oh yeah, he was shy' etc. I wondered how Rover got involved but didn't end up asking. The cast included James Van Der Beek and Joshua Jackson and Mom said I should get them to sign it and I said 'just because our dog is on the poster doesn't mean we're going to get invited to cast parties'. But then I was in the movie. There was a farmhouse type of thing in the middle of nowhere. I was there with James and Joshua and this girl. We were in a bedroom chatting and laughing. They had found me and we had already known each other but they were helping me out or something. The place was attached to a clothes shop. I heard bad people coming. They told me to put my shoes on so I did. I asked if anyone had a spare coat or something because I had none. I looked around the store for something, but I couldn't find anything and we had to leave. I ran out and ended up at this church thing. Mom and Dad were there. Dad was in the 'pews' (it wasn't a real church but looked like it, with the pews and the thing at the front). Mom was at the front and she was showing everyone how to wash this shower. I think she was bluffing to trick the bad guys or something. I was sitting with Dad. Mom made hamburgers but gave me one with a bun. George Clooney came in and joked around with me for some reason (his voice was very distinct and clear) and when he came back around he gently kicked my leg and I grabbed his leg with my legs and pretended to wrestle. He laughed and then said we should get a meal later. Dad was like you should do it and I was confused."
"4036"	"(2014-03-12 (23)) Somehow I was in the inner circle of some US Government thing and I was having an affair with Obama. At first it was like his son and he was in his 30s, but then I think it was him. At one point I was meeting him in this hotel room and I had a key. I knew people were following me and all the locks were greyed out except for the last one and it worked. There was a just a bed, lounge and a TV. It was very basic (even the colour scheme was blah). There were people outside looking, but they left. Obama came and I said 'go' and he said to meet somewhere else and left. I was then somewhere else and he was on a stage with his wife and kids (he had 2 daughters and a son). I was talking to his wife and mother about stuff. Then I was on the stage too. Then I was someone else who he'd appointed vice president but then there was some lockdown thing happening because of a possible assassination and they chucked 'me' out and I was like 'you can't chuck out the vice president' but they were all like 'I'm the vice president now' and made me leave. They said I could take one item and Obama heard the ruckus and gave me this drawing he'd done of her/me one night. There was a flashback with this person who had purple and yellow paint down half of their face and all of their body. The left side of their neck and chest had thick black hairs, very spaced out and I was weirded out."
"4037"	"(2014-03-18 (23)) I was at Hillary's, but it was different. Lots of the shops were hiring, and were all clothes stores. I applied for a few and went to check my mail (still at Hillary's). There were two for me -- there were cushions inside with a sticker saying 'you suck' on them (and no to the job obviously). I went to university, which was different. It looked like a mansion thing. A lady said university was closed -- it was Easter Monday (which she called 'good Monday') and I'd forgotten it was closed that day. I went back home and realised I was working today at Cannington. It was almost 4pm and I started hurrying to get ready and told Mom and Darren I was leaving for Cannington and they were like 'oh god, you're going to be late' but I said I started at 5.30pm and they said 'oh you have plenty of time' [IRL, I'm working at Cannington tonight] . People on the forum were giving me directions. Quizzleygirl said there'd be a sign saying 'Quizzleygirl's 4 [km] ' and to turn there and the rest of it would be on foot. I did so. Then people from the forum were there. FlyingSquirrel had a disguise on and I was out of the room and he was talking to me, then took the mask off and he was like 80 (he looked very old) and I tried not to act surprised. He went back inside and I saw everyone sitting stunned. Benjamin was there and he looked at me through a window and I mouthed 'FlyingSquirrel' and he was like 'oh my god'. He came outside and then he was The Doctor (David Tennant). FlyingSquirrel was outside too, just a bit away from us. I thought something was dodgy. Something happened and he got younger (about 50). The Doctor hinted it was The Master again. Then I was his companion and was saying he couldn't kill him and there was a dead bird and the Doctor looked vengeful but picked up the bird and it came back to life; suggesting what he'd do to the Master. He also said something like 'remember, I didn't kill him') [IRL I'm rewatching Doctor Who and watched the Master episode last night] . I wondered if it meant FlyingSquirrel had been killed and the Doctor thought so."
"4038"	"(2014-03-30 (23)) I was at home or something and there was a massive spider thing skittering about. It had a 'tail' which dragged along. Someone else and I were on a bed and too scared to go down. It had a head on it that like had a human head inside it (an image, I think). There was some other creature as well which was rubbing its head on the spider. I grabbed this tennis racket thing and they grabbed this other thing and we hit it. I felt bad but we kept going until we thought it was dead. We tied rope around its head. Then it turned into a person and they were dying. It looked like Bill Bailey and he was a friend of ours and he confessed his love to me and I had just started going out with his friend who we worked with. We thought he was going to kill us or something, but then he was ok and we were in the shop we worked at. I knocked over a thing of flour and went to pick it up, but it spilt and I got flour on my hands. Bill Bailey was walking out and I deliberated on what to do and then went after him and tapped his back -- he was wearing a denim jacket -- and said 'it doesn't have to be weird'. He said 'I have to see you and [the other guy] falling in love every day' and I went silent. We went to this deli to get ice-cream -- I got a chocolate vanilla Cornetto thing. He tried to pay by card but they wanted the expiry date of this thing and he didn't have it. I had no money or anything on me either."
"4039"	"(2014-03-30 (23)) I was with The Doctor (David Tennant). We were close and possibly going to take it further. We had some other girl with us temporarily as well. We went back to the 40s, during the Nazi era. There was this blonde lady (about 40) who was evil and running some thing. She wasn't meant to be there, so the Doctor was trying to fix it. We were outside at night around these buildings and a market. Then we were in this underground lair place. We got separated and I got tricked and trapped in this room with lava. There were some places to stand but it was sinking. I was calling out for the Doctor and panicking. I jumped onto this lower platform and managed to get out of the room. I ended up with a lady and others following me and I ran and opened this door. The Doctor came and through and I realised he must've used me as bait. We got trapped somewhere else and she had this thing there which was like a red light preventing the sonic screwdriver from being used. There were blocks on the wall and they were all black except for a white one in the corner. It was Minecraft like and the screwdriver would work on the white one, so he pushed it back and we climbed through. It led into this hall and we climbed up a wall into this big room which was like a museum. The lady confronted us but didn't try to kill us. The Doctor was talking to her saying we had to take what we wanted and leave. I was wearing a coat and it got caught I considered leaving it, but I liked it so I unhooked it. The lady looked stunned and wanted to take all this jewellery, but couldn't. I didn't know why he was taking her with us. We opened a door and it led into the TARDIS, which looked totally different. It had a curved entryway and had a window which looked outside and was underwater. Apparently the TARDIS was parked underwater somewhere but this was a portal to it. Outside, two stingrays were swimming towards each other and the Doctor said they were mating. Then we left and the stingrays joined together and began mating. Then it was beavers and there was a sort of comedic British voiceover describing the mating and birth. At a certain point in the pregnancy, their heads changed and they looked like they were wearing a pointy white mask thing. Then it would fall off and she would give birth by swimming upwards and the baby beavers would just pop out, followed by the placenta."
"4040"	"(2014-04-05 (23)) I kept having nightmares that would go longer each time I slept. The 217 lady (The Shining) would appear and I would try to scream and nothing would come out. She would come towards me and eventually I would wake up. I was too scared to sleep."
"4041"	"(2014-04-06 (23)) I went to a forum meet-up. We were in a regular cinema seeing some movie but I'm not sure where we were. Quizzleygirl and Bignose were there. Initially I sat next to Big and I said 'hello, Bignose' but he ended up moving. I sat in the back row in the middle and no-one else was there. Benjamin was supposed to come but hadn't arrived yet. At the halfway point, he turned up and went staright to an empty seat next to Quizzleygirl. I was annoyed. Later he and someone else moved next to me. He was talking to the other preson and his arm was resting over my leg. I wondered what was going on. He moved it and later said a few words to me. After the movie, Quizzleygirl drowned or something. I took her out of the water and I was alone and I thought about just leaving her, but I thought I might as well give CPR a go and she came back on the first breath."
"4042"	"(2014-04-09 (23)) We had a group meeting but somehow we all forgot [have a group meeting today] . We accidentally bumped into each other at university (which was different) and we were like 'oh feck, the meeting', but then we were like 'let's do it tomorrow'. I distinctly remember Classmate-M-02, Classmate-M-05 and Classmate-F-13 (she asked me something). Classmate-M-05 was talking to me about something. We were outside near a car. Then later I was inside somewhere for work. I needed to get changed, so I went up an escalator to find the toilet. I went to go to the toilet and saw Classmate-M-02 and he went into the other toilet. I realised I'd gone into the men's and walked out as he walked out of the ladies and he laughed and said something like 'no I didn't, Izzy' and we went into the right toilet. I went into a cubicle which was large and the doors were up high. A girl and a guy outside could see in (they were young, like 13). They wouldn't leave and I ended up chasing them out and kicking the guy in the butt (gently-ish). There were lots of people in the toilet, it was very crowded. Later I kicked someone in the balls (jokingly, not hard) and they 'pickpocketed' me and took my wallet. I grabbed it and kicked them again and they took my phone. I took my phone back and was like 'my brother used to do that to say like 'don't take your eyes away from your stuff or people will take it''."
"4043"	"(2014-04-10 (23)) I was with Dad and he was taking me to this really posh shopping centre to meet his friend who owned the whole thing. It was very fancy and I was worried we'd get chucked out. The guy ran a clothes shop in there as well, so was in the office for that one. We went in and a black security guard stopped us and asked if we had an appointment and Dad was like 'we're friends' and we went in. The guy was Robert Downey Jr (not actually him, but he was 'played' by him). We sat down and said hello etc. Later, we caught him kissing a woman in a car. He was married as well so we were shocked and didn't know what to do. We interrupted him and the woman left. Then it was a movie and I was now a young girl who he'd been helping. He gave her a hug as his wife drove past and she assumed he was cheating on her with 'me'. I tried to tell her it was just a hug."
"4044"	"(2014-04-10 (23)) I drove to this restaurant thing and the first floor had collapsed, but second floor ok (no-one was on second floor). It was day time. I looked in at all the people stuck in the rubble and went back to the car. I heard giggling and a group of young people came up and said 'is Valerie in there' and I was like 'I dunno' and they said thanks for picking us up and I said I didn't and she said 'you will though' and I said 'I won't' and she said 'you will'. It was now night time and I turned on my lights. I locked my door and drove off - and saw them holding on behind. I drove crazily but it didn't knock them off. Eventually it did, but they followed and kept turning up. I was trying to find the freeway but didn't know where I was. I ended up near a hospital and called Mom and she said she was at Dad's and I said I was being stalked but she didn't have any suggestions. I got out and went into the hospital, and it was now day again. I was trying to navigate but it was difficult. There was an area underneath the hospital which had like airport shops."
"4045"	"(2014-04-17 (23)) I was in the Game of Thrones universe. Jon and Bran were there. Bran could walk. There was a castle thing. I was then in real life and some weird thing was happening. I was out the front at home at the curb near my car. I wasn't sure what the problem was, but something felt off. I kept seeing something in the corner of my eye and when I'd look I could see this creepy white kind of face making a noise like The Silence. It was fuzzy and would disappear when I looked away. It would only be visible sometimes. I went back inside and noticed it was silent. The house was different. There was a big screen door to get out the back and I could see 'shadows' of people who I kept referring to as 'the villagers'. They'd been 'taken'. I could see blurry colours and faint outlines of people but nothing substantial. I found Mom and was glad I found someone. Then the house was something else and there were a few more people. Someone touched one of the shadows/white things and an egg appeared in the air. I grabbed the egg and a purple splotch came out. Later, I touched one and there was another purple splotch. I noticed a shadow that became more real looking. I came across it again later and I realised it looked like clothes I would wear and it 'came through again' and it looked like me but had a tiny, badly cut fringe. I said 'you're me' and she said yeah but that she'd taken liberties during 'editing'. She couldn't be seen by everyone yet though."
"4046"	"(2014-04-21 (23)) I was at university having a meeting giving feedback about Genetic Engineering. Ms Foucault was hosting. There were only a dozen or so people and we were sitting on the floor. Everyone said there should be questions and learning objectives. Then I was in a study area thing. There were lots of long desks (2 chairs per long side and 1 on the ends). Stephen Merchant was there and did the 'boobs' calculator thing. I started laughing and couldn't stop and was like 'I'm studying genetic engineering right now and I'm laughing over 'boobs''. Later, I was in an office. It was dark outside, but was apparently morning. It was dirty -- there were lots of crumbs etc. The owner was complaining and asked where the cleaner was. Their assistant tried calling them and the owner went into the cleaning closet. They came back out and then the cleaner came out of the closet -- she was Hispanic and old-ish and I thought 'there's a stereotype'. She started cleaning and we realised she was blind. We were all kind of fascinated by this. The room we were in was like a waiting room with lounges and a coffee table. Later, Stephen Merchant came back and we were having sex on the lounge. He was on top of me and I came and he checked that I was done and then he kept going until he came [this 'followed through' IRL] ."
"4047"	"(2014-04-28 (23)) I was at home, but it was different and I think I lived with Dad. Something went wrong with the lock on the front door and it wasn't locking. It had been like that overnight but I'd only just realised. I said we had to get it fixed straight away because I was working tomorrow and wasn't going to leave it like that. We called over a lock dude. He was young (about my age) and chubby, but average looks. I was doing all the talking for some reason and taking care of it. He said he could do some today and come back in the morning to finish it (it had to 'set' or something). He was sort of flirting with me (though I wasn't sure if he was) and then he asked me out. I said no and he was just like ok and left (I was polite and he seemed ok, though hurt). The next day he came back and I'd written on my calendar two lines from the exchange and he was near the calendar and I thought 'feck, I don't want him to see that'. He didn't seem to notice (though I think he was pretending to not have seen it). I was paying with Dad's card and was at the computer/ATM thing with the guy. I needed Dad's account number and pin, so I called him to ask for it. He said his pin was like 1420 but it started breaking up and I couldn't hear him. I think I went to look for him and it turned out he'd been killed by the lock guy. I was like 'why did you kill him?!' and he said he thought it would convince me to go out with him and I was like 'you killed my Dad because you thought it'd make me go out with you?'. I then wondered if he'd read something of mine where I'd said I thought serial killers [in films] were hot. He did seem more attractive though. I ran away and he followed - but didn't seem like he was going to hurt me, he just seemed sad. It was dark outside now and I ran back to the house and turned on the light in the lounge room (it was like Dad's old house now), but it flickered and didn't come on. I tried turning on the other lights and nothing happened. I then thought it must be a dream, so I started shouting 'Turn on!' over and over and the light started getting brighter and then they were on. But then I 'woke up' within the dream and was telling Mom about the weird dream I just had where 'this guy was flirting with me and then killed Dad to make me go out with him'."
"4048"	"(2014-04-30 (23)) Portal had alternate endings. It didn't actually matter what you did, it would just give you a random ending. It showed up on a blackboard like in Antichamber which endings you'd seen. For one, the lab was on a spaceship. After Chell broke free, the engines/gravity thing were turned off and it began falling to Earth and would take 30 seconds. Then she woke up in bed and was young (maybe 12-ish). She had two sisters and a brother. She was trying to work out if this was a dream or if Portal had been a dream. People kept showing up in blue and orange clothes (sometimes it would be a person wearing both colours, other times it would be two people together). Then I was her and I'd recently watched Wishmaster 3 and 4, though it wasn't actually the Wishmaster films. Each sister was scared by a different film. I told them I'd recently watched them and one remembered a naked guy in her 'scary' one and I said it was the third one. In the third one, some weird stuff had happened and this naked guy ended up with this 'frozen' bit of jizz in the shape of a plate and was riding on it over a waterfall. Then I was at university, doing a film course. I had to do accounting and economics as 'essential electives'. After accounting, I was sitting with some friends. A guy came up to me and started talking to me saying his name was Kenneth (?) and had sat next to me in accounting. I was like 'yeah, whatever' and didn't even look up at him, though I didn't remember who had been sitting next to me. He was apparently flirting. He stayed friendly even though I ignored him and then left. My friends Facebooked him and he was 17 and Turkish. They said ""he didn't look 17!"" and I said ""yeah, and I'm not a pedophile"". There was also a movie which may have been Clerks 3, but it also kind of wasn't (didn't really follow any continuity except for Dante and Rosario Dawson's character being together). She had a nose piercing (between nostrils, like a bull) and was really scruffy looking. There was this whole story about Dante's childhood crush and best friend, whose name I've forgotten, but she moved away during early adulthood and drifted apart. She returned and so did his feelings. She obviously liked him too. At the end he was being sad in his room and sort of crying and she turned up at the window and said ""I love you"" and he said ""I love you too"" and I can't remember what happened next. Then it showed this 'after the credits' thing where it showed Kevin Smith revealing carvings on a floor that had 'his name <3 her name' and dated like 30 years ago or whatever and it'd been based on a true story."
"4049"	"(2014-05-02 (23)) I was at home, alone, late at night. There was a party going on next door, but it was weird. People kept turning up out the front trying to get in, or going out the back. Most realised it was the wrong house and went next door. One group of people tried to break in, even after they saw me. Then there was a guy - either we were sort of friends, or he had just come to help - trying to help keep them out. There were some lollies and chocolates - it was Halloween I think - and we'd been eating some of them. I noticed this snake and large centipede thing coming out of a cupboard. I dropped a bag of M&M's and they split open to reveal bugs inside. There were bugs in all of them and we were trying not to be sick. I text Mom at some point saying someone was trying to get in. Later I heard someone coming through the front door, so I grabbed a baseball bat and turned the corner and whacked the person on the head - but it was Darren, as they had come home as soon as they got my text."
"4050"	"(2014-05-03 (23)) In the audience for Stephen Colbert, but it was like a stand up thing. I think I knew him or worked there. He called me up on stage for something and I was wearing patoonkis. I sat on the stage like |_'- (or whatever you call that). He was doing some long quiz thing - he handed it out to everyone, including me, and we had to fill it out. It had random questions and basically wanted you to give funny answers but I couldn't think of any. I had recently started going out with this guy called Jeb? He wasn't really typical of my type, but he was decently attractive. There was an Asian restaurant thing that was only open for breakfast. It opened at 4am-9.30am I think. I was there at 5am one morning because I couldn't sleep. I was there with Mom, but then I was there with Jeb and maybe others. When I finished my food, I cleaned up my table (I think it was a recommended thing to do) and one of the ladies working there commented that everyone had cleaned their tables and saved them a lot of work. At some point, I hadn't seen Jeb for a while and was getting worried that he was bored with me. He worked with/knew Colbert, and I mentioned this to him and he talked to Jeb for me. Apparently he had just been busy and was also having trouble 'restraining' himself from going further and I was like 'I don't mind if he doesn't'. I met up with him later and we were in a store, going up an escalator."
"4051"	"(2014-05-14 (23)) I went to see Grayson, whose office was at Westland University. I went past his office and he wasn't in there so I kept walking but turned back and then he was. He looked completely different and I was thinking that I didn't remember him looking like that. He had very short brown hair. I knocked on the door and wasn't sure if he heard me so knocked again as he looked over from his chair (his desk facing outward). I said I wanted to get another work shirt and he said there was a special on to get 2 for cheaper so I said ok. He asked my name and I said 'Izzy Conell' and he didn't seem to recognise the name at all and I thought that was weird. He said ""are you sure you're a medium?"" and I said I'd try on the shirt just to make sure (I wondered why he assumed medium). I took it and went to find a toilet to change in. I was walking really slowly and had trouble moving. When I went back he asked a question like 'if Jesus said he was going to come back in 4 days and [something that I misheard as 'because the world was ending'] would you keep working?' and I was confused and said if there was work to be done, I'd do it. He wrote something down and then I left. I was telling someone about it a while later and they said he'd been asking it to everyone and the question was actually 'if Jesus said he was going to come back in 4 days and give everyone millions of dollars..'. No-one understood why he was asking."
"4052"	"(2014-05-17 (23)) Portal 2 had a bunch of randomized endings. You had to 'roll' for them and each one had either a good one or bad one (eg, in one version you'd die, in another you'd live). I can't remember it very well, but the one I got (it was all text btw) had something to do with Wheatley's insides? I think his insides were getting put into something else and I was thinking 'I wouldn't mind Wheatley's insides, what the hell am I thinking?'."
"4053"	"(2014-05-17 (23)) We were at home, though it sometimes wasn't. Layla said she needed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (book) for something for school. Granma gave her Alice in Wonderland and she was like wtf and I took it and gave her my copy of Cuckoo's Nest. Then she said the thing she was doing was about courage or something and I gave her the Alice in Wonderland book for her friend. Later, I think we were at Nana's. Mom and Dad were both there. Nana gave me some McDonald's and said 'hopefully it's still warm' and I said 'when did you get it' and she said 'yesterday' [she had heated it up] . There was a 'graduation' for the year 12's of my year going on in one room but I didn't want to join them."
"4054"	"(2014-05-19 (23)) Brienne (Game of Thrones) was being forced to work at the gallows? She didn't like it though. It was at a castle which I didn't recognise and I was there too. Jaime came on a horse and had a fight with Cersei and then left angrily on his horse. Had to wait for gates to open and then took off. I was later at an outside area, which was undercover, next to a river thing. Restaurants etc. I was sitting at a bench next to the river doing something. I had my laptop with me as well. This lady told me that they had better Wifi on this side and that between certain hours you could download as much as you wanted. I was like ok, but she kept hassling me. Eventually I left with two friends of mine and got in a car (who sat in the front), and we picked up two strangers (a couple) as well (who we had met briefly, but didn't know). We drove for some time and were going through some country road with mountains and stuff. The wifi and car began to sputter and the driver said to lock our doors (apparently this was a 'common-ish' happening. People using EMPs to stop cars and then mugging the people [EMP thing possibly reference to Godzilla which I saw the other day] ). I realised the two strangers hadn't locked their doors and I thought it was suspicious but I leaned over and locked it, she unlocked it and I said to the driver that it was ""an inside job"" and he said ""I know"". I grabbed my laptop bag and another bag I had and when the car stopped I got out. Everyone else heaped their stuff into a pile for them to take and I started walking. They were like 'where do you think you're going? Put your stuff over there' and I said 'no'. The guy started coming towards me and told me to give it to him and I said ""I would rather kill you than give you my laptop"" and he pulled out a 'knife' but it was actually a plastic fork. He kept coming closer to me and I reached for it and snapped the top off (it wasn't a perfect fork btw, it was wide and had big forky bits). He just looked at me confused and I tried to stab him in with it but it barely did anything. He laughed and said you had to make more than a surface wound. So I sliced it down his arm and then started cutting into his face. Then I wrote 'I am 69' on across his forehead and on the top 'DOOM' and I think I wrote 'gay' on there. Kept cutting into him and stabbing him and then he was just bleeding from everywhere [I rewatched Scream last night, possible influence] . Then I was at a shop and it was about 6-ish and I bought this ice-cream which had a cool name like 'fluffy bunny' and it was round-ish. The guy from before was following me and he made a reference that it was a real bunny, so I took a big bite of it and made a 'so there' face. I pulled the bunny bit out of my mouth to check though and it was just like a little fluffy bunny toy. I thought it was a weird idea for an ice-cream, but it was soft and delicious. I kept walking and he was sometimes following. I found a Donut King and was looking at their donuts [yesterday I really wanted donuts] and the two girls behind the counter were talking ignoring me and then just turned it all off. Everywhere was closing. At the end of the store was a Big W and I saw Ben & Jerry's ice-creams but their lights were turned off and they were closing, so I walked back to leave. When I got back in my car, it was then like a 90s video game. I was driving and had people following (people who were angry about me killing this guy, because they didn't believe it was self-defence and they loved this guy for some reason) and were trying to stop me getting home. There was a map on the corner of the screen showing where I was and all the other dots for the other people (lots of them). The controls were annoying and it was hard to drive, also only had the four camera angles. I wasn't sure whether to drive home because they'd know where I lived, but as I drove I realised this game only had one location you could drive to. They kept trying to run me off the road. Then there were flashbacks to before I killed the guy; we had an AI called EDI [been playing Mass Effect 2] and she was talking to us in this room with a container thing in the middle with swirly light in it (my mind is a blank, like a 'core' or something). She seemed cautious about the guy, telling us in private, but then when he was present she 'jokingly' referred to him as 'Mr Doom' so I started calling him that. The core or whatever was unstable and the surrounding power started to glow and I yelled at EDI to fix it, calling her Wheatley at one point."
"4055"	"(2014-05-22 (23)) I was going out with Stephen Merchant, though he was younger. We went on a trip with Mom, Ezra and a friend of his. Everyone kept changing around though, sometimes Ezra's friend was a girlfriend, sometimes Steve was my girlfriend and sometimes Mom was 'her' mother. Anyway, I can't really remember where we were or why we were there. Mom made these muffins and she went off to do something and we were eating one each. I had a chocolate one and I said it was really dry. Ezra and his friend had a bag of weed and stuffed some into their mouths. They gave me and Steve a pinch and said it wouldn't really do anything and went off laughing. Steve and I looked at each other and were like *shrug* and ate it. We hadn't had sex yet but wanted to and planned to try and do it on this trip. We went off to the bedroom, but it was two bunks. Ezra and his friend were wrestling on one bunk. Steve and I kissed, but then next thing I knew, I woke up to Mom checking our hair and mouths crazily (looking for pot). I was on the floor and Steve on the bunk. My head felt weird and I just sort of looked around confused. Also, earlier there had been a 'pop-up' to choose between one thing or a free meth lab (think like Tropico 4), and I chose the meth lab because it was free. Steve, who was then not really Steve, was unemployed and poor etc. He was using the meth lab to try and get some money. There was a big bag of powder which he said he had 'found' and I was worried it had been stolen and people would try to get it back. Later, I was working somewhere on first shift with Esther and Hector. I had to park near the staff parking, which was underground and near a pool. I walked up and there were a bunch of photographers waiting for something. Esther and Hector were there and I joined them. We had to watch some announcement before we could go in. There was also this big ball that had been found on Mars and people had unravelled it (it was like metal strings) and it turned into a piano."
"4056"	"(2014-05-26 (23)) I had been out and came home at night. I pulled up in driveway in Mom's usual spot and then apparently fell asleep. I woke up some time later to Mom checking on me. I got out and was saying that it was pretty dangerous and stupid of me to fall asleep in my unlocked car, but then my bed was outside, next to the steps and this was normal. I got into bed and Mom was talking to me still. I briefly thought it was strange that I had my bed outside, but didn't think more of it. Ezra was there too. Three Hispanic looking guys walked past the house and up the driveway to the house behind us, looking at us through the side. We thought it was weird, so went inside. I was walking down the hall and then saw them running through the gate as Mom slammed the wood door shut. She said ""oh my god, one of them has a knife!"" They were banging and trying to get in. I went into my room and called the cops. I was speaking really calmly and I was worried they'd think I was lying."
"4057"	"(2014-05-26 (23)) I went to some nightclub thing. It was a bit strange though. It was near closing or past closing and we were still in there. There was me, Mom and Ezra. We went to the toilet and the doors were all closed, but they'd just been pushed to. Mom went into a cubicle and I went to the one next to it. Ezra decided to go to one as well. Then a lady who worked there came in and I put the lid down and stood on top of it because I thought she was dodgy. Mom made a noise, but the lady ignored it and went straight into my cubicle. I ran out. We all got back together somehow and I was saying that I'd read about something or other where it's a maze to get out of and they 'take' you. This place didn't look that difficult to get around so I wondered why this would be the place, but then the lights flickered and went out. I'm not sure what happened next but I was captured as well as a friend of Ezra's called Cody something. The people were saying that originally we were going to be paired together, but they swapped us around so that I would be with Stephen Merchant (who they had captured a few days before). I kept asking why we were paired up but no-one answered me. I was thinking 'well, I might die but at least I get to be with Stephen Merchant'. We got moved to some place where a whole bunch of us were crammed in and walking fast. Stephen Merchant was there and I was asking him what happened to us and where they were taking us but he said he didn't know (also, he looked a lot younger). Then were in a big cabin thing in the woods. There was a big room full of beds and lounges. We each had a bag of stuff and had to pick a bed. I waited for Steve to walk over to a bed, and he went with this soft one near the window in the back of the room. There was a paired-lounge across the wall. He put his bag on it and started taking stuff out when this guy put his bag on the bed and I said 'that's our bed' and he was like 'I was here first'. I jumped on the bed and said 'no, he just put his bag on the lounge which goes with this bed and we were already taking our stuff out so we were here first' and the guy begrudgingly left. I was still trying to work out why they needed us and why we were paired up with someone. Some theories were they were going to 'breed' something, sacrifice us, use us as food or combine us."
"4058"	"(2014-05-27 (23)) I went to the Prince Charles (though it was different and like outside). Stephen Merchant was standing outside for some event and I took a picture from far away. People were going up to him for photos and stuff and I wanted to go up but was deliberating because I was nervous."
"4059"	"(2014-05-29 (23)) The XFM shows were recorded at this place overlooking the ocean. It was a see-through booth, and I'd go every day and sit next to them and just stare at Steve. I think it was only Ricky and Steve there. I wasn't sure if they even knew I was there because they never acknowledged me, so then I wondered if I had actually been going there every day or if I just imagined it. Anyway, on this one particular day, Ricky left and Steve started talking to me about Die Hard. He said he hadn't seen Die Hard 2 and asked me what it was like (although in my mind, I was thinking of Scream 2). I said that I liked it, but the first one was better. I then realised they were still on air as well and I got nervous and didn't know how to speak (my voice was coming out really weird and monotone)."
"4060"	"(2014-05-29 (23)) I still lived at Dad's old place. I was home alone during the day and just messing about in my room. I heard this weird noise and got up to check but didn't see anything, so went back to my room. I heard it again and again, found nothing. The third time I heard it, I happened to peek into the laundry and saw a man coming through a cat door (we had a cat door in the laundry, but on the side next to where the freezer was, and one on the back door). He had tufts of curly grey hair. I started shouting 'what the hell do you think you're doing?' and he saw me and quickly backed out and ran off. I banged on the door, still shouting. I grabbed a phone and couldn't remember the number for the local police and then I was trying to decide whether I should just call emergency police in case he came back or if I should call Mom or Dad. I went back to the laundry to find him coming in again and I again, started shouting and he backed out and just stood there. I opened the door and tried to find something to scare him with, but picked up a piece of broken glass and slit his throat with it. He fell to the ground and died, blood everywhere. I dropped the glass and went inside. Then there was a knock on the door. There were two men claiming to be from a phone company, but they looked dodgy and had a van in the driveway with no markings. I told them to 'fuck off' and slammed the wood door. I called Mom and asked if she was home and could come round but she wasn't. I said ""I heard a noise and there was a man coming through the cat door in the laundry, so I slit his throat. There are two dodgy guys hanging around outside."" but she didn't seem to really care.  They started making their way out the back, so I went back to the laundry and grabbed the glass and slit another one's throat. Then suddenly the other guy fell back and I saw a guy standing near the shed, who'd thrown a knife at the guy. He said he was a vampire and would take care of the bodies. I was confused, but said ok and went back inside."
"4061"	"(2014-05-30 (23)) There were these big bubbles and I was filming Spaceman eating them in slow motion. They were thick bubbles, so it took a few seconds to burst. Then, it was Rover and he was trying to get this bug in the corner of this ledge up high. Suddenly, this bat grabbed his head and latched on. I was freaking out and poking it with a stick and trying to get it off."
"4062"	"(2014-06-05 (23)) I was having a dream within a dream. I was at a beachside type of centre, sitting at a table on a deck facing the beach. There was a bird 'humming' a song. Each time it finished, it would start again and the song would be slightly more 'complex'. Eventually it had lyrics etc. In the dream, they were very clear and I was thinking I had to write them down as soon as I woke up [but I forgot when I woke up] . It was only a short song, like a verse and a chorus. I 'woke up' at some point. There was a video of some teens at this old temple type of place and one fell through a 'window' onto this big statue and knocked it over. They were screaming and then he jumped up holding the head and they all laughed. Was back in London at my flat. It was different though and looked like our old place in Parkville. I was there temporarily to gather my stuff and they were letting me stay there for free. I could hear Kiersten and Lukas arguing in the room next door. There was a girl staying there and apparently didn't get along with Darnell. She was really weird and seemed to spy on everyone. She was subtly making fun of me and started singing some 'embarrassing' song I had been listening to and I just shrugged and said I liked it. Later, I was somewhere else. An Irish guy called Nils was talking to me and we were trying to work something out. Dmitri was there and I mentioned that I used to like him. He then asked me ""what is your Nils like?"" and I asked 'what?' and he repeated it but was speaking really fast and I couldn't understand what he was saying. On the third repeat I said ""what does that mean?"" and he said ""you know, the guy you're shagging?"" and I said ""he doesn't exist"" and he said ""really?"" and I said ""yes, now let's get back to this.."""
"4063"	"(2014-06-09 (23)) I was at home, though it occasionally flipped between looking like the old house, looking like it does and being slightly different. I had two sisters (one was Haley from Modern Family [been watching it lately] ). Ezra was there as well. We could hear some weird noises and looked outside to see these flying things whooshing about. I kept looking and one started coming towards us and it was a hot air balloon full of teenage girls. They pulled out their cameras when they saw me and I quickly went back inside and locked the door. They landed out the front and came up to the door trying to get my attention. I told everyone to ignore it and they would go away. Darren opened the door and said hello and chat to them briefly. One girl said they were looking for ""a down syndrome"" and I thought they must've been doing a checklist thing. Mom and Darren left to walk Rover at around 9/10pm. We had a big mattress in the living room (it now looked like the old place) and the sisters and I were sitting on it, talking. It got later and later and they still hadn't returned. We were starting to get worried and I questioned calling the police but didn't. Then it looked like home again and it had been hours and I decided to go for a quick drive around the block just to check on things. I started walking towards the door when I saw a light and car coming up the driveway and I said 'Or not, they're back!' and felt relieved. But then I looked out the window and saw that it was a white limousine. I was confused, but thought it was strange so went up the hallway to my room, turning off lights. I said 'this is the strangest night ever'. I tried peeking out my window but couldn't see anything, then I heard a scream. I went back out (and now it looked like the old place again) and Haley said that a guy had come around the back and looked through the kitchen window at them. We could hear him doing stuff around the back, trying the laundry door etc. I dialled 000 and the guy asked what I needed and I said 'police' and he asked if it was urgent and I said 'uh, well not really but kind of' and he said 'no, then?' and said he couldn't help me and I said 'but there's a guy trying to get into the house and my Mom has been gone for hours' and he said he would send links to my phone on what to do. I started panicking and could hear the guy fiddling with the laundry door. Then it was back home. I grabbed the big knife at some point and went back to my room. Oh, when we were at home, my sisters were lying in Mom's bed and Ezra was nowhere to be seen. I heard the front door open and I crept out and saw a man walking towards the back room. I snuck up behind him and stabbed him. I was shocked and didn't know what to do now, then Darren walked in the front door. He seemed battered and not really upset, just happy to be home (this wasn't regarded as suspicious, just thought he was oddly calm). I asked what happened and he said they'd been attacked. He said he'd been looking for Mom for hours but couldn't find her and that she was limping (he acted out the motion of dragging one foot) and it was harder before because she had twins - which I took as meaning she was with Rover. I was relieved they were ok, and thought we should go for a drive to find them when he said that Rover had been hurt by the people and taken off and he'd run after him, but he got hit by a truck. Then he looked distraught as he said he tried to help him, but it was too late. I started crying and howling and it got worse every time I thought of his puppy-like innocence. Not long after that, Mom turned up as well and then we were all crying, but then we were like 'let's go to bed'. By this point it was early hours of the morning and wasn't that dark outside. I couldn't sleep though."
"4064"	"(2014-06-18 (23)) Not sure what was going on properly, but I went back to London. I was with a group and we were split into two and given rooms. I wandered into one and someone said I'd picked the wrong one because the other room had a big comfy bed and this one had crappy bunks. Then, I was with Benjamin. We'd somehow been put into a group together and still hadn't spoken and were on friendly enough, but awkward terms. We had also slept together in the past. Our room was quite big and had a big fancy bed in the middle. We were lying on it and it was day time. I stared out the window and saw that Gherkin building and sighed. I wasn't sure what I was doing here, but was hoping that I'd be staying here this time. Benjamin and I were talking and giggling and it still felt weird, but a bit more comfortable. He was sitting up against the bedhead and I was sitting on the other side, with the blanket over my legs, but facing him. We kind of looked at each other at one point and he moved closer and started touching my leg. I fidgeted but let him and he got closer, moving his hand further up. I started to resist, but gave in and lay back and he got under the covers and on top of me and started kissing me."
"4065"	"(2014-06-28 (23)) I checked the Big Brother website and Marlon and Ash were both evicted in a double eviction. People were saying that half of a boy band had been evicted."
"4066"	"(2014-06-28 (23)) I looked outside and there were these weird dark grey clouds coming towards us. Tried to get the cats inside, but Gizmo and Sapphire were still outside somewhere. There were these moths and one grabbed Cuddles and lifted her up. I started whacking it and it died. They were a little larger than normal size moths, but they were strange."
"4067"	"(2014-06-29 (23)) I was watching Big Brother. Kim was on this platform thing and Chris was sitting below with sunglasses on. There were tons of other people around though and it was noisy. Chris said to someone that he ""likes her ass"" and she was like 'what? What did you say"" and he said ""I like your ass"" without flinching. She seemed shocked that he just outright said it [oddly, the episode the next day he said that he liked her ass] . Matthew had cerebral palsy and that explained all his weird twitches. He was always bleeding from his head/face and looked really sickly. Someone got me this flat thing in London. It was like a house, but in a group of them and it was only one storey and small. It felt empty. People were having a lunch party thing outside. I was checking the locks and they were all unlocked. I had to find the key to lock them. I was looking in the dishwasher when a lady came through my back door and I was confused because I thought I locked it and then I wondered if she had a key."
"4068"	"(2014-07-01 (23)) I was in London with a friend. Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais were doing some live show nearby that we were going to go buy tickets for. The place it was being held at was just around the corner. We went to a cafe and was looking at the different chocolate drinks when I saw Stephen Merchant walking into the store. I squee'd to my friend and tried to keep my cool. I picked a drink with Oreos and they made my friend's drink and then Stephen just held up a bag of bread and water bottles and handed the money over to the guy. It was really rude and I was a bit disappointed. I got my drink but it wasn't as nice as I expected. I walked around the corner I saw Stephen go around and he was at a door a fair way down but he turned and looked in my direction and I turned and went away."
"4069"	"(2014-07-05 (23)) I was still at university. I went to some chemistry based class and sat down. Marvin came in and saw me and then I was worried because I'd told him I wasn't studying anymore but then I couldn't remember who I'd said that to and I thought it was odd since he went to State University. I think there had been a zombie apocalypse thing. Some others and I were in this school building which was quite dark, but it was still early evening outside. We started going down into this store room thing when someone told us to get out. In the shadows were these maggot/worm looking things (they weren't solid, they were like a lighter part of the shadow) and they were called the Unsleep - the only thing that killed them was sunlight. We had left the door open and the shadow started pouring in with them in it, and we threw stuff and shone a torch on it but nothing happened. Then the clouds moved from the sun and the sun shone in and the whole shadow disappeared. I quickly shut the door, but one was left out. The sun had gone away though. Someone said we should leave now. We didn't really know where to go, because we didn't know where the Unsleep had already infected. We drove around looking for somewhere to go. I found a few 'weapons' that would kill the Unsleep, one needed pineapple juice and like nails or something. We already had a pineapple, so we were looking for other bits. Eventually we made one (it was like a gun), but then we found this military base type of thing which was all lit up with fake sunlight."
"4070"	"(2014-07-10 (23)) I went to the cinema that was at a shopping centre. I took my shoes off (as did most people) and when it finished I started walking back to my car when I realised I didn't have shoes on. I ran back and they had been cleaning the cinema. I asked someone there if they'd found any shoes and they said no. I went back to my row and couldn't see any shoes. I found a black pair of sneakers in another row that fit, so put those on, but then went back to my row and looked underneath my chair and found mine. I put them on and thought maybe I should get some black sneakers for work while I'm here but I wasn't sure where the shoe shop was. Somehow I ended up losing my shoes again and went looking for them. I had a dream about Big Brother and it involved Ashleigh, Helen and Mark (who was a director in the middle of making a big film) and I posted on Facebook instead of writing it in a note on my phone. Everything was shortened and the grammar was really bad and Dan Palmer liked it and some other people as well (Ashleigh's 'brother' for one). Later, we were parked in North Midvale carpark and I was in my car and Mom was in her car. It was dark and was creepy. I looked in Mom's window and she turned and had this like giant blue snake tongue and zombie like eyes and face. I ran back to my car and didn't know what to do."
"4071"	"(2014-07-16 (23)) I was at university (I don't know what I was studying or what university it was, just one I made up), and something had happened like a battle. I'm not sure exactly, but there were lists of all students who had been involved and 'killed an enemy'. Marvin also went to the school and we were sitting next to each other on computers in a computer lab. I found my name on the list and his name as well. He was sort of following me around at one point and sometimes I was following him [similar to at work] ; there was a small cement platform thing outside that had steps going up to it from all sides (it was kind of a pointless feature and not that big either) and we were standing on it. He just kept kind of tagging along behind me. After the computer labs, we finished up at the same time so I followed him out. I couldn't remember how to get out of the building anyway, so just kept following him but then he went to the toilet. I went into the girls' toilet so it wouldn't look awkward, but there was some kind of problem so I just left."
"4072"	"(2014-07-16 (23)) I was at home and it was like the end of the world or something. I was pregnant and my boyfriend/husband was with me. I got hurt somehow and I was sitting on the grass dragging myself to the car. I got to the top of the drive way and then it was just me. I was making my way back to the house when some people came through the gate with guns. They wanted to come in and I refused. A guy pointed a gun at me but I didn't back down. Then my 'brother' was a friend of his and my brother had like taken off to the streets years before, but he told the guy to back off and they got into a fight. I went inside and ran to my room and called the police. I was whispering and saying there were people outside with guns, but an automatic message thing kept saying that I was speaking too quietly."
"4073"	"(2014-07-21 (23)) I had this pet lion and flew to Malaysia with it for some reason. Aunt Sally and co also had something to do with it. I was with the boys, but I only remember Nathaniel specifically, and she was coming on another flight. I had to give the lion up to a zoo or something and I can't remember what happened, but it was then a film and at the end it showed the main character and a 'baby lion' (which was actually a fluffy Labrador) on a lounge."
"4074"	"(2014-07-21 (23)) I was at the old house, sitting in the living room. It was night and there were people outside. I was a serial killer or something, so just calmly sat as they tried to get inside. I walked into the kitchen and took a sharp knife, putting it into my pocket and sitting back down. I text Mom and said 'come', but I thought that they might have her phone so I didn't say any more than that. Then I was in another country. There were these aliens who were taking over countries or cities, taking people and killing the rest. I'd come across them a few times. I was in the street (it was night) and there were lots of them marching around, doing their thing. I ducked in and out and around, trying to find something. There was a pile of bricks that I was hitting and they were falling apart like Minecraft blocks and I was taking the things that fell out. I needed to find certain coloured bricks to make this weapon. I ended up in a building where the 'leader' was and she was like 'you again'. She made no effort to do anything to me and basically said that she liked having me around. She warned me that they were blowing the place up and showed me the way out."
"4075"	"(2014-07-22 (23)) I was watching Big Brother and someone had written some stuff on a piece of paper and it was in the corner of the screen but I saw it had Stalled written on it. I was thinking of posting it on the Facebook group, but decided against it. I somehow came across a video of supposedly Dan Palmer, but the guy in it didn't look like him. He also had piercings and lots of jewellery and I was grossed out and trying to work out if it was actually him. When he spoke, it sounded like him but I couldn't work it out. I was annoyed that he wasn't as perfect as I thought."
"4076"	"(2014-07-23 (23)) I was at a shopping centre after hours and there were a few others around. I was under the impression that we were all spending the night. Later, there were people after 'X-Ray' who was Dexter Koh and I remember running up this staircase after him and he ran off (I think we were friendly)."
"4077"	"(2014-07-23 (23)) Work was slow, so I had taken up odd jobs at a place I used to work for/have some affiliation with. When I got there I saw GBCS people and I was like 'oh, stocktake!'. There were about 10-15 people. I saw Esther and she called me Hugo, before realising her mistake. I told her I didn't even know this job was available and that I hadn't gotten any emails for ages. She said she'd talk to someone about it and gave me this weird hug."
"4078"	"(2014-07-23 (23)) There was a movie or video game with zombies that I'd used to somehow accidentally create zombies. I was filming a film using the real zombies as the zombies. There was a small room with shelves of DVDs and food and stuff and we had to get people from both ends to push so they'd come together, but we were having trouble getting it to fall properly. Then a group of zombies were coming near the door, so I tried to close the door but the wood door didn't even fit and close. I shut the other one, but they were already on it. Lots of little baby ones at the door too. We just ran and eventually got to a car. Outside this building there were military people and stuff."
"4079"	"(2014-07-24 (23)) I woke up to discover that Steven got evicted, but Big Brother pulled a twist so that he stayed in and someone else would get evicted instead. I was fuming."
"4080"	"(2014-07-25 (23)) I was at a shopping centre with Mom and there was a rack of stuff that I somehow noticed was infected. I put some stuff on it to stop it and we left. Then I wondered if it would actually stop it and if there was infection anywhere else. We went back in for some reason. I went to the toilet and locked a cubicle. Not long after I'd sat down, I saw two hands come down under the door and then a zombie girl suddenly came at me from under the door. It was really fast and scared the hell out of me [IRL too, my heart was pounding when I woke up] . Her face was quite graphic, a white eye and rotting flesh. The only thing I had as a weapon was this thing that was like a giant straw. I stabbed her in the face when she came through again, I put my foot on her face to pull it out. I heard other zombies in the toilet, so I readied myself and opened the door and started stabbing them. I ended up in the male toilets and there were some other people still alive in there. They had forks and I was annoyed that I didn't have a fork. We got to the main part of the shop and found some other weapons. There weren't that many zombies around here. While I was looking for a weapon in a corner of the storeroom, one of the women with us started bending over weirdly and she suddenly turned and went at me. I started whacking her but couldn't stab through for some reason. One of my friends killed her. Someone suggested this was like a judgement day scenario thing, where the bad people turned into zombies and the good guys were ok."
"4081"	"(2014-08-01 (23)) I was at home, but I think it was a new place. It was quite big. I wanted to get some kind of woodwork station set up and Poppa bought these bits of wood for me and was going to set it up in this outside area that we owned. But apparently the surrounding areas were dangerous and meant stuff might gets stolen. Then I was in a video game. I was playing with two others on my team. It was like an RPG. I think Ezra was one of the people I was with and we both had a little bit of armour but the other guy didn't. We did one mission (and it was set up so like one of us was in danger and we had to rescue them) and the second mission had these logs over pits, so if you stood on them in the wrong position, you'd fall. Both of them were tied up; one on this thing in the middle and the other on this wall at the back. I started walking towards him and then noticed there was a snake along the length of the wall. Someone said it'd seen me and I looked back to see it looking at me and I tried walking slowly away but it started moving and I started hitting escape and nothing was happening, so I alt+f4'd and got out of the game. I tried again, this time moving slowly but it saw me and I got out of it again. We didn't know what to do. We got back in and I paused, but now the scene was like a fair and I walked around it and I saw the snake come out of a toy grabber machine and wrap itself around a mother and squeeze her and kill her. I deliberated between going back and owning up to it, or just leaving. I started walking back to see what was happening but I saw it slithering out and around my corner, so I pressed alt+f4 and left and told the other guys I was giving up because it was too dangerous."
"4082"	"(2014-08-05 (23)) Mom and I went for a drive and went to the roundabout on Camberwell, but it was like all white in front (like there was nothing there), the houses nearby were sort of misty and see-through and we decided to go another way. We thought maybe it was like the end and the whiteness was taking everything and we were concerned about going back home, but when we went back the white was receding and it was just a light mist left."
"4083"	"(2014-08-06 (23)) Was at the old house and playing some weird, old video game. I think it was related to Half Life, and I finished the first one and didn't really like it. I started the second one and then realised it was 5pm and I was late for work. I started to leave, but then went and ate all these chips like Burger Rings and Cheetos and then dinner and when I eventually left it seemed to take ages for me to get anywhere. I got stuck somewhere and started crying that I was going to be late. I was in a bathroom but lots of people were there and I told them to leave. I'd realised I got my period but took the pad I had off by mistake and didn't have another one. I also didn't have a bra on but people came back in and I needed to find somewhere to put it on. I kept trying to text Hector to say I was going to be late, but I never got around to it."
"4084"	"(2014-08-06 (23)) I was at home and there was like a small party or something and Chris (Big Brother) was there. About 5 people were in the back room and one by one they gave Chris a hug because he was crying. I stepped down and put my hand on his back and he turned around and hugged me and I hugged him back (though my left hand got stuck between us). I said ""it's ok, she's a cow"" and he laughed and said ""I know"". The hug kept going but he didn't seem to want to get out of it and he said 'is there a reason this hug is so long' and I said 'no'. Eventually we pulled apart and I went to do something. Mom told me she was inviting some people over for dinner and I said I wasn't coming for it and she said 'but it's for you' and I said that I didn't care, I wasn't interested."
"4085"	"(2014-08-09 (23)) I was somewhere with a bunch of people, including some people from Big Brother. Steven was talking about something to the others and I said 'feck off, shut up' and it went silent and he was like 'no swearing kiddies. Awkward'. I walked off, trying not to laugh and stood next to a wall. Ashleigh came and stood by me and was talking to me. Kim was behind me and it was early on in the series when they were still friends. We were joking about 'stroking peanut butter' and laughing and then Chris came up and I said 'we're just talking about stroking peanut butter' and he was like 'ok' and we all started laughing. There was another 'eviction' coming up and we had to decide whether Winston stayed evicted or another person and I was really annoyed. They also showed some clips from the past including this task, which I had liked, which involved a huge tree and Pauline dressed as some kind of green witch fairy thing. She had two rings on one hand, on the middle and ring finger which had a square emerald type of thing in them. At some point I thought I was dreaming and was making people appear. I started saying it out loud when I saw Stephen Merchant, in a suit and with shorter hair, walk around the corner, look at me and then go into a toilet cubicle. I walked over and deliberated about going in, but peeked into the cubicle and saw him standing there and went in. He locked the door and immediately started kissing me. That progressed to us having sex, with me up against the wall and my legs around him. It was really intense and I could feel it all. At one point someone looked over the cubicle and was trying to put post-it notes around and I told them to get lost. I woke up during the 'end' of it."
"4086"	"(2014-08-16 (23)) It was like a film and there were lots of landscape shots and was generally just nice looking. I think it was on another planet/in the future (at one point someone said they were 254 years ahead of us technology wise) and there were trains that went around the whole world. It was just two tracks going each way in a loop, stopping at stations. They were super fast as well. Anyway, they had a limit of 50 people per train and there were 5 carriages (they had a specific name but can't remember). If someone got off, someone had to get on or it wouldn't go."
"4087"	"(2014-08-16 (23)) A group of vampire type people had taken over one of the carriages and blocked out the sun and just kept to themselves (there were quite a few of them in there and I think they'd either eaten or gotten rid of the people in the other carriages). They could go in the sun but would feel sick and blinded and would eventually just like throw up and die. They would get out of the train at night, usually at public toilets to find people to eat (lots of toilet stops presumably because there were no toilets on the train). Two guy friends were at this toilet when the train stopped there. It was hinted at that one of the vampires had died and they needed a replacement. They weren't really bad guys, but they did need to consume blood regularly. One of the vampire guys got off and 'infected' one of the guys (can't remember how it was passed). The guy ran off with his friend though. Whilst the vampire was looking for him, the guy accidentally infected his friend (they didn't know at that point though). The sun came up and the guy was outside but for him it looked like a desert and the sun was bright and hot and he was feeling sick. The train was nearby and the vampire guy told him to get in or he'd die and he went with him and got on the train. When he felt better he refused to go anywhere else without his friend. He found him eventually and realised he was infected and dying. He told him to get on but his friend refused, so he grabbed him and took him on to the train. It screeched to a halt and a warning saying the passenger limit was overloaded started going off (which would call in authorities if left too long) and the friend jumped back off and said 'it's too dangerous, just leave me' and the train started up and he tearfully watched his friend as it moved on."
"4088"	"(2014-08-18 (23)) There were zombies. They were fast and dangerous and had been around for a while. I ended up at this building, which was possibly a big school/college and realised there were people there, but they were bad. I heard them coming and quickly hid under this table. A zombie came in growling and I was trying to remember whether they sensed by smell or hearing, but a person came and took it away (it was like a 'pet'). I was sneaking around for some reason or another, but eventually they saw me and started going after me and shooting at me. I was running and climbing over fences and got back inside the building and ended up in this large gym area. There were lots of bits of furniture around (like bookshelves and such) and shelves along the top. I climbed up so that I was up high away from the zombies that began to pile in. A few people got bit and then I had a friend with me and we managed to climb down and sneak out and I pulled them into the toilet that was just next door. The door didn't close properly so I got her to sit against it and keep it closed. I found a button or something and pressed it and it flooded the place with water. Some bits of water leaked into the toilet, but it didn't flood. When it had finished, we got out and climbed along pipes and such to get out. Outside was all flooded as well - the streets were filled with cars and the water came up about halfway, there were also lots of hills and such to walk on. There were still plenty of zombies around and lots of animals. I remember seeing two animals running past us. We wondered what to do next."
"4089"	"(2014-08-22 (23)) I went to this library that was quite far from home and I'd taken the bus there. Marvin was there and it was fairly busy. I went to the counter and asked if I needed to register to loan books and they said yes and told me to go in to get started. I sat down next to these people and Marvin sat next to me. We talked a bit, but mostly just sort of hovered near each other. I was walking around and went to the front of the library and saw a Goosebumps book I'd never heard of. I found more and they were from different 'series' of the books, before and after I had read them as a kid and that's why I'd never read them. I was excited about finding new books and wanted to read them but wondered if it would be the same to read them now."
"4090"	"(2014-08-23 (23)) I was watching Big Brother 2012 and at the beginning Scott and Sara were chosen to pretend to be a couple. They obviously failed the task and were talking about it on the final show [watched the final last night] ."
"4091"	"(2014-08-24 (23)) I was at my first job as a trainee supervisor. It was a supermarket. Niles was there too and I saw his checklist of stuff was completely filled out and I only had two things checked. I was annoyed that he'd done it before me. I was then at home and Mom and Darren were planning on buying this house across the road from Rochester Circle. It was old and falling apart and small. I was complaining and said I didn't want to move. Our house was the same, but we had an attic and the yard was massive. Mom and I went for a walk in the backyard - which went alongside the road and the fence wasn't totally closed off - and there were all these sheds and things falling apart and rotten."
"4092"	"(2014-08-25 (23)) I was at home - though it was different and I lived with Dad and Ezra. We were in the lounge room watching TV and sleeping out there. I can't remember exactly what happened, but I think a sniper shot through the window at us. We had some kind of idea who it was, but I don't know why or who. I ran out into the bushes outside (it was a house in the middle of the bush, though it was still sort of local). People were chasing me and I kept running and was running over buildings and stuff. They almost caught me a few times, but I kept escaping. I ended up at this factory thing, I think it was for ice-cream or something, but it had been abandoned for years. When I went in though, it was still running which I thought was odd. I think I was then with someone else and we were trying to hide from the people and escape the building. We eventually left through the front door and there was a group of people outside. Then we ended up in this neighbourhood and broke into a house. I can't remember why we were in there and I think we were hiding from people in the house, but then it was just us two. Outside a kid and an older guy approached the house and were looking through the windows and apparently had seen us. I crept around to the back and left through a window. I climbed up this hill behind it and crept along the fence. They were walking away and I walked onto the road behind them but they saw me and then I thought that was stupid. I asked where the train station was and they pointed and I acted grateful and like nothing was up. I met up with my friend and we got on the train. The kid and the guy had followed us and sat on the opposite side of the train. I think they questioned us about what we were doing there and I said I was their niece (the wife was called Olive, can't remember the husband). Then we had actually met up with them at the house, but we were involved in something dodgy and I think there was some orgy or something, so they hadn't answered the door when the kid was there. They called the people and they confirmed that they knew us, but they still seemed suspicious. I was trying to work out what my next disguise would be and I chose a green wig, which I had worn before and had a fondness for."
"4093"	"(2014-08-27 (23)) I was at my first job as a trainee supervisor and it was supposed to just be me and Esther on the early shift. However, when I arrived (it was at Hillary's btw and was different), Niles and Sergio were there. At one point Esther said something about me not eating pork and when she said it again later I asked her why and she said that Niles had told her I didn't eat pork. I was annoyed that he was spreading rumours about me."
"4094"	"(2014-09-02 (23)) The beginning was a little hazy, but I was involved in a plane crash (it didn't take off and explode or anything, everyone survived) and befriended some guy while waiting around. We'd been friends for a bit, when we were involved in another similar plane crash and I forgot most of our friendship (aside from the fact that we were friends). He also claimed to be in love with me and seemed slightly obsessed and I think we slept together occasionally. He was ok looking, but wore a thumb ring and another ring on his left hand. We were also regulars at this 'fancy' restaurant/club type of thing and I had a dress just for going there because you had to dress up to get in. I loved going there for some reason and really wanted to go tonight. We went there and sat at the table and it was very purple inside and our table was up a couple of steps on this raised platform. There was a stage where we first came in, but the curtain was closed. The menu was cheap looking and hardly had any options, all really standard stuff like steak. I was really flirty and giggly for some reason and I tapped him on the head with my menu. His hair went out of place a little bit and he got annoyed. There was a mirror behind me, so he fixed it up a little and I was giggling at him and he said 'how would you like it if I ruffled your hair?' and I said 'you can ruffle my hair tonight, if you want' and he looked at me like he was going to jump across the table and rip my clothes off and I giggled and felt slightly embarrassed and said out loud that I didn't know why I was acting that way. Later I was at Granma's house (which was different). She had quit smoking, but Mom was smoking out the back and she asked for cigarette. She had to hide it from Uncle Gabriel, who was out for the time being. After she'd taken a couple of puffs, her face looked really old and wrinkly (almost comically). She also had a dog which had had puppies a while ago, but the puppies had been given away and the dog was locked in a lounge room. She let me in to see the dog and I gave it a pat and said 'good boy', but then realised she'd had puppies, so had to be a girl. I went to leave but the door was now just a block of black wood. It had been door sized before, but was now about 2 inches wide and I didn't know how to use it I kept messing about with it and it turned into a cloth. I went to Granma and said I couldn't work the door out and the dog ran outside. She came in and grabbed the wood, which was suddenly bigger and it had folded up 3 times over, so she expanded it out and put it in place. I said I didn't see that. Later, I was at home, which was the old house except Mom lived there. The guy friend from before and I were sitting out the back talking. Mom came out and saw him and said 'hello... little guy'. I said it was my friend from the plane crash, and she said she was wondering how she didn't know him. We came inside and I lay down in the games room md he sat in the living room. We were talking over the wall about random stuff and then Mom came to the kitchen to make lunch. She said she was going to make pumpkin soup and I said 'noooo'. She didn't offer an alternative and was basically like 'deal with it'. I sulked back to the games room. She asked why I was in there when my friend was in the other room and I said I felt like laying on the floor and he wanted to sit in a chair. She made an awkward romantic/sex joke and there was a pause and then I said 'don't be creepy'. I could tell that we were both sort of thinking 'we're already having sex', but I wasn't going to let her know that."
"4095"	"(2014-09-02 (23)) I went to my first job with my supervisor shirt and it was for a company that made shampoo made from poo. It was in little test tube things and was like round bunny port but smaller. On the ingredients thing it mid it had something to do with dragons and some exotic creature. Apparently it smelled like poo and didn't clean that well but it was popular. It was the only thing they sold. There were quite a few people on the job and they were all supervisors. Hector and Esther were there. Esther told everyone to mark their names off the job sheet, so I did. Niles turned up and had a supervisor shirt on as well and I was really annoyed, thinking 'this was supposed to be my thing!'. I had a jacket on, so I thought at least when I took that off it'd rub it in his face too [note: This actually came true; I turned up with my supervisor shirt on, feeling smug about it when Niles turned up in a supervisor shirt too] ."
"4096"	"(2014-09-05 (23)) I was supervising my first job which was a massive banquet thing. I don't remember seeing anything to actually scan, it seemed like I was just sorting out where people were sitting, and I was rushing about trying to get everything done. People (all stocktakers) were showing up and I was showing them to their assigned tables. Niles turned up and whenever he had his back turned I was making faces. He was at the dessert table and I showed him to it. Some time later he came up to me and said that he'd been talking to this like human resources person called Vicki Station saying that I stared at him 'nastily', made him feel uncomfortable and excluded him from the group and I was like wtf. I went past the tables and into this other room where there were people scanning around the perimeter and told them to download when they finished the walls. I went to find Esther and started talking to someone who'd just come out the shower with the same colour hair, and then she put her head up and it wasn't Esther so I said ""... you're not Esther"" and continued looking for her. I found her in a little office and told her what Niles had said. I said I didn't have a clue what he was on about because I treated him just like everyone else. I was wondering if my hatred for him was actually apparent, but I thought I was polite enough to him in the flesh. Esther wasn't sure what to do either. I had a name card on a table too and it was one spot away from Benjamin, but I thought he wouldn't make it because he's on holiday [he's on holiday at the moment] , but then I saw him over the other side. The card next to mine on the other side said ""Morisey"" and I held it up to some people nearby and said ""Is Morrisey sitting next to me?"" and we joked about it. Later, at either another job or another thing, Sergio and Niles were doing the assigning and I went up to them and Sergio asked what I wanted and I said 'desserts table' and he said 'I'll put you on cigars' and I said, calmly but firmly that I didn't know anything about cigars and it'd probably be better suited to someone who could contribute to the conversation, whereas I know I can enjoy dessert and bring something to the table. He, seemingly, reluctantly put me down for desserts. I was worried they'd change it when I left."
"4097"	"(2014-09-23 (23)) I was at home, which was the old house. I was home alone and Slater came over, crazed and looking for Mom. He was trying to get in the front door and I was yelling at him to go away and trying to get a hold of someone. He went out the back and there was a problem with the back door so it wouldn't lock. Somehow, it sorted itself out and he got 'caught' or whatever. I was sitting at a desk relaxing and suddenly he shouted 'RA!' really loudly in my ear [it caused me to wake up IRL, cringing in fear and my heart was pounding] ."
"4098"	"(2014-10-01 (23)) I was dating Sam from Big Brother. We owned some kind of company/factory thing. It was a weird house building thing, with lots of windows around the outside. It was quite messy. He'd had shaggy hair and had a haircut so it was tidier and shorter, but I preferred his old haircut."
"4099"	"(2014-10-02 (23)) I was working somewhere and Hugo was working near me. He said that I shouldn't wear the same pants because they smelled. I was a bit shocked and I said 'I have no sense of smell' and he said 'yeah I know, but we can'. I was shocked at how forward he was (and he didn't seem fazed one bit about saying anything) and I was a bit hurt. I was also wearing clean pants so I didn't get it."
"4100"	"(2014-10-08 (23)) Mom and Darren had bought a new place, but it was like a caravan and had no rooms. 'Bedrooms' were now a bed in a box, as in, a small walled up part of it had a bed inside (just a bed) and drawers were on the outside for clothes. I said I'd rather kill myself than not have a bedroom, saying that if there was no room for a desk then it wasn't worth it. I was wandering around outside at some point and there was a fluffy grey cat on some stairs. I walked past it and then it jumped up at me from behind and started strangling me. I managed to get it off and ran back inside."
"4101"	"(2014-10-09 (23)) I was to be stocktaking Northtown McDonald's (still in the old place) at 9.30 this morning and I woke up and it was 9.30, but then I remembered my start time had been changed to 10.30. I had done this store before and it was always just me that did it [note: we do not stocktake fast food stores] . For some reason I still got there at 9.30 and they said they couldn't actually get started until 10.30 because of something that needed to be counted with a member of staff. I left and did something for a bit and came back. The parking was split up into how long you could park there for (right outside was 1 minute, around the back it was like 8 days but it was in blocks and it had to be either multiple vehicles or a big vehicle to fit all the blocks [as if it were a video game] , but I managed to convince a guy to let me park). The stocktaking at McDonald's was super secret, I had a notebook there with my name on it which had all the stocktaking info from previous ones (the earliest date was 2010). Since it was still too early, the manager guy took me around to where there were like units. It was like a university/school and one side of the building were little units (all one storey). Mine was next to his. At some point I was doing some quiz with a heap of other people, writing down answers in this book. I was wearing a Le Samourai shirt. The questions were all about films and I was answering them all easily. Two guys next to me called out and asked if they could look at my answers and I shooed them away. It was because I only had a few answers left and was rewriting them into another book (which I was going to hand over to them) and I wanted to do it in peace. They were 'teasing' me for not giving them the answers but when I finished I said 'I was going to give you the answers, I just wanted to finish it'. One of them had dark hair, the other blonde - the blonde one was chubby and more attractive, the dark hair was average build, slightly above average height and meh looking. He took an interest in me for some reason and started following me around. He followed me to the unit thing and I let him in. The manager guy came back and into his unit and I told him to be quiet because he listens. Then the manager guy knocked and I told the guy to hide, so he went into the cupboard. Manager guy said they were ready for me now and I said I'd just get my things. I closed the door and told the guy to leave after me and to leave the key somewhere. I walked out and knocked on the manager guy's door, but the guy left my room already and started walking down the other way. I distracted the manager guy for a bit with the notebook and then left. At some point later, something happened and people started going crazy. It apparently was similar to The Signal, where a transmission was setting them off and they would gradually go crazy. It also seemed that being in large groups was an issue as well. We were in a small group (including the guy from before) and had been ok so far (it was some time later now). One of the group began to 'hear' the signal and it would get louder as the group of people got bigger. We discovered the group thing when we picked up a new bunch of people and they went crazy and we started to go funny. But the other people died and then we were ok. It seemed like the group had to get smaller as time went on (and I thought that eventually we'd all have to be alone and I thought this was counterproductive for biological reasons). When we were in a house, the sound would get louder and then I suggested that it had something to do with the size of the area, so generally we were always wandering around outside. We met up with some other groups and the guy was testing his signal sound by putting us into groups and edging away and placing a new group when the sound subsided - this way we could see how far away we needed to be from each other. Then we were somewhere in America and apparently a meteor had hit my hometown. I started to cry because 'all the stuff we've worked for, all the stuff we owned, all our pets are all gone'."
"4102"	"(2014-10-11 (23)) Dan Palmer was on OkCupid and I went on his profile to find it had been updated and filled out - he was 40 years old (which shocked me) and we had a 96% match. He had a photo of himself for every year and his one for 1991 he only looked about 8. I hoped he would find me in his matches and message me."
"4103"	"(2014-10-11 (23)) I was out somewhere at night. A Mr Whippy type of thing pulled up and a bunch of us were lining up. He looked like AJ Bowen in The Signal and he never gave change, so you either had to give him the exact amount or give him a bit more. It was implied that this was a scam. I pulled out my wallet and pulled out a $50 note, then $20, then $10, then $5, before realising I had tons of change. The ice-cream was $3.35 or something, so I gave him the exact amount. He seemed angry and gave me a messy ice-cream - instead of soft serve, just squished it in. I complained and he did it again, but still messed it up. He got increasingly angry and violent and messy making my ice-cream and I continued to yell that he wasn't doing it right. I wanted one with chocolate sauce and nuts, and he would either forget one, or just dump it on etc. Eventually, he made it properly and I went off to enjoy it."
"4104"	"(2014-10-13 (23)) I was on a bed with Mark Duplass. He was propped up on a pillow (like lying down, but sitting up), and I was lying the opposite way, resting my head on his leg. We were talking about something or other and I took a photo of us. I posted on the forum mentioning what we were talking about and said I was talking with Mark Duplass. I was thinking about whether or not to post the pic but thought it might seem dodgy. At some point I snuggled closer so that I was hugging his leg and was half touching his crotch area. This seemed like normal behaviour as friends, though I did wonder if anything would happen."
"4105"	"(2014-10-24 (23)) Mom and I were staying in this hotel in the UK. It looked fancy in the lobby, but the room was a total mess. You had to climb up this ladder to get into the room and it kept flooding with dirty water - so we'd have to climb through the water to get into the room. All the furniture was mismatched and wobbly. Mom would often go out and not leave me with a card, so I'd either get stuck in the hotel with nothing to do or get left outside the room unable to get back in. I went to a cinema with Dad and Ezra and there were no seats, and we were alone, so we sat on the floor at the front. Guardians of the Galaxy was playing, but it was different. Two guys that worked there were having an argument and I think one killed the other. At some point I met Donald Sutherland and had a brief chat with him - mentioning that I'd seen him in an older film that day."
"4106"	"(2014-10-25 (23)) I can't remember the exact details but I was with Malachi and he really liked this apple pie that someone made. I discovered that he was a guy from a long time ago - who was immortal - and was getting revenge on people who wronged him when he was younger. I think he met with his mother at one point and seemed friendly with her, but then turned and accused her of letting her boyfriend be a dick to him. I was also watching Big Brother at some point, I remember seeing David and I also remember Sandra being with Sam and she was upset and crying because they couldn't be together. He said to her that 'either they'll get married or they'll be bff's forever'."
"4107"	"(2014-11-03 (23)) I was at a place which had all playgrounds - not sure if just one for each or ALL - with some other people including Jamison who was same age as we last saw him (8?). I found the McDonald's one and it was one I liked as a kid - vibrating seat spinny thing and I was saying it brought back memories of 'when I was in love with Bill Moseley'. Later on we were in another room with more people and Bill Moseley was there. I was standing nearby and briefly spoke to him and Jamison started to say she's in love with you - I said ssh and put my hand up to him but it was obvious what he was going to say and Bill was like 'it's ok' and then he said that I was thinking about him whilst on the vibrating seat and I was like omg but then we all had to sit in a circle for some Lords of Salem re-enactment thing and Bill was dressed like that and he walked around the inside of the circle putting these small skull stickers on people's chins and kissing it, when he got to me he did the same and then kissed me on the lips. I was like *inside squee* I woke up in the dream not long after to find my door open (at hotel in Kununurra) and I flashed my torch to check and then I heard Hector asking Mikhail if he'd opened my door and woken me up and then the conversation was muffled but it was implied he had come into my room and I thought he had kissed me."
"4108"	"(2014-11-05 (23)) I was staying in a room and Skye from Big Brother was in another. The blinds were riding up. Skye's outfit was in like four parts. Someone chased her. I threw a party at my house. Lots of people showed up and people were peeing, pooping and spewing all over everything. I tried to say that people needed to leave but no-one was really interested. I started shooting to get their attention. A girl who I was related to and I was her heir but we didn't like each other and she confronted me and I said I was only pushing people who caused a mess and it doesn't matter if I like them. I was doing Spud Shed with Esther and had to strip this meat -- it was thick and red with grey on the bottom, and was renowned for being difficult but I picked it up quickly."
"4109"	"(2014-11-06 (23)) From Dusk Till Dawn [on last night] - the place where they shot the pyramid bit was an actual place and for some reason I thought I'd been there though it like in Mexico but then we there and there a photo album where people posted to say they'd been there and I found pics of myself from when I was like 4. It was creepy and dark in there. There was a weird person hanging around. I can't remember properly but I think I (except not me) killed someone and was on the run. I kept meeting with people and then killing them. One girl I kept throwing around but she wouldn't die. She was all twisted though."
"4110"	"(2014-11-10 (23)) I forgot I had a job on and ran around to get ready for it but was already over an hour late, and it was at a place an hour away. I was really stressed and annoyed. There was then another job flying out across the country. It was quite late and I had this little bike thing (that was near on the ground) and I was driving Mikhail, so he was on the back. Hector pulled up next to us in a van and said it was too dangerous to drive it and then I wondered why I had it in the first place."
"4111"	"(2014-11-16 (23)) I was at some kind of school or something. I can't remember what was happening, but I went into a small toilet cubicle - which was part of this room - to get changed. Some bad guys came and were stealing stuff and taunting people. I stood on the seat as they tried to reach under the cubicle door, but they knew I was in there and got in. I had a pen and was jabbing the guy with it as he got closer, then I sliced his neck with it. He fell to the floor and then I was worried what would happen when his friends found the body."
"4112"	"(2014-11-17 (23)) There were lots of dust storms and the end of the world was near [saw Interstellar last night] . We lived in a different house and some guys who had been injured were staying with us. One of them had this stick which was decorated and had spikes on it. That guy was like the 'leader' and decided to revolt. We fought and fled. It ended up being four of us left at the end in this room. It was me, a guy I liked and another couple who were my friends. The room was bare and some kind of 'black hole' type of thing was sucking stuff in and throwing stuff out. It was windy because of the motion. We didn't have much longer left and we decided that the first thing it threw out that we could kill ourselves with, we would use it so we didn't have to die slowly. The guy I liked and I were holding each other in tears and we sort of admitted that we liked each other and then had sex. Afterwards, we continued to sit and wait. Somehow, we then ended up in a kind of spaceship and were saved at the last second. A computer screen showed all these different systems and planets, which lots of information about each one - the day cycle, the temperature, the general climate, average number of natural events; plus extra information about the fauna and flora, gas make up etc. One looked like Earth but with lots more water. There was a continent that looked a lot like how it would look if the ice caps had melted [I saw an artist's rendition of it once] , and it said that in this continent the temperature was like -600 degrees. Most planets had major extremes - there was a tiny planet that sat around 60 degrees, yet was covered in ice. We landed on a cold planet that was in winter, but had tolerable conditions. It was covered in snow and ice. There were buildings there and we wandered into a deli. There were people frozen in there (like, aliens that looked almost just like humans and they were frozen doing stuff - one guy was reaching into an ice-cream freezer). As we walked past, they began to thaw out, though we didn't see until one of them attacked us. We ran from them and one girl seemed personally intent on getting us. She led a group after us and we ran down a corridor and we unlocked this door and hid behind windowed glass. I tried to lock the door, but it wouldn't lock and she slid a knife down the side of the door, which I grabbed and turned on her. When she didn't back down, I sliced her throat. Then a group of older people-aliens came and told them to stop. One of them was her father and was distraught to find her killed. He drove us back to the spaceship and when the others left I said I was sorry for killing his daughter, but I didn't have a choice. He seemed to understand."
"4113"	"(2014-11-19 (23)) I went into the Big Brother house for a random visit. I was talking to David, who was still there, about hearing outside information from the people in the runs. We were whispering quietly and he said yes. I asked if they'd told Skye that she was doing very well and he said yes. I said my Mom has been wondering that for a while. I remembered I'd only paid for 4 hours parking and I'd been there for like a day. I left to go check on my car, but it hadn't been ticketed. I moved it and bought a new ticket. Later I was playing this game where a serial killer dude is in your house and you have to wake up and save these 2 other people sleeping in the house without being seen. The killer was sneaking around doing other stuff too. It was dark and had weird lighting and was quite creepy."
"4114"	"(2014-11-20 (23)) I lived with Stephen Merchant. He had a female friend visiting and staying with us for a bit. I was annoyed, but didn't voice this opinion. I was in my room and he had come back from the shop and was talking to the friend saying 'I know you love mangoes' and then something about 'Izzy likes these marshmallow Santa's' and I smiled and tried not to giggle because it sounded so ridiculous but was also happy that he knew I liked them. At some point I was somewhere with Analisa and she had a photo with David Tennant - I took it, so I also took a bit of video. She was really excited and happy about it. Later, there were these chairlifts (but like, a bus) and I got put on the female only one, which gave you less points. It was for reforming people? An old lady was on there and was whinging about how girls in her day worked and didn't do nasty things and I said something witty and cutting to her, and she responded back with something that made no sense and everyone cheered and clapped for her and I was like wtf is wrong with these people. But two seconds later we were just chatting as normal. We saw one of these lifts get struck by lightning, catch on fire and crash. It was very dark grey out there and everyone started freaking out. I was stuck somewhere with a couple of male friends. I had my Portal gun on me initially but it squirted water. I was messing around with it at a park. A guy came and wanted to play with it, but I was worried he'd break it and said no. He said he wanted one and I said it was pretty expensive, he said ""$1500"" and I said 'not that expensive'. One of my friends got into a fight with him later when he confronted us at night in this storage container. Later we were waiting in this shop and I bought some chips. They were really salty. I thought I'd lost my wallet earlier in the fight, but my other friend had it."
"4115"	"(2014-12-01 (23)) I was at the beach with Ezra and Dad. We had these skates which could walk on water. We had two different ones and we were going to try them out but I think we were a bit scared and were just sitting around. Little waves were splashing at the shore, but they kept getting bigger. I had my phone lying on the sand and a wave came right over it. I grabbed my phone to dry it and it was still ok. I ran back to the car to put my phone in there. The waves were still getting bigger and coming out further. There was an almost vertical step down to the shoreline now. I kicked at the sand to make it easier to walk down. I said we should leave. Nana lived nearby in this weird house and I went to warn her to put the pets inside and stay up high, when this wave came and hit the house. Somehow it hit the third storey, but we didn't get swept away with it. There was a cat on the second highest storey and I tried to get it to stay there. I ended up in a car and when the next wave hit, it lifted the car up and started sweeping me away. I started to panic and didn't know what to do."
"4116"	"(2014-12-04 (23)) I was on a work trip. We took about 20 staff and were on a bus. We had to stop overnight and were crowded into rooms. I was with Hector and Mikhail talking to them in their room and I wanted to stay there, but had to go into the girl room. I was the last one there, but there was a double bed in the front room left over. There was a bedroom full of bunks that was full, and then 3 doubles in the front room. At some point I was wandering around this like laboratory warehouse and there were freezers and fridges everywhere. I looked in the freezers (like ones at the supermarkets) and people from work were frozen in there. I saw Mikhail and Co-Worker-M-05 in one. The supervisors were walking around and I asked Esther what was going on but she either didn't know or was avoiding the question."
"4117"	"(2014-02-05 (23)) I was lying in bed with Benjamin and I can't remember if we were already seeing each other or if this was the start of it, but I turned over to face him - and it was like in a movie where the 'camera' would go between my face and a bird's eye view of us lying there and soft lighting and such. For some reason I don't remember ever seeing his face. He kissed me and I kissed him back and we started making out (which was sort of sloppy), and he ran his hand up my leg and when he got to the top, he climbed on top of me. I was thinking that I was happy that we'd resolved our differences and we were together like I'd always wanted."
"4118"	"(2014-02-05 (23)) I can't remember what was going on, but for some reason I was masturbating (I was bent over this table/desk holding a vibrator under me), trying to orgasm or something in front of Ezra and his friend. They weren't watching and it wasn't weird, but it was like I was trying to achieve something that we all needed to witness. Classmate-M-07 (from high school) turned up and had sex with me from behind, but we still didn't get whatever it was done. There were pictures of me on the walls and we took them off to throw away."
"4119"	"(2014-12-07 (23)) I was out somewhere and I saw Lawson sitting at a bench. As we walked around we saw Cat was with him and was very pregnant. She was later walking around looking at these photos/head statues of rich people. She had her hair up in a wedding-like bun, had big red lips and was wearing a fitted dress. She was looking for names for her baby."
"4120"	"(2014-12-08 (23)) I was at a petrol station with people from work. It was night and we weren't working but it may have been on a break or a travel job. Marvin was there with his girlfriend and they kept hugging and kissing. We all bought some stuff and mine came to $1400 but there was a problem with my card. Then I realised it couldn't have been $1400, because I'd only bought a $200 thing and some chocolates."
"4121"	"(2014-12-15 (23)) I had finished a stocktake and was waiting outside with Co-Worker-M-02 and Niles. Mom was giving us a lift. I was thinking now she'll meet Niles and 1) hopefully hate him too and 2) realise that he's not attractive and I don't like him. She got there and had to only take a few of us at a time. Niles got in the car, but she misunderstood and just took off. I ran after her trying to get her to come back, but she was gone. Then zombies came from nowhere and we had to run. I was with more people now and we ran through backyards, alleys and over fences and jumping from roof to roof. When it quietened down we walked. It had then been some time and we needed water. We found this guy who gave us shelter and some water bottles. One of the guys in the group found wispy white hair in the guy's bed, and brought it out to us - saying that his dead wife was rotting in there. We took the water and left quickly."
"4122"	"(2014-12-16 (23)) I was playing Sims 4, when a Sim was climbing down a long ladder and this white thing came out of its bum. It then shrivelled and lengthened and fell out and the Sim died. I went to tell Mom and I described it as a ""cigarette butt"" looking thing. She just kept giggling about 'Pluto' and not really paying attention to me, though I was really concerned about it for some reason. There was also something to do with a plant with a 'scary' snake in it. There was also something to do with Ezra, who had gone somewhere and we needed to find him. He had lots of money and was spending it all on drugs or something. There was a massive bus that Nana and Poppa had and we were all going on that. I was feeling sick and didn't want to go, but they said there were 13 rooms on it, so I could get my own one and I agreed. Granma was going as well, which put me off. At one point I was eating some food and stirring it, when suddenly it was sticking together and started rising and growing. I yelled at it, calling it a name (I think it was Nick), and ran out to tell everyone about it. You could hear it making noise/speaking from the other room, but no-one was taking it seriously."
"4123"	"(2014-12-18 (23)) I was with a couple of friends - a girl and Jack O'Neill. Jack was a little bit flimsy and a bit of a ladies man, flirting with pretty much everyone. We were in a shop or bar or something, and a guy friend of his went a bit crazy - a friend of his who was gay and who had a crush on him (we were presuming, I think). He was on the ground and Jack lay down next to him and kissed him and they made out. We all stood around awkwardly and I was secretly enjoying it (the kissing, not the awkwardness). Later we were outside the building and there were some girls there and my female friend pointed out that he was averting their eyes. I 'rewound' and noticed his eyes would flicker down and not look at them. She proposed that he was making an effort to not flirt with all the ladies as she'd pointed out to him some time earlier. I wondered if perhaps he was confused after that kiss, or maybe it was just nothing. The female friend also had this weird hair, which had this high bit in the middle full of interesting colours (that were like, shiny and vibrant blues, not a flat hair dye blue), and the sides were deep black. I asked if I could touch it and it was hard like from mousse and I said 'aw, I was hoping it'd be fluffy'. I also thought she may have had a crush on Jack (as did I). At some point Dad and I were at this takeaway restaurant and I ordered something different from the usual and he was shocked."
"4124"	"(2014-12-20 (23)) Mom informed me about some job that Acquaintance-F-08 had organized (an illegal one) and they needed someone to go in and collect whatever it was. This was the riskiest part of the job and somehow I ended up involved. I had to go into this house to get the thing (or whatever it was I had to do). While I was there, the guy came home with a woman, and the wood door at the front wouldn't close, so I had to leave it and go out the back way. I ran across the road where there was a McDonald's and some other things. At some point later, Acquaintance-F-08 contacted me blackmailing me for all the money I'd get (which was $300 million). Not wanting to cause problems, I said 'how about halves' and she said no because she could buy some sword for $500 million and sell it for a lot more. I said 'fine, I'll take $20 million' and she still said no. I told her she was being ridiculous because she could still buy her stupid sword and even $20 million was more than enough, and for me it would be enough for life, but she wasn't budging. I said I needed time to think about. Then I got in contact with Jordy about it and he said to meet him at this place with a weird name at midnight. I had to ask him about a few times the name of the place and where it was and then I realised I didn't know what day and he said 'tonight'. It was some place where we'd know people weren't listening. I don't remember the conversation or the conclusion, but afterwards I realised I didn't have a car. Dad appeared out of nowhere, also without a car, and walked with me to get somewhere to call a cab. A guy and some girls were posing for photos on the sidewalk. The girls were dressed skimpily in leather but looked about 12."
"4125"	"(2014-12-21 (23)) Mom, Rover and I went to this place and I'm not sure what it was supposed to be, but it had a big house/mansion thing which had shops and stuff, and there were stalls outside - all along this bridge and an outside area which lead to a beach. At one point Ezra was there too and he'd taken my phone. Luna was hanging upside down in a pool (like, his legs were over the edge of the pool and he was lying in the water. This was a normal, but amusing thing for him to do and I told Ezra I needed my phone and tried to take a photo. I complained phones made it difficult because I was worried I would drop it. Luna ended up moving and I didn't get a photo. There was a pet shop section and there was a cute dog, sleeping. At first I thought it was a cat, and then it woke up and its ears went 'dog like' and it jumped out of the pigeon hole and started getting excited. I felt bad but gave it a pat and then went on my way. Mom went missing. The guy who ran the place was really shifty and I suspected something else was going on here. I grabbed Rover on a lead and went looking for her. Mom's name was 'Claire', so I was calling that as out as well. There was a group of people in this 'well', and I peeked in to see if she was there. They all disappeared, but she wasn't part of it. I kept walking and then I saw her leaning against a half wall as part of a walkway. She was the woman from American Horror Story. Her face had been disfigured and she was blind. I ran over with Rover and said 'it's Mom', but when she talked her voice sounded different (croaky and scratched), and he didn't seem to recognise her. This upset her, but I kept insisting to Rover it was Mom and he started warming up to it. She asked how bad her face was and I said it was pretty badly disfigured. I went back to the house place to find the guy. Apparently he was taking the occasional person and turning them into 'ghosts', but not really ghosts, and they would be like his slaves. I found him in a kitchen and he told me to follow him and when he walked out, I grabbed a knife and put it in my pocket. I lost him, but I was going through tunnels and one tunnel passed the back of a stage, so I walked through the curtains and he was standing on it and said 'ah, the stage ending! Only 50% of players get this far' and he gave me this sharp pointy thing. I thought it was a trick weapon, so I took out my knife and started stabbing him with it. I then used the sharp pointy thing (which was hook like) and slit his throat (it barely cut the surface). But he just lay there on the floor and it healed. I was like what. Then Mom was there too and had been healed too (it was the place?). I demanded we be let go, but he just laughed. We ran and got outside where all his 'ghost slaves' were and they went after us. He said he was going to take Rover and Mom begged him to take her instead of him and the ghost slaves just grabbed her and pulled her inside."
"4126"	"(2014-12-22 (23)) I was part of a group of people trying to hide/take down 'goblins'. The 'goblins' took over people's bodies/did some kind of body snatcher thing. I had this cave type of hideout (which was near other hideouts), but some goblins were nearby and I was trying to cover up some of the holes that would make it obvious it was there. However, someone called out that they were setting the area on fire, so I ran. I followed the others and we ran to this elevator outside this building. I had a guy friend, who I liked and was possibly my boyfriend but I'm not sure, and he was with me. The first elevator was full and we waited for the next. Some of our group had deserted us. We watched the floor the elevator went to and got in. The floors had extra bits, so it was like floor 38.1. We got there and there was another set of elevators, which looked like train carriages. There was a notebook there with stuff highlighted. I assumed they left a note about which floor to go to. When I finally found the hint, it was for this current floor so I assumed they had forgotten to write it. But I went outside and saw the floor it had come from, which was floor 41. So we went up. I'm not exactly sure what happened from here. The guy friend and I ended up at a petrol station, behind the counter and no-one was there. Customers came, so to keep up the pretence, I served them while the guy looked for stuff. We left and at some point we were given a car by our 'leader', and there was me, a girl and my guy friend. I'm not sure what we were, but the goblins could possibly smell us, but generally would only do so if we aroused suspicion. The guy friend and I went to some event that a friend of mine was involved with. I was talking to her and thought something was wrong. She took me outside and I turned around to see her eyes had gone a weird shade of white, surrounded by black, and I said 'are you trying to be a zombie? What are you doing?' and her eyes went back to normal and her face broke out in a red, lumpy rash. I just acted confused and annoyed and it seemed to convince her that I didn't know about the goblins (which she apparently was). I walked off, pretending to be upset at her actions, and went to find my guy friend to leave. She had realised by this point I was pretending and we had to run. The other people there seemed to be acting strange as well, and I said 'It's everyone'. We were then driving and it had been a while since we'd slept - as the goblins would locate us when we stopped. We finally found a hideout where we could relax for a bit. Our leader brought us a new car - a van, which had two rows of seats in the back and a big boot for storage. It was also apparently very good for handling corners. We were excited because it meant more room to store stuff (which we had trouble with) and could fit more people if needed."
"4127"	"(2014-12-24 (23)) Mom and Darren bought a new house on Rochester Circle. I wasn't told about it until basically we moved in. There were no actual bedrooms and I got really annoyed and was yelling at them for not even asking and for not even getting a house with rooms."
"4128"	"(2015-01-04 (23)) I was part of a unit trying to kill these aliens. I think we were on their planet, but I'm not sure. We were battling outside in a rocky kind of landscape, shooting with these big futuristic looking guns. Some time later I was at this house (it could've been mine, but I'm not sure). There were muffins on the bench. I got a call from Weiss (Alias) asking if there were muffins and I said yes. Some of the stuff he was asking sounded weird and I suspected him of being a bad guy. I started eating a bunch of muffins. They returned and I remember seeing Jack, Vaughn and Weiss. Weiss went straight to the muffins and I went up to Jack and mouthed that Weiss was bad (not sure of exact thing I said). He took me outside and we went down the side of the house, in the shadows (it was night, btw). He said ""really, Vaughn?"" and I said ""no, Weiss!"" I explained what I'd heard, but heard noises nearby and they'd come outside. Jack started shouting about the neighbour to cover up our conversation and we walked back to the group. Then I was at at home and Mom and Darren got home at like 3am and the neighbour across the road (who was a fat, 50-ish guy) was mowing the lawn. It was very loud and Darren went over to complain."
"4129"	"(2015-01-09 (23)) I was supervising my first IGA. I kept losing my location stickers. I had to put S locations up next to the normal locations for checking purposes. Esther had started checking although people hadn't finished scanning. I had only put up 2 stickers and couldn't find my sheets. I kept getting pulled away for stuff and getting distracted. Everyone ended up finishing and sitting around doing nothing and I was panicking and running around looking for my sheets. Niles was there and looking smug and I was annoyed that he had to be there while things were going wrong."
"4130"	"(2015-01-15 (23)) We lived somewhere else, in this apartment building type of thing. A light/mixed Native guy followed me up the stairs. He said he'd show me how to pick the lock of our door. I said to Mom, who was standing nearby, 'he's trying to break in'. He got the first one opened, but nothing with the second. He pulled it off and showed us that the mechanism had broken and wasn't working. He followed me in and kept following me around. Later, there was some kind of family reunion thing happening in another country. Dad, Ezra and I were there. This guy around my age and I were friends since childhood or something and were both very intelligent. He was a scientist-mind. We were in this big warehouse kind of thing and were having some kind of battle (based on what some mysterious person said or something that one of us had to die). We were drinking this potions and growing bigger. Then another potion did something else and made us turn blue. Then he mixed part of a potion with another potion and went red and had fire breath. Then somehow we could just say what we wanted to change and I was like 'bigger' and we slowly got bigger until we went through the ceiling. Then he had claws and all these things, so I just started listing off heaps of stuff while trying to escape his attacks. Then I could think my changes. I ended up going invisible and being able to fly, but because I had so many changes I was heavy and it was difficult to stay up. He went invisible as well, but I made it so I could see him. I got close enough to him to 'switch off' the changes and he turned into a kid again. I said this was stupid and we should stop and he seemed grateful and told me to switch back too, so I went back to a kid as well. And we left laughing that we almost caused a war. Also at some point, Ezra was aged back to a baby? Or was cloned into a baby? He liked giving high-fives, so I was high-fiving him."
"4131"	"(2015-01-28 (24)) We were all given 'roles' like in Town of Salem (medium etc), but they were 'super powers'. A medium guy died and then his brain was in the computers. We were trying to get away from bad guys and were holed up in this house. I was trying to get the medium guy to help us, but he seemed reluctant. There were also bad guys trying to hack the computers. Later I ended up in this place where we were like prisoners. I got a shirt from someone which had a code on it. There was a sentence with every first letter highlighted but I could only glance at it for like a second before someone would enter the room. I could only read 'too' so far. Later I was being talked to by one of the 'leaders' and managed to read it whilst getting something from the fridge and it read 'toolshed'. I knew this was related to a prophecy regarding Sydney's mother (Alias) (who was either my 'lost' mother or someone else). I saw her run by the window of the place I was, and I just got up and ran out the back to the door of the toolshed. She said something to me and we held each other as the place exploded."
"4132"	"(2015-01-28 (24)) I was on the forum and Benjamin posted saying he had been flirting with this girl for ages and she was finally his girlfriend and something like 'Izzy will be happy for me'. I went to his Facebook and his profile photo was of them together. She was quite ugly. There were tons of pictures from April 2014 of him on a cheap looking film set and it looked like that's where they'd met. I was annoyed."
"4133"	"(2015-01-29 (24)) I went to see Poppa and they lived in a really big house (similar to old one). They also had maids. Poppa called me to say that an ornament hadn't been cleaned properly and some other stuff. I talked to the maids about it and they started cleaning. They only came 2-3 times a week."
"4134"	"(2015-01-29 (24)) Hugo and I were walking down a street after a stocktake. There was a parade/march on and some streets were closed off. We had taken the train, so were trying to get there. We had to crouch and walk under train to get somewhere. The end of the track was over water (the train flew?). We got to the conductor bit and he'd made a signal like he'd seen us, but then he started the train.  Hugo was in front of me and directly under it, so I quickly went back and got up and yelled at the conductor to stop, but it was too late and we all fell into the water (the train too)."
"4135"	"(2015-02-03 (24)) I was going on a long drive somewhere with Stephen Merchant and some other friends. We were sitting in the back and I was sleeping with my head on his shoulder."
"4136"	"(2015-02-03 (24)) We still lived at the old house. We took Ratatouille's cage out into the family room and left it there for a bit. When I went back to it, there were another mice in it. Some big, some small, all kinds of colours. I remember some with coffee colour patches, a white one, some like Ratatouille, grey ones and there was one with red eyes. I was grabbing them and chucking them away, but they never seemed to all be gone. So I grabbed Ratatouille and put him in another cage that they couldn't get into and put it in my room. But when I went back to it, it was full of ants. I was trying to shake the ants out and Ratatouille fell over and seemed dazed, I was like 'omg sorry' and then I went to grab him but this big spider walked up to him and looked like it was going to sting him and I squished its head. It spurted out this green stuff and covered Ratatouille in it, and then he rolled over and died. I started crying and then I woke up in the dream and was telling Mom about the dream but started crying telling it. I then woke up in real life crying."
"4137"	"(2015-02-09 (24)) I can't remember anything more of this dream, except for someone saying ""Letitia, get me a slice of cheese"". I kept waking up throughout the night with the phrase in my head, but I remember nothing else."
"4138"	"(2015-02-09 (24)) Somehow I found out that it was the end of the world. I think Zim (Invader Zim) was around as well. I decided to not tell anyone because it was inevitable and not very far away. Some footage of this thing in the sky was leaked and everyone realised. I was with a guy on this cliff and I said I'd taken the footage. There was like 17 seconds left and we counted down, but nothing happened. Some people had killed themselves and I remember Payton shouting something like ""I'm a virgin and Lady Gaga sucks!""."
"4139"	"(2015-02-10 (24)) Dan Palmer was around and eating some weird food. Mom had some weird food from Granma like fish and eggs, that were strange colours like purple and pink. Dan put his bowl next to Mom's and they looked almost identical. We both took a picture of it. It was my birthday. We were at the old house. Granma called Mom and I told her to say I was out and she did. Mom was giving her my email as 'Izzy.conell@yahoo.com'. Then she pulled up in the driveway. I ran and told Mom that I had to go silent in my room for hours. There was a massive storm one night and Mom and Darren said they could see a hurricane. There was a movie with a leopard which attacked this girl after knocking on her door and when she went out he roared, but the girl got away. Something happened in the town 17 years ago and these kids survived but some stuff happened to them and the sheriff said they were 'strong' because of it."
"4140"	"(2015-02-11 (24)) Doing an IGA. I was stickering and people were scanning. I was in a room with Esther and Hugo, and Esther was taking to Hector -- who was in another room. She asked him how much he trusted me with running his IGA job and he said 'not very much. She misses locations, wanders off' etc and Esther and I were confused and she said 'Izzy's right here, Hector' and went to talk to him saying I'd done it a million times and I was fine. Hugo said, to no-one in particular, that he 'trusted me completely'. Hector came in with the laptop with proof and Hugo complained that he was embarrassing me. There were pictures of some problems -- eg, not separating old guns with new guns because I didn't know, 8 pictures of a movie I watched and one video of me and Mikhail mucking around but it was actually because Mikhail took something from me and didn't give it back."
"4141"	"(2015-02-11 (24)) I was wandering around with Joaquin Phoenix and Shia La Beouf. I'd not liked them but now I was hanging around with them getting to know them. We were walking the streets at night. They were flirty and kept saying I'd sleep with them but I thought in my head that I'd probably do Phoenix, but not La Beouf."
"4142"	"(2015-02-14 (24)) Mom found this guy who looked after animals to look after my mice. I went over there to see them and the guy was really hot. He had black hair and blue eyes, and sort of 'masculine' and not my type, but still very charismatic (though fairly soft-spoken and quiet) and attractive. His house was full of animals and clothing racks [possibly due to stocktaking so many clothing stores lately] with lots of 'sexy' women's clothes of all different sizes - implying that he had many lovers. I remember his last name was Willett, and I think his first name was Dean. We began sleeping together - his 'rule' was that he would pretty much sleep with anyone he wanted to and never got into a relationship with anyone. This carried on for a while. One day I went over to do something with the mice and he had another girl there (hispanic looking). I was unfazed and carried on with the mice and left. Some time later he started getting possessive and told me to not see anyone else (which I wasn't anyway). Then it was a movie and he was less attractive and had a weird, deep and ugly voice. There was a girl called Ivy who owned a bakery (or something like that) who he was now 'my character'. He also had this silver/metal mark on his face and was a loud, fast talker (salesman-like). There were a few ensemble characters as well. It turned out that this guy was disturbed and a murderer and all the other characters had issues too. Ivy's bakery had actually been in an explosion some time ago, but in her mind it was still flourishing. So she was still working and serving imaginary customers (and the other customers who still believed it was fine), though it was abandoned and covered with dust and there was a broken mirror."
"4143"	"(2015-02-19 (24)) There was a woman (called Essie?) with a Goa'uld (we were calling them that, though they functioned differently). We were keeping her under lockdown in this room and she couldn't pass the barrier, although she did once and you just had to say a word and it was like in vampire movies and she'd get 'dragged' back in. If people went into the room she could transfer over. We had to keep the door open for some reason and there was a kind of party/celebration happening. A dog ran into the room and I chased it out, but as I was trying to get it, a young girl (like 2) wandered in and went into a bed. As I went to get someone, the kid walked out. We concluded quickly that the dog was not infected but then I mentioned the kid had gone in. The kid looked shocked and was holding this bottle and had really small hands and I thought it looked weird. She was also very ugly. The girl said she wasn't infected, but was talking in 'homie' speak and her sister was like 'that's not her'. She looked defeated and went back to the room with us and transferred out. Not sure if same dream or the same 'storyline', but I had some group of people after me (though I wasn't 'me'). I ended up having to jump out of a window into water at night and then hid under this bridge - the building was surrounded by water for some reason, about waist-high, since while I was hiding under the bridge, people were walking around in it looking for me, though while I was swimming around in it, it was deep. Anyway, I kept going under the water to look at their feet and which way they were facing. But I was stuck under there all night. In the morning the 'head' of the group - a lady - said she'd found a body. Then at some point there was a baby/young kid and it was 'bad' for whatever reason, so I strangled it fairly violently, whilst also crying."
"4144"	"(2015-02-20 (24)) I lived in, or was staying in, this big house sort of near the sea/no close neighbours. Lots of windows around it. It was night and I was outside and it was windy. I went back inside and was worried there were dodgy people around. I locked the door. I sat in the dark, in the corner on my computer and I was watching the security cameras and saw quite a few guys sneaking around the side of the house. I called the police and said ""I'm alone at [whatever the address was] "" and the guy was like 'oh are you so-and-so's niece' and I said yes, yes and said there were dodgy guys. One came up to the door and just opened it and came in. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed two kitchen knives and stabbed him. I remembered Rover was in the house (it was just us) and I went to find him and saw a guy aiming a machine gun at him, and I threw one of the guys in front of him to protect Rover from the bullets. I slit two guy's throats at the same time, and stabbed the last guy. I think there were a few more guys that I also killed. Rover had gotten hurt and I called around for some kind of 'pet ambulance' and I sat with him, patting him."
"4145"	"(2015-02-22 (24)) I was staying away somewhere, like in these cabins but we weren't supposed to go out after dark or something and keep our doors locked. I think there was something dangerous going on, but I'm not sure. There were 4 girls (including myself) and 4 guys. One of them was kind of hot and we kept catching each other's eye. We flirted for a bit and then ended up having sex, but it was a little bit rapey. We kept having sex though. I posted a vague post on the forum that I'd had sex with someone but shouldn't have and the posts were all 'helpful advice' type of posts, but saying like 'if it's consensual sex then it's ok', and they hadn't really gotten the gist that it was only partly consensual. Benjamin posted my FilmForum activity and like 'how can you fit anything else in when you're working 44 hours a week and watching this many films' but it was only like 1 film a week. Something happened and someone else and I were outside somewhere (during the day), not sure what was going on, and there was a pond thing with passports in it. I joked that we were actually dead and these are our passports. They were our passports and she freaked out like 'how did you know' and I said it was a guess 'you know how many movies I've seen, this happens all the time'. Everyone had then forgotten their memory (except for me), but no-one really knew and we all bundled into this room and sat at this long table - girls on one side, guys on the other. I still found myself attracted to the guy from before and I caught him staring at me again. I wondered if he'd still be the same as before."
"4146"	"(2015-02-24 (24)) I had this dildo thing which was like a realistic penis. I was performing oral sex on it and noted that it tasted like a real penis. It was very big, but as I relaxed and got into it, I got more of it 'in'. Although nothing was going on elsewhere, it started bringing me to orgasm."
"4147"	"(2015-02-26 (24)) Mom did something to my car, and then ended up getting the whole windscreen smashed. We were driving in another car and I was annoyed, but not overly angry. I kept mentioning it though and worried about how I was going to get to work. We went to a petrol station, which was tiny and she parked in it - that is, the bonnet of the car to about the windows was as big as the store and my window was just next to the counter. I saw some of those mint slice chocolates and wanted one but didn't ask. There were two policeman nearby too. I can't remember what happened, but I ended up meeting some people and staying with them in a hotel room. There were 3 guys and 1 other girl - but I think she was already a friend of mine? Or at least I knew her before the others. One of the guy's was called Dave and was the hottest one and who had taken a liking to me. He had brown hair and a bit of stubble. They all wanted to throw a party and took a vote on it, saying that I wouldn't want to, but I agreed as well. I was slightly excited about it, but also already bored by the idea. They started setting up, gathering drinks and snacks and so on. They were rolling a dice to see who got to choose which drink next (drinking before the party started). I was sat against a wall, the girl on my right and one of the other guy's on her right (all spaced quite far away). The other guy (not Dave and not the one sitting down) was the one she liked. He had a bit of a chubby face. Dave was talking to him just outside the room and I noticed he had a ring on each ring finger, which annoyed me. I was thinking I'd drink a bit and wanted to sleep with him, but wondered if I could go through with it if he was wearing jewellery. He grabbed a bottle and came over to me and said something about 'being in love with me' but that I wasn't interested. He sat down right next to me and I made a face and said 'we've known each other for like 2 days'."
"4148"	"(2015-03-02 (24)) I was stocktaking in a big clothes warehouse. There were rows and rows of clothes up to the ceilings and I was hoping someone else would have to do them because I didn't want to have to keep climbing up ladders. The supervisor of the job didn't have enough guns for everyone to be scanning at once, so some of us were wandering around trying to find something to do. At one point me and another guy were tidying up some of the floor racks that had clothes just piled on top. Later, we started taking barcodes out, and then the supervisor gave us check sheets - which was like a map of the area with houses and the houses represented something or other. There was some house where these twins lived and they had an exact copy of themselves (so 4) and each pair shared a bed. Anyway, later I was doing some more wandering, when the supervisor said we needed more people to be guarding the entrances and she referred to me as the 'sheriff' and put me at the front entrance. There were zombies or demons or something around. I wasn't particularly scared, just slightly nervous (apparently used to this). I walked back and forth for a few minutes, when I saw a group of 4 of them in a line shuffling backwards towards us (two of them had been our staff, another one of the warehouse's staff and they'd been possessed. Pretty sure they were demons since they were intelligent, but we called them zombies). I ran in and called out and said 'there's 4 in a line coming towards us!' and she told me to sound the alarm. There was a big red button on the wall and I pressed it. The alarm sounded and people just came out of nowhere grabbing weapons. I got a rifle but it had no ammo and I was still looking in the bag of ammo, putting some into the gun (it only held 2 at a time) when they entered the room. There were 2-3 entrances on each side of the building. One was near me and a demon came through and I shot him right in the head. Lots more kept coming. There was also a building next door (about 5 metres from this one, exactly the same) that sounded like they were getting slaughtered. When we'd finished them all off, we looked next door and no-one was left alive. Then shadows started going weird and these things that are hard to describe, but sort of like a stapler remover - there wasn't much to them, they were solid black and had one sharp pointer on the top and bottom. They also had this deafening squeal. They were shoving their pointers into people's legs and such and dragging them off. One stabbed me in my leg and it hurt like hell and they didn't seem to respond to the guns. I then had a knife or something which seemed to get rid of it."
"4149"	"(2015-03-03 (24)) I went to a cinema to see Kingsman again, just to rewatch the church scene [saw it yesterday, loved the church scene] . I was in the cinema, and a teenage girl was annoying me. I moved seats and she moved behind me and kicked the seat giggling and ran back up. She did something else and I maybe hit her, but we went to the cinema manager and I told him about something she'd done that she wasn't allowed to and she got a warning and that was the end of it. Then she was Farrah. We went outside and Valerie was there too. She was being friendly. My car was like this little bike with like helicopter blades and my car engine could be moved so my car engine was in it. I got in and flew up but then something went weird and it went back to the ground and then I saw fire, so I got out and it exploded, killing Valerie and setting fire to everything around it. It spread quickly to this bush area."
"4150"	"(2015-03-04 (24)) Karl, Ricky and Steve were play wrestling on some grass. They were also wet. I remember Steve getting up and walking away and his back was really hair (and wet, so slicked down)."
"4151"	"(2015-03-05 (24)) I was at home, which was slightly different, and I heard people outside my window and someone shot a gun through my window and hit me. I can't actually remember properly what happened after that, I kept passing out in the dream and I think I was trying to call an ambulance and I think Mom was there too."
"4152"	"(2015-03-10 (24)) I was watching a film about this guy whose daughter had died from some illness when she was about 8 or so. Not sure what happened to his wife, but he started dating this woman and he never talked about his past with her. Sometimes it switched between being 'first person view' from the woman and it being a film. While 'I' was the woman, I was at his house and this young girl came up and started talking to me. She was a bit mysterious with the way she spoke but I gathered she was his daughter. He couldn't see her though. Then I started seeing his wife too. Something happened and he went crazy and he started killing people. But it was like an interactive movie, so you were experiencing the kills as well. The lighting was all weird, like dark but red and then blue etc. He was crying and crazed looking and had a knife and he was slicing up his wife and this other woman. Even once they were dead, he was just slicing and slicing. He killed the daughter as well. Then a baby started crying and he went to kill it. Then I was in like a cinema watching it and a lady behind me was snivelling. I thought she was stupid for finding it sad and I was impressed at how intense and immersive it was."
"4153"	"(2015-03-15 (24)) I was in English class with Ms Solomon, though it was somehow connected to GBCS. We had to do these essays as well as make up some 'this or that' cards, which would get randomly placed around a supermarket that we were stocktaking and then we'd have to pick our favourite and give an argument about why that one was the best. I made one on Bridget Jones' Diary with Colin Firth and Hugh Grant on each side. I made another one based around Colin Firth. I was highlighting the 'correct' answer (Colin Firth) in yellow. The third one had something to do with a werewolf character. I had another that had 'watch Hababam' and 'watch [something else bad] ' on the other side. I decided to change the other film I'd picked and as a joke, Ms Solomon suggested changing it to something like 'ants eating your eyes because of something or other'. I can't remember what she said now, but I wrote that down and it was a decent sized paragraph. Autumn was there and she was carrying all the choices. Mine were taped to my textbooks. I decided to take out the Colin Firth ones, thinking they were stupid. I told her I needed to put the big one in there (it was heavy to carry as well) and while I was doing that, I took out the two textbooks and put them in my bag. I bought a few things and then decided I wanted a Yogo. I asked the lady if it was ok and she said be quick (she was still scanning my stuff). All the Yogo's were out of date by ages, so I went to the chocolate section and they had Munchies, so I grabbed those and a Twix. I ran back and she was serving another customer, so I had to wait a bit."
"4154"	"(2015-03-19 (24)) There was a wedding going on. The bride was a French girl. I was not at the wedding, but outside on some grass nearby with some others. She walked over and she had shoulder-length blonde hair with a slight wave, light blue eyeshadow and a subtle colour lipgloss. She was average looking, but probably considered conventionally attractive. She started talking and had a weird mouth with a gap between her teeth and I thought she was ugly. I made a comment after she left that French girls are ugly. Some time later, I ended up with Esther and a girl who looked Eastern European or something like that and we went to a pub. We were scanning some fixtures on the floor with lollies and stuff, then Esther got a drink and asked if I wanted one. I was full and said no, but I'd take a pack of Salt and Vinegar chips. I then decided to get a drink and went to her and asked for a Budweiser. We sat at the table waiting for our stuff, when the guy behind the bar started spouting hate talk about women. The other girl with us started getting visibly angry and got up and confronted him. He just sort of smirked at her and she hit him with this candlestick holder thing. It made a loud 'dong' noise. He punched her and she kept hitting him. She came back over and he came over having a go. Esther said leave it alone and he started at her and I said 'oh, so we're picking on smaller and older people now' and he yelled at me. We got our stuff and got out, but he chased us and we had to run. Esther got in the driver's seat and I got in the back behind her. The other girl was far behind and I told Esther to lock the door. She got to the car and came around my side. I didn't know how to get her in the car, but then I moved across and she got in. She knocked my Wheatley bag out when she got in and I reached out to grab it and they were shouting to leave it and I said no. The guy got there as I pulled it back in and we locked the door and drove off. I was later at a shop and Trinny and Susanna or whatever were there and one of them started talking to me, asking if I wanted to stop 'sweating all the time' and I said yeah and she said ""drugs?"" ""no"" ""alcohol?"" ""no"" and some other things and then she handed me this weird looking towel, which was also a blow-up towel that heated and she said it would be effective. She was giving it to me to test but it cost $100, so after waiting a while for it to heat up I left. I was sitting on a lounge at some point and Bang-a-Boomerang came on and I was miming along and 'dancing' to it and this guy just looked at me like wtf. It ended and I said 'aw, I want more ABBA' [listening to a lot of ABBA at the moment] ."
"4155"	"(2015-04-01 (24)) Co-Worker-F-03 was supervising a job that was considered 'high up'. I can't remember what kind of store it was, though I had thoughts of Kathmandu. At the end of the job, I was somewhere else with someone and they called and said if I got back in 10 minutes they would make me a 'chief supervisor' - allowing me to potentially supervise the job in the future and being a trusted stocktaker with them. I got back and then we left. Later some people were filling out a sheet and I didn't see my name in the 'chief supervisor' bit, so he started writing it in (in chalk), but then I noticed it was already there and they scribbled it out. Later, I was on a job that Hugo was supervising (just us two). Mom had dropped me off and when she saw Hugo she gave me a look, but I put my head down so as to not egg her on [she has been making creepy suggestions lately] . It was a clothes store, but it was like a section of a bigger store and no manager was around. He had scanned a rail, and gave me a box that was underneath. We were messing around a bit and I was giggling a lot. When we got to the end, there was a bunch of other stuff from other stores and I had to check it wasn't from this one (there were some wedding dresses, as well as like porcelain type of decorations). Then I noticed cleaners in the hallway. The lights were all off too. It was early in the morning, before the store had opened and we suddenly had to be out. Another girl was then with us. We fast walked through the shadows - I noticed Hugo wasn't carrying any equipment except his two guns and I asked if he had any equipment and he said no - and were almost at the exit when someone spotted us, and we kept moving and went into the men's toilet and out a backdoor into the carpark. Then it went into third person view and showed the person walking after us as we all got in the car and drove off."
"4156"	"(2015-04-07 (24)) I was supervising something like Kathmandu at night. I had 12 people or so on the job, but when I arrived I realised I had only 2 guns and I hadn't charged them (or the ones I'd left at home). Esther turned up with 6 guns or so but I was panicking. I got some people started scanning in the back room and went to get the files on the laptop. When I went to check on people, everyone without a gun had been sent home. Hugo turned up at one point to see if we needed help but I said we didn't have any extra guns anyway."
"4157"	"(2015-04-09 (24)) I was in the world of Brazil, except it was different and stranger. I wasn't 'from' there, but I don't know how I ended up there. Jonathan Pryce looked like Mr Dark, except was Sam Lowry except that he wasn't and I was calling him Jonathan. We were dating and his place was basically just one room - it was rectangular and not very wide, I only remember seeing the room from the bed which was at the far end, there were cupboards/wardrobes around the back wall, and then the bed was next to that but the bed was facing sideways, so the back wall was to the left of the bed. There was almost no space from the end of the bed to the side wall. At the front end was the kitchen and the door was to the left of that. There was a couch and table and some other bits in the middle. I'm not sure where the bathroom was. Anyway, I remember lying in bed in the morning and he had already left for work so I was bored and awaiting his return. I went about my day and was outside in the garden later and was wondering why he still wasn't home. This policeman type of dude was around and he came by and asked to see my ID card or whatever (for the person that lived at the house) and I said it was my boyfriend's house and gave him Jonathan's card which he scanned. He then said he'd been arrested and I was like wtf. He left and then Jonathan ended up returning but had like escaped or something. He explained what happened (can't remember), then we could hear sirens coming closer so I said we had to leave now, I grabbed my phone and left everything else - I was slightly annoyed about leaving all my stuff and I only grabbed my phone because I wanted the music on it. Jonathan had this vehicle thing which sort of flew and there was only enough room for two people so we got in that thing and were 'flying' away. It was difficult to control and was all over the place though. After being chased for a while we got caught and ended up in this underground science lab. I woke up in this passage way and walked past these rooms which all had a big glass window, door on the right and inside were big eggs. It turned out the place had been cloning dinosaurs and a few baby dinosaurs were wandering about. I saw a big T-Rex type of thing at another end and I started running for the door at the end of the passage way and started climbing up the walls. A few more T-Rex things appeared as well but they hadn't seen me yet."
"4158"	"(2015-04-22 (24)) I was with Esther in a big, multi-storey gothic style house. We were doing something to do with work, but I'm not sure what. It was stormy and we went outside to do something and around the side of the house it was pitch black in the distance and a thick grey fog just in front of us. It was getting closer and weird noises were coming from it - like a whispering static. Someone else with us went into it and we ran back inside, but it had caught up and it was pitch black inside. Once it had enveloped us, the sound stopped and I couldn't see or hear anything. We had referred to it as both 'The Silence' and 'The Nothing' [the first made me think of Doctor Who and the second of The Neverending Story so I couldn't decide which one I preferred] . We were stuck in there for a year, then it went away. Only the three of us who had been caught in it had been 'gone' for all that time though."
"4159"	"(2015-04-23 (24)) I was doing a stocktake at a small-ish store. The guys who owned it were Arabs and it was a travel job and the place I was staying at was very 'Arabic' [in my head, I mean. Not actual Arabic style] - to move upstairs and such, there were these floating steps and you'd move them to jump up and across and such. I was trying to get up one, but I moved the last step too far and when I jumped across I fell. A lady and her young son were in the room and started laughing (friendly laughter, I was laughing too), she didn't speak English but said something to me. I decided to just walk straight to the place instead since I could get to it another way. I printed out the check report and there were huge numbers of coffee - it said like 'squintillion' etc. Hector was there and I thought of something funny and started giggling and he asked what I was laughing about. I said nothing and walked away a little bit, still giggling. I had to go to the toilet and went back to my room to do so. The rooms were all shared here - the rooms came in levels and in a circle so there were no real inside walls. My room had 3-4 beds. I walked in and a girl opened her phone to shine the light at me and when she saw me she went 'oh no', and I said 'sorry I have bodily functions that need seeing to' in a snarky tone and went looking for the toilet. At some point later, a guy that looked like Ioan Gruffudd was making a speech. I was lying in bed and I had this vibrator that looked like a piece of lettuce and it was easily adjustable and had it on, lying between my legs. He was someone I sort of knew. He came over to me and I tried to turn it off, but he was already crouched next to the bed by the time I switched it off. He said something to me and then went back to his speech. He said something like 'is anyone tickling themselves right now' (which made sense in the context of his speech, but I knew it was secretly aimed at me) and I put the blanket over my head and giggled. He also sent me a message saying 'I know there's a man under there, I can help you out' and then a meme-like picture of Stephen Merchant that had some kind of play on words joke about 'Slow Face Merchant' which was the name of a font and another one that was a quote from Stephen Merchant about buying something cheap."
"4160"	"(2015-05-02 (24)) I was outside with some people, in a bush-type place (though it was quite open, not many trees). This fog was hanging in the distance, but we noticed it coming closer. Someone else said to run, so we did. I had my work ladder, and other people were carrying more of our ladders. There was a young girl there as well. I couldn't run properly with the ladder. I knew we had to get to a 'save point', which was marked by an orange line on the ground. We reached it barely, the girl falling over the line and I went back to make sure she was over it and she was. It was a type of 'game' (we weren't willing participants, I'm not sure of the details), and the area was marked out with these orange lines. Then it changed slightly and the area around was actually flooded, every hour the water would fall and the walls around these areas would go down. We would then have 15 minutes to get to the next area. We were in an area that was nearing the exit (though even after we left this area, there was still flooding or whatever so I'm not sure what we were going to do) and I gave my ladder to the other guys with the ladders. They were putting them in the car, which was later under water. I was looking for my ladder, and they started pulling out the ladders but they weren't mine. Then I went underwater (it was quite deep) to check the car [I'm not sure how they got the ladders before, dream logic] and had to swim down and found the ladder under the car. I could see clearly underwater and it just looked like an underwater forest/city. In the distance I saw an area where a bridge would've been, but without the bridge and on the other side was a big group of zombies. They saw me and started climbing down (they were slow zombies). This was what the water 'protected' from - we weren't trying to escape the water, but the zombies. I went up and said they were coming and everyone started getting into action. The next area was like a house with rooms and stuff and I think wasn't affected by the time limit. Outside I could see a big shopping mall. A while later the water went away. These bad guys found us and started trying to break in. We were trying to make weapons and stuff to fight with. The mall was also full of zombies and I found it amusing how accurate Dawn of the Dead and stuff had been."
"4161"	"(2015-05-04 (24)) Something happened to me and I kept seeing those ghost people (it was something similar to It Follows, where only you can see them and they'll keep coming to you and you can pass it on). I was in a room at one point when one appeared and I tried to scream but nothing would come out. Later I was with some other people and there was an old guy there but I thought he was one of them. I tried to cover myself with a blanket and was fiddling around with it and then in real life, my hands must've moved and touched each other and I woke up in a panic - in the dream I interpreted the touching as the ghost guy touching me."
"4162"	"(2015-05-22 (24)) I was at a shopping centre and 3 other girls and I were sitting on this couch. They were all friends and talking amongst each other. We had won a competition to meet Michael Fassbender? He came up to us and shook our hands (I was the last one). They were all giggling and I was laughing at their reaction. He walked away and they were commenting on how hot he was and how he walked, and then when he got a little bit away, he turned around and came back. Then there was a food place just near us and he lined up to get some food. I got up to go to the toilet and he walked by me. The girl's toilet was occupied and he went into the men's. Co-Worker-F-04 was somewhere at some point and in America there was a hat called a thong, which had two hats joined together and a bit of material hanging down at the back. I got to the conversation late and she gave me the hat to try on. I asked which hat I was supposed to put on, she took it back and showed me - the back one was actually on your head and the front one sat up slightly higher and I said 'oh yeah I've seen those rapper people wear stuff like that' and they giggled. Later I was playing this game where you could make all different choices, eventually leading to all these different endings. It was 'real' though. I ran down this hall into this area where you could train your 'agility', I reset at one point and saw someone go outside to train 'strength' and I didn't know how they got outside. When I kept 'dying', I decided to follow the other person and went outside to train strength (there were a few options, I picked one of those strong man games and hit the hammer down on the button and the thing went ding in the highest area. Then later there was this room with lots of shelves with useless stuff on them. Someone was coming in through this door and I had to hide. Sam (Supernatural) was also there and when he noticed the person coming, he climbed into a cupboard and closed the door, and I only had a few seconds to find somewhere to hide so I lay down in one of the aisles but the guy came in and switched on the light and found me (I also struggled to keep my eyes open while I was there and felt like I was going to fall asleep). I reset and tried running back into another room. There were suitcases but I didn't fit in them. I reset again and realised there was a cupboard joined to the one Sam was in. I paused and climbed up and slowly moved backwards into it. There was some stuff, including a roll of wrapping paper and I pushed it under me. The wrapping paper was between my legs and from moving back and forth I ended up coming. As I went to lock the door, the game unpaused itself. The locks didn't hold and I had to keep grabbing Sam's door and my door and closing it back up. I passed the area and continued onwards, but I can't remember what else happened."
"4163"	"(2015-05-24 (24)) I was working at this shopping centre. I wasn't supervising but I had equipment with me. There were quite a few close parking spots, so I parked and went in. Then I wasn't working and it was like a hotel or something. I can't remember what happened properly, but there was a lady with long red nails who was a werewolf. The colour red would set her off. She had some control over it, but was dangerous. I was with someone else and we went into one of the rooms. We went into the other room and there was a window at ground level with no curtains. We were scared because she was nearby and might see us. I started trying to cover myself with a blanket, but then I realised it was red. I jumped up and told the person I was with we should leave. Her husband or boyfriend was also around and we warned him (he didn't know she was a werewolf). We ran out to my car - I couldn't remember where I parked at first, but I easily found it because it was such a bright red and my licence plate was clearly 1CEZ -084 [my actual number plate] . The guy I was with jumped in the driver's seat and I was a bit annoyed because it was my car but I got in the passenger seat and gave him the keys. I told him to lock the doors but reached over myself and locked it. We drove for a while and then it was night. We stopped in the middle of the street for some reason and got out and the guy got attacked by the werewolf. She hadn't changed fully. I told her something in exchange for leaving me be, but she could only control it for so long, so I got back to the car and took off. I was meeting others somewhere nearby. I got to fork and couldn't remember if it was left or right, but I turned right. Then I was on World of Warcraft and was questing and it was like this outside area with these leafy plant creatures and a bunch of scientists. I had to kill like 40 of them."
"4164"	"(2015-05-25 (24)) There was a 'flashback' to old times (looked Roman-y). These young guys were coaxed into seeing this woman who would have sex with them and they could lose their virginity. One guy had already done it and had these spots on him, but he encouraged his friends anyway. They had to go through this portal door into this weird cave like place. I can't remember what happened exactly, but they changed their minds, panicked and went back through the door. As they did their skin began to bubble and melt off and they screamed and died."
"4165"	"(2015-05-25 (24)) It was then this Friday and I was talking to Dad about something and he mentioned some dates and it didn't seem to add up. I realised that I'd gotten my dates mixed up and missed every job on this week. I freaked out and triple checked and wondered why I hadn't been called when I hadn't shown up. I put it down to enjoying these few days off and losing track of time. I didn't know what to do about it, but was feeling stressed. Markiplier had joined our forum and had made a few computer related posts asking about stuff I didn't even understand. I thought I should delete the posts I made about him in the Celebrity Crush Thread."
"4166"	"(2015-06-26 (24)) I woke up (in apartment in Hollywood) and it was 12.45pm. It was today (going to Six Flags) and I was supposed to be up at 7am to get picked up at 9am [happening IRL] . I tried to call Winifred and had no luck, so text her saying I was getting ready. I went downstairs (place was different) and found her on another street. I said my alarm didn't go off, I have no idea how I slept that long etc. We agreed it was too late to go today and I suggested Sunday but she seemed bewildered by the idea. Then she said maybe we could go today and Sunday but then realised it would cost too much. So we decided on Sunday. Then I was back home and Mom was talking to someone about me saying that I had no sexual experience and they were like 'how do you know' and she asked me and I said 'I'm not answering that question' and then said 'no', ambiguously. Mom said that she knew people interested and she said 'Chris' (actually Matthieu) saying he liked fat girls. I was like 'ew wtf' and then thought Luisa was the skinniest person ever when we first met her. He was then over and acting weirdly and I tried to avoid him."
"4167"	"(2015-07-04 (24)) I was outside with some people and there were some dark clouds looming, and I suggested we get into this plane, which we did but this guy started flying it and I was like 'I didn't mean to fly it' and then he said something like one of the guys in the group had to die, so he parked it in this water but it was shallow so we walked out. Then everyone picked a Pokemon toy, and they had Cyndaquil, Psyduck, Mewtwo and this pink one that wasn't a real Pokemon and I chose that one."
"4168"	"(2015-07-05 (24)) I don't remember anything else, but I met up with Elmer and EscapeArtist."
"4169"	"(2015-07-13 (24)) I can't remember properly, but I was driving and it was flooding everywhere because it was the end of the world. But then there were zombies. The zombies were smart and could learn. They also weren't rotting and dead, they pretty much just looked normal but with blank expression. At one point I was with some others trying to hide and escape this place. I ended up at this space station place, in space, with Mom but it wasn't actually Mom. We snuck around and took these pods to this other section of it. I can't remember what we were trying to do. But we couldn't leave to get back and they'd found us."
"4170"	"(2015-07-19 (24)) I was in America with some people who I didn't know. Someone was showing me and this guy around. The guy said he was freezing because he thought he was going to Africa and didn't pack warmly, we laughed (it was winter). We were waiting outside this fancy Chinese restaurant. Then Cristian from Big Brother UK 2015 was there and he went to the bathroom to have a bath. There were windows and we saw him sitting in this spa with bubbles. Some girls went around to look through a closer window. Later, I was in a room with some people and the lights were off. I was in bed and went under the covers and I had a penis, and was masturbating. I wondered if it was big or not, so looked at it and was disappointed that it was small. Then I was somewhere outside with Cristian and Danny. I think Cristian and I ended up having sex or something. Danny came up to me and said that this meant I also fancied him and he leaned in to kiss me and I slapped him. I was smiling and joking (we were friends I guess), but said I wasn't interested and was a bit grossed out."
"4171"	"(2015-07-24 (24)) I was either on Big Brother, or knew some of the Big Brother people. I knew Helen (BBUK 2014) and we had not gotten along, but we had each other's numbers. Anyway, I was on a job that Esther was running. It was like a 2-storey chemist or Priceline. I had a text from Helen saying 'hey you should check out this website, you'll love it' and I thought it seemed spammy, but I opened the link and it was some random site. I got a call from her but couldn't take it as I was being briefed by Esther. I took her phone for some reason and also went downstairs with my phone as Helen called again and I answered. She said to ignore the text and I said 'the spammy one' and she said yeah. I said something awkwardly, but politely, like 'was there anything else' and she repeated what I said with a sound of disgust in her voice. I said 'hello?' but she didn't respond. I could hear an indicator and realised she was driving. I kept saying hello but got no answer. Then Hugo was there and a bunch of other people who turned out to be Esther's kids - one of the guys was quite attractive. They were messing around and I took out Esther's phone and took a photo of them and they wanted it deleted but I said no, and one was playfully trying to get it back and saying I'd sent it to myself and I said I hadn't, but then thought I should so I did so while they tried to get it back. Esther then came down and looked sick and then vomited quite violently. She muttered something about needing her phone and I gave it back to her."
"4172"	"(2015-07-27 (24)) I was in San Francisco and something happened and 'they' wanted to keep an eye on me, so sent PDQ to kind of kidnap me and keep eyes on me 24/7. The first place he took me was this boat or something and I tried sending information that I was 'near the bay' and that this tall building landmark was in sight. Then he took me to this safehouse place. He gave me this weird food to eat. After 48 hours or whatever, they were satisfied and let me go. PDQ said he was impressed I didn't kick up a fuss and made some weird joke about me trying to eat the lid of some food."
"4173"	"(2015-07-30 (24)) I was at the Technical College (different) and in a class that was quite full. I was sitting with Tristan and Fletcher. The lecturer was trying to find a movie that none of us had seen to assign it to a project for us. We had a 10 minute break and I got up to look at the list of movies and wrote down all the ones I hadn't seen. When everyone got back from break, they'd moved seats slightly and it was all out of whack which annoyed me. Next door was a barn with horses and cows and they were making noises and we looked out and saw they were feeding. Later, there was some bad guy and some obstacles. The bad guy took off down this zipline but we'd been warned some of them were 'fake' and would disappear part way, I sent one off to see what would happen and it disappeared. A girl carefully used her fingers to slide across and another girl decided to copy her but she fell in halfway and died (there was like acid or something). Nearby was more acid and some pipes that you had to balance across. Tristan got on without shoes and I commented on it as he was making his way down and he said something like he'd be ok and then he toppled over and fell in."
"4174"	"(2015-08-04 (24)) I vaguely remember something similar to It Follows. I was in this building with some others and the 'It' couldn't get you if you were in the light but it could be in the shadows and it also had 'powers' that could turn off lights. Every time it appeared it would just keep coming towards you, staring at you and it was really scary."
"4175"	"(2015-08-05 (24)) We had just moved into a new house. It was huge and lots of bedrooms. I was trying to decide which one I wanted. Mom and Darren were acting weird and looked upset. Mom said something and I didn't hear it so asked her to repeat it and she was like 'don't worry about it' but I asked again and she said she and Darren had decided to break up. Then she started crying. I went away and was annoyed and a bit upset because I was confused about what we would do since he paid all the bills."
"4176"	"(2015-08-07 (24)) I was married to this chubby-ish guy who looked like AJ Bowen. He went to have a shower, and I got naked and lay on the bed on my stomach. He got out of the shower and saw me and climbed on top. He was moving, but his penis wasn't going in and I was thinking 'how small is he?'. I tried moving myself and grabbing it and pushing it inside me, but he couldn't get it back in. [In real life, I half woke up as I orgasmed, but promptly fell back asleep and returned to the dream] . I was really horny and annoyed. I whispered to him to turn over, he didn't hear me and I said it again. He got up and I turned around but he left the room. I didn't know where he went off too and I checked to see if he'd come, but he hadn't. Then I was at home, which was like the old house. I looked out the window and saw Mom walking down the driveway so I assumed they were leaving. I had this big box full of sex toys and I got this suction cap dildo and put it on my chair and sat on it and bounced up and down fast, which made a bit of noise because of the chair, but I came quickly. I got up and the suction cap was on the chair but no dildo and it was still inside me. It was covered in cum and slippery and sticky. I didn't know how to reattach the two, so I got a tissue to wipe them down and then put all of them back in the box. I then heard talking from somewhere in the house and realised they were home, but I didn't know if they'd been back the whole time. I also noticed my door wasn't closing, if I tried to lock it, it would still pop back open. It just kept opening inwards. After packing everything away, I told them and Darren came to have a look at it. He knew what the problem was and said it was an insurance issue so he couldn't touch it and had to call out certain people to take a look."
"4177"	"(2015-08-12 (24)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and much bigger. We all went into a classroom and Ms Nowak was teaching us, but I thought it was supposed to be Screen Studies and I asked a couple of people and then someone asked her and she said Mr Hoover was sick, so she was doing a class similar to hers. Everyone left early and we ended up in a computer class. I was next to Tristan. I left the room to do something and when I came back Classmate-M-01 was sitting at my computer playing what looked like Solitaire. I went up to ask him to move and then decided to just sit at a different computer, but then I realised I was still logged on on that one so I sat in a chair and pulled up next to him and realised he was playing Runescape and I said 'no-one plays Runescape anymore' and told him to get off my computer. He slowly did and I went about my business. I was also browsing the forum. I left the room again for something and all these people had this printed out screenshot from the forum of Elmer saying something weird. I started grabbing all the pieces of paper and I was really angry and maybe embarrassed about it. I found Classmate-M-01 and yelled at him about it. Then I walked back around to the classroom and I saw Tristan sitting on a bench in a hall. I got to the classroom and no-one was there and it was locked. I went back to Tristan and he was like 'just leave it and get it tomorrow'. Then I can't remember what happened but we left the building briefly and when we returned it was like an abandoned building. Leaves were everywhere, dust covered everything, windows and walls were broken etc. It was dark and creepy. I noticed that the lighting was really bad (as if it were a film with bad lighting), but that it added to the creepiness. We returned to the classroom and there was a big woosh of wind as I opened the doors (it was like two big doors) as if they were going to shut on us, but they didn't. Everything was old in the room too; smashed windows, leaves blowing about and it was like it hadn't been touched in years. I got my bag from under the desk I was at and we went to leave. Not sure what happened next but we were outside and Tristan had been acting weird and then he was evil and was doing this evil grin and it was really dark so I couldn't see his face, just a bit of his chin and the rest was under exposed from the bad lighting. I was trying to get away from him but didn't know where to go."
"4178"	"(2015-08-21 (24)) I was in Bali, staying in these weird cabin hut things. A group of people were outside at night on the beach singing Agadoo and doing the dance and I joined in. I posted on the forum what I was doing. Then it was day and Bali was close by, like a few km away. I could see the city from where I was. There was a tidal wave which was small and got bigger. I climbed a tree or building or something to get higher. I managed to get over to the other side eventually but the world had been overtaken by creatures and bad dudes. Then it was normal and I was waiting outside an apartment block thing and Cecelia and Fletcher came out. I was waiting in the passenger seat of a car. Someone said Judah wasn't here yet and I got excited because I didn't know he was coming. I turned around at one point and saw him and someone else waiting behind the car."
"4179"	"(2015-09-02 (24)) I went somewhere for a party thing or something. It wasn't anything big or fancy. I was there early and saw someone wearing a shirt that said 'Stephen Merchant' on it and then I realised it was Stephen Merchant. I walked up excitedly and was like 'omg I don't want to sound weird but I'm a big fan' and he was happy to chat with me. He got a bit drunk and started coming on to me a bit strong and I pushed him away and left. Then I wondered why I was pushing him away since I'd wanted that for so long, but I didn't want a random drunken fumble. When I went back later, he was gentler and whispered an apology in my ear."
"4180"	"(2015-09-02 (24)) I was at the Technical College and it was today, but they said the 'downstairs' studio was free and we'd all be going down there and could shoot. The 'upstairs' studio (the 'main' one) was bigger than the real-life one and had these big light boxes which could change colour and do disco type lights. This was where we were going to shoot. The downstairs one was smaller and didn't have any fancy stuff. We'd only booked a camera as we were only going to be rehearsing and we weren't allowed to add any more equipment as they'd need to bring in a lawyer. We just went along with rehearsing. Cecelia looked like she'd dyed half her hair blue (top front half, and a few inches of side), but it was just a cloth. We set up lights (which we somehow had now) and Cecelia did the first bit of the song (guitar intro), then we stopped the music and went to this outside area. Tristan and Juniper were also there, but I don't remember seeing the others. We spent so much time doing nothing and then it was time for lunch and Tristan left. Juniper's Facebook 'About Me' bit said something about how she didn't like when people compared the living conditions in third world countries to living in Midvale (regarding trash)."
"4181"	"(2015-09-02 (24)) I went to this shop and it was weird and like a circle but only had one entrance. There were drunk people everywhere and I had to talk through this group and a guy told me to 'lick and wipe my chin' and I instinctively wiped it, but then they said it was because a guy was turned on by that. I just kept walking. It was kind of dusk outside, and I went to my car and got in and locked the door. I felt uneasy. I left but I was followed by two other cars, with people whooping and driving crazy. I had to drive crazy to get away and then it was like a game and I was smashing into things and doing spins and so forth. I can't remember what else happened."
"4182"	"(2015-09-08 (24)) Mom, Ezra and I went to Red Rooster and we let this girl who was walking in front of us (in the drive thru). We ordered 3 chicken 'rolls' (actually wraps) and chips. We were waiting for like 40 minutes, apparently because the girl in front of us had ordered 10 burgers and they could only cook one patty at a time and they took 7 minutes each. Later we were at home. Some people were staying over, including the Hulk. We went into the bedroom for some reason and he was lying in bed (as Hulk) masturbating. We were like 'argh, Hulk!' and walked out and when we went back in he was back to normal (as Mark Ruffalo) and we talked to him briefly and left."
"4183"	"(2015-09-08 (24)) I was at a party, lots of people were there from the Technical College. Frederick was there and was really drunk. I wasn't drinking and was sitting at a table by myself. He came over and started flirting with me, openly saying 'I'm drunk, so I'm flirty' and wouldn't leave me alone. I just kept saying 'go away, Frederick'. He kept harassing me, which was annoying but it was also funny so I started giggling at one point which spurred him on. He opened some food thing (mayo) and it got in my hair. I went to the bathroom and locked the door and went to take a shower, and he was hanging around outside still."
"4184"	"(2015-09-08 (24)) I had posted a video of a video Dan Palmer had posted, saying something about him being hot. When I checked the video next, I saw that he had specifically requested it to not be able to see it. I felt really bad and was sad that it'd bothered him so much. When I checked the button to 'ignore' something, you had to say why and one of the options was 'stalking'. I deleted the video and was trying to think of some way to fix things."
"4185"	"(2015-09-10 (24)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were in class. I was wearing my Good Advice shirt. Judah came in and said to us to meet him outside in a few minutes. Fletcher and I left but he wasn't there. We went downstairs and found him sitting in a chair. Other people were gathered nearby. Cecelia joined us. It was all the 'new' S+S crew, and we were getting some forms. At one point Judah was mimicking that Citizen Kane clap, which we thought was hilarious. We started putting some stuff away and had to put it in the toilets, but it was now like a shop. The toilets were all closed so we had to keep looking. Later, it changed to a spooky abandoned house. We were looking for people, but we'd hear them call out and then not hear from them again. It ended up being just me and one other person and we were calling out to someone and they called back and I started following the voice but the other person I was with said don't follow it. I left the house, and then it was a movie and the whole thing was actually taking place in someone's head - there had been a bus crash with one survivor and she was calling to the other people to keep them awake, and their voices had disappeared as they'd died/fallen asleep. Then it was real life and I was the survivor and the rest had been Good Advice crew. The last girl I'd been calling to was near the front and she had died. I went around the back and found Judah and lifted his arm off the floor and then he woke up and I was glad he was alive, but then I checked the girl next to him and she was alive too, and then the rest of the row started waking up. I wanted it to just be us two who had survived."
"4186"	"(2015-09-15 (24)) I was rewatching The Babadook. It was the same creature, but a different film. It started off in this creepy and dark lounge room of an apartment and there was a boy talking and a face appeared about behind the curtains and ducked behind it again. I was thinking it seemed a lot better than I remembered and was actually creepy."
"4187"	"(2015-09-15 (24)) I was in class, but everyone kept leaving and some guy was going to McDonald's and was going to get everyone breakfast, but then he only had 20c left, so I opened my wallet and had lots of coins, so gave him a whole bunch of 20c and 50c and said I wanted a plain Sausage McMuffin and as he walked out I added 'and a hash brown'. When I went back to class I noticed everyone had gone (Tristan and a few others had left with the McDonald's guy). I was annoyed I hadn't gone now. The teacher asked if I wanted to talk to Cecelia and I said 'where is she' and she was lying under a table I was standing next to. Cecelia shook her head and I said to the teacher that 'I think Cecelia needs to work things out on her own'. Some time later I was told the guy was back and I went looking for him and found him outside somewhere. I had to keep asking people where he was and they kept referring to my McMuffin as ""Izzy's pancakes"" which confused me. When I finally found him, it was a muffin. Some people were playing with one of those things that spins a tennis ball around and you hit it. I ate my muffin in my car and I took off my bra for some reason. I was trying to put it back on, but people kept coming up to me. I tried to hide it and then when I got a spare moment was trying to get it on. I ended up driving to this toilet which was called the philosophical something because it had philosophical quotes on it, but the seats were sinks and were up high. I sat on the floor of a cubicle trying to get the bra done (the cubicles were tiny), and I also needed to pee badly but the seats overflowed with water and were dirty, so I was using paper towel to dry it off. People were peeking in through the main door and asking why I was on the floor and what was wrong. I jumped up and said I was drying the toilet seat and they were all like 'oh she's ok' and came piling into the toilet, taking the other cubicles. I got out of that one and went into the shower cubicle as it had a higher door. People still kept harassing me and watching me and I ended up screaming at this one girl saying 'I will literally kill you'."
"4188"	"(2015-09-17 (24)) I was at this weird place which is hard to describe because I'm not exactly sure what it was. Dan Palmer was there and we were flirting and messing around. He got into a bed at one point and told me to get in. I climbed in and he started kissing me. He climbed on top of me and we had sex. Later I was with some people and all I could think was 'I had sex with Dan Palmer!' and was overly excited and happy about this, but didn't tell anyone."
"4189"	"(2015-10-04 (24)) I was at the Technical College and it was Thursday. It was different, and on Thursdays we had this math class, but we had only attended the first 3 or so and then skipped the rest. I decided to go today, but Tristan and the others decided to skip it and go to this cinema on campus. I realised I'd forgotten my calculator and was contemplating skipping it when I got a text from Tristan saying there was some event on at the cinema, so I text back 'link?' and he sent me a link and it was this thing with Dan Palmer in it. It was a short film/music video that he was in and then a film. I went and bought a ticket but then forgot what session it was for and the time was wrong on the ticket. I asked the guy standing around and he said it was for 11am and it was about 11.15am now. I quickly ran in, but the film had already started and I'd missed the music video - which was something I'd been wanting to see for a while so I was annoyed."
"4190"	"(2015-10-07 (24)) We were in OHS class and Mr Jennings told Tristan that he would be failing him for being slack and talking too much in class. Tristan left and was really depressed. I tried to convince Mr Jennings that it was unfair and that he'd worked hard on the music video and did all his homework. Later I was collecting those Monopoly stickers from McDonald's cups I found around the place."
"4191"	"(2015-10-08 (24)) We still lived at the old house. Something happened and Dad was dying and we thought it was supposed to today, but he was ok. The next morning, he was dead. I woke up (my room was the old office) and Ezra had posted all this stuff of us with Dad when we were little with RIP's. I left my room and discovered Ezra had left his body in bed and hadn't done anything about it yet. Mom came over and I started crying and she hugged me and said it would be ok and I said 'no it won't'."
"4192"	"(2015-10-14 (24)) I was a 'guy'. I was in my house with some other family members and my girlfriend, who was Sara Paxton, was in a bedroom and was sick. I knew she was infected with a zombie virus and would change soon. I was trying to gather up important stuff and leave. I went into my bedroom which was across from the bedroom she was in, and someone else went in there. He came out and I saw a bit of his ear was missing and I realised he'd been bitten and she was a zombie. I went into my room and closed the door, but he changed and they both tried to get in and I couldn't hold the door closed. Then it 'reset'. I tried once again to gather my stuff and leave. I packed up my laptop and went to put it in my car, as Paxton came out of the room as a zombie. I went outside and it was night, and the driver's door was open. I saw a lady grabbing something out of my car and I ran down to her yelling, as she ran off. I was close to catching her and I think she had my wallet."
"4193"	"(2015-10-15 (24)) These 'evil' doubles were taking over people [watched The Broken last night, similar concept] . They had a tell though; if they met your eyes, they would smile and nod twice. A group of others and I were pretending that we were one of them and trying to escape this place. I can't remember much now, but it was quite scary."
"4194"	"(2015-10-20 (24)) I rewatched The Babadook but it was a different movie; a guy was alone in his house and it was dark and stormy outside. He could hear this banging outside and he thought someone was out there messing with his head. It kept cutting to these 'flat' 2001 A Space Odyssey-like images of the sky and clouds, in different colours (purple was the most prominent), with lighting flashes and thunder. At the end of the film, it turns out the banging was a plastic bag attached to a fence that was blowing around in the wind. But it had been so tense and you were sure someone was trying to get in. I then 'woke up' and was telling someone about the dream and how it was such a cool story, so I was going to write it into a script. Then I was somewhere with Tristan and Cecelia. Tristan had cupcakes and gave us one each. They were really nice cupcakes. There was a room with a bunch of my stuff in storage and Cecelia wanted to look at it and she pulled out an old school book which said 'year 16' but it was from 2003, but I had quotes from How I Met Your Mother on it, although they were made up quotes like 'Marbles'. She said she thought it was a surprisingly good show for most of it and I agreed. We went to a cinema and I saw a movie and then was packing up all my stuff and was going to go buy a ticket for The Martian, when the people for the next session - which was The Martian - came in, including Cecelia, so I pretended I already had a ticket and just sat back down. Later, I was walking on the road and I wasn't sure where I was. There was rain coming and there were these 'blocks' in a column which showed what kind of rain each bit held. There were lots of alternating purple ones and I wasn't sure what that meant and was worried it was an electrical storm. There were a few sparse houses on one side of the road, but there was a 'blow up' toilet on the other, I ducked into that as the purple block hit and it was just 'lots of rain'. But I couldn't close the door and had to try and hold it shut and the rain kept coming in and hitting me. I was also trying to get my phone out to call Mom to get me, when I saw a police car coming past, so I ran out to the road and waved my hands and he stopped. I quickly looked back into the toilet to see if I'd left anything and he started taking off, but I started running down the road after him and he stopped again. I got in and there were some other people in there. I quickly explained that I was lost and couldn't contact my Mom, but they were in a rush to get somewhere so didn't really care. Not sure where we went from there. Later, I was in with Cecelia, Tristan and Juniper. Juniper was a vegetarian and wanted us to join her in some protest thing. We were in some place with chickens. Rover was there and he picked up this fat chick (which was brown/black and bigger than a regular chick) by the feathers on its back and I told him to put it down and he brought it over to me and put it on my lap as if it was a present. I thought it was cute. All these chickens were scheduled to be slaughtered next month and Juniper wanted us to stop it. Then I was in a car with Tristan, Cecelia and maybe someone else. We were on a long drive in the middle of nowhere and were stopping at every petrol station. We got to one and these 2 guys - one blonde and one black haired - came and Cecelia had dated one some time ago. They were douchebags. They turned up at the next one as well, and we noticed they had a gun. My card wasn't working and Cecelia had to pay for something for me that was $20.10. We got back to the car and they 'jokingly' held the gun up at the car. We were worried they would do something at the next station. Then there was another car with Technical College people, including Jolene, but their car was full of Skittles and something else, so a bunch of them piled into ours and then we were squished. We then were on a lake and in a boat. They were throwing things at us from another boat. They were all lying down paddling and I hid behind this thing at the back. They realised we were hiding and got these long sticks and punctured the boat and were trying to get us with it. I got hold of it and hit him with it and he went flying. I kept hitting him and he was hitting other things and his legs and arms were all bent back and he was covered in blood. Eventually he was dead."
"4195"	"(2015-10-27 (24)) I was at this hotel on an island. It was a big hotel with 100 floors or so. Spaceman was with me and the hotel had served alligator or crocodile and I'd fed him some, but he was sick. I got on the elevator and took him to floor 100 which had a vet. Later, an alligator/crocodile was loose in the hotel and killing people. I went back to the 100th floor to get Spaceman so we could escape, but the whole floor was covered in ice. People were frozen in ice columns on the wall. I found Spaceman and put him in the elevator, but saw the alligator/crocodile coming towards me and I ran into the elevator, scaring Spaceman and causing him to run out, but I had to close the door and leave. Then it was a year later or something and we returned. There were actually multiple alligators/crocodiles and they still hadn't gotten rid of all of them, but they had started to rebuild parts of the hotel. I was exploring in one of these half rebuilt areas and I saw a cat and then I saw Spaceman and it turned out there was a female cat and they had had kittens. I was happy he was ok."
"4196"	"(2015-10-31 (24)) I was in this house but people from class were there. Most of them were sitting around a table in a kitchen, which was also the main room/where the front door was. It was morning, but it was really dark. I went to check my phone and I had almost no battery and realised the cord must've fallen out last night. Because it was 'morning', I needed the phone for the whole day and then for Good Advice later. I asked if anyone had a Windows phone charger and Fernando said he did, but his phone looked strange so I asked to look at the input and it was almost the length of the phone and completely different. I tried to call Mom so she could bring it but either she wouldn't answer or the signal was going funny. I went outside and was walking up and down the street trying to call. It was very dark and definitely looked like night. A man's voice from the shadows said 'are you a boy or a girl?' and I quickly walked back to the house. Finally there was an answer on the other end but it was a creepy guy's voice. I checked the number stored in my phone and it looked strange, so I tried calling her number but couldn't remember what it was. Then there were also two kids at the house, but they went missing. I turned my back for 3 seconds at one point and when I turned back around they were gone. As we looked for them, other people went missing. We closed the front door, which we had had open, but people were still disappearing. Soon, only three of us were left. The lights kept turning off and we had to keep turning them on. I suggested we make sure we're always touching or in sight, but one of the guys went around a corner and disappeared. The other guy and I held hands and I switched on the kitchen light and I went to close the kitchen door which had opened again, but he went around the corner to close another door and we lost grip for a split second, but when he grabbed my hand again it was really tight and when I walked back to see him, it was this scary person with white hair (kind of spiky out to the sides), with dark rings around their eyes and a kind of 'dead' looking face. I tried to scream, but no noise was coming out except for a couple of squeaks. I started to wake up, but not quite so I kept trying to force out a scream to wake myself up and eventually did."
"4197"	"(2015-11-07 (24)) I met up with Bullfrog and Zamir. Bullfrog arrived last and looked and sounded exactly like Fletcher. He was really creepy though and I thought he was going to kill me. I kept wondering why I met up with him."
"4198"	"(2015-11-08 (24)) We were waiting in a classroom, which was just this big room with not much in it. Fletcher had posted a picture of a bunch of us, including Brock, and Brock sent him a message to ask to take it down because it was a bad picture of him. He looked different in it. People were lying on the floor, and I lay down too and I said it looks like we've all just crawled up and died. Tristan took a photo of us. Then Mr Norcross finally arrived and we had to go to this computer lab to look at our footage from The Interview [assessment was on Friday] . I went to sit next to Fletcher, but someone took the chair as I went to sit down. I grabbed another seat. Tristan was last in and had to sit away from us. The computers were old and I was like 'what is this, Windows 98?' and then saw it was Windows 95. Because they were so old they couldn't run the software to look at the footage and we had to load up something else instead. I couldn't remember how to do anything and I had to go to some setting and choose 'full bean', which loaded up a list of applications. Then I was playing a game which was playing out in real life. It started with you out the front of a huge mansion/house. It was a game which had multiple storylines and endings. I first went left into the forest and into this little house. It was then night and also dark inside. The house was against a wall, but the front side of the house was all windows. It was only one room, the front door went to a little kitchen which then opened out to a living area. A warning came up to say a werewolf was outside and I tried to stay still but it noticed me and I failed. For the next start I went into the house. I was running through this open space which looked sort of like halls of a shopping centre. I went into this room and Sam Raimi was in there. He was like part of the game. He was talking about being in some movie when he was younger and not being adorable and I said 'oh Sam Raimi, you are adorable'. Then there were these creepy people at the door - they were wearing masks and had this long hair. I was trying to climb to this top shelf. I got up there but then the stuff on the shelf was suddenly those heads with the mask and hair and I was thrashing my arms about knocking them all off and I reset. I went back to the little house in the woods and this time crouched down on the floor, hiding behind the fridge and the cabinet. The werewolf came and was sniffing around and then someone came and shot it. It suddenly became day and the werewolf changed back to a human, but was dead."
"4199"	"(2015-11-11 (24)) I was at the Technical College. Everyone had to make an individual short film as well as the chosen ones and we had no idea how we were going to find time for it. Judah said most people did theirs on the weekend or over the holiday and submitted it in January. I put down Cecelia and Tristan as my crew and we were trying to think of ideas and Cecelia jokingly suggested this ad one where the girl says something like 'findmymusic.com' and flips her hair and pours water on her, but it was actually an already existing jokey ad. At some point Fletcher and I were somewhere with Co-Worker-M-04 and he said something like 'you two are like you have a crush on each other and sometimes think about it but then realise it would be weird and never do anything about it' and it was 'true' in my case in the dream and I started giggling and saying 'nooo'. We walked off and Fletcher was like 'we don't' and I said 'yep I know'. Later, Judah was dressed as Shaun from Shaun of the Dead, with a cricket bat attached to the front of him. A zombie invasion occurred and he had a gun and was owning all the zombies, so we were sticking with him. I accidentally pushed him at some point and he was very solid."
"4200"	"(2015-11-15 (24)) I was at a shop with Mom. We were sitting on this seat which was near a table and chairs. Some posh people sat down at the table and this girl had a little dog with a mane of hair that had been crimped. Mom hadn't seen it but began talking about how disgusting it was when people did things like straighten their dog's hair. I got up and walked out of their eyesight and started miming the cut-throat action to tell her to stop. She stopped before she actually said anything and changed the subject. Later I returned and Mom said the posh people had made fun of me leaving and that it had something to do with my hair. I was wearing my Good Advice crew shirt and I saw Judah at the shop also wearing his crew shirt. He acknowledged me and later I was saying something about something 'sucking balls' while he was nearby."
"4201"	"(2015-11-17 (24)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were getting marked on everything. We went to camera and Mr Norcross said 'who wants to go first?' and Juniper said she would because she thought she would get a high mark and he displayed her mark and it was 38%. Then he put everyone's up and I got 67 and Tristan had 77 and I was annoyed he got higher than me. But later he put them up again and they'd changed, mine was 68 and Tristan's was now 35. He didn't clarify what happened. We went to editing later and it was like a bar and Teacher-F-01 had these hats behind the bar that were to protest something about freeing chickens. A few people were wearing them and I said I wanted one and she gave one to me. Later, Fletcher was hanging around me and being weird. He was like saying he loved me but in a jokey way. I was sitting down with him at one point and he started trying to put his hand on my leg and kiss me and I kept pushing him away and being like, jokingly 'what the hell are you doing?'."
"4202"	"(2015-11-23 (24)) I was at school, though it was different. We had to nominate 3 people for something or other. I was in the room where the ballots were submitted with Tristan and Fletcher. Judah came in with his form and I saw that he'd written two people I didn't know in spots 1 and 3, but Tristan was in spot 2 (misspelled as Allan) and the reason was like 'he is my backup in Good Advice'. I was annoyed because I can do all the same stuff. I hadn't decided on who I was going to choose. Fletcher and I were with Frederick at some point and Fletcher was saying stuff about dating me or liking me or something but saying it like hypothetically, though admitting that was how he felt too. Later, we were doing the promo ad but it was for a guy who had this bottleshop. I was the only one there and he got me to dress up like an employee and stand at the counter and shot some stuff really quickly. He showed me the footage and it looked good and I said maybe some more cutaways. I said I'd go back in this room and have a look and see what we can add. I was then with Fletcher and I posted on Facebook saying 'I wish I had someone else here'. Then other people were there, including Tristan. The guy had these horses and I took one of their ropes and started to lead it away when I heard him telling the others to not touch the horses and I tried to tie the rope back but couldn't and the horse was getting agitated and I had to tell the guy about it. I didn't know if the ad was for the bottleshop or a particular drink and the guy looked annoyed and said it was the drink."
"4203"	"(2015-11-28 (24)) I was at the McDonald's on Beaufort street, except it was different and I was in America. Rover was also with me. There were lots of dogs there and they all looked very similar to Rover. It was very busy, and I found a seat outside at a little table with an umbrella. I saw Harvey Keitel walking around and he had this weird ring on his little finger. He came over to me and said something and chuckled. He was talking to me for a while and then we talked about Rover. I think I came back a second time and he was there again. This time I was trying to point out which one was Rover but I couldn't tell. He said 'you couldn't even tell which one's your dog' and I said 'yes I can, I just haven't found him yet'. When I did find him, Keitel made Rover follow him into this truck and took off. I tried to chase it, but it was too fast. I think I then 'woke up' and kept reciting the dream in my head, especially the fact it was at McDonald's Beaufort street, but in America. Then it kept like melding between reality and the dream. There was a picture of me, Fletcher, Tristan and Frederick where we were in a room and had posed in positions that were also reflected in the mirrors, so there were 2 of us. Except for Frederick, who was in the window. We were talking in a group on Facebook and Fletcher posted a link to all these notes I'd written which had been private and I had no idea how he got them. One was a list of the guys in my class from one year, ranked in attractiveness and other things like that. I deleted it and was like wtf. I had a message from Mason on Facebook, to a group we were in but I didn't remember being in that group, and was complaining about a job he got put on which was putting bottle caps onto bottles, which he implied I was also on. Then I was on a job with Hugo, who looked younger and shorter and because I knew it was a dream world [I wasn't lucid, I'm not really sure what it was] I tried to change him to look like he normally does. But he kept noticing his height changing so I was trying to be subtle about it. Then we were trapped where we were and needed to stay somewhere. There was this school place with dorms that we could stay in. The guy one had a lot of bunk beds around the walls, but no-one was sleeping on the top ones. We soon discovered it was because of this horrendous wind that came blowing every now and then. It was blowing as I left that one to go the girl one. The girl room was a lot smaller and had less beds. There weren't any free, so I had to wait for a new one."
"4204"	"(2015-12-02 (24)) I was parked at the office which looked similar, but was more cottage-like and in a different location. Someone parked there who wasn't meant to be there and I tried to convince them to leave. It was night and quite dark. I left, but then I think it was day. I was driving down this street a little fast and I was approaching a red light, and the left lane had a few cars in it so I changed to the right lane but I didn't quite realise it was red and went straight through and realising my mistake I instantly pulled over, and a cop car pulled up behind me with its lights and siren on. I told the policeman I had seen the green light ahead and gotten confused and didn't know what I was thinking. He seemed to consider letting me off, but then gave me a $200 fine. I was annoyed about the fine and also having a blemish on my record."
"4205"	"(2015-12-05 (24)) I was with a friend on this underwater ship. I can't remember why or what we were doing on there. At some point we went outside briefly and I had a watermelon. The water started to go down and we were somehow informed that the ocean was losing all of its water briefly. Then we were on the ground with the ship. It just looked like a road, it was completely flat and was painted on. There were walls all around it. The sun was quite bright. There was a big storm coming [I woke up earlier to hear talk of a storm coming] and would replace all the water. We saw some big clouds forming in the sky, and a weird dark cloud low down. I went back into the ship, but then it showed that the weird cloud was actually a giant turtle on a section of Earth. It fell and landed on the ship, crushing half of it, then the turtle rolled off and the Earth rolled over to crush the other side of the ship. I was then outside and 'I' had gone in, but I was another version of me. I told my friend we couldn't go back to the ship and had to find somewhere to go before the storm started. We found a blow-up water toy thing which you could get inside, so we climbed into that (you had to lie down in it), but his side had a broken zip, so we rolled it up and held it. It started to rain and we realised this was no good. We were then somehow on the street and there were shops nearby. I suggested going to Kathmandu to get a boat [they don't sell boats] . It was raining quite hard outside and all these famous people and people I knew were around. My friend was then Nathan Fillion. I saw Mr Hoover walking down a road at some point."
"4206"	"(2015-12-14 (24)) The house was different and we had these 'bumpy' walls, like you'd find on the outside. We'd covered them in something to avoid ants, but it had attracted ants instead. I had gone to sleep and woke up to lots of ants on the walls and they'd laid eggs in my hair, which were deep on the roots and I was pulling them out."
"4207"	"(2015-12-15 (24)) Most of the people from Good Advice went to a fish and chip restaurant. We had a 4 person table and a 2 person table. Tristan sat at the 2 person table on the other side of the room and I sat on the other table. Frederick was there as well. I got a chicken burger."
"4208"	"(2015-12-16 (24)) I had a boyfriend and we were out driving one night. It was quite late and I was a bit tired, but we decided to have sex in the car, somewhere. We went to the carpark of a hospital and parked up. We climbed into the back seat and he put a condom on, but people kept walking past the car and we would just pretend to be sleeping. There were too many people and I said we should try somewhere else. I suggested Meadowbrook or Uptown carpark. So we went to somewhere like that and got back into the back. He had his shirt off and I was kissing his chest and getting lower and was slowly grinding him as well."
"4209"	"(2015-12-16 (24)) I went to some science school thing. It was very secure. I was in the lobby area and no-one was there. I looked behind the desk area, which had a glass window showing another area, and I saw a guy walking away from me. I knocked on the door and he turned around and looked at me. He explained to us they'd accidentally released some zombie virus. I can't remember exactly what was said, but it was contagious through a weird way. It could be instantly transferred through a bite or whatever, but you could get infected and it wouldn't take hold until a certain thing set it off (think it had something to do with a kind of food). He couldn't leave the quarantined area because he was infected, but it hadn't been set off. We left and walked past another area of the school where some of the scientists seemed to be just working as usual and we realised it had only just happened. As we were leaving we saw zombies coming out of the area and we got to this huge shopping centre. At the top was some kind of helicopter ride. We started making our way up there and as we got a few storeys up, we saw the zombies starting to come in to the shop. We got to the top and they said they had one more space in a helicopter and my group sent me. But they let me and this guy, who was my boyfriend or something, on and still had another spot, which they didn't fill. The helicopter started flying and flew out this window, but then it stalled and started to fall. This had happened before and I grabbed a railing on a building outside and this gave it enough time to start spinning fast enough to fly. When we came back from the ride, everybody was gone. We collected a few chocolates and things from the shop and went outside. I said ""it's a ghost town"" and started singing the song 'Ghost Town' by The Specials. We wondered if it was because we were in a 'desert town' and had gone to find more people or if they would come out at night or something. We did come across some at some point and found these outside showers and covered ourselves in water because we thought they wouldn't see us and they didn't seem to be able to, but we were worried it would evaporate quickly."
"4210"	"(2015-12-19 (24)) I was put on two jobs on the same day. One in Rivervale with Hector and one at Brookland High School with Esther. I went to the school in the morning and then wondered when I was supposed to be at Rivervale. I noticed I had a new job booking with just the Rivervale job, but wasn't sure if it was correct. Esther said she would have a look at the job sheet, but for some reason it was locked and she couldn't access it. The school was different and we were set up in the 'office', which was next to the canteen. I remembered it was school holidays and there wouldn't be any students. Esther and everyone else disappeared and I was wandering around waiting. I got a muffin from the canteen and started eating it, then wasn't sure if the guy had given it to me for free or not, so I asked how much it was and gave him the money. Esther returned and said the job had been cancelled because of some issues with the file."
"4211"	"(2015-12-21 (24)) I can't remember why, though I kept thinking it had something to do with Big Brother, but Tristan and I ended up in this little hallway with 8 rooms that were 'mirrored'. I chose #4 because I 'liked the number' and Tristan chose another on the same side. We wondered what the mirroring meant. Frederick went to Russia and we wondered why, but he had been in this movie and his leading lady was Russian and we deduced he'd had an affair. When we jokingly mentioned it to someone, there were apparently rumours about it and this had confirmed it. I was in New York or something and staying with these people. I was given a room close to everything, but then this lady moved me to the end room. She was trying to rush me but I was trying to log off the computer and she was like 'oh, you have an account' and I thought maybe she was planning something dodgy but this ruined her plans. The room I went to and the house was similar to our place in Parkville. The room was big though and had three different curtains and I was trying to pull them all to cover the window. I could see the city and it was a dark night, so I could see all the lights and it looked similar to my town. Then it was like a movie and this young girl was looking after this old guy in bed as he was coughing and having pains. I think it was her father. Later, she was in bed coughing as he looked after her. It turned out they were 'emotional vampires', though actually took blood from people using these sucker things and they were immortal. I was sitting on a chair somewhere and there were these starfish. They moved really slowly and would like put one of their 'feet' up and stay there for like 10 seconds and then move it. One started climbing up the chair and touched me and I freaked out and jumped up."
"4212"	"(2015-12-22 (24)) Tristan and I were on Big Brother. There were actual housemates and also people from the Technical College. Everyone was up for eviction, but people were choosing people to un-nominate. There were eventually 4 of us left, including me. There were over 20 people in the house. I joined the others and they said the four of us left would have to nominate in front of everyone, but then they made us all sit around the edge of the wall (there was a ledge/seat around it), and called out people's names and we put our hands up if we wanted to nominate them. Aisleyne and Nikki were there. I was telling them about how the outside world felt about them but then realised it was outside information and stopped. When they said Lea's name, I put my hand up and was thinking she would definitely go over me."
"4213"	"(2015-12-23 (24)) I can't remember properly, but people were doing this weird jokey thing of asking someone on a date because you got something at the end. Troy (Community) was asking me about it and then asked me and I said no and we both laughed. I said to ask Abed. There were some big vibrators nearby and someone had changed the batteries recently and I was joking with them that they didn't know where they'd been. Victor (BB5) was in a shop and this girl who liked him was trying to get with him. She was fat and ugly, but nice, and so he was trying to politely reject her. She was rubbing herself on his groin area and he looked uncomfortable."
"4214"	"(2015-12-24 (24)) I was at the train station and I saw Dan Palmer there. I was trying to avoid eye contact and to not get his attention, but he had seen me. My train came and I waited for ages and then got on. The doors closed a bit later and I was annoyed he wasn't on the same train, but then I saw him behind some people. He ended up coming down my way and was talking to him. I asked him if FrightFest started today and he said 'no, tomorrow'."
"4215"	"(2016-01-02 (24)) I was doing some contract work and I was working at this government/army office place. Tristan was also there. I was sitting at a desk and looked behind and saw an GBCS sticker and I was like 'do we stocktake here?' and then a few minutes later, a group of stocktakers came through the door. Mason was the supervisor, but I didn't recognise anyone else. I waved and made a joke like 'see I had a legit reason to not to do this job, because I'm working somewhere else'. Something happened and there were zombies, but they would get a little octopus attached to the back of their head when they were turned into a zombie. The octopus would also glow. The zombies would sleep in between attacks and if someone came near they would wake up and attack. Some of it got closed off and we had to kill all of them and open the doors to get out. I got separated from a big group, who got through while I got left behind. Though they hadn't all been killed. Tristan was in the group ahead and was right next to the big open door to the outside."
"4216"	"(2016-01-12 (24)) I was outside on a road at night. I think it was Wanneroo Road. There was no-one driving on it, but there were cars in heaps everywhere and lots of trucks on their sides (lots of those fuel tank types). At one point they all started going up in flames and I was trying to run around them and get to safety. Later, there were zombies or something and we were trying to sneak around."
"4217"	"(2016-01-13 (24)) We were staying at a house. Fletcher had his camera and kept leaving it in places recording which was annoying us. At one point I was trying to take it to do something with it, but realised it was recording, so I took it and trimmed the video to take me out of it but as I was putting it back he came in and I tried to delete all of it saying I just wanted to play with it. Later I was watching a monitor with like live camera footage. I saw one of Cecelia and another girl hanging in a closet and I got some people and ran down. We took them down and tried to untie the knots. Cecelia was still alive, but was paralyzed (we thought perhaps temporarily, but we weren't sure and she lay crying on the bed)."
"4218"	"(2016-01-21 (24)) It was our first day back at the Technical College and we were in sound class or something. The room was massive and all the seats were on this platform and were like beds and couches. I wanted a bed and sat on it but Frederick and Tristan went to the opposite side because they liked these other seats and all the other ones in between got filled up and I was annoyed, but we later switched to desks and chairs. The other students were lame and the teacher was douchey."
"4219"	"(2016-01-23 (24)) A group of people and I went into this big house which was where some bad people lived. I think they were cannibals and stuff, and we had snuck in there for some reason. While we were in there they came back and I was in this pool that was upstairs and I had to try and stay low in it so they wouldn't see. They ended up catching us and Otis (House of 1000 Corpses) was there and he was in charge of me and he said 'I'm going to have you for dessert' and I was wondering if he was flirting with me or being literal."
"4220"	"(2016-01-27 (25)) I was with Eric (True Blood) and we were investigating something. We were in this building and went into this arcade type place, but it was dark and just had a bunch of private booths down one side and airplane seats on the other. I walked down and saw a machine at the end had been destroyed. Eric hadn't seen it and said it looked like no-one had been here until I pointed it out. There was another person with us as well. We slowly walked down the aisle checking the booths and seats and when we got to the end, a dog jumped out and started attacking Eric. For some reason he was unable to shake him off and he couldn't heal himself from dog bites. I tried to hit it away but felt sad about hurting the dog and couldn't do it. The other girl felt the same, so Eric managed to pull it away enough for us to cut it a tiny bit and then he ripped it off and killed it. I apologised and said I just couldn't hurt an animal and he didn't seem too annoyed. There was a clue to whoever it was we were looking for and we left. There was a hotel nearby and we asked some questions there. There was an information screen and Eric told me to search for him and I started writing in Alexander, then started writing Eric Northman but kept making mistakes when typing Northman. It found him anyway and it had all this information about how he was this famous viking dude hundreds of years ago. He left to go investigate a room. The other girl was now a clone of me and she asked me if we should get a room (so we could spend the night with Eric, and we were dating him so it wasn't a new thing) and we approached Eric and he was like 'ah, only the two of you' referencing a time when there had been two clones. We started booking out the room when these people cut the power for some reason. We thought it meant the guy was in the building and I think there was an explosion or something somewhere else. We kicked into gear again to find him and I was annoyed because I really wanted to have sex. On our way to wherever we went next I was thinking about how the clones kept dying (and that possibly I was one too) and being replaced, so even though we were dating he was never really with the same person."
"4221"	"(2016-01-27 (25)) I was out somewhere with Tristan. I couldn't find my sunglasses, but then found them in my pocket. We went to this big market thing and it was in another country. Fletcher was then there too and we passed a frozen yoghurt stand and I decided to get some. It said it was $8 for a medium, so I said I'd get a medium. The lady behind the counter was probably about 30 -35 and was fat. I asked which one was a medium and she pointed to the containers. There was a huge and random selection of flavours. I asked for a chocolate version of a flavour but she started getting the vanilla and I said I'd have one of each. I asked if I could get another flavour and she looked at me in astonishment and said it was only two. She also had put big scoops of the other two and the container was almost full. She asked if I wanted any toppings and she started reaching for the Oreos and I said 'ok I'll take the Oreos'. I asked if I could have the cookie dough as well and she just looked at me stunned and said no. She took it the counter the til said $44 and I was like what and then she said 'that comes to $75' and I was like 'wtf, it said it was $8 for a medium' and she said the weight values are on the side and I said yeah but it doesn't say anywhere we pay by weight, it said it's $8. I said I can't pay for this and she said if I didn't it was a $40 fine and I carefully said 'I didn't say I wouldn't, I said I couldn't. You can't expect me to pay $75 for frozen yoghurt?' The other people in the queue started standing up for me as well saying it was false advertising and it clearly said $8 and the lady started backing down and saying that she was starting to see our point of view."
"4222"	"(2016-01-31 (25)) I was with Nana and someone else looking at a house they were thinking about buying. It was old and strange but they 'liked its quirk'. The main 'bedroom' was in the middle of the main hall and you had to climb up this very narrow and tall set of stairs. And it wasn't a bedroom, but a king size bed at the top, with cupboards down the side. We walked to the top and Nana realised that Poppa wouldn't be able to climb up. I tried to get down but it was hard. I had to use this ribbon to hold on to the side and then swing back around to the steps. Walking down the steps was scary as well because they were so narrow and steep. There was another guy involved who wanted to change parts of it. There were religious pictures and things all around and he wanted to remove them and was saying he doesn't understand why they don't want what he was suggesting and I said 'maybe they're religious?'. Some time later I was outside and a group of us were sneaking towards another group. It was like a war? A girl came behind this truck and saw us and I quickly grabbed her and put my arm around her throat and she passed out and I put her in the truck. Another girl saw and I did the same thing but less clumsily. I said to one of my teammates 'I've never done that in real life before'. They ended up seeing us and took their guns out and slowly made their way over to us. I said I didn't have a gun and someone threw me one. But it was hard to aim with and I never got a shot. A guy was close and I shot and a dart looking thing with a round green bit on the end hit him in the back and I was like 'I got one!' but someone said it was theirs and showed me the pattern on their dart and it matched. The 'bad guys' were then led by the guy who wanted to change the house and I said 'why don't we talk about this instead of killing each other?' and then I went and sat down and he agreed and they put their guns down."
"4223"	"(2016-02-04 (25)) I was at the Technical College for today. Tristan and I went to Mr Hoover's class, but it was only us two. There were supposed to be three others, but they weren't here and had been absent the last few days too. It was in a small-ish lecture theatre that was very black. Mr Hoover said he'd have to move us to a different class because he couldn't teach a class of two (and the first activity was in a group of four). We had a big lecture on with another guy and I got there a bit late. I sat away from everyone else. I was next to a black girl who introduced herself and asked how old I was. I said 23, then went 'no, 25. Don't ask how that happened' and she looked at me funny and then said she was 26. I said everyone else was like 18, so I was glad there was someone older in here. The lecturer said that anyone who wanted to leave could and one guy got up and left and then heaps of people got up. The only people left were people from last year. I moved over to sit with them. Then it was a break and there were three toilets. Fletcher was still in the room. I went to the toilet over one side but there wasn't actually a toilet in there. I went to the middle one, but there was a wall missing and just a curtain to pull. I went to the furthest one and I think there was another issue with that one."
"4224"	"(2016-02-04 (25)) I can't remember properly, but I had climbed down this almost vertical cliff side to get to this little 'beach'. I was taking photos of the water with the DSLR but the waves started coming in more violently and one knocked me down but I kept the camera in the air. I tried walking back to shore but it kept pulling me back. I made it eventually and had to climb back up with only one hand and it was really hard. I made it back up to the top after a long struggle."
"4225"	"(2016-02-06 (25)) A bunch of us were somewhere and I was talking about Fletcher's camera and Frederick was like 'it's your camera. He bought it for you' and then I felt odd."
"4226"	"(2016-02-09 (25)) I was with a group of others on this rocky formation. We were in like a crater of it (there was an 'exit', but it had high rocky walls around it. I had the DSLR and someone set off this little explosion causing a dust storm and I was taking pictures of it until I realised it was coming towards us and I put the lens cap back on and closed the screen and turned away from the dust hugging it to protect it. Later, I was out somewhere with a bunch of people. There was a long, but short, wall and Tristan sat down leaning against it. Everyone else followed suit with Judah at the other end. I went to sit next to him but had to get up for some reason and Fletcher took his spot. I sat down next to Fletcher and was trying to get a photo of everyone, they all waved and were kind of lying against the wall. Fletcher kept adjusting himself and getting closer to me each time, until I was squished against this pillar at the corner of the wall. He moved again and I was literally jammed in between him and the pillar and his legs were touching mine. Most of the others had left by this point. I sent a message to Tristan saying 'help' and had no reply. Then I felt something crawling on my back and I jumped up squealing and tried to brush it off. I couldn't find anything, but I saw lots of spiders coming out of a crack in the pillar. I found Tristan later and I said 'thanks for the help' and he just laughed. I said Fletcher was pretty much sitting on top of me and he just laughed again."
"4227"	"(2016-02-11 (25)) We were writing scripts and stuff to get selected. People were calling out the name of their script and others voted on whether they liked it or not. Claudine wrote a script called The Last Stand and everyone loved it. Jolene's was also popular and we were sure her's would get picked. Another class come in and Cecelia was there. There was this studio room and they were getting people to go in for each role to select them for each script. They were going to pick four and Tristan said there were too many people. Also Fletcher was hanging around us and being normal and I was glad that he wasn't acting weird."
"4228"	"(2016-02-11 (25)) I was playing a zombie game except it was playing out in real life and went back and forth between a game and real life. I was at a college type place in a library or gathering area. I walked to the front door and saw a person all zombied with like teeth showing and bloodied and didn't look like a movie zombie, but an 'actual' zombie. I ran and went down some stairs and zombie action started happening up there and people were getting bit and killed and I ran into a hall and ducked into the toilet, then it was a game and I was crouching in a cubicle and I was thinking of Stalled. The door to the toilet had a gap and a zombie face appeared underneath snarling and wouldn't go away. I thought it was a glitch so I restarted. The next time I with another girl called Maree and she was one of the main characters and had either lost a child or had an abortion and was haunted by the memory of the child (a girl). We ran into the girl toilets this time as it said there were levels in there but all the cubicles were locked and we went into an open one but it wasn't really a cubicle and had room for zombies to get in. I put my feet up on one side of the wall of the cubicle and lifted myself up with my back on the other side.  One came in and I paused the game and went to customize where you could edit the look of the characters etc. The option I selected caused the zombie to leave when I pressed play. Another time I reset I play ed as Maree and she was underwater but not, climbing up this ladder thing where it showed zombies next to her in another pipe climbing. It was very quiet and ambient and creepy. Then she swam through this underwater room. Then she was in a room which like had destroyed stuff and grass and puddles. I heard the zombies coming and ran through the door into the next area."
"4229"	"(2016-02-12 (25)) I was at the Technical College, in class, and people were doing something with acid at the front. They had different mixtures, so some were diluted. Justus, I think, didn't believe that it was acid so started drinking it and I was expecting his throat to just burn through, but he just kind of gagged a bit and everyone rushed to stop him."
"4230"	"(2016-02-12 (25)) I was watching something that was like a Tarantino film, I'm not sure if it was but I thought it seemed like one. Kurt Russell was in it, and he had this car which he loved and kept going on about all the details of it. I can't remember what happened, but something went wrong with it and he crashed it. Then there was this bridge going over this gap and someone in a car missed the bridge and fell straight to the bottom. The smoke from this caused a guy on his bike to hit this bit of wood that made this guy on a wheelchair nearby fall in. Then the car that crashed earlier was on fire and Kurt Russell was still inside smoking a cigar, the police had come to get him and he was doing a monologue saying how even on fire this car is beautiful and he can't leave it or something."
"4231"	"(2016-02-13 (25)) I was at the Technical College though we had class but it was in a weird area. There was water for swimming in which went around like a path. Mom and Dad were both there for unrelated reasons. Dad had a picture of a pile of text books and was about to send them in a message to Dan Palmer. He said he was going to send them to my boyfriend and I said didn't have one and I was like 'oh my god, don't send I haven't even spoken to him in 2 years ' and I got annoyed and Dad got angry and was like 'not spoken in 2 years?!' And I thought I saw Christian James nearby and I was saying like he was just some random and I wasn't gonna just talk to him. I was in the water and Dad was in a mood and I ignored him as I went by and Tristan was there, who I also ignored. I heard him asking Tristan something and Tristan was saying that I'm everyone's favourite and pointed to somewhere around the corner (straight for him, corner for me) and said they were the main ones. I went around and found Fletcher and someone else in the water too. I was happy to see Fletcher there but then he said he forgot he'd changed class and his actual class was over other side of campus, he looked a bit sad about this and seemed like he wanted to stay as he got out. I said just come back to this class and he seemed reluctant."
"4232"	"(2016-02-14 (25)) We were at the Technical College and had like 'homeroom' or whatever. Fletcher and Tristan were in the same one. Some lecturers were trying to work out which classes Fletcher had next since he changed. I was in a supermarket with Tristan and some others and we were crawling around to get out. Tristan was in front of me and struggling to get through some of the tighter areas and was going slow, so I did this kind of jump to get ahead. Later, there was an eclipse and we waited it out before the next class. Co-Worker-M-06 and Mason from work were there and I can't remember why but Co-Worker-M-06 admitted to liking me which I thought was weird since he's gay. Later we were in a room with Co-Worker-M-06, Mason, Fletcher, Marcos and someone else. Fletcher and Marcos were on opposite sides of the room, behind me. Someone asked 'ok who thinks Izzy's hot' and Co-Worker-M-06, Mason and the other person out their hand up, I nervously swung my chair around and Fletcher hadn't but then reluctantly put his hand up. Marcos was like 'wait what are we doing' and when they said 'hands up if Izzy's hot' he was like 'ok well I'm in the minority here'. Co-Worker-M-06 said the first day he met me I had 'shyly' asked 'where do I go' and he liked it. I felt uncomfortable and weird and wanted to go home. At some point during the eclipse, I was alone with Co-Worker-M-06 and he said 'we can go somewhere and do stuff' and I said 'I don't want to do stuff and a few seconds later Fletcher walked into the room and I felt awkward. Later I was making a silly short film with this Kiwi guy and wanted him to run about these fields so it would look Hobbit-y. [Fletcher changed class recently because he liked me, and people keep saying 'everyone likes Izzy'] ."
"4233"	"(2016-02-17 (25)) I was supervising this Decjuba at Harbourtown. It was a supervisor-only SFG and I'd never done it before [working at the store today for the first time, but not supervising] . I got to Harbourtown which was different and just this big block of shops, with these market stalls next to it. I parked over one side and asked a lady where it was and she said it was on the other side, so I drove through the carpark to the block of shops area. The whole thing was on this big block which was just grass between them. I parked and realised it was 8am and I was 1 hour late and I couldn't work out how that'd happened. I got my stuff out the boot and asked another lady where it was and she said it was down in the stalls. It took ages to get through and by the time we got to the store, it was 9am. The manager lady didn't seem that bothered though, and it only took me a few minutes to scan everything. Apparently there was another Decjuba that had gone south as well."
"4234"	"(2016-02-17 (25)) I was with Frederick, who I was dating, and he'd been offered this weird job and all he had to do was live in this cave for 8 weeks. The cave was on the beach and we were walking down there to see it and discuss the details. It was spooky and I reached for his hand and we held hands as we walked down. We made a joke about it being haunted, and the person said it was. When we got to it, it was really creepy and I said we should just go, but they kind of forced us inside and then we couldn't leave. It was some 'devil' cage or something and after the 8 weeks, one of us had to be sacrificed. I think we managed to escape, but I don't remember anything else."
"4235"	"(2016-02-19 (25)) I was sitting at Cecelia's and sitting at a table and lots of people were around. Frederick had been acting weird and he came up and said 'Izzy, I like you' and I just put my head down. It was a bit awkward but everyone else just got back to talking and he went away. I didn't know what to say or do. There was a photo of us on Facebook from a while ago with a caption like 'I am in mild love with Izzy'. Jason was also around and I wondered if he knew (he was also in the pic but maybe he thought it a joke). I was with Frederick later talking about something and I wanted him to just do something because I was really horny but I left the room sighing with frustration. [stayed at Cecelia's that night, sharing a room with Frederick and had been thinking the same] ."
"4236"	"(2016-02-20 (25)) There was a film that called for extras and some of us volunteered. There was a bus and we were all placed according to last name. I was away from everyone else. Tristan was next to a couple of people he knew. When they called out Frederick to place him they called out 'Frederick Pine' and Pine was actually Tristan's last name, so they were seated fairly close. Most people hadn't turned up though so when we went to leave they let us move. Frederick and I kept looking at each other and then looking away. Later, we were in a class or something and Tristan was talking about something and referenced this data which was like a calendar, but had little cogs on the days when the person had had sex. Apparently this was my data because Tristan said there was a bit where I'd said 'I don't want to have sex on my birthday' and when it was revealed it was mine, there was an awkward silence."
"4237"	"(2016-02-21 (25)) I somehow accidentally created zombie spiders which multiplied quickly and could explode and basically caused the end of the world. It was an idea I'd had that someone tested and it worked too well. They would explode and multiply, and so on. From when it began, it was only minutes until it would destroy the planet. Tristan was like 'tell us who you find attractive at the Technical College' and I said 'Judah' and he was just like oh and then the world ended."
"4238"	"(2016-02-21 (25)) I was in a big shopping centre and it was about 5.30pm because all the shops were closing. I was looking for something to eat, but everything I thought looked good was closing. I left and there were some guys outside looking bored. I didn't have shoes on and it was really hot outside and I couldn't remember where I parked. I heard them talking as I was walking and they were saying they should rape me. I tried moving faster, but they caught me and the leader held me down on the ground pulling down my pants. I struggled and he punched me. He had sex with me and then got up to give the next guy a turn, but they got distracted by something and I got up and found my car. I got in and turned it on as they noticed I was gone. I drove out and was trying to go fast, but there were all these roadworks in place. There was a narrow bridge with almost no barriers and I went off the edge straight into the water. I rewound it and went back and drove super slowly. A family that lived nearby ushered me onto this platform and took me into their house. The place nearby had been flooded, hence the roadworks and bridges. We realised we had to hide my car and the only way was to sink it and I was upset about this and was trying to decide whether I'd rather them find me or lose my car, but decided to lose the car. The guy went out to sink it and they were trying to find all these materials to use for something but I said we'll freeze without them. I was worried the guys would find me regardless and then I'd lose my car as well."
"4239"	"(2016-02-22 (25)) We were in a classroom and Ms Nowak was teaching, but most of the class was different. Our assignment was to write stories based on these vague one-sentence plot lines. The first one was something like 'your best friend wakes you up as a baby at 5am' and she said she always imagined waking up in Africa. I asked if 'best friend' could be yourself or anything since I didn't have a best friend or any close friends and she said I could. I decided to write it from the point of view of the Star Child from 2001: A Space Odyssey where his best friend is the Earth and he's waking up to watch over it. Ms Nowak said there were 39 answers to all the questions and I was like 'what there can't possibly only be 39 different stories' and I was pretty sure no-one would've done mine."
"4240"	"(2016-02-23 (25)) I was at 'home' which was a massive place with 2 storeys and I think I was babysitting and had other younger siblings. I text Mom to say that Cuddles had scratches on her shoulder. I heard a noise outside and we formed a conga line with me leading and I got a knife from the kitchen and walked back around avoiding windows. I heard a person out there trying to get in so I turned the TV on and then heard them saying on the phone that the TV was on but they couldn't see anyone. We were hiding and saw them walk past a window. They tried to get in somewhere and a long glove was hanging down and I cut through it with a knife and it fell apart but there was no arm inside it. Then I saw a guy sitting on a lounge in an office upstairs and I went in and sliced his throat but nothing happened and he said he was invincible and that this was a game and whoever 'won' (ie survived) by sunrise would go back to hell with him. It could only be one person and everyone else would die. I ran out. He slowly killed us one by one. He could sometimes control people and got this old lady to put 'menthol' in the oven and then try to take it out and burned her arms and then she put her face in there too. Then we were casually sitting in a room with him and he was normal looking but had devilish type of features. I could draw and had his notepad with lots of good sketches in it and I tried to sketch him but I kept getting distracted. Fletcher was there so I told Fletcher to sit at the table and I tried to draw him and he kept moving but was looking at me and when I tried drawing the side of his face, we almost made eye contact and I felt weird and stopped. Later we escaped the house and ended up in this place with a ghost train. There were only a few of us left and Fletcher decided to sacrifice himself for me and I said no don't be stupid and he did his serious nod thing and I was crying and really upset and I said ""why?"" and he was like ""you know why"" and he stayed behind and I ran the other way still crying. I went on the ghost train with some other girls who were my friends and got off at the end and we were outside and the sun was coming up. We were walking in a crowd of people and we were like 'we're going to make it' and as the sun came out, the sun suddenly turned black and smokey and we realised literally only one of us could be alive. I was determined to survive now, even though I was the guy's favourite. I ended up back at the house and he said 'you always win' and showed me a book with photos of me in the past but it was now a movie and my part was played by Jennifer Lawrence. She was younger and looked kind of rebellious with dark eyeshadow. He said she normally worked out to do telekinesis much sooner and she was confused. She 'won' and I think defeated him and stood triumphantly."
"4241"	"(2016-02-24 (25)) Judah was making a short film and he had written it but had a girl directing. I asked if Tristan and I could work on it and said I didn't care what the job was I just wanted to work on something and he did his nod thing and I thought he looked really hot and then he said something like 'you, yes but I'm not sure about Tristan' (jokingly). There was a spot free taking the trees out of the ground and he said that we needed more experience doing that so gave that job to us. He also said he was now in for D&D and I clapped and said 'yay'. Jason was around and I didn't know if I should ask him to come to D&D and he was keeping his distance. Then Judah was in some TV show where there was a mid-shot of him and you saw this grey-ish dragon appear behind him and he turned around and it roared and lunged towards his head and then cut to black. I was like 'no, you can't kill Judah!'. There was also something else where we had a small budget and had to simulate doing some effect by drawing lines on a screen and I accidentally blew something up and something exploded at the bottom of the sea and was likely causing World War III (it played out as 'real', but I'm not sure if that was just a simulation or not since no-one seemed that bothered)."
"4242"	"(2016-02-25 (25)) I had gone on holiday or something with Tristan, Jason and Frederick. I had slept with Frederick, though no-one knew this. Later we were all standing together with someone other people and Frederick said something like 'she slept with someone here, but it wasn't [the other two] ' and then he was like 'oh I gave it away'. Later, it was Cecelia's birthday on Valentine's Day and we were going out to a club or something. I went to the toilet at some point but they were all broken and gross, and on the floor, so I sat 'in' the bowl and was peeing and because the doors were high, they could see me outside. There were two drunk women (dressed very sluttily) and one started talking about my vagina and saying it was the nicest one she'd ever seen, so I tried to cover it up and she was saying how her's was in a 'zig zag' and mine was perfectly straight. I couldn't stop peeing, but finally it stopped and I made jokes as I left but got out of there quickly."
"4243"	"(2016-02-27 (25)) I was watching a movie which was kind of dull, but it was also somewhat hard to follow and it didn't really wrap anything up until the end. It was kind of a thriller and at the end, this old guy (about 50-60) who we thought was the bad guy confronted this guy at a speech he was giving and it was implied he was actually the good guy. I was then in a room on one of the top storeys of this building in a city with the other main characters and a lady was like 'oh no' and I moved to look out the window and saw a mushroom cloud. A shock wave hit and we saw a building start collapsing. Some people started climbing out of this building onto another one that it was connected to, but we decided to stay in here and wait. But the building started to sway and the room began to collapse. We tried to climb out the window and then somehow ended up in the ocean or a pool."
"4244"	"(2016-03-01 (25)) We had this hangout in like a cave? I crawled through this tunnel into the place and Stephen Merchant was there too, but he had a piercing near his mouth and it really annoyed me. He was talking to someone at one point and referred to me as 'her' and I loved the way he said it. He kissed me at some point and then later found out I hated piercings so removed them. Later, we were in class and Mr Hoover was pairing us up so we wouldn't be with our friends, but he did the newbies first and then all of us were left. Tristan was like 'I'm going with Marcos' and I said 'that's not fair, I'm going with Frederick' and Fletcher was also in class and ended up in a group of 3. We had to make a film and Frederick went off to swim in this pool and was like 'I know what kind of film we can make' and I made a face and said 'that's not PG'. I went to the train station with Frederick and Cecelia, but it was one I hadn't been to before and was confusing. I got lost trying to find the Woodside line and eventually I gave up, exhausted and called Mom to pick me up saying I couldn't work it out."
"4245"	"(2016-03-04 (25)) I was staying somewhere with a bunch of people from the Technical College (some real, some not). They had triple bunks and I was staying in the same room as my friends. We were messing around somewhere and I leaned in close to Frederick and he said 'I thought you were going to kiss me' and he kissed me on the head. We were later in the room and some girls came in and wanted to stay in there and I angrily snapped at them and said 'no, this is our room' and they left. I had a middle bunk and Frederick had the top bunk. He was teasing me through the wiring of the bed and we were taking photos of each other. At one point I climbed up the side into his bed and he was like 'what are you doing' and I said I needed to hide. Someone came into the room asking for me and she stood right over the bunk sniffing it and he said I wasn't here. She said it smelled like I'd been in his bed and he just shrugged."
"4246"	"(2016-03-07 (25)) I was in a theatre for a showing of some play. There weren't many people there and I thought this was because it was Wednesday. I was sitting off centre in a bad seat so I got up and moved to near the back and more in the centre. A lady came and I was sitting in her seat so I moved over one. She had this massive rocket launcher gun and she hoisted it onto her shoulder and started shooting people in the play. It shot like a fireball, but there was no fire. She said anyone who crossed this line on the floor would get shot. Everyone started running and screaming but I just stayed with her. When she went over the line to get closer, I stayed on the original side and she shot another girl who crossed it. She asked me to see this guy to call someone. He gave me his credit card (his name was Martin and he was French or something) and I had to use it at this phone booth thing. I showed the card and pointed at the guy to say it was his card and he waved back. I waited for a phone to be free and called the number. It had to be done this way so they could talk to each other in secret and the guy's baby had been kidnapped. I called the number and the 'bad guy' answered. It was his girlfriend's number, but it had been some years and you could the hear the kidnapped kid talking in the background as he was a toddler now. It was implied the bad guy had tricked the girlfriend into dating him."
"4247"	"(2016-03-07 (25)) I was in a mansion type of place. It was a huge house with lots of storeys and basement levels. I worked there somehow, I think. They had made or captured this Godzilla type of monster which they called the 'fog breathing dragon'. They planned to set it on the public and I knew but couldn't say anything. I was in a basement level when it got out and I hid and watched it walking up towards the main level, but then it stopped and walked back down into darkness. I panicked because I didn't know where it was and where it was going. I was trying to find somewhere to go to hide from it. I went outside and there were a few people just chatting and being normal so I assumed it was still inside. I was looking around for an entrance to another part of the mansion (there were other separate buildings too). I saw Emmanuel walking towards the place so I waved him over and quickly explained and said we had to hide. We found an unlocked door and went in. There were a few people inside and it wasn't a great hiding spot, so we left. I could now see some fog near the main part of the mansion and realised it was out. We kept going into places and leaving. We went into a house but people were actually there making out in the lounge room, so we snuck past and left through the back door - which had two chains on and I had to quickly and quietly take them off. We jumped over the fence into this alley. We found a display home and I thought that was perfect. There was no door handle, just a sliding door. As we walked in, two couples turned up and came in as well. I tried to make small talk and said I was just having a look. They asked if I had a boyfriend so I pointed to Emmanuel to shut them up. They asked if we had kids and I said no. I thought maybe they were trying to make it sound like they were more deserving of the home. I was looking around at the rooms. The main bedroom had a little changing area for babies and a baby was on it and almost falling off, so I grabbed it and moved it to the pillow. A guy who I assumed was the father came in and I told him it was falling off and left. I said we should leave and we got in a car. There was lots of fog in the distance. Tristan was with us now too. We started driving and going down the road we could see the fog trail leading up to the road where we were going. I said we just had to go. We got to the main road and we could see it close by on the left. I put my foot down on the accelerator and turned right. There was a bit of traffic though. I drove to this theatre place at the top of a hill, thinking it would be the safest place. We went in and there were lots of rooms and people around. We were trying to find some guy that was performing and looking for his dressing room, but there were too many staff members around for us to check. We were in a hallway with a food cart which had prawns and other things on it. Tristan saw his grandma and started talking to her and she was like 'oh it's good you're here with friends' and I got impatient and they finally said bye."
"4248"	"(2016-03-10 (25)) I was at the Technical College, which was different, and Tristan had to do some test. Our Thursday classes were a bit of a jumble, although we still had editing in the morning and I was thinking about skipping it. I was walking somewhere a bit later and saw Fletcher about to jump on a train and I called out to him and he stopped. He was excited to walk with me. We went to this busy pub and Brock was there. Fletcher admitted to having read a journal of mine and my heart dropped because I realised he knew I knew that he liked me and various other things [coincidentally, Fletcher gave me a letter this same day admitting his feelings for me] . He brushed over it though and I didn't get a chance to ask him about it. We went outside and somehow a fire started and because the pub was made of wood it caught fire very quickly. I was worried about Brock, but we found him in the crowd that evacuated. Some time later, there was a zombie somewhere. It got killed instantly, but I knew this was the start of the apocalypse. I decided this place near the sea would be a good place to settle, so I went to get people to take with me. I first went to Tristan and his he was with his father, who was in a caravan. We were waiting for him when he made this screaming noise and came out and shot himself in the head. It looked like he had been zombiefied. A couple zombies came around the corner (they were fast) and we killed them somehow and got in the car. I went past the Technical College to find Fletcher and stopped in the middle of the path and yelled at him to get in. I said 'the zombie apocalypse is starting'. We went to this house/apartment for some reason and we got attacked while there but this girl came and shot the zombie and we invited her along. We ended up at this dormitory place and were hunkering down there for a while. We had more than enough people that could fit in one car, so we were deliberating on where to get a bus or van from. One girl was downstairs looking for clothes, but had left the curtains open. I found her and told her off and said people could see in. She then went to turn on a light but I switched it off as quickly as she turned it on (it made a flicker though). I told her to lock the door and saw movement outside. We quickly ran back upstairs and I peeked out the window and saw the streets littered with looters. The others were sleeping but I woke them to say we might have company. The next day we were driving through the streets and it was just normal business. We were discussing why and suggested that most people were just sick at the moment and in a few days all the people coughing would turn. I realised I'd been coughing and joked that if I turn, just kill me instantly."
"4249"	"(2016-03-11 (25)) I was at some kind of convention/speech with Cecelia and some others. They gave us these dildos and then said we got to keep them. One was like a tentacle. Mr Hoover was there as a speaker and was demonstrating how to use a butt plug and lay down on the ground and was putting it in and I didn't look. Then we had rooms there that we were staying in and Cecelia was across from me. I deliberated on whether or not to try out the tentacle dildo but kept getting interrupted."
"4250"	"(2016-03-13 (25)) I was at the Technical College in some class. We were on a bridge and Anaya was there and did something to annoy me. Some other people had annoyed me as well so I went to Mr Hoover's office to complain. There was a queue and then I was next. I was really angry. Fletcher came with a piece of paper and I was ignoring him for some reason and Mr Hoover called him in and I said ""I was next"" and he said that it would only take a second. He handed him the piece of paper and then I went in. I started saying 'I was in class and Anaya was annoying the hell out of me' and he seemed shocked, then I realised it had been a dream and I went 'uh, I just realised it was a dream' and we both laughed. I said 'never mind' and left. I felt better now and talked to Fletcher as normal. Someone asked me what my Gronk film was about and I explained it was meant to be that the three people were dead and the bar was limbo and after they realised they were dead the bartender led them to their final destination. I explained the final product was a mess and he agreed. I was somewhere with Tristan and Reuben came and had his hands in his pants and said that he just walked around masturbating and no-one noticed. He was then shaking people's hands. Then we had to meet in this outside area and get into groups of about 30. Mr Hoover came and said he was giving us some black students and about 5 of them joined us. Then all the groups met up in this big area. He told everyone to get into a circle, going girl boy girl boy, and hold hands. Tristan was on my left and Frederick on my right. I felt uncomfortable about holding hands but went through with it anyway. I wondered where Emmanuel was as I'd prefer him to Tristan and was glad Fletcher was somewhere else. We then had to separate and the girl had to go behind the two boys and then put our hands on their backs. I refused to touch them so hovered my hands behind them and the exercise was a 'trust' exercise where they would fall back. We just didn't do it. Then we had to go with different partners and Mr Hoover randomly paired me up with someone else. There was more physical contact involved and I refused to do it. I just sat down and ignored the person. There were a couple more that I also just ignored. I went ahead to the next area and it had this little grassy/forest area and then a temple at the bottom. I ran to the temple and went behind some columns and stayed in the shadows. But some people had seen me and this girl started coming towards me trying to touch me and I put my hand into a fist and said I would punch her in the face if she touched me. She left and I joined the others in this room with a bunch of tables and I sat down at one at the front. There was some kind of number puzzle on a piece of paper. Brock sat down at mine and asked if I was having fun yet and I said no. Mr Hoover said that he forgot to see if there was anyone who disliked physical contact and I put my hand up as did a lot of others, including Fletcher who was near the back. I ended up back at the temple area and it was like a game. There was a T-Rex standing over me and I ran and tried to run into some bushes to hide but rocks blocked most of them (like it would in a game). I finally found this big leafy bush and hid under the leaves. It couldn't see me and stopped chasing me, but then started eating the leaves. I could see it through the leaves (a game mechanism) and it was getting really close and I thought it was buggy because I couldn't escape now."
"4251"	"(2016-03-18 (25)) I was friends with these 3 guys (all looked between 20-25) and had been for a long time but I'm not quite sure how everyone was related. The three of them had special powers to go to 'The Middle' where they could morph into any creature and do other things. The 'leader' was called Karl and he had sort of Nordic features. Another was quite fat and the other looked like Tom Hiddleston and had medium-length black hair (very similar to Loki's). I can't remember what his real name was but his 'Middle' nickname was Table. I had a crush on Table and I was pretty sure he liked me. He was kind of like the 'rebel' though and kept using The Middle to do things, at one point he went to a zoo and 'stole' a leopard and tiger. The guys were disappointed and said 'you'll be on camera' and he just shook his head and looked regretful and they realised he'd used The Middle. If they used it too often they could be lost in The Middle or something, but they could also become masters of the power. They were saying they were ""50% human"" and said they should just focus on being human for now. I lived with them and we all shared a room with a single bed each. Karl was at the very end next to the wall, then the fat guy, then Table, then me closest to the door. We were in bed and just sort of talking but Table decided to sleep on the floor so got rid of his bed and put the matress on the floor at the end of the other beds. He invited me to join him and I thought about it. We had shared a bed before and were comfortable with each other. I threw a pillow at him and he giggled and then I got up to join him. They made a little jokey fuss about 'getting into bed with your boyfriend'. I put my pillow next to his on the left side and he moved over. I got under the blanket, facing him, and he put his arm around me and my shirt had ridden up a bit and he brushed it down first. I rested my hand on his side. We were both wearing socks and he was rubbing his foot on my foot. We were very close and he was also kind of giving me Eskimo kisses. Eventually we began kissing and he got up a little to shift me underneath him but I could feel the feet of the 'fat guy' who had also switched to a mattress but had just left it in place of the bed. He woke up and it was now Frederick and he was like 'oh Izzy's getting lucky' and we changed positions so Table was hugging me from behind and Frederick started going around us taking photos. He eventually got bored and went back to bed. Table hugged me tightly and was kind of spooning me."
"4252"	"(2016-03-22 (25)) I don't know where I was, but Juniper had to go to the toilet and the door didn't lock so I had to stand outside and guard it for her. I thought she had finished for some reason and I got distracted and was talking to someone and some guy went and opened the toilet door. She came out a few seconds later and didn't want to talk to me because she thought I did it on purpose. I apologised and said I thought she had finished."
"4253"	"(2016-03-26 (25)) I was watching a movie except it was playing out live and I was the main character. It was night and in the rain and I was in the UK, I think, and had no way of getting back to where I was staying. I saw this small building and knocked on the door. They opened it and let me in and I said 'My name's Abby'. There was an underground section and it turned out they were scientists and working on lots of secret things. They let me down there for some reason. While I was down there an alarm went off saying that something had escaped. I somehow 'knew' it was a zombie type of thing. There was this cage in the middle of a room (it looked like a type of lab, the whole underground area was very white and had machines and things all along the walls). I saw this fast, rabid zombie run into it and attack the guy in there. I tried to find somewhere to run or hide and I could hear chaos going on in the distance. They wanted to stop the zombie before it got outside."
"4254"	"(2016-03-27 (25)) We went to Classmate-M-09's house and his room was this shared room full of bunk beds. Tristan was there too and had said Daniel was actually a girl, and I was trying to see if he was until I realised it was just because there were teddy bears and 'girly' things around but we later found out they weren't his. The house from the outside was made of stone and was very rounded and fancy looking. He said his parents used it for their 'clients' (they worked in film) so they didn't have to book hotels. I was walking down the street later, wearing my sunglasses, when this girl said 'hey, Izzy' and I stopped and vaguely recognised her but didn't know who she was. I said as such and looked at her name badge but it didn't ring any bells. She said she went to 'Bush College' and I remembered I had gone there for a month or so in highschool. She was talking about some stuff I'd said and was acting like we were best friends. We were somewhere else later, outside, and people had made some short films and were getting awards. One was for best film made by a 'homeless' person and this guy we had seen staying at Daniel's got the award. I went to the canteen later and it was this round booth that was quite large (looked like those kind of bars in the movies at a beach resort) and I got a ham crossaint. I went to find somewhere to sit and didn't want to sit with Tristan for some reason and saw Emmanuel sitting with some other people at the 'bar' of the canteen, but didn't want to look weird or have to sit with other people. I was annoyed that I wanted to sit with Emmanuel. Later I was somewhere else with a bunch of people from the Technical College and saw Emmanuel again and he said something to me and I said 'shut up Emmanuel' and he said 'shut up Izzy' and then we walked away."
"4255"	"(2016-03-30 (25)) I was on the beach and playing in the shallow end of the water. There was a little jellyfish nearby. A stingray was also hovering around and I was a bit nervous about the stingray, but not the jellyfish. The tide kept coming in further and I kept moving further back and Dad, who was in the water, joked that I'd end up off the beach."
"4256"	"(2016-03-30 (25)) I was in this house for some reason. It was full of ghosts, most of which were hostile and causing problems. We were there to get rid of them, I think, but I didn't really want to be there. There was a room where we had certain lights installed to see them and we were trying to get Ma (the name of the 'leader' ghost) to come in but we couldn't work out how to turn them on. As the ghosts piled in though, the lights turned on (a weird red colour). There were a lot in there, it was almost like a ballroom. I pulled out my phone to take a photo and only a few of the ghosts could be seen. Fletcher came in and was apparently a ghost and he explained that it took energy to not be seen, so only the older and stronger ones could do it with ease. I got him in the frame for a photo and could see him and I took a photo. I went out at one point with a couple of the ghosts. They were obsessed with orange juice and I took them to a bar place and they ordered orange juice and the bartender sent it sliding down the table to us. I got one too. One of the ghosts used to be an alcoholic and said they couldn't have alcohol, but then ordered something alcoholic and choked on it and spat it out, but then kept drinking it. I wondered if they could get drunk."
"4257"	"(2016-03-31 (25)) There had been some kind of disaster or something and we couldn't go outside. We lived in this apartment block type of thing and I lived with Dad and Ezra in one of the nicer and bigger rooms. We looked out the window one day and saw some cars, and then saw a bunch of military looking vehicles carrying people. Everyone was angry and upset about this because it would mean they would have to share their rooms with other people since we were already at capacity. After processing them they told us we would get a few people and I suggested to these people we were friends with that we combine instead."
"4258"	"(2016-03-31 (25)) I was with a few people and we were outside trying to survive. There was a pregnant lady who was my friend and her boyfriend/husband, another person, and a guy who was my boyfriend. He had dark hair and a bit of stubble. We found a camp for the night and were there for a few hours but when we went to make a fire we discovered there had already been a fire there and the ashes were fresh. We quickly left but ran into some lions and other animals. They growled and circled us but seemed to look behind us and then walked off. I was like what the hell was behind us that scared them off. It was night now. We were walking for a while and found this dip which led to water and was very grassy, but one of them suggested it would keep us out of sight and provide us with food and water. I started climbing down but then someone said it was too vertical, so I put my hand up and my boyfriend helped lift me back up. Then there was a montage of us staying there; eating, laughing, sleeping, having sex. We went for a walk one day and found this house and decided to stay there. Then it was like a game and I was building rooms and placing furniture and it would say if there were enough toilets or beds or whatever for everyone. I kept finding already furnished rooms but with no door so was moving things around and putting doors in. Then we saw this big vehicle thing flattening the trees and coming this way. There was a type of door you could place which would hide itself when activated so only we could see it. I put one of those up on the side of this room (it was less obvious on the side), and we went in. But then I realised there were windows facing the rest of the house so I started deleting the windows and doors, but when I went around the corner there was an entire wall of windows and I could only delete them individually. The pregnant lady was looking from the other side to let us know how it was going and I asked if she was able to build a wall in front of the windowed wall, but then we saw a black lady walking around and I called her back in. We lay down behind this bookshelf to hide. The pregnant lady went into labour and I tried to find her a comfortable place to rest. There was some weird bit with an elevator and a rollercoaster where she kept making the floors higher, going to like 1000 and it made this rollercoaster that we went on faster and wobblier and it was huge and had lots of loops and it was scary, but we were laughing and screaming. Then it was back in the house. A lot of people came in and I knew already knew we were there and then I saw Emmanuel with them so I jumped up and said we didn't want any trouble. They asked why we were hiding and I said because we don't know if people are going to kill us or help us. I added 'then I saw Emmanuel and figured you must be ok'. They said 'well if you know Emmanuel, then you're ok with us'. I followed Emmanuel into this room to ask him about the people he was with and I was thinking 'maybe this will give me a chance to sleep with him' and then I remembered about my boyfriend and was trying to decide which one I liked more."
"4259"	"(2016-04-01 (25)) Karl Pilkington had a daughter called Alexandra and she was in her 20s. She was a little chubby, but average looking. I think something happened to her so she was in the news or something."
"4260"	"(2016-04-01 (25)) I checked my bank account and I had all these dodgy transactions from the Philippines. The first one was that Paypal transaction I did that got emailed to me [happened in real life, and I wasn't sure if it was dodgy] . My password had been changed on a lot of sites and I had to change them all. I had to cancel the card but since it was less than 2 weeks until I was going to the Philippines I was worried I wouldn't get a new card in time and it cost $90 to get an express card."
"4261"	"(2016-04-01 (25)) Mom had a different car and I got in the passenger seat (which was the opposite side like an American car) and the door behind me kept opening. I was trying to lock the car as I was sitting in it, but it just kept popping open. I complained to Mom when she came and she said it kept doing that you had to slam it. Later I was at Dad's house, which I was looking after while he was away. It was actually this huge, expensive place which was next to these other fancy, expensive places. I was going through his cupboards and fridges throwing out stuff that was out of date and cleaning up the place."
"4262"	"(2016-04-03 (25)) We had a new house, but some of it was temporary. Some had been built has rooms and had some of our stuff in it, but we stayed in this big tent thing just outside. Mom, Darren and I were working on something outside when I saw this dark grey cloud coming towards us and I said 'grab Rover and get inside' and we ran into the tent thing as it started raining. The tent was attached to the bottom with hooks and the wind and rain was lifting it up and letting the water in. I said we would drown and we had to leave. We started grabbing our things and got to the car but it had stopped raining. We didn't know if it was going to come back so didn't know whether to stay or leave."
"4263"	"(2016-04-03 (25)) I was in jail for some reason and there were these portals - I'm not sure of the specifics, but we were aware they were kind of safe but the police weren't. They were also maybe controlled by us in some way, like through a control, but I'd never used one. Anyway, I was trying to escape. A guard let me out of my cell but there were lots of guards and I couldn't get out anywhere. A portal was opened and he put me back in my cell but forgot to lock it. Classmate-F-05 was also there as a prisoner and was out of her cell but had guards in front of her. She saw me leave my cell as I slowly walked behind the group of guards and as soon as I had a straight line to the portal I ran and jumped in. Classmate-F-05 followed. I ended up in an outside place, which had park benches and grass and stuff. A few other people were there, including Frederick. I was sitting at the bench eating and he was next to me and kept leaning on me. He kept moving to different areas and it would always be where I was going to go next so he was joking I was following him. I pondered as to whether the portals took us to a real place, an alternate universe or was some kind of hallucination. Frederick said he thought it was like a shared dream and didn't exist beyond the area we were in. I said I didn't think it was a dream because the mirrors functioned properly and I could read words. Later I was sitting at a TV and Nana and Poppa were there, sitting on a lounge to my left. Tristan was sitting on the same lounge as me. Emmanuel was there and we were joking about something and then he said that we got along better than Tristan and Nana and Poppa."
"4264"	"(2016-04-04 (25)) I was watching a horror movie set on a ship that was sinking or had some kind of issue. Some people had gone on it (I think it was a ghost ship to begin with), and there was a ghost on there killing them off. One of the characters was played by Karl Pilkington and he had hair. They were in a part of the boat that had filled with water and there was a little gap for air. As he went to get some air, the ghost filled it with water and caused him to drown. I was like 'you can't kill Karl Pilkington!'."
"4265"	"(2016-04-04 (25)) I was at a shop and I'd had a drink with some people and I was driving out and got stopped by a policewoman who gave me a breath test. She went off to test it and I was holding up traffic, so I drove further around the corner to where she was parked. She went to the next car to test them and I continued waiting. I saw Esther and some other people from work and I waved. I asked what store they did but I don't remember what they said. The policewoman came back and said I was ok to go and my reading had been '0.5', which was well below the limit. Later I was in Ms Nowak's class for today and she said she'd made a mistake with the director's presentations and that those of us remaining had to do this other activity. She showed us these drawings and they were like coloured in with pens, using lines. So it was drawing a scene or picture using only certain defining lines (like a window, but not a desk) and then using 'lines' to colour it in. I had no idea what she wanted us to do and so I just sat there."
"4266"	"(2016-04-09 (25)) Fletcher, Cecelia, some others and I went to Fletcher's house for some reason. His parents were old and white, they looked like typical American grandparents. I asked Cecelia about it quietly and she said it happened sometimes with Filipino's. He seemed to be their natural born kid, but I couldn't really work it out. We left there and were on a street and I think this girl kept dying and we took her with us to give back to someone else later. We went to this ice-cream store which was closed to wait in."
"4267"	"(2016-04-11 (25)) I was talking to Fletcher on Facebook and he said that he needed an ""esoteric future"" and that I was a ""sacred mound"". I didn't know what he meant but the other stuff he was saying sounded like he was 'breaking up' as friends, so I was confused and annoyed. Later his profile said it had been deactivated but I also had a friend called Joe Walker or something which I assumed was his account."
"4268"	"(2016-04-11 (25)) I was at the Technical College and I was running late for class but wanted to get lunch. I got this wrap thing which was chicken with lettuce and tomato. I got to class and Mr Jennings was the lecturer. The desk layout was like a square 'C' with the open part at the front where Mr Jennings was. Tristan was at the desk on the left side as you came in the room and Fletcher was next to him on his left. I sat next to Tristan on the right. They had already started class and had been handed out cards. They all had different things on them - items or pets or people. He was handing out a different number of cards to each person and it was supposed to force a divide in the room or something, make some people arrogant about the number of cards or what cards they had etc. Mr Jennings gave me one card and it had a picture of a cartoon elephant and was called Bop. I said to Tristan 'I have the best one'. I was eating my wrap in class and it was very messy and there was lots of lettuce. Sometimes it was steak instead of chicken."
"4269"	"(2016-04-11 (25)) I was at home and my room was bigger and didn't have much in it. I noticed some ants in the corner and I left briefly and came back and there were more. There was also another part of the floor that had started gathering them too. I called out to Mom and said there were lots of ants in my room and she said she'd have a look later. I said they were getting bigger but she didn't seem to care. I threw a sock and it landed in a corner where a group of them were and they started going frantic and spreading out further across the room. I ran out of the room but looked closely and realised they weren't ants but hairy spiders. I yelled to Mom saying they were ""hairy jumping spiders"". Spaceman was near my room and I shooed him away. Then Rover was lying on my floor and I made him come out. Mom said she thought they were dangerous but still didn't come to help. They began pouring out of my room and into the hallway. I was freaking out and screaming at them to do something. Darren calmly walked out and said he was waiting for them to go 'up' and I realised he was going to go under the house. They had started filling up my room vertically as well. I was worried they would ruin all my stuff."
"4270"	"(2016-04-18 (25)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were going for lunch. We went to the canteen and it was weird and lots of stuff was closed. I had found a video of me falling and curling up as a bus came towards me and Brock stopped the bus. I had forgotten about it. I showed Tristan and Frederick. Later, we were at a pub and Tristan got drunk and kissed Ms Nowak and she just laughed."
"4271"	"(2016-04-18 (25)) I was trying to get back to the Technical College after leaving for a bit and I couldn't remember the way. I was driving and going up steps and in off-road places but I knew I was dreaming and I didn't care. Then I had another me that I was using to ride and she would walk on all fours. I was riding her but it rubbed against me and it quickly made me come and I woke up during it."
"4272"	"(2016-04-18 (25)) I was at the Technical College. We were in a computer lab but had another room we were in too. Frederick had some idea for a story involving me and I didn't want to be in it. Hubert was in the room and under a blanket. He got up and I saw his butt when he got back in and I squealed and he put clothes on as he laughed. He complained that people had called him gay and his family complained that he was in effeminate and I said it wasn't a bad thing. I was talking to Fletcher about leaving or something. I wanted to edit something but the labs were full. Bev also complained about something someone else was doing."
"4273"	"(2016-04-21 (25)) I was at Frederick's house and it was just us two there. We had been drinking and hanging out there. His room was small and was basically just a bed."
"4274"	"(2016-04-21 (25)) I was watching The Matrix. Neo was running away from Agent Smith and was running through this market and shopping center. The Agent kept changing into people and Neo was only barely outrunning him. Neo got on a fast elevator to the top floor and then ran and took this balloon thing to the ground and the Agent gave up. Neo also had two kids (a girl and a boy) and was still trying to decide whether to leave The Matrix."
"4275"	"(2016-04-22 (25)) Winifred made a short film for that festival thing with a prompt. I can't remember what the prompt was but she had two guys who were similar looking and they were flirting with each other and were shirtless and rubbing each other's chests. Then some guy got a finger through his ear to the other side of his head, then the finger got chopped off and the chopped off bit was so long that you could tell it wasn't actually part of the finger. I edited it slightly so it made it look more real."
"4276"	"(2016-04-26 (25)) I was with someone from highschool and she said 'I had a dream that you proposed to Michael Graves' and I asked who that was and she was like 'you know, Michael Arch-Smith. No, Eugene, the one who knows everything' and I said 'Eugene Pritchard?' and she said yeah."
"4277"	"(2016-04-26 (25)) A war or something had happened and there weren't many people left. I had been hiding out in this house on a hill in the forest but had to leave because bad guys were coming. I went into the city/village and found some good people. Some of them ended up dying but I was with this one guy who owned this chain of shops which all had an underground storage area in the back. The bad guys were coming and we went into one. At the front it just looked like clothes storage, but further on there was a bunker area."
"4278"	"(2016-05-04 (25)) I can't remember where I was but I heard Frederick say 'your girlfriend's in there' and saw he was talking to Fletcher which annoyed me. Fletcher asked about his stuff from the Philippines and I said, about the watermelon seeds, 'there's only two bags' and I gave him the shirt and he put it on. He didn't seem to get what it meant. There was an episode of Extras where Andy had told this guy he lived at this beach resort and the guy wanted to see it. I was there with him and it was Dad that lived there but I had a pass to get in so I let him use it. There were two sections of the place though, one was really posh and fancy - which the guy assumed Andy lived in, and the other was where Dad lived which was just basic accommodation. The room was small and it was just one room for everything and was basically just a bed. Later it was just me there and I went on Dad's computer to look for something and he had all these porn sites up and bookmarked and it was just all over the place. Then I was somewhere else in someone's room. I was friends with this guy who I liked, but he had a girlfriend. Something happened and he was saying something about who he wanted to marry and she realised he was talking about me and she was just like 'you want to be with her, so be with her' or something and left and then I didn't know what to do, but I was happy. At some point I was riding on motorbikes with Frederick and some other people."
"4279"	"(2016-05-07 (25)) I had a friend who was an ant. I can't remember his name. There was someone else who had an ant as well. We communicated telepathically or something. We were doing something with them. I had him on my finger and was putting him around to do whatever he was doing. They may have been competing. I tried looking for him at one point and couldn't find him, then I found him and he'd snapped one of his legs. Then he went missing again and I was worried he'd fallen down this big hole. I was really sad. Then he appeared again but he was light brown and bigger and didn't look like an ant. I asked him if he evolved."
"4280"	"(2016-05-08 (25)) A zombie-type virus had wiped out a lot of people. The zombies were all underground though and hadn't yet come into contact with us. Something was happening to the atmosphere which was forcing us to all go underground. I was at the shop with a group of people, including Mom. They were getting food, mostly canned food. I was bored and then she asked if I wanted chocolate and I grabbed a bunch of chocolate, including a big bag of Ferrero Roche's. Later I noticed my bag had been opened and another lady shopping said she wanted some and I said 'you could've just grabbed your own bag' and I showed her where they were and she apologised. I got a new bag for myself. We went down a couple of levels and each level had a trapdoor. We would then explore the entire level to make sure it was clean. We got to one and were listening for noises. We carefully opened the trapdoor and it all these flaps covered in blood. It had filled with water and a guy floated to the top but was still alive. We pulled him out and could hear hissing and zombie noises coming from down there and we thought it was odd they were underwater. It was all flooded except for the first 2-3 levels and we wondered how everyone was supposed to fit. Later we were somewhere else. We had a random mix of people. There was a blonde Scottish lady, kind of mousey librarian looking. There were a few actors, one called Iain Softley. One of the guy's I was kind of friends with got excited when someone said we had a new addition to the group who was a girl and it was big news for everyone. I took issue with it and asked why it mattered if it was a girl. He said 'because we're guys. It's someone new to look at'. I said it makes no difference, girls and guys are the same. He said 'yeah but we like anal' and I shouted 'so do girls!'. I didn't know what the relevance of this point was. I was thinking about the guys we had in the group and came to the conclusion there was only one I found attractive and a couple more that I would sleep with if I had to."
"4281"	"(2016-05-11 (25)) I went to the editing class today and it was different [attending a different editing class today] . There were desks organised around the teacher's desk, but they didn't have computers and then all the computer desks were in another corner. I sat the desk next to the teacher's desk and waited. Fletcher came in and sat next to me. Reuben and Emmanuel were also in this class. I ended up moving to another spot and Fletcher followed. He also gave this huge 'book' of notes and papers to someone and it turned out it was an OHS report or something he had done for them. I was thinking he needs to stop doing people's work for them. Tristan came in at one point and I pretended to hide under my desk. He spotted us and said something or other and left. I then realised it was Saturday and I said 'you have class on a Saturday?' and Fletcher said it was because it was full at all other times during the week. Teacher-M-01 came in and made everyone sit together around him. There were lots of people and he said everyone had to tell a story. I was looking away and he said 'how about we start with Poppa's girl?' and I got a chill and turned around and was like 'what? How do you know about that?' and he said 'I saw it on the family car' and everyone nodded like it made sense and I said 'yeah but I've met you once, months ago'. I said I didn't have any stories and he said it didn't have to be recent. Fletcher said 'lots of stuff has happened, oops you can't talk about that, what about moving to England'. So I said 'oh yeah, when I was 13-' and Teacher-M-01 interrupted and said 'that's a young age to move' and I said 'no, that's later. When I was 13 I really wanted to live in England. When I was 18, I thought I could do it so I got a job and I was also studying at the time. When I was 22 in 2013 I moved there and lived for about 9 months'. He seemed satisfied with that and then asked if everyone had done something on their blankets from last week. Fletcher and I moved to sit on this couch and his blanket was this weird abstract type thing with lots of dots in patterns and it was purple. He covered himself up in it and I borrowed a yellow blanket to put on me. There was a fishtank thing with a decorative thing in the middle and when you looked at it from the side everything looked squished and small for comical effect. There was some squid type thing that kept hanging around at the corners waving one tentacle about."
"4282"	"(2016-05-13 (25)) I was watching Deadpool but it was different. Morena Baccarin and Ryan Reynolds were still in it though. Baccarin was in this dodgy looking carpark and it was night. She was waiting for Deadpool. She was walking past a car and there were some guys in it. She realised it was an ambush and then Deadpool finally came. He fought with a few guys and dodged some bullets and then they both got into this car. She was in the driver's seat but then it was me. He jumpstarted the car and then was screaming 'drive through the cars!' so I started driving and turned and went down this street. The car was old and very slow, but started to pick up speed. He kept screaming 'just keep going' and she/I drove the car over this cliff but there was a massive drop and down below was the ocean. It went in slow motion and went quite far, until finally crashing into the water. Then it showed a beach resort and the opening of the beach. The water bubbled and then Deadpool came walking out, but he was covered in seaweed and stuff and you couldn't see him at all, he was completely green. He walked into the resort. Then it went back and showed Morena Baccarin coming out of the water and she had a mermaid costume on, which showed her cleavage. I was annoyed that they gave her the 'decorative female' treatment. Whatever had happened to them had made them immortal for some reason. They got cleaned up and there were a lot of close ups of Baccarin smiling and I wondered if her only role in the film was to smile a lot."
"4283"	"(2016-05-13 (25)) I went to this Chinese restaurant with a friend and we both already had some Chinese food with us. We walked in and this old Chinese guy, presumably the owner, reached his hand into my friend's one and started feeling all the food. He went to reach into mine and I said no. He showed me he was wearing clean gloves and I reluctantly agreed. After feeling around he said it was ok. Then some people were sneaking around out the back looking for something. They were good and the Chinese owners were bad. This black guy and his white girlfriend were in this bedroom looking for something. They heard the people coming so quickly got undressed and pretended to be having sex (she was bent over and he was behind her). His penis was huge; unnaturally long. The old Asian owner came in and saw them. The black guy was like 'sorry we just couldn't help ourselves' and the Asian guy just kept staring at them and then encouraged them to continue. The black guy hesitantly started having anal sex with her, only putting in a little bit and then after a few seconds she said she had come (she was obviously in pain and just saying that to make it stop). But the Asian guy wanted more so he put his penis around the side of her face and she somehow put it in her mouth backwards (so the head was pointing out) and started pushing her head back and forth. He was moaning and acting like he was about to come but didn't want to."
"4284"	"(2016-05-21 (25)) I was living with and dating Dan Palmer. Brief moments of us together flashed by but I can't remember them. There was one where he had just gotten out of the shower and was naked. He was getting dressed and talking to me and I was leaning against the door frame. He put his undies on and then came up to me and kissed me. Then he kissed me again, longer this time, and started putting his arm around me. This led to us having sex in our bed. Later, I went into the room and the bed was broken. I yelled out asking what happened and he said something like 'you fucked me for 3 hours doing banana splits'. I wondered what a banana split was and I yelled out saying 'don't just blame me, you were there too'. Then I was at home, which was different. Esther came over and was preparing her scanners for a job. We were in the kitchen with Mom. In the list of jobs for the next week was a travel job which said in the UK. I said 'so you're doing a job in England' and she said 'no, it's in Exmouth, it's ex-English'."
"4285"	"(2016-05-21 (25)) I was young, like 4. I had an older brother, who was Classmate-M-27. He was having a party and there were a bunch of teenage girls and boys there. I was sitting in the car with some of them and they were asking each other which illnesses they had. One person asked about the clap and one person put their hand up and I congratulated them for being honest. He later got annoyed with me and left me in the back of the car with the doors locked and left it in neutral. It started going out onto the road and I tried opening the door, but it wouldn't open. So I wound down the window, opened the door from the outside and jumped out. My mother (different) came home later and realised what had happened (she put the 'clues' together and knew he had done it on purpose). She was upset and angry at him, but we didn't know where he was. There was a weird red flash of light outside. It happened again later and I mentioned it to my father. He looked worried and made us go out the other door. He had a topless car and I got in and the seats in front were bent so they were almost horizontal and I hid under those as I saw the lights happen again and something peered over the top. I screamed and the thing ran. I could only see it properly out of the corner of my eye and I was scared."
"4286"	"(2016-05-27 (25)) It kept going back and forwards between real life and a video game. Body snatchers were taking over. They would be very flat and wooden and I think didn't blink as much. A female friend and I were in a house for some reason and then we had to escape because some of the family were body snatchers. We rushed about looking for windows and finally found one that we could fit through. As we were walking down the street/path, we saw two guys up ahead. One was Kit Harington and the other was ok looking. They slowed down and started walking with us and Kit was walking with me so I was happy that I got the hot one. The rest is mostly a blur, just snippets of us running away and meeting with people and then they would turn and we'd run away from them. I was working at the airport at some point and this little food place had nice looking muffins and cakes."
"4287"	"(2016-05-30 (25)) I was in a supermarket which was near to the Technical College, or like part of it. I think I bought some stuff but I may have been doing some work there? I went to class and left a kebab there. I went and did something and then came back and saw Justus eating a kebab. At first I thought it was mine, but then I saw mine was still there."
"4288"	"(2016-06-02 (25)) I was in editing class, which was different. The room was bigger and more spread out and the computers were all around the edge (and were PCs and old-ish). It was kind of L-shaped (but like a fat, squashed L), with the door at the top of the L, and in the little nook was the computer I liked. But it wasn't there, so I took the one next to it, though I made a comment that my computer was gone. Malcolm McDowell was our substitute for the day. He was a lecturer at the Technical College and although we had no classes with him, had had him as a substitute before. As I was busy complaining about my computer being gone and sitting at another, everyone had been told to have a break and it was just me and Tristan left in the classroom. I said I had already finished cutting Box and was going to leave early to print stuff at the library and would get a break then. I started to say that it was distracting having Malcolm McDowell as a teacher but he walked back in and I cut my sentence short. Everyone came back in and Fletcher came in and wanted to use the computer Tristan was on. He seemed frustrated/stressed as usual and didn't look at me. Tristan moved over to another computer and Fletcher started importing something and left. You could see the video playback and it was all this footage of people in a lecture theatre, filmed from behind them. Frederick appeared in one of them. Tristan's monitor broke somehow and he grabbed the glass and cried out 'ow' and Malcolm McDowell, in a joking/weird way said 'what a fucking arsehole' and we laughed. Tristan asked me to go get him some chair and I said 'what chair?' and he started having a go saying 'just get the chair' and I got angry and said 'I don't even know what chair you're talking about or where it is, so I don't know what you want me to do' and he pointed out it was some chairs that we had been near earlier that were at the 'front' of the school. I left and was walking down this 'hall' (outside, but undercover and paved). I saw Fletcher coming but walking backwards, so I stood behind him with my hands out to stop him but he turned at the last second and I laughed. The conversation was a bit awkward. He said we hadn't seen each other in a while and implied that I'd been ignoring him and I said 'I thought you were busy, so I left you alone' [haven't seen him or spoken to him in a while] . He said 'I could never ignore you' and I felt more awkward. We were standing in front of the windows to the class and I noticed everyone watching and felt more uncomfortable. He said 'I'll walk with you' and I said I was getting some chair for Tristan. We walked off and past a few people who were sitting in another room, including Claudine, and she made a jokey signal that she was jealous we got out of class."
"4289"	"(2016-06-04 (25)) I was in the UK and I had my car there. I was reversing out of a parallel park and my car started sliding and it hit this fancy old car. I quickly reversed and took off because I was scared it would cost me too much. Then we were at the Technical College. Our class was doing a production for a music video. Tristan made a list of all the people and their roles, Anaya and another person were put down as potential directors, and someone I didn't recognise as editor. I was just in 'unassigned'. I got angry and started asking why I hadn't been put in a role I wanted, or at least considered. Someone said there had been a meeting and I said I never heard about any meeting and if I wasn't editing or directing I wasn't going to participate. He changed it and put me as director. I calmed down and said my problem wasn't that I hadn't gotten a role that I'd wanted, but that I hadn't even been considered or asked. I was later walking outside and bumped into Fletcher. He stopped me and said hello and apologised for ignoring me saying he had a lot on his mind. He was being really awkward but I was glad he was talking to me again. Later some of us (about 5 girls) got taken down to this basement area by Mr Hoover. There were little artifacts and such. There was a table with containers under glass of 'disgusting' things. The only one I remember was an 'ectopic pregnancy' and it was like blood and a little fetus thing. All the girls had a look and got disgusted and walked away. I was fascinated by it and used the magnifying glass on all of them to get a closer look. There was a door nearby with a little window and I had a quick peek from far away and were told it was the doorway to hell and Satan was in there. A light in there came on and you could see a silhouette on the far wall of a big horned creature. One of the girls looked in and he opened the door and invited her in. It then turned into a kind of movie and he sat her on a chair and immediately got this knife and sliced the top of her face and cut it off. It was very graphic and bloody. He kept her alive and asked what her biggest regret was/what she felt guilty about and then healed her face and told her to go and repent or he would reverse the effects. He did the same to another girl. I was worried I'd get asked to come in because of the car thing earlier."
"4290"	"(2016-06-05 (25)) I was attending a wedding which was a bit odd and I had some sort of role like guest liaison. A guy who I had met a few days before hadn't turned up and I was worried because he has made suicidal comments. Mom and I decided to go check his house. We got there and the gate going to his backyard was open and she was looking back there and then we saw his body hanging from the back fence. It was covered a bit by clothes on the clothesline and bushes. I was upset that he had been there for probably 2 days and no one had noticed. He had left his back door open and he had a couple of cats. Their food bowls were empty but it looked like he had filled them up before he killed himself. The cats were friendly and that made me sadder. Later I had something to do with Big Brother. They got this digital 'milk' candle and were allowed to spend time outside with ex-housemates. Chanelle (BB8) was one of them and had like a best friend from the house that she hung out with. They had to go back when the candle melted, and they had to rush because they had forgotten. I was walking with some people, including Chanelle, and I said that I hated Big Brother letting in ex-housemates and said to Chanelle 'I don't mean I hate you, I just don't like them bringing in people who have gone. Once you're gone you're gone' and she agreed. Later I was somewhere inside and Steven (BBUK15) was there with this huge round ring on his left hand. Two girls were giggling over him and I was like ugh. Later I was with Technical College people watching some movie. The end was suddenly really gory and violent. I think someone got like squished and it showed all their guts and stuff on the floor. Juniper was there and looked disgusted and was like 'it's so gory' and some people agreed and I went it's not that bad and Mr Hoover like 'that's how you can tell if someone's a horror fan'."
"4291"	"(2016-06-10 (25)) I was somewhere doing something with the Technical College. Fletcher came up to me really close and leaned in as if he was going to kiss me and I leaned back to get away. He continued talking to me and I tried to walk back and stand up straight. He kept following me really closely and didn't seem put off by this. But after a while I looked at him properly and he looked like he hadn't slept or had been taking drugs or something. I was glad he was talking to me again but was weirded out."
"4292"	"(2016-06-11 (25)) I'm not sure where I was, but there was this huge toilet with stalls in the middle of the room. It was very grey and very dirty. I went in there to pee and as I sat down, another girl came in and asked what I was doing as she got into the next stall, which put me off. Later, there was a screening of some small film but there were some big guests there, like Jack Nicholson. We were hiding behind this wall as we were doing behind the scenes work, and we peeked around the front to see all the guests and we spotted Jack Nicholson and giggled to each other. Later I was somewhere with Technical College people and I was in the water, sort of upside down and Classmate-M-14 poked me in the bum and made a comment and I realised that I'd gotten my period and it was showing through. I wasn't embarrassed but annoyed, and mentioned what had happened as I looked around to find a pad and some clean pants."
"4293"	"(2016-06-12 (25)) I was at the Technical College, though it was a bit different. The top floor of the media building was this huge area where people would gather for like 'parties' and drinking. Cecelia was there. I took the elevator down to the bottom floor, which was still the same and I started walking towards the storeroom when I saw Fletcher walking my way. He stopped as if he was waiting for me, but I looked up at him and then looked back down as if I were ignoring him and he started walking back the other way. I went back up the elevator when I was done there and went back down with Cecelia some time later. Fletcher was sitting, waiting at the elevator and he got on and Cecelia was talking to him. She made some joke to me about something and I responded and said something to Fletcher as well."
"4294"	"(2016-06-12 (25)) There was this resort in some country, which I had stayed at before with someone to lower costs on accommodation, and then later Nana and Poppa had moved in to an apartment there. It was a fairly obscure resort so it was weird. I was staying there again with some friends and told them this story. There was a sign in the bedroom saying 'this is the lucky room, if you present this card you get 50% off', but then it said it had to be handed in before the 30 June or something. We left at night and went to this creepy public bathroom. I went with my female friend and we closed the main door, but it had a big open area at the bottom of the door and I kept staring at it, expecting someone bad to come along. It was very quiet outside too, adding to the creepiness."
"4295"	"(2016-06-19 (25)) I went to a cinema somewhere sort of far away. I parked in front of a wall on the opposite of the car park to where the building was. It was quiet, with only 2-3 other cars there. I brought a table and my laptop for some reason. Emmanuel was there too and we watched about 3 movies that were playing there and then I decided to go home. I walked out with the table and my bags and went walking down the carpark forgetting where I'd parked and then realising that my car wasn't there. I put the stuff down out the front and went in and told the receptionist that my car was missing. She said something like 'you must be new to this town' implying that my car had been stolen. I wondered how I was going to get home with all the extra stuff I was carrying."
"4296"	"(2016-06-21 (25)) There was a trip for 20 people to go 'the moon'. It was leaving at a specific time and a group of us from the Technical College decided to go. Tristan and Hubert were there. We were just walking from the Technical College and got to the building which was like a hotel, but then Hubert and I realised we'd forgotten our wallets so we ran back to get them. As we reached the top of the building we saw the shuttle in the distance and it was a couple minutes past the departure time and we saw the shuttle take off. We were disappointed and made our way back down the ladder. We bumped into a lady who asked if we had wanted to go and she said they could send just us two. She had a clipboard with notes and asked what we would like to do there. I said I used to study to be a vet so could do something with medicine, or that I also liked numbers so could do financing. She seemed annoyed at me. Hubert said something media-related. She quickly began organising for us to leave and I told Hubert it seemed odd that they would want to send just two people but he didn't listen to me. Then we were there, though I don't think it was the moon now but some other planet. The inhabitants were human looking, but usually had strange fluoro warpaint type of makeup styles. They gave me a room which had a bed and TV etc, and was quite nice (it was just a bedroom I think). I was watching TV one night and it had Foxtel but it had lines through it and the reception was really bad. I went to bed and heard a noise and when I opened my eyes I noticed my 'door' (which was like electronic) had been turned off. I turned it back on and went into my bathroom and I walked out to see the 'leader' guy in there and he said he was in love with me and wanted to have sex and I said no. He said that on this planet when someone felt that way about someone it meant the other person felt the same and I said that's not how it works. He said that he had these 'feelings' about me that weren't like normal feelings so it meant I had to feel the same. I said something like 'I have those feelings about Stephen Merchant, and only Stephen Merchant'. I ran out of the room and ended up in his room which was next door. I left there and ran to this place where there were people I knew. There was a guy I kind of liked called Doss or something and I saw through the window a guy having sex and I hoped it wasn't him and I looked into the room next door and that guy was having sex too. One of them was Doss (I couldn't tell which was him), so I walked around the corner and saw a black lady lying naked on a bed with a guy with his mouth around her vagina and both were still. I said something to them and then left and went to the room that I thought was Doss's and snuck in and as the leader guy and his people came, I went under the bed and then I heard my phone go off and thought I'd been found but then I woke up in real life as it was my alarm."
"4297"	"(2016-06-23 (25)) I was supposed to work one evening but I forgot and it was 2 hours after the start time that I realised so I text the supervisor to apologise and say I'd forgotten. Then I somehow missed another job and I wondered what was wrong with me. Later I was somewhere where people from the Technical College were - it may have been the Technical College (different from real life). Some of us were sleeping over in this building and I was on the floor with a blanket and pillow and Frederick wanted to sleep there too because he didn't have a blanket so I said ok. I woke up in the morning and people had started trickling in and I was worried they would think something dodgy was going on. Frederick got up and was helping them prepare for something and I stayed lying down. Then I discovered they were setting up for a karaoke night and I got up and started packing up to leave. I kept complaining about karaoke saying 'I hate it' and whinging that it's alway new music I've never heard of. I picked up some of my stuff and left to take it somewhere else. There was a big crowd of people outside and I realised I was wearing my Portal pants but didn't really care. Jolene and a few others were walking near me and she was smoking and I angrily waved the smoke out of my face and walked past."
"4298"	"(2016-06-25 (25)) A bunch of us from the Technical College were staying over in this store. It was across from a Target and I had to use that as my landmark to find it again every time we went out to do stuff. There were mattresses across the floor in two rows, each mattress was right up against the one before it. One row was incomplete and I grabbed a mattress and my pillows and blanket and tried to find somewhere to put it. Luis and Emmanuel were sitting on a mattress and Emmanuel said to go next to them. They were trying to figure out where everyone would go and Luis asked Emmanuel something like 'is anyone more familiar with anyone else' (to work out placement of the mattresses) and Emmanuel said no. Then after a pause he said 'well there was that one night' [referring to the time he kept hugging me] and looked at me and I was like 'yeah no' and Luis was like 'wait, what did I miss' and we waved him off. I put a video camera down facing the beds and left. Some time later I noticed my pillow cases were off my pillows and when I grabbed the pillows they were obviously not mine. My pillow cases were from Lord of the Rings. I angrily left looking for my pillows and went into other areas I knew people were sleeping. I saw one girl sleeping and squeezed the pillows and they felt like mine so I grabbed them and woke her up and asked where she got them. She said they were from a friend and I kept saying they feel like mine and she said she didn't know anything about that and I decided she was probably legit. I continued going around squeezing pillows but none of the others were like mine. Eventually a girl said 'you were filming, why not check the footage'. So I went back and played the video and it showed a guy and a girl who didn't like me (and who I didn't like) planning to take my pillows and plant something in them and give them back a week later so that it would make my hair itchy. I asked someone if I should tell Mr Hoover about this and they said to wait for them to do it and I said 'but I have proof right here'."
"4299"	"(2016-06-26 (25)) We were at the Technical College and bumped into Mr Jennings. He asked if anyone else was coming to class today and I said 'there are no classes this week' and I mentioned that Friday had been the last day for results and he'd apparently forgotten and quickly ran off saying 'Shit! Shit!'. My first thought was that maybe he would pass Emmanuel despite him not handing in his assignment, and briefly pondered my result."
"4300"	"(2016-06-26 (25)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and I saw Dmitri. We had a quick chat and discovered he was joining our course. Later I walked past him again talking to a teacher and I heard my name and the conversation seemed to imply that he was trying to get into my class. I sent a message to the group saying 'a guy I had a crush on in highschool is joining diploma' and when I checked replies I had a reply from Cecelia and Judah and I realised I'd sent it to the wrong group chat. I was running about doing stuff for a while and was stressed about whatever it was. Then it was a game and this girl was going to college or something for the first time and had a younger sister. They were in the car and the Mom was driving them. She got there and it was weird and she was in her room, and there was a door downstairs leading to this creepy 'hell' type place where some kind of devil guy was. It kept resetting, though she always remembered bits of it and he made things 'creepier' for her each time. She opened a cupboard at one point and these cards were being invisibly thrown around and she knocked a bunch of stuff over to try and make it stop but it didn't. Then there were a few people in the hall next to the stairs and there was a dark tunnel that led underneath the stairs to the other hall. They were waiting for something and I noticed the devil guy standing in the shadows and I yelled out and she attacked him and killed him, but then he came back bigger and she killed him and then he came back bigger and stronger again and with other bosses and I had no idea how to beat this level."
"4301"	"(2016-06-29 (25)) I was playing a game (that was kind of playing out in real life), with zombies and I had a camera which could change their temperament. There were three settings; calm, 'normal' and threat. When they were calm they just completely ignored you, when they were normal they would be zombie-like, but not fast and aggressive but when they were at threat level they would come running at you trying to get you no matter what. When you put them in calm mode, it would only last a certain amount of time before changing. The setting was similar to Dying Light, although the first location was like a shopping centre. It was like a tutorial stage and I had a zombie running towards me and I flashed the camera and turned him calm and then walked through. I made it out and then it was quiet outside. I walked down some steps and then decided I didn't feel like playing anymore but I didn't know how to save the game."
"4302"	"(2016-06-29 (25)) I was at this kind of zoo in an Asian country. People would often sleep over and stay there for some time. I was with some others but I can't remember who. We were sitting near this hole which was called something like 'the unending pit'. I saw a yellow and white striped snake curled up around a small tree across from us. It woke up and started coming towards us and seemed to be looking at me. I slowly tried to move behind the others, but it followed me. I ended up falling into the hole but I landed on a wooden slatted platform some way down. I was trying to call up but no-one was coming. Then I was in some water and my car was there. I got into the car to get my water bottle and it was slowly filling up with water. I was sad I was going to lose my car because I liked it. I opened the window and swam out. Then I was back on the platform and waiting for people to help me get out."
"4303"	"(2016-07-06 (25)) There were dinosaurs which were taking over or something. I was at a house that was sort of in the middle of nowhere with a few people and we were trying to hide from these small-ish dinosaurs. We were inside and I asked if someone had closed the door and they hadn't. I went out the front door and I climbed on top of this patio area and one of them walked under it and I tried to stay still so it wouldn't see me. There was a harbour where the government was telling people to go so they could get on boats and be sent somewhere safe. I went there and there was a massive queue. We got put on a canoe thing at the end and after sailing on that a bit where no-one could see there was a huge green alien (typical 'little green man' looking thing) with its little mouth slightly open making a kind of quiet 'ahh' noise. Everyone started screaming and trying to escape but there was nowhere to go. Then the 'camera' showed it from a side wide shot of it picking people up and eating them and you could hear the crunching. Later, I somehow survived this and was trying to warn people but everyone thought I was crazy. I was telling them 'don't take that path' and not mentioning the alien but they wouldn't listen. This detective guy was after this guy I knew. The detective and I were standing out in front of this house, the street had lots of trees and bushes either side. The detective was staring at something in the trees on the other side and I looked and I could see a blue shirt and realised it was the guy he was after. He took off after him and I ran as well. All three of us were running through the bushes and fairly close. I was exhausted from running. Eventually he caught up with him and we ended up at the harbour, but it was now connected to a hotel/hostel place. The room we got was a shared room, with lots of double beds. People were lining up directly outside the door. The path to the alien was parallel and blocked from view. I whispered to a few people in the queue to not go down there. The door had about 3 locks and I used all of them. We were laying in bed, I think I was sharing with the guy I knew and he was spooning me. Someone looked out the window and I warned them not to in case you saw something you shouldn't. At some point, a guy got set on fire and ran into our door, almost opening it but we all pretended to be asleep and they dealt with him. In the morning, a fire broke out everywhere and people started running everywhere. Our room was on fire, but I grabbed my carry-on suitcase and took my diary, fat little notebook and something else, as well as my phone before I left. I asked where some people went and they said 'down that side' and I was annoyed and said 'I told them specifically to not go down that path!'. People were jumping on the canoes early to get them away from the fire. I saw some people I knew in one and I told them to jump out and not go. The next canoe set off and I saw some more people I knew and Emmanuel and I stopped the canoe and I grabbed Emmanuel and the other people I knew and took them out and pushed the canoe away. I told them there was a giant green alien at the end that will eat you."
"4304"	"(2016-07-15 (25)) It's not very clear, but I remember smoking a cone at some point. Emmanuel and I had gotten closer and there were these pics of him and a girl, and someone asked about them and he said it wasn't serious. We started dating, I think, and had sex at some point."
"4305"	"(2016-07-16 (25)) Hubert had been telling everyone he was gay. I made a joke that I liked him and he said 'I like you' or something and then was trying to say he wasn't gay."
"4306"	"(2016-07-17 (25)) I was looking at the online timetable for next semester and I found a way to switch classes and it put me in the A group. I changed back to our group since I didn't want to leave the group but I wanted the nice timetable."
"4307"	"(2016-07-20 (25)) We were at the Technical College and Reuben was dancing around."
"4308"	"(2016-07-20 (25)) Frederick and I were on holiday or went out somewhere? We visited some people who I think were his extended family. They had lots of kids. I don't think we were dating but we were kind of close. We ate food and hung out there for a bit and then left. He had a Ute and we got into the car. Later I was somewhere else. There was an exercise bike thing which had this long rod bit. I was masturbating with it, like actually inserting it and going back and forth. I got off and some people came and I was trying to get back on it, but subtly and then Reuben noticed and was like 'she's masturbating!' and I was like 'no I'm not'. There was cum all over it like almost dripping."
"4309"	"(2016-07-22 (25)) Laurel and Gordy had a drinking competition. Laurel won and Gordy was jokingly annoyed."
"4310"	"(2016-07-28 (25)) I was at the Technical College and it was still yesterday and some time after my interview. I walked out into the lobby and saw JJ DeCeglie standing outside the front doors, leaning against the wall of the ramp on his phone. I ducked out of sight and found Cecelia and said that he was still here. When I went back out he was inside and saw me and invited me to something tomorrow. It was some really expensive show (like $600 or something). I said I couldn't afford it and didn't really have spare time and he kept saying weird things. I managed to leave briefly and found Cecelia and said he invited me somewhere and she said 'like on a date?' and I said 'I don't know, maybe he's just trying to be friendly' and she went out to speak to him and I was trying to tell her not to. She started saying stuff like to back off and she said something to me like 'stop being so deluded' [as in, people do like you] . Then it started pouring down and was really windy; the rain was also coming inside somehow. JJ went down a tunnel around the corner to go to a carpark and we had to follow as it was the best way to avoid the weather. We were concerned about how we would get back to Good Advice. Later, I was at Good Advice and Gordy was there dancing around."
"4311"	"(2016-07-29 (25)) I can't remember how but there was a maggot tornado. The maggots were quite big (a couple inches long and fat) and would stick their heads into things and stay there or bury themselves inside. They hit a fan and got flung around. Most of them landed well away from me and I hid under my blanket but some landed in my bed. I was squealing and disgusted and someone else helped squeeze them out and throwing them away and I tried to squeeze the area around them because I didn't want to touch them."
"4312"	"(2016-07-29 (25)) I was watching the Big Brother final. Laura looked old and fat and had grey streaks in her hair. When I saw Andy walking down I called out 'Andy!' and he stopped and smiled and I gave him a hug and said he was my favourite or something. As a joke, someone listed these two Asian kids as adopted children for Alex. They were like 4 or something. Then there was a joke/prediction thing where Alex and I were married in the future and Mom was like 'yeah like you'd believe he'd be with her' and I was like 'I don't think he's anything special anyway' but then we did end up together and we still had the kids and we were getting them out of the car to take them somewhere."
"4313"	"(2016-07-29 (25)) I was on some kind of camping trip or something but it was sometimes Big Brother. It was late in the season and I was in there. People were playing pool outside. I was lying on ground reading something and occasionally making comments to myself. I was wearing a skirt or dress and it was tight and short. I had lost my undies so had to keep adjusting myself. Fletcher was also there and I forgot he was still here and he came and lay down next to me and I tried to ignore him. Later we went camping. Cecelia, Marcos and I went to this bridge over fast water and there was a pricier section that look like some fairy land with lots of kids playing. Cecelia find some old screwed up paper from fortune tellers and read them out. A yellow one said 'Izzy Conell' and was like 'you have go tell someone something' and I said Cecelia pre-planned this as prank. Marcos's one said he'd get arrested for drugs."
"4314"	"(2016-07-31 (25)) I had a series of brief and intense dreams which were kind of like hallucinations. I remember one where Tristan and Frederick were arguing and came into my room, still arguing. At another time, Dan Palmer came into my bed and got on top of me and we had sex and I came."
"4315"	"(2016-08-01 (25)) Something had happened and we needed to get away and hide. I was with Frederick and Tristan. We were packing some stuff into a car and Tristan said we'd have to change our identities and go somewhere else. I was annoyed at this. At some point, I thought it was a dream. I tested this by telling Frederick to do something instead of asking him and he did it without complaint. We sat in the backseat and he kept touching my feet with his feet and poking me. I decided I wanted to have sex with him and was trying to think of a way to leave where we were and go off somewhere but then I woke up."
"4316"	"(2016-08-06 (25)) I was out somewhere with Mom, at some kind of shop. There were lots of people. I saw Grayson there and there were a bunch of woman fawning over him and Mom made some comment like 'I heard he was good looking' and I was like 'uh, he's not my type'. Later, I was at home which was like the old house and I was trying to get into the bathroom. I went through the bedroom and the door was like mottled glass and I opened it a little and it was steamy. I saw a glimpse of Mom and Grayson like kissing and they shut the door. I was confused how that had happened."
"4317"	"(2016-08-09 (25)) I can't remember where I was, possibly my house, and I was in a room with Frederick and he wanted to smoke some weed. I was preparing it and he was standing right behind me and I felt nervous about him standing so close but at the same time I was horny and wanted him to grab me, but at the last second I turned and moved and was like 'what are you doing?'. We went into another room to smoke and the blinds were open. I started feeling stoned and a parade was going by so I was trying to close the blinds. Juniper and Claudine walked past and saw us and then came in. I suddenly got angry and yelled at them to leave, screaming 'get ouy of my house!', mostly aimed at Juniper because I didn't want her killing my vibe. Frederick looked confused but shook it off."
"4318"	"(2016-08-15 (25)) I was staying at this hotel type of thing. I had a room down one end but it was open and Nana had a room at the other end. Frederick had a room down the hall and we were dating or sleeping together or going to. I was waiting for him and went to his room to see what he was doing. He had to do something first. I was glad Nana's room was on the other side in case anything happened."
"4319"	"(2016-08-23 (25)) Dan Palmer replied to a comment that Cecelia left on a status of mine on Facebook and started referring to me as 'Cecelia's friend' and was obviously interested in her and I was annoyed."
"4320"	"(2016-08-24 (25)) I was reading about Halloween costumes. Mom and Darren were talking and I hid under this table and when Darren came near by, I jumped up to scare him but he didn't really get scared. Later I was somewhere else and I was talking to a friend, a black girl, about Grey's Anatomy and I was saying that George was my favourite character and I lost interest around the time they killed him off and I said they got rid of all the characters I liked and said 'they got rid of the black guy - wait sorry that's racist' and she laughed and I was like 'what's his name? Isaiah Washington'. I was somewhere with Frederick and someone else. Another person wanted to do some experiment and we cut up this meat loaf. I don't remember what we did with it. Then we got in Frederick's car and I was in the back and we drove to Nana's, which was different. I left my water bottle in the car because I thought we wouldn't be long. I went in and saw Poppa and I said 'hi Poppa'. He asked if we wanted stuff to drink and Nana said 'Izzy always brings a water bottle' and I said 'I left it in the car, but now I'm thirsty'."

"4322"	"(2016-09-01 (25)) I put this griptape thing in my mouth while I did something else but I coughed and it scratched the top of my mouth. I could taste blood and I looked in the mirror and there was a cut at the top/back of my throat and it was dripping down the back of my throat. I gargled some water and it felt like I was drowning and couldn't breathe. I spat it out and the water was red. I did it another two times and it was still bleeding and kept going down my throat. I woke up feeling like I was drowning [I was thirsty] ."
"4323"	"(2016-09-01 (25)) I lived in an apartment thing at a train station. There were lots of underground stations and they all had huge apartment complexes. I was living with Frederick and Tristan and not sure if there was anyone else. We were still moving our stuff in. Some people were visiting. I went to my room and it was huge and my bed was near a window. The curtain was closed but was see through-ish. I didn't know if people could see in. I started humping a pillow, riding it quite hard and looked out the window to make sure no one could see. I was thinking about Frederick and having sex with him and I came, then I got up to do other things."
"4324"	"(2016-09-05 (25)) I was in an elevator and when it opened the lights were flickering and it looked like a creepy hospital. I thought it had to be a dream and could see something convulsing just around the corner. I went to flick the light switch to check if it was a dream and then the convulsing thing was Tristan and he looked up at me but his features all started melting into his face so it looked like he had no face. I was scared and was like 'definitely a dream' and said 'no I don't like this' and he started coming towards me and I shut my eyes and tried to breathe and wake myself up, which I did."
"4325"	"(2016-09-06 (25)) I was on a travel job or something and Frederick was there too. I walked into the hotel room and Frederick was masturbating in bed, but like under the covers and on his knees bent over as if he were on top of someone. He said something like 'good you're here' and motioned for me to get in. I climbed in and took my pants off and he seemed ready to come at any second. He reached down and put like his whole fist inside me and it didn't hurt, but didn't feel good either, it was just weird. He did this for a bit and then went inside me and came. Later, we were somewhere with Cecelia and Emmanuel. I was with Cecelia and heard him telling Emmanuel that we'd had sex. Emmanuel hit something and was clearly annoyed and said something like 'she's a teenager, you don't even know her'. I said to Cecelia 'I'm 25, not 16' and giggled. I also told Mom at some point and I was on my phone on this site and there was a video of it. It was very rough sex and it showed him doing me from behind and then me getting up and wiping myself and throwing the mess away, looking disgusted and in pain. Then there was another video from the front and it seemed even rougher and more painful than before. I was like 'I don't remember it being that bad'. I was on a site to look for friends with benefits because I missed having him in my bed."
"4326"	"(2016-09-09 (25)) I was staying in some hotel thing where you could pay to have a guy keep you company and maybe sex (implied) and I was considering it. Later I was with others in a crowd sitting down watching something. I was with Cecelia. Fletcher came and sat next to Cecelia and she talked to him. I felt uncomfortable. We went to this room which was Frederick's room I think and was where we'd had sex. When Fletcher was gone I started laughing saying 'imagine if he knew'. Later Frederick and I finally talked and he sent me a big message saying that I was being needy and he was being clingy. And that he felt like we couldn't date because I didn't want kids and if I did decide to have them I would let weed get in the way and if I protested 'well you're told other things are good for you and you don't do those'. And also that I would let my weight get in the way because I had issues with it, and was worried that I'd never believe he didn't care about it. I was like 'um' and started to write a message about how I didn't want to date him, I just wanted sex and that if I did have kids I'd be responsible and that my weight didn't matter that night so why would it be an issue for me later."
"4327"	"(2016-09-09 (25)) We were having a party. Our house was very big and had multiple storeys. My room was massive and had seating in there and a big bed. Lots of people showed up, around 100. I went into my room at one point and saw a bunch of people sitting around and I coughed and then told everyone to get out and that no one was allowed in my room. I went out into the hall and this guy around 40-50 was there and put his around around my shoulders and was showing me something. He was clearly drunk. He pulled me close and his stubble scratched my face and he kissed me on the cheek as I squirmed to get away. I had to deliver something and there was a tunnel that was part of the Science Museum that went to where I needed to go. It was free to walk through but was underground and took about an hour or so. I got to this house and sat outside with my stuff and was writing/drawing/reading something and Granma came out, chipper, and asked if I was coming inside. I said I just wanted to finish this off first and she happily said ok and went back inside."
"4328"	"(2016-09-10 (25)) A bunch of us were staying at this hotel thing which was also like a themed fair. It was cottage like and old timey/fairytale like. The rooms were very big and there was like one person per room even though my room had like four double beds. Lots of people were there hiding from something. Some of us were hanging out in a room. Mom and Frederick were there and on the opposite side of the room. She came up to me later and was subtly asking if I wanted to talk about it and I said 'I don't know what you're talking about' and she was like 'he told me'. Out of embarrassment and annoyance, my eyes welled up a bit and she was crying a bit out of sympathy. I 'yelled' saying 'I don't want to talk about it. I don't want you to know about it'. She said 'you should tell me these things' and I said no. She said 'he said he doesn't feel the same way you do' and I said 'how do I feel?' And she said 'well you like him a little bit' and I said 'no I don't'. I left and went to my room and messaged Frederick on my computer asking why he told her but every time I went to type the words would change. I realized I had a virus and it was this program which would predict your text incorrectly (and change words written correctly). I went on my phone and messaged him properly. He said 'all I did was play some of Bohemian Rhapsody and [a song that was called something like I Want It or I Want You To Know] ' and I assumed she had deduced from that and the awkwardness. Later the things we were hiding from found us. They were like magic, there were possessed skeletons and zombies and disappearing ghost things. Everyone started running out of their rooms and fighting them and running away and I was trying to escape."
"4329"	"(2016-09-12 (25)) I was in London and my flight was tonight. I was at the airport but hadn't checked in yet. I couldn't remember what time my flight was and I thought maybe 9.30pm or 11.30pm. I had almost 20 jobs for the next week and also realized I wouldn't be back for Good Advice. It was nearly 9.30 and I'd lost track of time so I tried to check the flight time as I ran through the airport. I was trying to check in online as well but I was having trouble finding the page. I ran past a plane about to close and somehow realised it was mine and I said 'please wait 10 mins' and the lady said 'you have 15 mins until we close the doors'. I ran to front of airport to check in but knew I wouldn't make it in time."
"4330"	"(2016-09-12 (25)) I was talking to Frederick about things but it was in front of others, I think, so we were doing it subtly. He said something like 'if you like the cuddling in bed it can start up again soon. But don't have any expectations. This kind of thing can create 'fairytale feelings'.' Which I took as him saying we're not dating, this is just for fun, and I tried to signal that I agreed."
"4331"	"(2016-09-13 (25)) Frederick had a party with his family for something. I was looking at the pics on Facebook and I saw he was friends with Acquaintance-F-03 again and that they were back together. I messaged Tristan about it and was annoyed and upset."
"4332"	"(2016-09-14 (25)) Frederick was going away for a bit and we had sex on this mattress on the floor that was in this little nook area. Some time later I was sitting on there with Cecelia and we started kissing. She lay on top of me and she was really light and I asked if that was all her weight and she said yes. I said Frederick was so heavy. We kissed for a bit and then we sat up again and I fingered her. We didn't go any further than that and just hung out. Later, Frederick was back. His hair was different, like it was last year. He came up to me and was putting his arm around my back and shoulders and flirting with me. Cecelia said 'he's just teasing you, don't let him'. I knew he was but I wanted him to."
"4333"	"(2016-09-15 (25)) I was at home, which was different. We were sitting in the lounge room which had a window to the driveway on the left and in front of us was the front door. I was telling them how I would stay at home and look through the gap in the curtains and not answer the door. Then someone came to the door and I hid. Frederick answered and it was someone from GBCS asking for 50c for parking. We gave them the money and they left."
"4334"	"(2016-09-15 (25)) I was somewhere where I shouldn't have been and was trying to get out. I snuck into the front passenger seat of this car and hid on the floor. Brock got in the driver's seat and was talking to the 'owner' who was Frederick and I was trying to signal to Brock to not give me away, but he didn't even look at me. I realized that he was doing it to not give me away. The parking was underground and he had to drive upstairs, get out to get a key and come back to drive out. I had to get out at the first stop and I waited for a while and walked out. There were lots of people but I didn't see Frederick. I went outside and saw Brock's car pulled up on the side of the road. It was in like a city, it was day and overcast (or at least, it was very grey). His car was kind of like a ranger car and was light grey. I got in and as I did realized it was a dream. I said to Brock 'what are you doing' and I can't remember his reply but implied I would know. I reached over and ruffled his hair and was thinking we should have sex. He made a joke about the fact that the scene didn't change and that 'even my subconscious was rejecting me' and we both laughed and I said 'I can't even get laid in my dreams'. Then I kind of woke up but was in sleep paralysis. I heard Tristan and Frederick talking in my room and then it sounded as if Frederick was masturbating. I could hear the squelchy sounds and then I felt something warm land on my leg. Then I felt someone come close to my face and could feel the hot air from breathing on my face and they started sniffing me. My first thought was that Frederick was going to kiss me and then that maybe it was a dog. I was scared and tried to scream but I couldn't open my mouth or my eyes. I could see the veins in my eyelids pounding and all I could hear was this screech from my blood pumping. I slowly controlled my breathing and woke myself up."
"4335"	"(2016-09-16 (25)) I was at this small shopping center with someone and we went to this hairdresser's because the person I was with knew the lady there. She was saying how she owned the place and didn't want to anymore and I said I'd like to own a store but wouldn't know what to do. Then I went to some people's house. There was this fat oldish guy who I knew and a lady friend of his. I was there to have sex with him. It was some game we had where I had to do everything they said. I was lying on the bed naked and he fingered me while the lady watched. Then he got naked and his penis was small. He lay on the bed and told me to get on top of him so I did and we had sex. Afterwards I sat on a chair and he was doing my hair, using a sieve to straighten the top of the hair and leave the rest curly. He said 'what about we dye your hair red' and I said no and he said 'but you have to' and I said yeah but that's permanent. Later the lady and another guy went into a bedroom to have sex. He was better looking and younger and I was slightly jealous. They left the door slightly open and I was watching while touching myself."
"4336"	"(2016-09-16 (25)) I went to this small cinema to see some horror film. Dan Palmer was there and he sat next to the guy next to me and waved hello. His hair was longish and scruffy. He saw some people he knew afterwards and went to talk and sit with them. I moved seats and someone voted for the next movie which was called Suicide Tattoo. I hadn't seen it but had heard of it. I moved to the front row but there were lights that annoyed me and it was hurting my neck so I moved to the back where Dan Palmer was. It was too far from the screen so I moved forward."
"4337"	"(2016-09-17 (25)) Our house was different. It was small and like an apartment and there were no windows. We had built a second entrance in Emmanuel's room as he had a bottom level to his room. I was sitting on Emmanuel's bed with him and we had been messing around with the video camera. I think I made a suggestion to have sex and he kissed me and fondled my boob and then we had sex. I was thinking it probably wasn't a good idea because now I'd slept with two of my housemates. I didn't feel weird around him though and I assumed it was because I was closer with Frederick and there hadn't been any build up with Emmanuel. Later we all went somewhere with the video camera. It was like a school but it was maze-like and there had been a zombie apocalypse or something, so it was a mess and there were dead bodies everywhere. I was with Tristan, Frederick and Emmanuel. We were looting and going through these lockers. When I was alone with Tristan I told him I slept with Emmanuel and he took it ok but seemed worried about it and said to not tell Frederick. We got to this area with a huge pile of bodies and chocolate. I was grabbing chocolate - lots of Snickers and Twirls and I got a Time Out too. I was getting them carefully in case any of the bodies were alive. When someone else went to get some, a hand twitched and they stabbed it. We were somewhere with a TV and were watching the video camera recordings in fast forward with a bunch of people. It was VHS quality. I said maybe we should skip a few scenes and they were like why and I signalled to Emmanuel, who was in charge of the controls, and he realised it was because we'd filmed the sex. I stood in front of the TV and he distracted people as our one played. No one noticed except one guy and he said he wouldn't say anything. Later we were still scavenging at the school and Emmanuel was saying how he had told someone about us having sex and they hadn't believed him and said something like 'why would Izzy sleep with Silas' and Frederick was right behind him and clearly heard. He didn't say anything though."
"4338"	"(2016-09-19 (25)) I think I was at the Technical College which was different. I was in this building with a young boy and girl who were brother and sister (around 5/6 years old). The boy's left eye was fake.  Some kind of fight/war started happening and we shut the curtains and closed the door to hide. We saw people getting rounded up outside. We heard them coming into the building and ran upstairs. We had to jump out of a window and I went first. They jumped next and the girl landed on the spiky stuff that goes on fences which was all over the ground. The boy hurt himself landing and his fake eye started coming out so he took it out and gave it to his sister to look after. There was a gap between buildings and I looked and saw soldiers. We waited for a bit and looked again and no one was looking this way so we ran across. Later I was by myself and snuck into this massive house. I hid in a room and some of my clothes were there. Some other people came to hide too, one was a gay dude and he saw the closet of the guy who lived there and it was really flamboyant and he wanted it. The guy (who was quite old) caught him later and I hid in the cupboard and the gay guy had sex with him to distract him. The wife came home later and we snuck out and left."
"4339"	"(2016-10-02 (25)) I was really horny and messaging people off Craigslist for sex. Eventually I went over to some guy's house and had sex with him. The next day I was at home (I think, it was completely different), sitting with Tristan, Frederick and a guy that I think was a close friend or family member of Frederick's. He said something suggesting Frederick should sleep with me and Frederick said 'I don't want to sleep with her, I've tried but she's unresponsive'. The guy said something like 'I don't know, sometimes you don't even take your shoes off' (ie, you don't try very hard) and I looked away, blushing. I was talking to Frederick later trying to suggest I was interested and wondering whether to tell him that I slept with someone else. There was a Facebook chat with me, Bryce and Percy. Some guy joined it somehow getting it from like Craigslist and was saying sex things to me. I deleted the guy and then Percy and Bryce."
"4340"	"(2016-10-05 (25)) I was in editing class which had us sitting at desks and the teacher was some guy with curly blonde hair who looked out of the 70s. He was showing some weird program to everyone and I was like just 'what the hell is this'. He came up to me after and said he'd show me since I'd been away. After class I saw him a while later and had to go back to class - he gave me keys then said he'd have to come because he had stuff in his bag. It was locked off like a mall, we went in and got some stuff and left. Then there was this game where you had to balance these life support systems and I accidentally changed something and a ton of people died. Then it was real life and someone had managed to save this baby before it died. They put it in this cylindrical thing and its face went green and got really big and it was like a zombie mutant baby but it started talking in this deep voice and was like 'possessed' or something. Later I was at dinner with Tristan at his sisters' place and Floyd was making jokes with me, there was some joke about pancakes. And his girlfriend (different) was talking about plucking her cheeks and something else and I was like what why and Floyd was like 'see she's smart' (because I didn't do it or care). Later Tristan said he was flirting with me and that the pancake joke was some inside thing, like a dig at his girlfriend. I was like 'he wasn't flirting' and Tristan just gave me a look. Later I went to this room which was basically a big mattress on the floor. Frederick came in and was having problems turning off the lights and was joking around and being his normal self. He turned the lights off and I said 'are you getting in?' And he said 'no... I'm just going to cuddle up to you' as he got in and lay behind me right up close with his arm around me and I liked it and had missed it."
"4341"	"(2016-10-08 (25)) I was out the back and the back fence was so slow we could see the neighbour. We were making jokes about something and I made a joke with a black accent saying 'I'm a strong independent woman' and the neighbour, who was a black lady, started having a go at us for being racist. I yelled back saying I could've been doing a New York gangster accent and no-one would consider that racist."
"4342"	"(2016-10-10 (25)) My room was slightly different and my mattress was coming out from the window facing the mirrors. Frederick was lying in bed and making jokes. I was in the bathroom and there were these big poodles that kept disappearing and we were trying to find them."
"4343"	"(2016-10-12 (25)) Tristan was telling me about Floyd's brother who was called Mark and said he was just like him. He was coming over and he was fat and ugly with a weird face. Frederick and Emmanuel were also there. We went to this fair place and I went on this ride and then a guy with a kid ride asked me to go on it to test something so I did. Some little girl also went on a ride but didn't put the safety thing on and it started and they saw she was still standing and not sitting and quickly shut it down. I went past McDonald's with someone and got a chicken aioli wrap."
"4344"	"(2016-10-17 (25)) We were staying at some resort near the beach with a pool. Lots of people we knew were there. I was in a group chat on a dating site with a bunch of people and someone said that last night Frederick had bought presents for, and gone home with, this 55 year old lady. I was very angry and upset. I posted 'he didn't even get me a present'. We were then home and I had to leave and I opened his door and he was sitting on his bed and I shouted 'you suck!' and left. Bryce came out of the house asking for a lift but I was so angry I didn't notice and got in my car and took off down the street. Then I remembered Bryce and went back for him. I dropped him off home and went inside. It was like a weird apartment in the jungle. His mother was weird but nice. I was then back at the resort. Someone called Izzy on another chat said 'I almost slept with Frederick' a few days ago. I replied 'I don't know who you are Izzy, but don't sleep with Frederick. It will ruin your friendship'. He was in the chat too but I didn't care. It was almost evening and I wanted to go for a swim. My pants had gotten wet and were hard to take off. I took off my shirt too. I was looking through my cupboards for my bathers but couldn't find them anywhere. I stepped out of the cupboard and noticed my door was open and a guy was looking that way. We both screamed and I covered up and then we laughed. I shut the door and put a shirt on but peeked through it and said I didn't realize it was open. Frederick came and was like 'I wanna see' and was being his usual flirty self. He walked away and came back and sat on this chair. I thought he looked skinnier. Then I closed the door and turned around and Frederick and another guy were in my room. I said 'how did you get in here?' and Frederick was just giggling. I looked back out the door and he was still sitting there and I was confused. Then he stood up and they said it was someone else with prosthetics but it looked just like him. I joked 'I thought you looked skinnier'."
"4345"	"(2016-10-19 (25)) I was at home and Circe was over. She asked me to do something like give a warning before I did something or whatever. I agreed. Tristan also said Frederick had taken one of his condoms and I asked why and he said 'some joke with Dolores'. Then I saw Dolores was over and she was sitting on a lounge and giggling on her phone. I saw she was talking to Frederick and I lost it and started screaming at her saying 'STOP TALKING TO HIM!'. Then I woke up within the dream. I told Tristan I dreamt that I screamed at Dolores. Later Circe, Tristan and Frederick were walking in a line through the house and Dolores was at the end. I started feeling angry immediately and I said 'Tristan, I'm getting angry' and he said that he could tell. And I said 'no I mean get her out of here now'. She started going, confused, and said something like 'as long as Frederick's friendship is true' and I screamed 'it's not! The same thing happened to me!' And she kind of ran out the house and I followed her, crying and screaming and was saying 'it's not your fault, it's Frederick's!' And she was like 'I don't know what the problem is' and I said 'he slept with me and then treated me like a stranger' and she stopped and turned around and asked why it mattered. I said 'it was my first time, he was my closest friend. Now he doesn't talk to me and he's doing the same thing with you' she asked 'do you like him like 'Facebook like' him?' And I said no and then she was cheerful and skipped away. I was upset because I assumed this meant she liked him and where things were going. I went back inside and Frederick was lying on the floor talking to Tristan. He asked me a question and I poured this jug of water at him. Then I threw a glass bowl at him. It didn't smash properly. He got up and was trying to calm me down and I kept throwing glass things and heavy things at him."
"4346"	"(2016-10-24 (25)) We were at the Technical College waiting around in a hallway. I saw Fernando come out of a room and he was surrounded by smoke and carrying a bong. I was like 'you're smoking at school?' And I went in and he had this jar of weed, but it was like thin strips of asparagus with different colours on the end and I said I'd never seen anything like it. I got my weed out of my bag and walked back in to show him. A lady teacher came in and saw us and walked back out. Later I saw Tristan at his work, which was this desk job thing and he said that he was banned from the Technical College and no one would hire him. He told me that they told him it was for failing a class and that I was probably going to get the same thing and I was worried and dreading the call."
"4347"	"(2016-11-01 (25)) We went to Ms Nowak's class which was in this big lecture theatre. It was only some of the class. At the front were a list of shows and movies and other categories. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Young Ones were there and I said 'no one pick my favourite movie'. Ms Nowak said she knew I'd say that and had made a decision about groups. Bryce was in class and we all had green wristbands. The rest of the people came in and most had red bands, including Tristan and Frederick. I was annoyed she'd separated me and Tristan. We all got paired up with someone and attached to them. Justus and Frederick were together. Marcos was with someone else. We had to do some project together. I was avoiding Frederick but kept looking at him and missed him."
"4348"	"(2016-11-07 (25)) Frederick and I slept together again and we had sex three times in one night."
"4349"	"(2016-11-21 (25)) Dad had bought this huge house and we were living there. My room was very big and was furnished. The house had obviously been renovated as you could see markings of where things were before. I went to lock my door and there were two doors before it and doors to other halls. I also had a toilet right next to my room. I was masturbating on the bed but heard Tristan and others and stopped and just curled up as if I was sleeping. There was a window in my room facing the hall so people could see in and I'd missed it. Then I heard Tristan's voice closer and I opened my eyes and he was in my room and I was like how did you get in here and there was another door leading in. I said I had to lock it and a girl he was with went and got a key to lock it. Later we were sitting around with some people and Frederick put his arm across my chest and I looked at him and we caught eyes and I could tell he wanted to have sex, so we got up to find somewhere and I was like 'I have been waiting for this for ages!' and I was so excited and horny, but then I woke up."
"4350"	"(2016-11-26 (25)) I was watching a movie which was from a few years ago and had Oscar Isaac in it playing this cool ladies man. He was clean shaven and looked younger. He had a sister played by this unknown actress and she was at his house/apartment. Sometimes I was her. They had chemistry and were talking in the kitchen and he made a move on her and she went with it. They were in this spa together naked and were high and she had her legs up with her boobs visible and he was eating her out and she was like 'this is the greatest thing'. The next morning they were kind of weird and she was like we shouldn't have done that and he was like why not it was good. Then like later I was at this house and a creepy guy came to the door and had a sign saying like he would steal one thing in exchange for something like a wish. This young girl let him in and grabbed this kitten and said he could have anything else and he took the 'custard' and then all the food in the house with custard in it disappeared (and it was like a lot). Then it was the movie and I was this cop or detective and we were watching Oscar Isaac. At some point he was getting ready and I was there and he put this green/emerald ring on his second finger and changed his mind and got this gold one and then chucked them off and said no rings. Then we were following at a distance through this shop. A lady bumped me and asked me a question and I kept walking and realized my phone wasn't in my pocket. I ran back and found the lady and she admitted she stole it immediately and gave it back. I kept running through the shop but my phone disappeared again and I was annoyed so gave up. Ezra also messaged me saying like 'uh we did it' and I was like what and he said that he got reminded of something and he said we'd had sex and I said we didn't. I said 'either I've wiped the memory from my mind or it didn't happen' and I couldn't imagine it happening because I had no interest."
"4351"	"(2016-12-01 (25)) Sometimes it was me and sometimes it wasn't, but I had this room which was like a fully contained flat and it was connected to this backyard which was fenced in. I was thinking that it would be a good location for a zombie film and have it all be based in that room/yard with the character not seeing anything beyond the fence. Then it was night and I was standing at my door and suddenly sirens sounded off and there were these red flashing lights and the fences were all closed off and extended higher. I was confused and then this kind of medical team came running in and ran up to me to test me and there had been a zombie outbreak. I ended up leaving and was somewhere else. The zombies were fast and when you were infected you changed within seconds. I was with some other people and this lady got bit and I looked around for a weapon and stabbed her in the heart, which was difficult. Everyone screamed at me not to but she had already started changing when I killed her. There were a couple of guys I was interested in and I was wondering if I should make a move. A young Stephen Merchant was there (looking like he did in Extras) and I really wanted to get with him. Topher (Dollhouse) was also there and he had a crush on me and everyone knew but I wasn't that interested in him, though I thought he was ok and would go for him at a last resort. I was trying to get in the room to talk to Stephen Merchant but there was suddenly an emergency and we all had to run."
"4352"	"(2016-12-03 (25)) I had moved into this huge house that was the same rent as here ($395 a week). I was looking for other people to move in because I could barely afford it on my own. There were three floors and I had chosen this big room with an ensuite as my room. There was also a kitchen per floor and about 10 rooms. There was another big room near the kitchen and also a smaller L-shaped room. I was trying to convince Tristan and Frederick to move in there and help find others but they didn't really want to. My room also had a door to this outside area with a private pool and spa. I was there by myself and I looked outside and saw a door was open and I was scared someone had broken in. I heard noises and realized there were people in the house. I locked my door and hid and told Tristan and Frederick to come over and help scare them off."
