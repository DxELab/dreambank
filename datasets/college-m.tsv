"051-1"	"#051-1 ""My wife to be"" and I were in a store. Apparently the store was near the water because I kept on trying to convince her to drive the boat while I went skiing. She claimed it was too cold to ski. Besides she had to buy snap-together funnels at the store near the water. In the store she was wearing only a towel, and I was holding the towel on her for a while so that she could look for funnels. She passed up quite a few funnels until she got to the snap-together ones. Finaly I got to go waterskiing, but it wasn't my ""wife to be"" driving the boat. It was my sister. But before my sister took me waterskiing, back in the store with my wife, after she bought the funnels we moved onto a different area of the store. We came across a table. On that table were the workout gloves (2 pair) one mine, one my sister's, that she and I had lost in real life. In the dream they were new and didn't have all the holes and stuff in them as they did when we lost them. I told my ""wife to be"" about how comfortable the gloves were and where the holes were and how they fit and how I wish I still had those gloves. I remember hoping that my ""wife to be"" would get the hint and buy the gloves for me for Christmas."
"051-2"	"#051-2 Real life: My friends and I just bought an eight-track recorder so that the band I'm in could record some songs. Dream: I get home from school one day and these two kids, kids that I know I've seen at Suffolk but don't really know or talk to, are down in my basement. They are playing with the new eight-track recorder. I was worried that they were going to break it. I went upstairs for something and when I came downstairs one of these kids told me he had to use my bathroom. For some reason all the lights were out and my basement seemed distorted. When we finally found the bathroom after some difficulty, I went into the bathroom and, this is disgusting, but I vomited through my nose. Then the dream ended."
"051-3"	"#051-3 My friends and I went into a cave and dug up some sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, and we threw some of them at a cat but they landed on a washing machine that was across the street in a laundromat. Then we went to a woman's house.(The woman was in my science lab last year in real life. I had asked her out but she said no.) We went into her basement, my friends and I, and turned on the TV. Home Improvement was on, which is the only show I'll watch on occasion. But I wasn't paying attention to the show all the time. I was wondering how I was going to ask her out again. Then the dream ended."
"051-4"	"#051-4 I have to bring up a recurring dream because it has great significance to the dream I had this week: dream #5. It always starts the same way. I walk down the stairs in my house and out the front door. I walk into the street and I always turn left. I lift my arms up to be perpendicular to my body and wait. Soon a big wind comes by and lifts me up. At first I am nervous. I am afraid of falling. I have no control over what I'm doing and the wind takes me where it wants. If the wind dies down I begin to fall or a large breeze makes me move quickly through the air and I get nervous. But soon I get comfortable with flying and I can turn in any direction I want. The wind dies down less often. I go higher and higher, often I get scared and come down a bit, but when the fear leaves I go higher than I previously was. Eventually I get the hang of flying and am comfortable with it, but I still feel as though somehow I'm missing something. Once I get the hang of flying I often realize that I've got no place to fly to. The dream ends with me kind of floating around aimlessly. I've had dreams along the lines of this one many many times."
"052-1"	"#052-1 In this dream I found myself on a type of spaceship. The inside looked like the starship Enterprise. This is strange because I really don't like Star Trek. For some reason a door is sliding open and closed, and I am shooting a laser at the opposite wall trying to hit two blinking discs. The laser I'm using isn't working so I switch to something stronger. The first beam was a red beam and this one is now a yellow one. I finally hit one and go out into the hall, walk a little way and enter a room with a sliding door. There is a girl dressed as I am, in some kind of uniform. The girl is someone I know from high school. I can't really remember what made me shoot but I did. The laser hit her in the foot taking a big chunk out. I remember seeing the chunk missing in graphic detail. I remember feeling ashamed I shot her and sad also. That was the end of the dream.    "
"052-2"	"#052-2 The only thing I remember about this dream is a jar of Guklins mustard rotating by my face. In the dream I don't know who threw it, but it was passing by my face in slow motion. The mustard was going so slowly I could read the label and see the brown specks in it. I could also see how the mustard shifted inside the jar as it rotated."
"052-3"	"#052-3 This dream was during a nap, taken after Thanksgiving dinner. In my dream I awaken on the bed to find my sister's cat hitting me in the face with his paw. He is not using his claws but I'm so tired I can't move. The cat keeps disappearing under the bed and then attacking. Then he comes up and hits me but has his claws out and scratches my cheek. I awoke and did not know it was a dream until I looked at myself in the mirror and had no scratches."
"052-4"	"#052-4 In this dream I am lost in a jungle and am walking along when I see this huge object. The object looks like the side of a bloated tick or the side of a huge gray submarine. This object is towering over the trees. I remember feeling afraid of it but going closer anyway. When I am close to it the side splits vertically. A huge elephant comes running out at me. I get out of the way and proceed to watch all sorts of wild animals run through. I think I walked through the split after the animals went through and I'm in my old hgh school. I can see myself screaming at my ex-girlfriend for something, which I have never done. I remember seeing all my friends but they were just staring into space."
"053-1"	"#053-1 I have an acquaintance, Mark, who offered me a job which I declined. He turned out to be very respectable and has a clear perspective on many issues we are both interested in. I don't know him too well but consider him to be a reliable and trustworthy friend. Through the course of our discussions he has made mention of his homosexuality. I know very few gay men, and have not an iota of respect for the majority of them. Mark is different, in my perspective, though. I had this dream, last night, though. I was meeting Mark and we decided, mutually, to meet at his house. He opened the door wearing a very feminine fake-silk robe with a chiffon collar. This didn't scare me; it pissed me off. I controlled my anger and told him, forthright, that I didn't find his attire appropriate to the occasion, which was just a social meeting to talk about current happenings in our lives -- specifically, his lover just left him, and my lover, who is a heterosexual female to compliment my heterosexual maleness has recently left me. I told him, straightforth, that I was not going to have sex with him . . . ""So go change your clothes, or I'll be leaving and we can keep things between us on a professional level."" End of dream."
"053-2"	"#053-2 I dreamed that I was laying alone in bed, rousting from a nap, to find that I had a split in the skin underneath my left nipple. It was not bleeding but it was tender and painful. So, for some damned reason, I slowly pulled it off. It totally weirded me out and I woke up. Odd, eh?"
"053-3"	"#053-3 I dreamt that I woke up next to my girlfriend (which is not altogether unusual, as we spend most nights together), or rather, my former girlfriend as we have broken up but still sleep together. Sounds odd, I know, but it seems to work for us. So I woke up and noticed how pretty she is (I commented on this to myself in the dream) and just kept looking. I was feeling her side, just above her hips, (which I also found to be beautiful and commented to myself accordingly). I kissed her shoulder and her neck just below the ear and climbed out of bed to smoke a cigarette. Next thing I know I am dressed and smoking and taking a leak into the toilet. I go back to the bedroom because it is warm in there and I felt very cold in the rest of the apartment. Her alarm goes off, she climbs out of bed and I turn off the alarm, also a ritual. I get undressed and go back to sleep while she goes to shower. She comes back wet and climbs into bed and puts her arms around me. She is very warm although I feel cold from somewhere. Then she is gone and the bed is wet and cold but I stay and I am shivering. I notice someone else in the room. I don't know who it is but it is sexually exciting. Next thing I know I am awake and my friend/girlfriend is happy to see me and I am happy to see her. This still in the dream but I don't remember anymore."
"053-4"	"#053-4 My last dream was that I was walking around the city, in and near the neighborhood I live in, in a rainstorm very late at night. I was warm and only wearing a T-shirt and jeans. I was alone. I mean there was no one around and (this is funny) no cars on the streets, passing or parked. There were no cars. So I was walking up Charles Street and the next thing I know I am walking into this dead end of a street also on Beacon Hill. Three guys jump me and I fight back. They say, ""Give us your wallet."" I say, ""I'll give you just the money,"" and they say, ""Give us your leg."" I use a fake leg for walking (not just in the dream, real life, too). I say no. They end up beating me real good but they, in the end, don't get the leg. End of dream."
"054-1"	"#054-1 I had a dream that a friend and I were in a local Stop and Shop. The store was giving away all the products in refrigeration section free. The store's refrigeration units were not functioning properly. I remember smelling everything I took to make sure it had not spoiled. I took lots of dairy products such as milk, yogurt, cream cheese and ice cream. The store was extremely crowded but my friend and I took what we wanted. Then I woke up."
"054-2"	"#054-2 I had a dream I went to a store and when I came out I saw some teenage boys in the lot. They were running around the cars like they were wild animals. All of a sudden two of them ran across my car from the hood to the trunk. My hood had a huge dent in it and they cracked my moonroof. I ran after them and they came and saw the damage they had caused to my car. While they were at my car a police car drove by. I told them to come over and they did. They told the boys they should pay for what they had done. The boys agreed to setup a payment plan with me to pay for the damage. I can remember putting a trash bag over the moonroof to prevent leaking of rain into the car. I called the boys to ask them when they would give me the money. Then I woke up."
"054-3"	"#054-3 I had a dream that I was on the subway on my way to Suffolk. On the train I saw a friend that I have not seen in about a year. We started to talk but I can't recall about what. We finally came to the station,. When we got to the street he walked a different way. I followed him and continued to talk to him. Finally when I realized how I was so far off track I told him I had to go to school. He was going for a job interview. Then I woke up."
"054-4"	"#054-4 I had a dream that I was younger. I was over at a friend's house during the summer. We (people I used to be friendly with) were playing gin by the pool. I remember that I wanted to go home. I kept looking at my watch. I saw on my watch that I did not have to stay much longer. They did not want me to leave because they could not continue to play gin. I wanted to go home but I did not want to say it to them. Then my alarm went off. I got out of that situation."
"055-1"	"#055-1 My first dream occurred the 17th of November. Although it was not as scary as previous ones, it was very confusing. The first recall was my grandmother's house in Venezuela. I think the family was having a party for whatever the reason. The confusing part is when I bump into my friends (high school friends) from Miami. I felt guilty when seeing them because I did not invite any of them to my sister's wedding last August, 1992. (My reasons for not inviting them included inconsideration and neglect from them., e.g., every time I was in Miami for the holidays/vacations, I would call them to make plans. Unfortunately, they had their excuses and/or made plans with me but never followed up on them. During my grandmother's party they neglected me again and would not even look at me. Suddenly my dream shifts from those high school friends to one kid named Joey Levy. During my sixth and seventh grade years, this kid became my so-called friend. His mother and my father attended high school in Venezuela years ago. The Levys also lived in Miami and therefore gave Joey and me a reason to become friends. Joey was the cynical, sarcastic kid who I hated. Through Joey, I was able to meet his two friends, Mark Cedar and Maurice Gabay. The one thing we had in common was soccer. We played for ""K-Land."" They played in the 71-A team while I played on the 70-B team. They were better athletes than I was. I therefore always envied them. Anyway, the friendship between these three guys and myself soon disappeared after my Bar-Mitzvah. I took the big initiative not to invite Mark Cedar (because I didn't like the way he treated me in camp the previous summer. I was hurt and angry at him.) This was a big soap opera during those years. Afterwards, Joey would make me feel guilty for not inviting Mark. Back at my grandmother's, Joey had clearly changed. He was no longer the pain-in-the-butt, sarcastic rascal. He went to Israel after high school and came back a pot-smoking liberal. I actually felt comfortable with him for once. However, he did seem depressed for reasons unknown. He told me that Mark received a tennis scholarship to Frostburg State University in Maryland. Similarly, Maurice received a soccer scholarship to Florida State where he was the leading scorer and star of the team."
"055-2"	"#055-2 My second dream included one of my biggest fears: sharks. I can only remember few details and therefore the end of the dream is quite distorted. The setting takes place on the water. I was accompanied by a ""mother-figure"" in her late thirties. Also, there were approximately four kids with us. The scary part occurs when a shark (the same shark from ""Jaws"" the movie) eats one of the kids. The rest of us jump on the closest dock for our protection and safety. The setting suddenly shifts from the dock to the cafeteria of Camp Shalom. (I attended Camp Shalom when I was a youngster.) There were townspeople from Orange Springs, Florida in the cafeteria when we arrived. It turns out that the townspeople knew about our tragedy but refused to believe us. I responded in an angry and anxious manner and then I woke up."
"055-3"	"#055-3 This dream occurred on December 7. The topic was a phone call I was going to make on December 20. One of my buddies from Maryland is getting married on December 19, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Unfortunately, I cannot attend the wedding because I will be flying down to Miami the next day from Boston. My ticket is nonrefundable and to exchange it for different destinations (i.e., Washington D.C. or Virginia Beach) would have cost a fortune. Anyway, my friend called me up about four days ago wanting to know if I were going to attend. I explained to him the situation and let him know that there was a ""gift"" on the way. Furthermore, I let him know that I was going to call him on December 20 from Miami. The day had arrived. It was December 20 and I forgot to call him. I felt extremely guilty when he ended up calling me instead. I could sense the disappointment in his voice. Then I woke up!"
"055-4"	"#055-4 My friend (Joel) and I were in a big house. There were four young girls playing somewhere in the house. These girls were approximately ten or eleven years of age. At first Joel and I were just watching the girls socialize in the backyard. They were congregated around the swimming pool with what looked like dolls. Anyway, we went back in the house, where the girls were playing in several rooms while Joel and I were watching TV downstairs. Suddenly, we heard several knocks right above us. We figured out that the father was coming downstairs. As soon as he made his way down the stairs Joel hesitantly took off running. I followed him outside until we were not in clear view: He then (desperately) asked me to call a cab from the payphone in the backyard. He told me of a party that was going on that night. He suddenly flipped me a coin but I didn't react to it quickly enough. He flipped me a second coin as if he were James Dean. I proceeded to call the cab and I woke up as soon as it arrived."
"056-1"	"#056-1 In the dream I was over at my girlfriend's house and I was with her downstairs in her living room. We were kissing on her couch. She had all her clothes on and I was totally naked. While we were kissing her mother came down the stairs. I jumped up and hid in the bathroom. Her mother came down and for some reason there was a space about a foot wide between the bathroom door and the wall. And her mother just looked in and kept staring at me."
"056-2"	"#056-2 I was walking across the street and the light turned green. There was a car behind me that started to move and it hit me. It started to push me across the street. I was standing while being pushed and I could see the driver. It was an older woman with short dark hair and glasses. When I jumped away from the car I ran up to the lady's door and I started to yell at her. She drove away but kept looking back. Then she smashed into a parked car. The last thing I could remember was that I was running away from the car, after she hit."
"056-3"	"#056-3 I was massaging my girlfriend's legs and for some reason her legs were completely covered with tattoos. The tattoos were of devils and snakes. I also remember that my girlfriend and I were talking in her car and she was being very cold and uncaring."
"056-4"	"#056-4 I was walking down the beach holding hands with a girl I used to like last year. In the dream I was aware that I had a girlfriend but I didn't care that I was with this other girl. I was hugging and kissing her. It all seemed so real that when I woke up I had thought that it was reality not a dream."
"057-1"	"#057-1 I was on vacation and staying at a hotel. Coming in I took the elevator and instead of it going upward it went to the side."
"057-2"	"#057-2 It was my birthday and I was in line receiving cards from my friends and family."
"057-3"	"#057-3 It was snowing out and I was outside sliding down my hill in the snow. It was the start of the blizzard of '78. I was talking with my uncle."
"057-4"	"#057-4 I was cleaning my friend's camper in my yard. All of a sudden it started rolling backwards. I got inside but could not push down on the brake pedal. The camper finally hit the fence and stopped rolling. It all of a sudden became nighttime and I was still in my yard but now with my dog. A raccoon ran by and I happened to kick it. It came after me. My dog started fighting with the raccoon and it ended up the raccoon killed my dog. I was bumming out and telling my friends what happene. Then I woke up and went and checked on my dog."
"058-1"	"#058-1 My friends and I were supposed to go to Boston one night, around 6 or 7 pm. The train was the last one that night, even though the last one is usually at 11:00. For some reason, the train was leaving from my old high school bus stop. Everyone was meeting at my house, which is about a two-minute ride from the stop. They were at my house, but I was really late. This is very unusual, because I'm always early. They were in my kitchen and kept telling me to hurry, as I was. We decided that they'd leave and I'd meet them at the bus/train stop. Now, there's only a couple of minutes 'til the train's departure. I raced out of my house, down the stairs and across the lawn, but I forgot my pants. I ran back, put them on, and ran out again, but forgot my asthma medicine. To make a long story short, I forgot my wallet and my coat, and ran back and forth every time for each item. Eventually, I got to the street, knowing there was no way I could make the train. Then my friend's car drove over the hill to meet me. The car was red, even though I don't know anyone with a red car. They stopped next to me, and they looked disappointed. Then I woke up."
"058-2"	"#058-2 I went to the music store that I always go to in Wilmington. This time though, it looked much different. It looked like a sporting goods store I had been in years ago, which had a wooden, cabin-like exterior. The proprietor, who is one of the nicest guys I've ever met, was there, but I don't know if we talked. He was busy with some paperwork behind the desk. Meanwhile, I was going through a large selection of sheet music, which was in plain cardboard boxes. Also in the boxes were some pieces of cake and some other things like muffins and cookies. I had a piece or two, but started eating them secretly so the guy wouldn't see me. They didn't taste that good."
"058-3"	"#058-3 I called a girl that I knew in high school on the phone. While talking to her on the phone, I could see her -- like on TV when two people talk on the phone and the black line on the screen separates them. The conversation was regular, just ""Hi"" and ""How are you?"" Nothing major. However, this is a sharp contrast to the experience I had when I actually called her last summer. She was hard to hear, like another phone in her house was off the hook, and there was a lot of background noise. The conversation didn't go well, as if she didn't know me."
"058-4"	"#058-4 The store where I used to work closed in January, and I had a dream that it opened again. I didn't know until I happened to walk past the now-empty store and noticed that it was like a busy Saturday. I went in and found some of my old employee friends working, and they greeted me the way they usually do. Also, everything was switched around, with clothing racks facing different ways and what have you. I went home and told my mother. I said something like, ""Well, I guess I'd better apply again."" For some reason, my mother did not seem too enthusiastic about the situation. This is surprising, because she loved that store and the fact that I was working there. I also remember wondering if the old managers were back, in addition to a few other choice individuals."
"059-1"	"#059-1 My dream consisted of my father's Corvette being stolen. It was stolen when I was driving it and left it at the shopping center. My father didn't get upset, because he was going to buy another one. He bought another one and then wanted to buy parts. We went to a guy and my father and I bought parts for his new Corvette. The parts we bought were our old parts from our last Corvette. We realized it and got our Corvette back and now we owned two Corvettes."
"059-2"	"#059-2 I was going on a blind date and the girl was beautiful. It seemed like everything was going good. Then all of a sudden we're walking and she ran into an old boyfriend. They went off together and left me there standing."
"059-3"	"#059-3 My friend and I had an argument earlier in the day. In my dream, we had both made up. She had apologized about how she treated me and cleared everything up. When I awoke from my dream I felt that everything was all cleared up, but in reality nothing had changed. When I saw her, I acted like everything was all right."
"059-4"	"#059-4 In this dream, I dreamt that I was playing on the Celtics. I was 12th man on the team. I hadn't played all season until this game. All of the Celtics guards got injured in the game and there was nobody else to put in the game except for me. I went in with the game being tied with only 20 seconds left and our ball. Coach Ford set a play up for McHale but I took the ball myself and took a 15-footer from the top of the key and hit it to win the game. The crowd went wild. In the locker room Coach Ford told me I had a lot of guts and heart taking a shot like that and named me the staring point guard for the next season."
"060-1"	"#060-1 Last night I recall a dream that I have had often. I'm always the hero. In this particular dream I was at a nightclub. There were many beautiful women. I was dancing and having a good time when this shady-looking dude walks in. I distinctly remember noticing him for a minute and then going back to my partying. I got a beautiful blonde to dance with me. As we were dancing the shady-looking guy grabbed my woman and put a gun to her head. Everyone was screaming and none of the bouncers would do anything. At one point the guy took the gun away from her head and pointed it in the air. In that instant I jumped at him and knocked him down. I took the gun. The blonde was so grateful and was all over me. I can remember all the other girls watching and wanting me, grabbing me. It was great and then I woke up."
"060-2"	"#060-2 Last night I had a dream that I had a big test in management and it was supposed to be all essays. I wasn't prepared for it so I had to cram the night before. This was a usual thing for me. I was studying till late at night and I happened to doze off. When I woke up, I hadn't finished studying and I had to leave right away to take the test. When I got in the room I was worried and I asked the girl next to me if she was ready. she said, ""Yeah,"" and that made me feel worse. I took the test and I knew I failed. The teacher corrected the tests. I got the lowest grade in the class and I was ashamed."
"060-3"	"#060-3 I had a dream that my mother had died. I attended the wake and saw her lying there. I felt like I wanted to die so she wouldn't be alone but I also had to be there to help my family. They were counting on me. I was indecisive whether to join my mother, thinking I had the chance to be with her or taking care of the family. When I saw how rough my little brother was taking it, I decided to stay and help him. He was a mess. I comforted him and tried to make him feel better, but I couldn't."
"060-4"	"#060-4 Last night's dream I was climbing a mountain with some friends. The further we climbed the further it looked like we had to go to get to the top. We kept climbing and were getting very tired. It started raining. It was very refreshing, but the rocks were getting very slippery. One of my friends fell. We looked down and lost sight of him through the clouds. We all freaked out but we had to keep climbing. There was a tangle in my rope and I had to take it off. As I was doing this I slipped and fell. I was falling and I woke up by jumping up. I was sweating heavily."
"061-1"	"#061-1 I dreamed that I was cutting my brother's hair. When I had finished I turned around to get the mirror to show him. When I turned back around my sister was where my brother had been with all her hair cut off. She asked me how I could do this to her and started to cry."
"061-2"	"#061-2 I dreamed that I was getting on a bus. I don't remember where I was going. I was walking to the back of the bus and I saw my sister with her friends sitting in the very back. I asked her where she was going because I noticed she had a bag with her. Just then she jumped up and yelled, ""Leave me alone!"" and stabbed me in the eye with a pair of scissors."
"061-3"	"#061-3 I had a dream last night about my daughter. I dreamed that she was crying and in pain and was laying on her back calling to me. In the dream I was crying because I couldn't get to her quickly enough to help her. When I awoke I was crying steadily as in the dream."
"061-4"	"#061-4 I had a dream that I took my brother to the park. He was playing basketball one minute and the next he was calling to me to come help him. I ran to help him and when I got there he was fighting ten girls who were between the ages of 7-10. The funny thing was he is only four. This is a true story."
"062-1"	"#062-1 Last night I dreamt that I woke up too late to take a very important exam. I woke up about 11:30 am for an exam at 11:00. Once awake, I had to check the clock and regain my senses before realizing that it was only 6:23 am and that I did not have an exam that day. I have had similar dreams before, only to realize that it was Saturday or a holiday."
"062-2"	"#062-2 Last night I dreamed that I went on a trip to Florida with my friends. It was actually a memory of when I did go there for a week. I dreamed of all the parties we went to, laying on the beach, and all of the other good times we had. I remembered how we had a party in our room and our phone got stolen. I also recalled all the people we met on the trip."
"062-3"	"#062-3 Two nights ago I dreamed that my 14-year-old dog, a Cocker Spaniel was hit by a car and killed. It was actually more of a nightmare than a dream. The driver left her in the middle of the road for dead. Although this probably couldn't happen because I always keep her on a leash, it was very realistic nonetheless. Thank goodness my dog was fine. She was sleeping peacefully in her bed. I did not get back to sleep for about two or three hours after that nightmare."
"062-4"	"#062-4 The other night I dreamed that I was on summer vacation my friends. We went golfing, to the beach, to restaurants and parties. We spent the days laying on the beach and swimming while we spent the nights drinking and dancing with girls we met there. I woke up right before going to the beach late at night with one of the girls I met."
"063-1"	"#063-1 I was working in a building with the summer camp I work at. I was watching the kids play hockey. I got bored and left to go outside. When I was outside there was a fresh water pond where other kids were swimming. I saw a shark fin in it and we told everyone to leave the water. As I looked around I saw there was a kid hiding in the woods controlling the fin by an electronic machine."
"063-2"	"#063-2 I was with my friends in a car. We were driving around and I had a 9mm gun which I was fooling around with because I never held one or saw one up close before. We looked out the car and I bet them I could shoot the flame off the candle that was in the distance. I did. We stop driving and were in the house that was off colored compared to the other on the street. Then we went to a corner store, almost like raiding like police would, and found machine guns inside."
"063-3"	"#063-3 I was at my house and we just received an electric screwdriver from one of my friends, but I really do not like the kid. I figured it probably didn't work and that is why he gave it to me, but we cleaned it and it worked. I ended up  going to like a [illegible] to see him with another kid.

After lunch she said, ""I want to tell you something."" I retorted by saying, ""Really, what?"" She told me that she was a witch. I didn't believe her so she showed my by calling the clouds around us (overhead, and it was clear before). Lightning and thunder came from the swirling clouds. Then she flew into the air.

She was wearing a tight black long-sleeved top with tight black jeans and black knee-high boots. She came over to me and gave me a big hug and a sensual kiss. She took my hand and led me into another large room that looked like a study. There she pointed to a couch and I sat down on it, as she went over to the  ""Wall of Sound"" (a stereo) and turned on one of my self-made tapes. The music came on and she walked over behind and gave me a back massage. After a while she stopped and started to kiss my neck.

Then when I looked back at Stacy, she was driving and I was the passenger. We went faster and faster. Then I blacked out. I awoke to her shaking me, in her bed, and saying, ""Oh please be all right . . . wake-up please."" When I did I saw her beautiful face and then as she kissed me . . . I woke up."

We then came upon another pile of snow. She again climbed it with the car, but this time, the door opened and I flew out. The car landed on top of my chest. It was at the top of the pile that this happened. She ran out of the car and becoming panic-stricken said, ""Are you all right? . . . Oh, my God."" I then replied (crying) ""Help me please!""

I recall that I thought it was very odd that they didn't die slowly and why they weren't down on the ground. Then my brother came up to me and said that he saw my old car (which I owned 10 years ago and sold) fully intact, for sale in the yard. Then that's when I started seeing old cars in the junkyard surrounded by the dinosaurs. I started looking for the car and finally found it sitting on top of other cars.

"080-1"	"#080-1 A dream that I have been constantly having since my early childhood has been bothering me for quite some time. The dream occurs in this beige-colored room -- not quite brown -- with no doors and no other way out. Throughout this dream I am a small particle in this huge room and all I seem to be doing is looking for a way out. The reason why I keep looking is because there is this deep man's voice calling my name. It keeps getting closer and closer to me. I am totally helpless in this dream because I can go nowhere. However, I somehow find a way to get out of the room. I'm not quite sure how but it does me no good. Because when I get out I end up in another room exactly like the one I was just in except that it is white and not that beige color. The thing that is weird about this dream is that it occurs in slow motion and I can't seem to move fast enough to get away from the voice. If I do the whole process starts all over again. Everytime I hear the voice all I want to do is run, but there is nowhere to run. That's all I remember about the dream and I never know if anything or what happens to me. Basically, I wake up right when the voice gets so close that it is in back of me and when I turn around to see who or what it is I can still see nobody and usually I wake up."
"080-2"	"#080-2 The other night I had a dream that I fell asleep while studying for an exam -- believe it or not it was my psychology exam. What happened was when I woke up my notes were on top of my head and I realized that I had not studied everything that I needed to. I was so scared and nervous, because I never fall asleep while studying. Usually I don't wait until the last minute to study, but for some reason in my dream I did. When it came time to go to school I was so afraid that I would fail that I crammed for the two hours I had before the test. Also, I would have to run to the bathroom and throwup because I was so nervous because I knew I had not studied enough. Sure enough I took the test and failed. But not only did I fail, but I also could not cope and dropped out of school because of it. The end result is that I ended up workiing at some kind of convenience store for the rest of my life as a cashier. The scariest thing about the dream was when I woke up. Sure enough I was dreaming this dream. I really did have a psychology test and I really did fall asleep while studying. In some way my unconscious was trying to tell me to wake up and to study because I knew I could never let myself fail. Thankfully I had a good understanding of the material, but I still could do better. I'm still in school and I didn't fail. It was scary, though, because it was like deja vu. I felt that everything [illegible] in the dream was going to really happen to me in reality."
"080-3"	"#080-3 Another dream that I had was that I was able to get into a local bar in my hometown using my current driver's license. Even though my license says I'm 20 years old, the bouncer let me in with full knowledge of the fact that I was not old enough to be there. The feeling of being able to go in the bar was awesome. I was psyched because all my friends are at the age of 22 and always go out without me because I can never go into the bar with them. Finally I was able to go out and have a good time with them. The weird thing was that even though I got into the bar, I had a horrible time. You see in the dream I was the only one over 21. The rest of them were only 20 and could not get in, so the roles were reversed. Basically having the dream proved to me that life is not always so good if you live by ""only if"" phrases. Because I used to say only if I was old enough when the fact of the matter was in the dream I was, but they weren't. This still was depressing for me. So basically now I don't wish that I was older or younger. I'm just happy and content with who and what I am."
"080-4"	"#080-4 Last night's dream I had was that I was a commuting student at a college. However, the college I was commuting to was in England. Yeah, I know, it's far-fetched, but in my dream I would fly to England on Sunday nights and fly back to Boston on Thursdays. You see I went to study overseas in September, however, it didn't work out so I came back to Suffolk. Now somehow or another in my dream I would go to that same school and instead of taking their curriculum I would be taking Suffolk's curriculum with all of the students who I met over there. The weird thing was I no longer hated it. I actually loved going to school there now and I felt at peace with myself to be able to study there without feeling any anxieties. In the dream it worked for everybody including my parents. They were happy that I could finally see England and enjoy it. When I was there I didn't enjoy any part of being over there. So because of the dream I now feel that I have successfully done what is right for me - - to stay in Suffolk."

"089-1"	"#089-1 [This is the most recent dream I have had.] The dream has to do with a Baybank automatic teller machine. One day I went to take some money from one of the Baybank ATM's. This ATM ran out of paper to record the transaction of ""fast cash."" I was eager to know how much I had left in my account. But because the ATM ran out of paper, I couldn't tell. I made purchases with my Baybank Mastercard that allowed the store to bill my account. I was a bit nervous maybe there was not enough money in my account, I thought. I wasn't sure whether the bank paid the store or not. So this confusion led me to dream about the ATM giving me a receipt of my transaction, which would have displayed my balance. Strange, isn't it?"
"089-2"	"#089-2 [The dream happened after or before the ATM dream.] In this dream, I dreamt I had my ""Horizon Reader"" book in my bag.

So I left it in my locker. But now I regret having done that because I have a reading assignment due next week. I was elated to find in my dream that my English ""Horizon Reader"" was in my bag.

But I did remember her saying price figures. I believe she wanted to sell herself for fifty dollars. I bargained with her and lowered the price to thirty dollars. She agreed to the price. So she would grant me sexual pleasure for thirty dollars. I also agreed. Then strange things happened. I found myself in the bathroom of my hotel room. From the bathroom, I could see people discussing things, just normal things (not sure about the contents). I started feeling guilty; I started changing my mind. I didn't want to have sexual pleasures with the maid. From the bathroom, I could see the maid preparing my bed. She wore [illegible] clothes. The dream ended there. Strange, isn't it?"
"089-4"	"#089-4 [This dream took some time before I filled the questionnaire of the psychology survey.] I dreamt of this kind of a building which I have difficulty describing: [drawing] . The house has a tall musclelike structure above the rest of the house. The dream began with an eerie feeling that I was at Harvard University. Somewhere near the top of the muscle structure there was a nest for a white bird. The view of the house in my dream moved from top (bird nest) to the bottom of the house. The whole house was in view. The transition from top to bottom was accompanied by a U2 music. I don't listen to U2 music but I did once see a video of U2 of one of their songs. There were some people in my dreams on the ground who were supposedly making a movie. I think the director was U2 lead singer himself. He was at the same time the music player. I don't know from where. That was it. Strange, isn't it?"
"090-1"	"#090-1 I was at Fenway with a childhood friend who I haven't seen in over 10 years. Bucky Dent was coaching third base. While the game was going on he came over to the seats and asked me what my name was. The whole time the game is still going on but in a way that didn't make sense. I can't remember why it didn't make sense. The next thing is we're standing in a living room. He's signing autographs and giving me all the baseballs that he signed. It was much longer but by the time I wrote it down I could only remember this small chunk. I do remember seeing this same scene over again about 5 or 6 times."
"090-2"	"#090-2 I was at a swanky hotel it looked like; there were no sounds. I started the dream with the feeling I had done something wrong. I was walking through the lobby. Pinkish/red carpet, lots of big plants/trees. The front side of the lobby was glass at an angle. I was walking, eventually, to the elevator and saw an old high school friend. She said nothing but looked at me with disapproval. This all happened in slow motion. I saw a brunette as me, who I knew at the time but I can see her face now. I got on the elevator. There were several people who I didn't know. As soon as the elevator started up I knew what was going to happen. The elevator shot through the top of the hotel. No one panicked though. Everyone was very calm. I pulled the doors apart and we were hundreds of feet in the air. We slowly fell towards the ground. None of us was concerned. We just watched as we fell. It was actually a cool feeling free falling with no anxiety. The next thing I'm walking out the front door of the hotel. I'm watching myself walk out the front door, as if I were watching back on the TV. And then it ended."
"090-3"	"#090-3 I was in some kind of eating establishment, like a Friendly's or a Wendy's. I was having a cup of coffee with a lady who is in one of my classes. No words were spoken. She then looked out the window and said, ""Look. There's Mike, Craig, Jason and Ed."" I turned around to look and across the large parking lot in front of a building that looked like the NAPA store in my hometown are my fiancee's cousins, Mike, Craig and Jason and her Uncle Ed. They were dressed up in tuxedos and looked just like one of the pictures we have of them at a wedding. I remember thinking at the time that was strange. That's it."
"090-4"	"#090-4 Inside of a store there was just like an empty box. No front. This [illegible] building and there were stores on each side like you would find at downtown crossing. It was 4-5 stores from the corner. In the back of the store you walked out a door and onto like an [illegible] channel of water. It was like the underground passageways in Istanbul. A friend of mine and I had hooked up a guitar to an amp and run an extension cord to the corner. Neither of us plays the guitar in reality. I'm in the back on the indoor boardwalk. I walk down a couple of shops having a cigarette and I hear this song playing. At first I think it's a radio but as I walk down to the ""store"" there is my friend playing the guitar with a drummer and two back-up singers. The song sounds great. I've never heard this song before yet I'm singing the words in the dream. They finish. There's a large crowd in front of the store. I feel envious that I missed a chance to play. One of the singers collapses what it looks to be a baby stroller. My friend asks me if I'm going up to school. I think to myself, ""Do I have time to go home and change first?"" I remember [illegible] It ended there."

I started to cheat off the girl in front of me. I wrote all her answers down. The professor was getting suspicious. I started to sweat a lot; sweat was dripping down my forehead.

How would she know if I needed new shoes or not? I told her she was crazy. Next thing I knew she was grabbing all the money from the till. I told her to stop stealing. She said she was not stealing; she was just taking what belongs to her. The money did not belong to her; she was a thief. I started to grab the money back and then I woke up right in the middle of my dream."

I then pulled up next to them, grabbed the girl somehow and rescued her."

I found a little bit of hamburger anyway. So I then started to cook it in the microwave. We usually only cook pastrami in the microwave. I put pastrami in with the hamburg. The weird thing was that when everything was still cold and before I put it in the microwave the cheese that I put on it was melted already. Then I asked the guy, who looked like he was part of the Hell's Angels, if he liked the cheese melted and he wanted to know why it was melted before I cooked it. Then he asked me how much hamburg I put in. I showed him the little bit I had put in. (We put things in a dish when we cook in microwave.) Then he said that I should charge him less. I told him I put pastrami in it also so it would be the same price. Then he got upset. I was nervous when getting everything ready and I took out a hot dog roll to put the sandwich in but he said he wanted a sub roll. Then another customer wanted something at the lottery so I went over to take care of that person. There were all these people at the counter. My cousin, who does not work there, was behind the counter and I could not squeeze by him because he was too fat. Then I started panicking and getting real nervous. Then I woke up."
"095-2"	"#095-2 A dream I had recently went like this. I was at a cottage on a dock we stayed at in Nantucket. I was in a room with my girlfriend and a few of my friends. We were all drinking. My girlfriend was in the room but she was wearing a bikini. All my friends were staring at her. I began to get mad but I held it in. I can remember becoming really uncomfortable. While we were all sitting around drinking I told her that she should change, but she did not listen to me. Then one by one my friends started talking to her and trying to kiss her and grab her breasts. I flew off the handle. I grabbed everyone who did this and threw them out a window into the water. (The cottage was part of the dock and it was on stilts over the water.) Then my girlfriend started to cry. I asked her why she was crying. She said because they were my friends that I threw out the window. I kept telling her that they weren't because, ""They were trying to kiss you,"" but she couldn't understand that. I woke up, but I had the feeling that when I woke up that something was unresolved."
"095-3"	"#095-3 Another dream which I had was one in which there were kids in the woods somewhere. I was with my brother and they were behind some bushes. They were being loud so I threw a rock at them. They began to chase after us. I was saying to them as I ran, ""I'm sorry."" I remember feeling like a coward with my brother watching me do this. I ran into my house, but it was not my house. It was someone else's house and I thought it was my house. I locked all the doors and windows so no one could get in and then the kids started throwing bricks in at the windows. I became scared so I called the police. They never came. Then my brother and I went outside through a window or something that they could not see me leave. We watched them throw bricks at the house. Then one of them wandered over to us, and I began to talk to him. He was siding with me and forgiving me for throwing a brick at them. Then he called them, the rest of the kids, over to us and they were not so forgiving. They tried to hit me over the head with a brick so I tried to cover my head. I have no idea where my brother was as I tried to escape. Then I woke up feeling my heart racing. I was sweating and afraid but at the same time feeling like a coward."
"095-4"	"#095-4 I had a dream in which I was out at a party and my girlfriend was with me. There was a kid she knew from my old high school. She was flirting with him and I tried to keep her from doing it. She just kept doing it. He kept flirting back even though I was right there. Then I remember walking into the bedroom and she was in there on the bed with her ex-boyfriend. She was having sex with him. I pushed him off and started to fight with him. He disappeared and she was on a couch with two boys who were both having sex with her. I remember very vividly feeling the walls and things in the room coming closer to me like everything was closing in on me. I was helpless. I woke up feeling very uncomfortable and angry."

The person on my side took out a semi-automatic gun and began to shoot at us. Both my partner and I were hit. When I looked over at him, he looked dead. As the people kept shooting, I crawled to the edge of a hill and slid down to the bottom. Then I floated down a street where I reached up and grabbed a pay phone and dialed 911."

"097-3"	"#097-3 We were off Admiral Street sitting on a house that has been known to have drugs deals there. There were at least two patrol cars that I could see. I was alone in one. I went into the house and arrested various people, but the one I caught happened to be my sister. I did not know what to do. Do I arrest her or let her go? She had just had a baby in February. I arrested her because it was my obligation and it was the best thing for her. I then became scared that the court would take away her baby, but I would file for custody."
"097-4"	"#097-4 I was riding down a tower's stairs on my bike and we were about three stories high. A friend of mine wanted to bust me up by throwing my bike over the side. I told him that if he tried, I would beat the hell out of him. All of a sudden he threw my bike over. So I hit him so hard he fell over the edge. He fell about three stories. When I looked over the edge he was dead. I walked down to see if were really alive or dead. Then I saw my brother-in-law walk by. I called for help but he would not come over to help.

I maybe see her 4-5 times a year and she lives in the same city as us. My mother's mother is always around and would do just about anything for us. Anyway I am at a party with my family and father's mother comes and starts bitchin' at us for no reason. I blow her off cause I'm fed up with her. My mother's mother comes and I give her all of my attention and do anything she needs. Then the dream turns to where I see my sister lying in an alley beat up. The kid who did this was a kid I don't like from the projects. My cousins and I get a hold of him in front of my house and we beat the hell out of him. When we're done and walking into my house I turn to see him gasping for breath and bleeding very badly in the middle of the street."
"098-2"	"#098-2 I was reunited with all of my friends from years ago.

I don't recall what, but the next thing I remember is my friend Paul and I were running through alleyways, jumping fences and climbing on the ladders that are attached to apartments. The police were chasing us and we were trying to escape. When we got on top of one of the roofs and the police were catching up, a door we needed to get in on top of the roof was locked. I ended up kicking the door in and after that we kept on running and a few seconds later I woke up."
"098-3"	"#098-3 This dream was short and to the point. My girlfriend and I have been together now for almost two years. The relationship that I am in is incredible. We match together perfectly. Anyway the dream that I had was of our wedding (the church, the reception and honeymoon). Of those three the reception is the most vivid. Everybody was drinking, dancing and having one great time. Melissa looked as beautiful as ever. I myself didn't look that bad. Then on the honeymoon we went to Disneyworld. I personally have been there three times and I can picutre Disneyworld real well. In my dream Melissa and I were riding on all kinds of rides I remember from being there before."
"098-4"	"#098-4 My friend Paul and I were at a convenience store. These two guys came into the store. There was an argument between them and us. Outside the car one of the guys came up to my window and started screaming and waving a gun. I took off with Paul and they chased us. After a couple of minutes into the chase I got a flat tire. Paul and I said that if we split up it would be harder for them to chase us. I ended up running to the fire station where my father was working that night. He took me up to the third floor. All of a sudden we both saw one of the men trying to get at us from outside as he was trying to get in through the window. Once he got into the room I ran right into him causing him to fall right through the window. I thought I had killed him, but I looked out the window. He had only fallen into a hedge that was out on the second floor. As my father and I looked over he was pulling out a gun. I ducked and my father was one second short of ducking and ended up getting hit in his right side of his ribs. I picked my father up on my shoulders and carried him throughout the fire station. I was very aggravated because of what had happened so I hid my father in the fire station, got an axe off of the fire truck and went looking for this person. As I was retracing my tracks the stupid phone rang -- woke."

The dream began with me entering the subway station where I usually begin the commute home at every evening. Many people filled the station as they waited for their trains to appear and take them home. As I was waiting for my train in the crowded station, my employer appeared next to me out of the crowd. We began conversing about a legal case (my employer is an attorney) that was taking place in the state of Oregon. As we were talking, my employer excused himself so he could make a purchase at the newsstand. While he was gone, I noticed that it had been 45 minutes since I entered the train station and my train still hadn't arrived. My employer returned to where I was standing and we resumed our conversation about something taking place in Oregon. He stated that a court in Oregon wouldn't send him a piece of information that he needed because the people in Oregon don't like east-coast attorneys. At this time I began thinking of the forests and sylvan landscapes of Oregon. I also noticed that it had been over an hour that had passsed, and my train still hadn't arrived. At about this point I woke up."
"100-2"	"#100-2 The first thing I recall about this dream is finding myself enclosed in a large open field of grass surrounded by trees. I walked across the field from where I was standing in the center and approached a row of trees along the border of the field. As I reached out to touch one of the trees, I realized that all of them were flat objects that only appeared to be trees. When I actually touched the one I was closest to, the whole row of fake trees fell backwards over a great precipice. As they fell away, I remember moving away from them and proceeding back through the field. I began running until I approached the trees near an opposite side of the field. When I came close to these trees I could see into the forest and could perceive solid ground beyond. Since these were real trees growing out of real ground, I stepped out of the field and began moving through the forest. I remember running through the forest swiftly, but remember nothing further about this dream."

I tried to escape the light by swimming very fast in different directions and diving deep into the water, but it continued to follow me. I kept diving deeper and deeper, but when I came to the surface the light was always there shining on me. After a while, I realized there was no escaping the light so I swam towards the shore. When I reached the beach I walked out of the water and came to a parking lot where my brother was sitting in a car. I remember nothing further about this dream other than my brother and me greeting each other in the parking lot."
"100-4"	"#100-4 I was being detained in a kind of prison in a former communist country in central Europe. The prison was in Europe, but it was designed exactly like Fenway Park in Boston. I was being held along with a group of students, but why we were being detained was unknown. Apparently we were found guilty of some crime that nobody seemed to understand. Groups of us were sequestered into various locations throughout the prison. The conditions of the cells were very primitive. They were large rooms with cement floors that were covered with straw. Upon arrival at the prison, our clothes had to be traded in for very worn, loose-fitting outfits that were tied at the waist with ropes. The prison, being the actual size of Fenway Park, seemed very large. There were very few people around except for ouselves and prison officials. While we were unable to go outside of the prison, we were permitted to move around inside of it. The halls and passageways were relatively empty, but there were people working at the concession stands. At one point the other prisoners and I decided I should attempt to buy some beer at one of the concession stands. I found a beer stand and asked if I were allowed to purchase some beer. I reached into my pocket and found money that I could pay for it with. The attendant replied that I could buy some beer if I hadn't had any codeine within the last 20 hours. I remembered that the prison officials had given me some medications earlier that day with codeine, so I was not able to have the beer. At that point I began walking around in the large and desolate prison. I remember nothing further about this dream."

Then I remember walking through the place where the show was to be held. I remember specifically two doors. One door went into this hallway that was really trippy. There were all types of objects hanging from the ceiling. I really liked it but after I saw this I left the hallway. Then I am not sure of the sequence but I think I looked at my ticket and it said: 12:24 pm. Which is an increment of 4 hours and 24 minutes.

I have currently two close friends who play professional hockey and during the summer they are constantly being recognized in the public and it drives me crazy. So before going to bed I started to wonder how it would feel to be in the limelight. It was a great feeling: going out and everybody just would stop and ask me for my autograph. A good feeling."
"154-2"	"#154-2 The dream that I had was that I won the megabucks. I had won 30 million dollars. At the beginning it was great but I ended up being miserable. People that I was close to started to say that I was snobbish and was always bragging about myself. I always thought prior to this dream that having an overabundance of money would be the best thing in the world. I found out in my dream that it was nothing but problems. It seems that every time I have strange dreams, I would have a conversation with somebody about certain topics such as money and the topic develops into a dream that night. I discovered in my dream that I had so much money that by being [illegible] I was trying to get rid of it but that was just as hard."
"154-3"	"#154-3 I saw myself being the MVP in my softball league in my dream. Also I was given the Most Improved Player award and also being voted to the Allstar team. I was told that everybody who was on my team was so surprised that they never thought that I could turn my performance around so quickly. I was hitting homeruns like it was nothing and also making catches that I only could make and no one else. Every time I would show up at the ball park, people would start to talk and I could hear the positive remarks that were being said about me. I ended up making a diving catch in the championship game. When I woke up to go to the bathroom the next day, I looked in the mirror and wondered, some day I wish the dream never ended."
"154-4"	"#154-4 A few days ago, I watched a show called Rescue. There was a police officer who saved a grocery clerk from being killed in a hold-up. My goal in life is to be a successful police officer. During my dream, I was considered to be a brave cop and was always thought of as being gutsy. There was a situation where I was driving in my cruiser and was called to a scene where a man had a gun to a woman's head ready to kill her. I risked my life in trying to save her by going in the bar and trying to talk to him. I succeeded but sweated every moment. All that I remember was that the suspect threatened to kill me. When I woke up the next day, I started to question about becoming a police officer. A frightening dream."
