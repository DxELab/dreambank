"2617"	"(2009-01-25 (18)) I was watching Prison Break. I don't remember anything that was happening, but I remember Bellick and T-Bag."
"2618"	"(2009-01-25 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop but it looked like an airport. There was a shop called ""I hate buns"" except it was sometimes ""I love hate"". At first the shop was outside, but then we were inside. Ezra was looking for a shop and we ended up in this sound studio like the one near the Science Museum with this old-ish woman teaching. She had a program open on her computer and showed us a music file and asked us to work out how to get all the music into ""one stream"" -- which we did by pouring water onto sand and making these thick rods made of sand and water. Ezra had spelled out ""hobgoblin"" and I wrote ""Hello"" and then ""Izzy"" in the sand. The lady had a glass and broke it and I called it a glass and she started rambling angrily that it was actually called something else and that it was mainly for 'bigger' people to commit suicide with and then she calmed down and said she was meeting some pedophile guy next and she was going to be late but couldn't contact him. One of us suggested we could go and show him this game to stall him. Then I was in a car with a guy friend. It was night and we drove past this shop, which he had broken into earlier. The door was open and someone was inside. He pulled up outside and was going to go in to stop it and I told him not to, and he hesitated but eventually drove off. Then we picked up a drunk friend and he said he lived in ""New Jersey"" and my friend said ""that's a nice place to live"" and I said ""unless you're in this country""."
"2619"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) I was watching Prison Break. T-Bag had a lot of different disguises and voices to use for different identities. He went to a hospital and there were some kids. He was pretending to be an Indian doctor and he called them to help them and was speaking in an Indian accent. The kid recognized the voice though. Eugene had had a dream (while he was in prison) about an assassination attempt on the president and it mentioned the dream on the news. There was a bloody dude called Billy in the dream. Later, Mahone dreamt of it too. He was on a rooftop or something. He was with Sucre, but then it wasn't Sucre and he turned around and Mahone shot him four times in the back. Later the president, who looked like/was Mahone, shot a friend four times in the back and then laid him down and shot him in the head. Three kids nearby saw and one ended up dying. Mahone and Eugene had a gun fight. Mahone pushed the other two kids in the way and Eugene shot them accidentally and they died. The president was involved with this girl, but he didn't trust her anymore."
"2620"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) I was at school, but it was a different school. The same people were there though. There was an 'assembly' and everyone was grouped together in different classrooms. I was sitting next to Fang in class. During the assembly, Calvin ignored me and sat with someone else. Rebekah was sitting somewhere else and was laughing with her friends. Ezra came in and sat next to me (we were at a desk). He knew my password for DreamBank and I was on it later trying to find out how to change the password. It looked different and had a forum. I couldn't find anything about changing your password. I was then in a lady's home and I had to leave (I was with others and we were on a mission thing). I had to drag this heavy carpet out. Then it was a TV show and this girl was wearing some latest fashion and these people took photos of it so it couldn't be released."
"2621"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) This family had moved into a new house. There was a cat and a dog and they were weird looking and were staring at it. The kids ran into the house. Then the father was actually dead, but they could see him. There was a building nearby that had a public toilet sort of feel and there were vending machines in it. Some guy wanted to get some Picnics for his friend. The father was getting the Picnics and he got in trouble with the police. Someone asked the guy what his pets were called. It was Bellick (Prison Break)."
"2622"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) A bunch of people and I were running away from some people. T-Bag (Prison Break) was there. T-Bag was going to kill this guy, but I took the shank from him and stabbed the guy so he didn't get in trouble. A lot of stuff happened but I can't remember much. Then we were in a game. There were lots of people around and we were running around through this large crowd."
"2623"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) I was at a cinema. The guy serving at the counter was in the clip for 'Jizz in My Pants', the clip was actually different. Someone said ""cash or credit"" to him and everyone was asking if he was the guy from it. Then I was in school and it was a few weeks/months into it. I was doing ok, but I wanted to do MUPC and so wasn't trying. The people there were pretty mean. We were all gathered and sitting on the floor. The teacher looked like Mahone (Prison Break) and he put some music on and everyone was singing except for me, as I didn't know the words and wouldn't have sung anyway. Then they all got up to do this dance. Only two guys and I didn't join in. There was a group of girls that were mean to me all the time and I couldn't find my bag and thought they had taken it, but then I found it in the shelf behind me."
"2624"	"(2009-01-27 (18)) I was at school but it was different. It was the last night of school and we were supposed to wear a 'disguise'. People were all dressed up but I was just in my leaver's jacket. We were in a room, which had round tables scattered around and had balloons etc and was party-like. This teacher called us all to the ""birthday board"" and they were putting people's birthdays on there. Eugene was there and wrote in Bradley's birthday as April 16th or something. Then I think I might have been somewhere else, but Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were sort of friends with me, but they were trying to put salt on my food, along with some other people. I kept hovering over the plate and squealing and running away but they would follow. Then I was in a hall somewhere and I think it was a movie scene or something. A black girl and a guy made a mistake and it was really funny. There was a dog at the back and Mom joked that it was mine. I then had a little camera and I was taking photos. Cuddles was on my bed, sitting in a bunched up bit of blanket. Ezra was playing with a dog."
"2625"	"(2009-01-27 (18)) T-Bag (Prison Break) was having sex with some lady. She was on top, and it showed his face. I was thinking that he was hot and that I missed season 1 T-Bag."
"2626"	"(2009-01-27 (18)) I was at Mom's house, but it was different and in a different place. Across the road from it, was mainly bare but there was a stingy house down this hill (across the road, was a huge square of land, which dipped down and the house was in the middle, but there were trees and such around). Mom and Darren were modifying the house and decided to ask them a question. We all went over and as we got to the door, people started yelling and glass was smashing. Mom got a bit nervous. We went in and they gave us all a drink, but I didn't drink mine and Mom and Darren had some of theirs. The house was very 'hillbilly' like and there were lots of rooms, with quite a few people in it. Eventually Darren passed out (from the drink) and Mom was a bit groggy. I tried to get her out of the house, but the people were going to kill us and I left her and ran off. They just came after me. I found a shard of glass, although I think it was a knife at first, and I began slicing the necks of the people in the house. Only about two of them actually came after me, everyone else just sat about in their room. One of the rooms had three guys in it and they were playing a card game. The room across from it had a few people in it too. I killed two of the guys in the room, but the third guy I couldn't get to. I tried to slice his throat but I couldn't get through it so I grabbed his arm and tried to slice his wrist vertically, but it didn't work again, so I ran off. Then I had a cardboard pole and I ran out the back. This guy had some sharp weapon and I was fighting him off with the pole. I called the cops while doing this and I said ""I'm at the house across from 4 Edinboro. They're trying to kill us! They drugged my Mom and her boyfriend and I only have a cardboard pole"". I ended up finding something stronger right after I said that, but then someone said that we had actually imagined all this and I got frustrated. We were then back out the front of Mom's house and we still wanted to go over, but were now hesitant. We started over and then saw an Asian guy similar to one in the 'vision', so we decided not to. Outside my window, which was one the second floor, was a lattice ladder thing and it was pink. It was hanging off the wall and they put it back in place. I was saying that people could now come to my window etc and they said they would reinforce it all and I said ""I want bulletproof windows"" and then joked that someone would come in the house and the only way for me to get out would be through the window and I wouldn't be able to go through it. I put my foot on the bottom of the ladder to see how strong it was and it started to fall. This guy was at my window, which was open, and told me to grab his hand and I said ""you won't be able to lift me"" but he kept insisting and I grabbed his hand and he easily pulled me up and through the window with one hand. I realized he was Edward (Twilight book) and said ""You really are a vampire""."
"2627"	"(2009-01-28 (18)) I was at a school. I was going to class and someone was acting dodgy and I poured hot tea on them. They said they were just warning us that we had to do a test on some body part next class and we needed to know names of some of the parts. We got to class and the teacher was covering the board and I was trying to look, but they kept moving so I couldn't see, as they had a picture of whatever the body part was with the names on it. Something happened and this creature started attacking people and we tried to run. The teacher got 'possessed' and in the class next door there were 'eggs' from the creature, which were just people covered in a sac, one of them had the legs still sticking out, kicking."
"2628"	"(2009-01-28 (18)) These people were at a party and there was some dress from World War 1. Jack Nicholson had it and someone said he was getting his smell and beer smell on it, and then he put it on and laughed and left."
"2629"	"(2009-01-29 (18)) I was at Nana's and I was staying the night and sleeping in the lounge. I was trying to turn the TV off but it wouldn't turn off. They had this weird video camera thing plugged in, so I went to Nana's room to ask what I was supposed to do, but she and Poppa were both sleeping. So I just unplugged the camera and then it turned off."
"2630"	"(2009-01-29 (18)) I was at a school. I had been there once before but I came back now as a guy, under the name 'Robert Knepper'. Some people from Brookland were there. I had math next and I was looking on the map to find where the class was. I couldn't work it out and kept walking back and forwards before realizing where the class was. I also had drama and I was thinking I would go change that later. I got to the class and there was a guy teacher. I said I was new and my name was Robert and he checked on the roll and it said I had been there once before, and then had two days off. There weren't any seats by themselves so I sat at this long desk at the back, but it was around the corner and I couldn't see the board. There were two other new kids and they tried to sit there too. I moved it so I could see, but it was on an angle and no-one else could sit there. I was then watching Prison Break and T-Bag had a son, who was LJ. I was reading something that said T-Bag had lied in prison about having sex with guys in there etc, and that LJ knew he was pretending. Also, Sucre had sacrificed himself and drowned and in a replay or something, I was wondering what they were going to do with Sucre since he was dead. Then some others and I, the others mainly from Prison Break, including Bellick, T-Bag and Eugene, were on the run. We went to this shop, which someone said was Ikea. The place was flooding and it had also flooded. The exhibits were on high platforms, under cover, but the rest of it was low down and outside and that was all flooded, so we could swim over to the platforms. There was a huge aquatic monster under the water which was passed out. We were running to get out. People were also in there after us. We got to the outside and there was a big gate which was locked. There was a fence all the way around it, which had glass on one side of it too. There was a little garden all along the inside of the fence. I found a head of a statue in the garden and started smashing the glass with it, it just left cracks and wouldn't smash. Sucre's cousin was outside as a guard, with the keys. One of the guys with us asked him to unlock it and he refused and I pleaded with him and said there was a monster right behind us and he looked worried and unlocked it. We started running and there was a long stretch of garden before you got the main road and we saw a police car drive past. I said that that was the first time in a long time they haven't stopped for us. Eugene realized The Company was waiting for us (and had made the police stay away from us) and he ran another way and we all followed. We ended up on this huge house block and there were big trees around and a fence around it. Eugene ran out onto this path behind it and some guys with guns chased him. This girl that was with us shot one of the guys through the fence. I reached through the fence and took his phone and gun. His phone was old like and it wasn't in colour (it had that greenish background and the plain black text). I put it in my pocket and asked the girl how to use the gun. She asked what I did know and I said ""I don't know, only what I've seen in the movies"". I pulled the bullet part out and some of the bullets were like rolls of camera film, which meant they'd been used. She went off and I pulled out this roll and it had bullets of different sizes (and they were battery like) in it. This girl was studying a road map of the house to work out how big it was and how many people were likely to be waiting around and the best way to get out. We ended up back at the Ikea and T-Bag told us to wait at this certain point just outside and then he started counting down and then there was a big roar. He had woken up the monster and it reached over the fence (over another side, but we worked out what was going on) and was taking The Company people."
"2631"	"(2009-01-30 (18)) I was watching Dexter, although it was something else at first. Dexter was with his sister and they were messing around and ended up having sex, a video camera was on and had recorded them. At first they were other people, I think and one of them said ""I can't kiss you, I love you"" and the guy smiled and pulled her close and they kissed. They left the apartment and the video of them started playing. Dexter banged on the wall to hide the sound. Dexter admitted to Rita and others that he was a murderer and Deb walked in angrily and said ""I slept with you!"" and Rita was shocked. Then I was at home and Mom and Ezra were there. Mom went out the back door to leave. This girl asked what I was doing this year and I mentioned MUPC and ""college"". Then I was at Mom's and she had this baby from next door over, I think, and it was noisy and I said ""shut up!""."
"2632"	"(2009-01-30 (18)) I was at school, which was different, for graduation. I saw some people wearing light pink gowns and I was told where to go to get mine. Elijah and I were complaining that they were pink. I saw Eugene there. The group of people I was with and I had white gowns though. Only a few were pink. I went to this place to get picked up. Seamus and Milo Ventimiglia were there. Milo asked what I was doing for the year and I said ""I don't know, thought I'd leave it to the last minute"". He asked if I did accounting last year and how I went and I said ""not very good"". I had my headphones from my iPod in my ears all this time and my ears were starting to hurt so I took them out. My ears still hurt and I couldn't hear properly out of my left ear. I checked the time on my phone and Milo leaned to look too. It was 4.14pm. I was thinking I'd go on IMDb and say 'Milo Ventimiglia went to my school'. I wondered why I hadn't made a fuss of it before. Mom and I went to Santiago's. We waited in the car and he handed me this sheet of paper with a list of songs on it and he wanted me to burn him a CD [burnt a CD for someone last night] . Grace Kelly was the first song on the list and he had ""Cold Pouring Rain -- Dragon"" and I figured he meant 'Rain'. Only some stations on the radio worked where we were, but they were all playing the same song. Next time we went there I gave the CD to Mom, who gave it to Santiago. He was talking loudly and fast. Some girl gave us these books with things to do for exercise but as they were expensive we just took one. It was just places to go which would require a lot of walking around and it was all stuff in the US or Europe; there were lots of pyramid places, giant mazes and museums."
"2633"	"(2009-01-31 (18)) I was watching Supernatural. I don't really remember it properly but Sam and Dean were both there. Then some others and I were shooting a TV show/mini-series/movie thing. It was about zombies. I was watching the first part of it and before this thing we were making there had been a prequel of what had happened before the show we were making and also some of the parts in between. In real life, this crazy fat girl was with us and I killed her friend or something and she was angry/upset with me and I suggested we tie her up. I locked something away in the safe. I changed the code so the other girl couldn't get in either. I changed it to 6456. The main character was a girl. The whole thing spanned years. Most of the movie used CGI. The sets were mostly green screen too. We were shooting a part in this small bushy area and I said ""the first bit of nature"". There was a weird possum thing in the tree. Then I spotted a giant lizard and some scraggly cat thing. It looked a bit like Cuddles. Mom said we should get 'Cuddles'. This scraggly thing was actually a boy and someone called it ""the father of her child"" (something to do with Cuddles). It kept chasing me. Mom had renamed her 'Princess' and Ezra was annoyed at this and said ""I'll kill Princess"". Then one of the characters looked like a young Chris Barrie. He got a call from some guy back home and said there was a pretend war going on. His scene included another guy, on top of a car. After the scene he said he'd been dared to put an extra knee up. Someone was saying how nice his hair looked, especially in that scene and said it was ""effervescent""."
"2634"	"(2009-01-31 (18)) I was watching Torchwood. Owen and Gwen were talking heatedly. It was some time after their affair had ended and Owen looked like he was getting angry and then they started making out."
"2635"	"(2009-01-31 (18)) It was the first day of the MUPC and it was right near where school is. It was a big place. There were about 20 people altogether and we were all staying there. We also had uniforms. There were three girls including me. The other two had done drugs and stuff in Year 12 and that was their reason for failing. There was a little booth outside and I asked the ladies behind the glass if I could change a subject, as I had drama, and I also had health as one of my subjects (it was like a normal school day). We had a fridge which would contain all our food. Elijah was also there. There is a Light That Never Goes Out was playing and I heard this of it: ""and if a ten ton truck kills the both of us, to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die"" and I was thinking there was something wrong with the lyrics (the two sentences are from different parts of the song)."
"2636"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was on IMDb reading about Six Feet Under and then was looking at Peter Krause's filmography and he wasn't in much. He was thanked for a narration on something."
"2637"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was watching Lost, although I'm not sure if it was, and Locke and others (from other shows as well) had to break into this giant shed, which had planes in it, in the middle of the forest. Some of them were on a plane and Locke was trying to distract the people outside. He was then on the roof and this girl up there suspected him and threatened to tell and there was a long drop to the bottom. They were both holding on to the edge and she let herself drop but he kept edging along to the water and when he got close he let himself fall. I was then there with some others, outside and it was night, and we had to get in. There were guards, but lots of bushes and things to hide behind along the way. We slowly made our way to the shed. This girl sacrificed herself so we could go (they arrested her, and then we snuck in while they were busy). I watched some comedy movie [it was new and Apatow like] . It was ok. Jack Black was in it and they had this thing to get rid of fire, which was a gigantic grey flap thing and he said it ""works like my kidneys"" and it was at the door or window and it 'breathed' and sucked the smoke and flames out. I was telling Ezra if he'd seen anything else similar to it. I went to the kitchen and Mom was there. I asked her if she had some food and Darren said ""pdf"" and he said it stood for ""do not prefer""."
"2638"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was on IMDb and I had my own page. I had been in a few things when I was younger, including Teletubbies. I also had a role in a movie from 2008 as 'agent'. Michael C. Hall was also in it. I didn't remember doing it. I was on my message board and I had a few comments. One guy was saying how I wasn't very good in some show I had been in when I was like four and because I'd been in another episode I must've known the director, as the same guy directed both those episodes. In the second episode I had a minor role as a dog and I barked once."
"2639"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was in the car with Mom and it was windy. There were these tent like buildings around, made of a thin see-through white material and as it was windy, these poles had been put in place to hold them and also gave them shape. Then Calvin and I were walking around outside. I wondered how deep the ""doopy things"" were and Calvin went and pulled one out and it was barely in the ground. He just dropped it and then we heard someone telling on him and he ran to put it back. This dude, who I thought was a teacher, asked him what his name was and he said ""Bluth, Michael Bluth"". We kept walking. Some parts were closed off and we had to take detours, but Calvin knew where to go so I followed him. We walked up this path which went up this hill and there was a rocky path. He suddenly jumped off the edge and I went to follow but realized it was a long fall and went to stop, but I slipped and was then hanging onto the edge. Calvin laughed. I started edging across until I got to a lower part and then I dropped off. A guy who looked like Bellick (Prison Break) was standing around and he had recorded it. I took a photo with my phone of the 'cliff' thing. Then we went to the Science Museum with Ezra. I said ""I haven't been here for years"". There was a poster on the wall when you first walk in, saying ""squeal for 12 seconds"". Calvin made a squeal and it was like a distorted echo and so I did one squeal. He kept going for a while. Ezra slowly came in after us and I motioned for him to come over. Everything was close together and it looked like Timezone. Two girls were playing air hockey and a guy was waiting for them to finish."
"2640"	"(2009-02-02 (18)) I can't remember properly, but my fourth top tooth on my left side was a bit loose. For years, whenever I touched it, it hurt. Dad got a 'bill' from a place for money from a song that I hadn't paid for and it cost like $900. I had to write some people down and Mom said ""she's got 15 people"". Dad thought I was going to blame Austin for the money. This all had something to do with my tooth. Ezra was there. We left there and I was with Mom and Ezra. I asked Mom which tooth and as she said a 'strong' tooth, I pulled it out. I wiped the gum and this black stuff was on it. I was watching Dexter, I think and Dexter and Deb were talking about their favourite 'team' or something and it was made up. There was something about Torchwood."
"2641"	"(2009-02-02 (18)) There were zombies. They were different though, some were fast, some just lay about, some were smart, some were crazy etc. Because of this people still called them people, instead of zombies. They could also open doors. I wandered into a house and there were some zombies walking around. Then there had been a large family there. They were running about and they were trying to guard the back door from them. Too many zombies were in though. Then I was there and I had a pole and a butcher knife. I stabbed them in the heart (they were killed from being stabbed in the heart). Some were harder than others so I had to slit the throat of one and stab him a heap of times. The house was small and I used this girl as a shield. I went to the back door and there were heaps of them. The girl screamed and slipped out, so I gave her a push and closed the door. Eventually, no-one else was around. I was closing and locking doors and turning off the lights. Then the house was different. It was big and I was with others. Some of it was very glassy. It was also night time. This black girl there was very bossy and she suggested we go outside to do something. Before we went I had locked all the doors. We went out and then we realized all the doors were locked and we couldn't get back in. It was a really nice house and it was pretty well designed. There were back lights everywhere and they were on. There were also buildings across the street, and some had lights on. We got in a car and drove through a brick wall of a different building across the street. We all climbed up and into a room on the second floor (hotel like). We sat on the bed, which was right at the wall. Some cars and motorbikes drove past. There was then a window where we had smashed through and it slid together and I was holding them together. I asked for someone to turn off the light but the black girl kept refusing. I kept asking and no-one would. I got an email from Simon Pegg who was surprised that I was dead and I replied ""yo, not dead"" and said that I was trapped because of a girl and ended the email with ""stay surviving!"". I let go of the window to type and then I had visions of people going past and opening it, which creeped me out. We decided to just stay here for the night and I was annoyed as it would've been nice at the big house and it was safer there."
"2642"	"(2009-02-03 (18)) I was in a shop. I had instructions from some bad guy to go to some shop, but I can't remember what it was called. I was on the phone to the person as I tried to find it. I found it and went in. It had wedding dresses on both sides of the shop, therefore obscuring the view from other shoppers outside the shop. I was told to knock out the person working there, so I kept hitting him over and over but he just got a bit groggy. Then I had to find some 'creature in the dark corner' and I found it and it was a white cat like thing. I don't know what it did, but then I heard police sirens. I used the back door of the shop to leave, which took me outside. The cops were already in the carpark and I had a thing to change my appearance and so I changed into a fat lady. They asked me some questions and then left me alone. I had taken my shoes off in the store and so sat down to put them on. I turned back to normal and then I ran from them. I had a gun and the bad guy told me to shoot the cops, so I shot two of them and then more came and I'd run out of bullets. I got close to a cop and pulled something off the gun, so he couldn't shoot. I got away from them. Then 'I' was a creepy guy with a moustache. He was staying at a ""halfway house"". People there thought he was dodgy. He had this huge room and never interacted with anybody. This little old man was starting to get suspicious and so the creepy guy invited him over. I thought he was going to kill him, but he was just trying to look friendly so they left him alone. The lady who worked there was also starting to get suspicious."
"2643"	"(2009-02-03 (18)) I was at school. There were lots of people and it was the first day back. I was trying to pick out the new Year 11's and Year 12's. There was a tall guy and a girl with big boobs wearing a low cut top. I couldn't remember the quickest way to leave and there were two sets of steps and I didn't know which one to go down. Then I was in the car in the carpark next to North Midvale with Daryl, who was driving. There were kids around and two of them walked in front and we waited for them to go across. They didn't so I got out and they very little and one was just walking into the side of the car and I said ""Go around, tard!"". Some teenage boys were around and they laughed. I got back in and we drove backwards, I saw something get flung across the carpark onto the oval (the long way of the carpark). Then we were walking. When we walked past, I saw the thing that had got flung was a baby/small kid, which was dead and had blood on it. We just walked past it. Samantha and others were with us too. We all had remotes for the X-Box 360 remote, which attached us to another person. I was connected to Daryl. We got to wherever we were going and then left and were walking again. We no longer had to stay together and the remote was plugged in to the back of my head and I pulled it out, which felt strange. I said ""that's been in there for 3 days!"". Elijah walked past and as he did he waved his jumper in front of me. I forgot who had walked past me and I thought 'was that Dmitri?'. Then I realized it was Elijah and we laughed. Then I was at school again and the MUPC was there. There were seven of us. People actually at the school were sitting at other tables. We were all seated around one. The guy teaching us said our first assignment was to find a female 'athlete'. The first girl who was asked who she'd partner up with and her Asian girlfriend, who was also in the class, did some sort of athletic activity so they paired up. This guy got asked and he said he didn't know anyone and the teacher said to ""get your head out of your ass"". Peyton (One Tree Hill) was there and she worked out and she thought the guy was dodgy so to save us both from getting paired with him, she paired up with me. We got called to this bar to watch something on the TV. It showed a nice looking waterfall in a nice forest, which the two winners of our class would get a trip to. It also included bungee jumping. Then there were clips of 'us' from our competing, which was in the form of a TV show. I looked like Eve Myles at first, then I looked like a different person, but was still a lot older (mid-20's). It showed 'me' in a forest, by myself and it was dark and spooky and something was making noises or something and I was making squealing noises. I was rating songs on my iPod, getting ready for the trip. The only song I remember rating was Blue Monday."
"2644"	"(2009-02-04 (18)) I had one day of school left. That morning though, I had no clean school clothes. I wore a white long-sleeved shirt under my shirt. I was at home and Dad and Ezra were there. I was making a microwave meal for breakfast. Ezra was in his bedroom had some giant thing that I don't remember attached to him and it was for MIS. There was a documentary on the TV about a dangerous monkey thing. It showed it eating and drinking at some water. A crocodile came and it bit it and then let go and then the crocodile left. The camera shifted to this other monkey in a tree and then I felt something scratch my back and I freaked out and woke up. When I woke up, I jumped and hit my elbow on the wall."
"2645"	"(2009-02-04 (18)) I was dating some guy and then we sort of broke up. Then it was One Tree Hill and he was Nathan and I was Haley. He had then slept with Brooke, in the four days they had spent apart, and he regretted it, but he didn't know whether to tell Haley. In real life, I was trying to sleep. Mom and Ezra kept waking me up. Dad came over to and woke me. I said I didn't get to bed until late. The first time they woke me up I'd only been asleep for about an hour."
"2646"	"(2009-02-04 (18)) I was at school but I didn't know why I was there. I, along with some others, got invited to spend some time with Barack Obama. He was doing a speech to some Europeans. This lady had written down some notes for the speech but he couldn't read her writing. I had a quick look and got 'inertia'. Her writing was very long, straight and close together. They then gave some people cue cards instead. Two of the important people left and he couldn't start his speech, so he tried to stall it. Calvin was there too. Obama was giving people prizes. He handed around a cardboard box full of little stuff. There was a Star Wars action figure in there, I took a pencil thing. When he finished, we got sent to a class to wait. Lorelei was talking to some black kid and said ""you're bi"" and proceeded to say how bad it is being gay and as I walked past, I said 'idiot' under my breath. I called Mom and told her to get me. Izaiah was in the room and he asked if I'd done some thing with Ms Myzshka (don't remember how to spell it) and I said no and he said he'd told someone that I had added her as a friend on Facebook and so I hadn't been allowed to do whatever the thing was."
"2647"	"(2009-02-05 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I had been dating some guy. We had to break up for some reason. I had this person/creature for some experiment. It got to the car and then we took it back. Some other people had better facilities and he decided to leave us to go with them. In the car I begged him (the creature) to come back. I was upset. I found out something and I was on Facebook and was trying to type an apology to Elijah because we had dated, although I wondered why I hadn't remembered about it before now."
"2648"	"(2009-02-05 (18)) I was out with some people, including Dad and the rest were adults too. It was night. Some guy had given me marijuana earlier. He asked when I was going to pay him back and I said 'you never said anything about payment, I didn't even want it' etc. Dad had given him some money before hand as well. I went home after that. Mom was there. Then I was near a forest-like park with Emery, his 'older brother' and someone else. It was still night. I can't remember what we did, but it was illegal and we saw cops coming and we all ran into the forest. I hid behind a tree, and Emery's brother hid behind another tree. The cops found Emery, then his brother and then me. They handcuffed them, but not me. I noticed my left shoe was on fire and I was stepping on it with my other foot to try and put it out, but it wouldn't go out. I don't know what happened to it though. I dropped my water bottle at the top of the hill near home. As the cop was doing something with Emery, his brother ran off. I almost went with him, but decided not to. I didn't say anything. When we went to continue walking home, the cop realized he was gone, but didn't bother looking for him. His brother came back though. Then he and Emery took off and came back again. Some people were complaining that they were naughty and having to take care of them. After I woke up (in real life), I discovered that Emery had gotten suspended for blowing up a lighter."
"2649"	"(2009-02-06 (18)) We went to a restaurant, like Retro Betty's. We were in two groups; one included Mom and the other had Dad and Ezra. Mom said ""We're here for Brad Pitt's birthday"" and the lady took us to a table that only seated four and I said 'no, we want to sit together'. She left and we all sat in this booth in the far corner. I had to sit next to Ezra. Then I was somewhere else and climbed up this ladder onto a platform. There were shopping bags up there, filled with lots of biscuits and chocolate snacks and bread. It was our shopping from weeks ago that we had forgotten about. I took all the bread out, as it was all moldy but took down the bags with the snacks and went to show Mom. She was next door. I went over and there was an old lady there and they made me take over the vacuum and vacuum this small patch of carpet in the lounge. They went into the dining room or something. There were two cockroaches on the kitchen tiles and I called out and told them but they said not to worry and continue vacuuming. Then I was playing a game, like Sims 2. I had to pick a setting for the Sim and other random stuff like that, as well as creating them. There were a few backgrounds which were really detailed, but they made it look cluttered and I couldn't decide on what to do. This guy told me to not try and make it fancy and just make it how I want it."
"2650"	"(2009-02-07 (18)) It was night, around 3am. I was at Mom's, which was different. My room had a door leading outside. There was a knock on the door. I didn't want to answer, so Mom did. It was a guy saying there'd been an accident and Simba was standing behind him and we thought he'd been hit. There was a car with a smashed light. Then Granma and Uncle Gabriel were around and we went to their place. There was a picture on the wall of some leader whose name started with an 'S'. It was an alien girl and I was thinking it was from a science fiction book. Then it was the next morning, I think, and a lot of people had died. There were ghosts (or something) of Dad and Ezra on the lounge. I thought they had died and I told them to touch my knee and they went right through it. It turned out that at some point last night everyone who was touching another person, skin to skin, had died. This also applied now. It showed a prison and a prisoner reached through the cell and touched the guard and they both screamed and died. I was then outside in a forest. There was a teenage girl and I went to ask her something and tapped her arm. She turned making an 'erggh' sound and her eyes started to bleed and she fell, but I was ok (it was later discovered that sometimes the 'dominant' person would be ok and if they were the 'same' they would be ok, I never really understood what the rules were). I ended up getting caught in the forest. The people there could put these things on their head so nothing would happen if they got touched. One of them looked like Sigourney Weaver. The leader guy told her to kill me, but she whispered to me to go along with her plan. She pretended to touch me and I fell to the floor, then it wasn't me and this other person touched 'my' leg to make sure. I later met up with Eugene. We were staying in a house together, sleeping in two single beds. After being together for a while, I was thinking that if I was going to die anyway, I may as well kiss him (not thinking that it could kill him) and so while we were talking, I leant over and kissed him, but we were both ok."
"2651"	"(2009-02-07 (18)) I was out the back of Mom's old house. There were round fat fish in the fish pond, which had legs and a face that was duck-like. I was talking to one of them and this guy was there, I think. Someone complained about waiting for Ezra and Dad. We were getting the money for MUPC together. Mom asked me something. I was later on my computer and my desktop was of Supernatural."
"2652"	"(2009-02-08 (18)) I started watching this show from the early 90's. It was set in a prison. They showed this guy and I said ""is that Bellick [Prison Break] ?!"" and I was thinking 'not again!'. In real life, he had been turning up in things I was watching."
"2653"	"(2009-02-08 (18)) It was my birthday or a little while after. We were at Mom's old house and I was in my room on my laptop/computer. My aircon was still in the window, but it was hanging out quite a bit, so I pulled it in a little. One of Mom's friends had given her a birthday present to give to me. It was a bracelet. I started complaining in disgust and told her to get rid of it. She told Ezra to put it in my room and I said to put it in the bin. I used one of those metal grabby hands to pick it up and I threw it in the bin in the kitchen. There were cones with chocolate eggs in them and I was eating one."
"2654"	"(2009-02-09 (18)) I was at a shop with Mom. The girl at the checkout was talking to Mom. I was looking down at the ground. I'd gotten a couple of lolly things and I said that I had been craving them. I looked up and realized the girl serving us had gone to one my schools for about a week or something. She didn't seem to recognize me. I was then on the internet and I was trying to find out stuff about Grey and what the toy was called. I found pictures of toy rabbits made by the same people. I read something about Facebook where this person had said ""it used to be MySpace, and now everyone is obsessed with Facebook"". Ezra still had his Grey and it had a tag with an internet address on it. I thought that was odd since the internet wasn't very popular when they came out. Dad and Ezra were watching a movie preview and it said 'shake it' and I thought 'they better not say 'like a Polaroid picture'' and then they said ""like a Polaroid picture"" and I said ""I knew he was going to say that!"" and was annoyed at Hey Ya. I found a site of some lady who would try and guess a word (to test out psychic ability or something). She had the word she guessed and the actual word. They were all really close. One of them was her guess was 'foot' and the word was 'food'. I was then walking with a girl outside. She could control people and so was making people do funny things. The cops were coming up the road so she made this person walk out in the road and almost got hit, so they came back and she made me start yelling at them. We got sent to a building. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were working there and they were the only people there. They interrogated us, but it was in the room in which you first enter the building. Jared got us to write down what had happened and Jensen did our fingerprints. The other girl finished first and it was my turn to get fingerprinted. Jensen called me over and I felt nervous. I asked if I just had to sit down and he said yeah. It was at a small table which was against the wall of that room, with one seat on either side. He did my prints, although it was only 3 fingers from one hand and two fingers from the other. Then we were having 'dinner', and I had two sandwiches except they looked like a CBA. We had a glass of yellow wine each. I dipped my finger in it and tasted it. It was sort of warm and I asked if could have water, saying I don't even drink coke and I was thinking of saying I don't even drink orange juice but couldn't be bothered. He convinced me to drink the wine, so I did. I was worried it was pee at one point. Then there was someone else there, I think, and they were worried that I was going to sneak off. Some real cops came and Jared told me to run now and I shrugged and kept eating. The person worried about me leaving mentioned they had cameras (so they would notice me leaving). Jensen and I finished the wine at the same time. He flirted with me a lot. A while later I needed to pee. I walked out of the building by myself and went to the toilet somewhere. I came back though. Jensen went to take a shower. I started exploring the place and I walked past the shower. It was open and he was facing away but he was naked, and I looked away and kept walking. There was a shelf with games and books on it and I recognized most of it from when I was younger. Jared and a lady joined me and I was going through the stuff going 'I remember this!' and excitedly looking at the stuff. Jensen came out, with a towel around him and asked what was happening. The others and I joked we were ignoring him and said ""let's go play Monopoly"". I then got a blood nose and when I turned around it splattered all over Jensen's towel. We started laughing. Jensen and I were laughing quite hard and I couldn't stop. I thought it may be because of the wine. There was a section with the recordings from the cameras and they were in video tape covers. One of them had 'Rose Red' written on it. I remembered misspelling Jared's name once as 'Jared Pinalecki'. I then woke up and I was in the passenger seat of a car. It was running and I was alone. It was daytime. I locked the doors. I had some of my dreams that I'd written down and I had a book where I was giving people character profiles. One of them said 'Guitar -- Dmitri' and I thought it was about Nathan Kohler. This guy in a grey shirt walked past the driver's window. I couldn't see his head though as it went higher than the roof. A little while later, he came back and started trying to open the driver's door. I still couldn't see his face. Although it was locked, it opened a little and I tried to pull it closed again. I was thinking I should start the car up and drive away."
"2655"	"(2009-02-10 (18)) I was at home. I woke up at 9am and called Mom to pick me up. She said she was busy and would get me soon. At one point, Valerie had come over. Farrah was talking to me in my room. I remember hearing a boy talking and thinking it was Jamison. I called at 7pm, as I was still there and she said she was out and I asked if Darren could get me. A few minutes later he came and got me. We were then at Mom's old house and I went to my room. My bunk was on the opposite side of the room and there were blow up dolls on it. I shared the bed with someone else. I then went to a Science Museum like place. It also had animals. They were able to leave their 'cages' and wander around. The rooms were huge and the doors were just frames, so you just walked through to each room. I was with Calvin, but he was sometimes Ezra. We were inside, at the entrance. I was taking photos of the animals. There was a fox like thing and I pet it through the cage. There was a cage with a rhino, although I don't even think it was a rhino, it was small. It came out of the cage and I jumped onto the reception desk (the cage was about a meter in front of it). The desk was higher than the rhino. The lady behind the desk complained as I had knocked some of her stuff. I got back down, but it came back and I jumped up again, knocking her stuff again. There were Sims 2 and 3 magazines on the floor. The rhino ate something off it. It started to walk around the desk and so I jumped off and snuck out of the room. Ezra was in the next room. I said the rhino was out and we frantically tried to find somewhere to hide. There was an 'exhibit' on the wall, which had a section in the shape of a door painted black. People would run/walk into it and it would look like they had disappeared. We ran into that, as I thought it would have a room behind it and the rhino thing wouldn't even see it. But, we ended up sitting in a plastic red tube with an opening. As the rhino would see us, we got out of it. There was another wall thing next to it and I 'opened' it but it was just this sparkly, colourful display. I thought that'd attract him so we went into the next room. It led back out near the entrance and I could see the rhino, which was now a big lizard-y thing (a dinosaur?) and was skulking around the desk still. There were two glass doors a few meters away (quite far from the lizard thing though). Ezra and I crept over to it, keeping ourselves low and opened the door. We ran down the sets of steps and continued running. Then I was with Calvin again and as I ran across the road we hailed a taxi, which was yellow. He talked to the driver through the window, about to give her the money and I started getting in the back seat. She told me to close the door and get out. Then she shouted at me ""Don't you know who I am?!"" and took the money and drove off. She was famous or something and she was known to just take money off people and drive off (that was how she worked). Then I looked over at the city and the 'rhino' was now a huge monster and was stomping around. I was thinking 'Cloverfield!'. We started running down the street, along with lots of others. Only a few cars were on the road. The city, though, was actually really far away."
"2656"	"(2009-02-11 (18)) I was at home. Dad was locking the back door. I was locking up the front door and some teenage boys were hanging around out the front. I closed the wood door quietly and Dad told me not to put the chain on yet incase they heard it. I suggested we put the aircon on so that the curtains would stick to the windows and therefore block the view. He said it would attract them. Then I had my own house thing. It was like glass all around. I was outside and it was night and I asked Dad to walk me to it. The door was open and the light was on inside. It had been trashed. Dad said that it smelled. It was just a big lounge room; I don't remember seeing any other rooms. There were yellow bags and towels that had stains on them. It looked like someone had had a party. I asked him to help clean. It had a sliding door and I pushed them together and put Blu-Tak in the middle of them to hold them together. People kept coming and I kept shooing them away. Calvin came and I let him in. I was cold and I touched his neck for some reason and it was warm. Mom came later. Samantha came as well and I let her in. We ended up getting a security guard, who was Anastasia. The house/room ended up full of people. It was now a shop. There was a food shop to the left side of the entrance; the rest of the shop was just a walkway I think. I was telling people they had to leave. There was a scary Native man and I said ""Excuse me sir, you have to leave, no-one's allowed here"". This girl walked out of a checkout and as she walked through the scanner things, it beeped and she quickly showed the person behind the counter something inside her bag and then hid it back in there. I went over and asked what it was and she wouldn't tell me. I grabbed it and opened it and she called out for help. I said ""it's my store!"". It was a heart rate monitor and someone else came for a closer look and she snatched it from me and swallowed it. I was thinking that I swallowed 'In a Big Country' once. I saw someone walking as if they'd just entered the shop. It looked like Rodney so I called out ""Rodney!"". He turned around and I told him to leave and he said ""Why do we have to leave and how'd you know my name?"". I said ""I know your brother [Eugene] "", he said ""Pants off"" and I looked at him strangely and then asked ""Did you say pants off?"" and he said ""Yeah, everyone knows him with his pants off"". I laughed and said ""No, I don't know him with his pants off""."
"2657"	"(2009-02-13 (18)) I was at some meeting thing and we had made food. This lady had some chicken thing and it looked really nice and I told her that. Later, I couldn't find my iPod and I realized I'd left it in her bag. I went to her house and broke in with someone else. I wanted a game off her computer so I plugged in the iPod to transfer it but I had trouble finding it. She came home and I got my friend to stall her. She left again though and I just left after that, without the game."
"2658"	"(2009-02-13 (18)) Ezra and I shared a computer, at the same time though. I was playing Runescape and left the computer for a second. When I came back he was also playing Runescape in a different window. We played with the windows side by side. I was annoyed at this setup because I couldn't listen to music. I could hear the faint sound of cats meowing and I thought it was Kiki. Mom and others sent a list of cats they had sold and points they had gotten for each one and also an intelligence rating. Mom's intelligence rating was high and it said that because of the rating it was, she could own three cats (which was supposed to be a high amount). Tabby cats got no points."
"2659"	"(2009-02-14 (18)) I was at the cinema and I saw a movie and when it finished I called Mom to get me and she said she was on her way. I was then waiting outside the cinema for Mom (although sometimes it was a school).  There was a very orange cat on the opposite side of the road. This guy came and stepped on its head, squishing it. I got upset, angry and scared. I climbed up this scaffolding thing (others were sitting around on it too) to get away. I sat there for a while but then I didn't know how to get down and I asked this girl near me. She said to just jump. I jumped down and then waited for Mom. In the movie, I think, I was walking in a forest. I think sometimes it was someone else and in the movie, sometimes it was me in real life. I was yelling to someone and they shouted back from a distance. In the background I could hear breathing. I found a clearing. This girl had a friend (a loner she had befriended) who wandered off into the bush all the time. There had been a nuclear bomb or something and I can't remember properly, but I think the loner had slipped and hit her head and this had turned her into a werewolf. There was a baby and I said ""ugly baby"". Mom said ""Yeah that is an ugly baby"". I was thinking I'd never heard her call a baby ugly. In the distance, I could see the city burning."
"2660"	"(2009-02-14 (18)) I went to 'Subway' with Mom. I was going to get a soup but Mom decided to get me a pie. Mom said ""that boy came over sometime"" and I saw Eugene sitting a few tables away staring over his shoulder at me. He was with Bradley, Jeremiah and others. I said I knew them from school. I was wearing my new brown shirt and Eugene was wearing the same one. The pie had almost 40 grams of fat in it and I said I wasn't going to eat it, but then I took a few bites. I got my phone out and put it on silent and changed the settings so I could take some sneaky pictures of Eugene. He had some facial hair now, but it was pretty hot. They then left, but Jeremiah and Mom got into an argument. I ended up going with Eugene and we went in his car with his father driving. We stopped somewhere and Eugene looked around at us, stared at me for a second and I went to get my phone ready again. Then we kept going and we went to his house. His father Abraham said we were welcome here and I could see a park just up the road. I pretended not to know where we were. I was thinking this was the best idea I'd ever had (going with Eugene instead of Mom). We were standing outside but then we were like, underneath the road but could see through it and Eugene was doing something to it (can't read my writing). I again tried to take a photo. Then there was a movie and it had Eugene dressed up as a lumberjack standing next to a good-looking fireman guy, and it was a test for women (most picked the fireman)."
"2661"	"(2009-02-15 (18)) I went to University. I went with a couple who were really chatty. One of them was going to work in a different country. Dad sent me a text with names of songs and told me to act confident. My class was math and it was like the introduction. We had a male teacher and he gave me a problem, but I had no paper or books so he gave me paper. Then he began talking about Africa and how people from TV shows went there and he mentioned someone from Heroes. As we left, I think, I was with some people and Raj (The Big Bang Theory) and others were standing next to me. Raj was talking to someone and then realized he was talking with girls around. Then someone thought I liked my teacher and I was thinking 'ew, he looks like Ric Ocasek' and 'All I Wanted' was playing. I was walking to the library and I saw Darius hanging around near it. I went in and was on the second level. It was small and there were a couple of shelves with a few books on them. It was crowded with young kids and they were there for a speech. The teacher closed the door and so I opened it and left. I walked down and went to the lower level. There was a shop in there and it was huge and the section next to me was girl's clothes. I was thinking it was bigger than the K-Mart we'd been in the other day. There was another girl with me and she was like 'whoa'. I was going to take a photo of the place to show Mom but the menu on my phone was different and I didn't know what to do. I turned off the sound first and then got confused. There were lots of people. I was walking around and I was in the men's section and there was a long sleeved shirt and I touched it and it was really soft. It was $100. Then this lady discovered the girl I was with wasn't with the University and asked me if I also wasn't and I said ""I'm a student"". I walked around to the desk later and it was the lady who had caught the girl out. I said I needed to get my ID card and she took me to the computer area."
"2662"	"(2009-02-18 (18)) I was watching some G-Rated movie. I can't really remember it, but these kids lived in a big house. One of them accidentally broke a mirror or window and the person they lived with was angry. A while later the maid (or something) smashed some glass and told off the girl who had broken the glass earlier and she got in trouble for it instead of the maid. Then two people were in a room. They weren't allowed in there and someone was coming. Then I was one of them and we got into the closet and hid in there. The door of the closet started opening but when I looked out, the room was different and nobody was in there. I was thinking the movie was just a rip off of Chronicles of Narnia. There were Pokemon around. For Mewtwo to be 'free', I had to rub him against something until an extra 6hp was given to his opponent. Then I was playing a game and I said ""Is this like Super Mario Galaxy?"". I was in a shop like place and I walked into this room and there was a werewolf in a chair and he said something funny and ""my name is Fred"". There were zombies too, but they were joke-like. I had to paint stuff in the room to get to the next room. I had red and yellow paint. I got to the next room and there were three guard dogs but they were friendly. In real life, Ezra had a friend over. We picked them up from their house. We thought he wouldn't come, but he did. Mom was driving. We went to the cinema. The seats were in weird places, some facing the back of the cinema as well. It was pretty full and a big room. Calvin was sitting in a backwards seat right near where we walked in and he said to sit next to him and I said no. While we were talking, a lady (who I thought was his mother) asked why I was moving like that (I was trying to crack my back) and I said I had a ""sore back"". She said that's why I should eat Broccoli, because it was good for muscles and I said that it was my favourite vegetable. I sat down in a chair on the other side of the cinema. On the screen, Lost was playing. I only saw Sawyer and it had already started (it was actually the movie that I had been watching before) and then it said the movie we'd come to see started in 7 minutes."
"2663"	"(2009-02-19 (18)) I was in a big room on a computer. Nana was nearby. I was behind the desk facing her. She thought I was masturbating and told Dad and he was like 'Well, she's 18, why not?' etc. I kept trying to convince her that I wasn't and that I wouldn't do that, it's disgusting etc. She emailed me later apologizing for overreacting, but refused to believe I wasn't actually doing it. Later meetings were awkward."
"2664"	"(2009-02-19 (18)) I was in the car with Mom and we were driving. Darren was at her window as she drove along and I asked how he just stayed there. We went to this guy's house and there were cops across the road. The guy got in and Mom took him around the corner. I was watching Penn & Teller: Bullshit later and they were walking towards and then down a step. They walked past this guy and Teller was taller than him and I remembered that Teller was actually normal height and the guy must be pretty small. Penn still towered over Teller like normal."
"2665"	"(2009-02-19 (18)) I found a site which had photos of Westland University students. I found mine. I wondered what Brent's last name was and there were a few Brent's, so I just clicked on Brent Palmer, thinking I'd heard that somewhere before, but there was no picture for him so I gave up. I found a State University site which had photos of their students so I looked for Eugene's photo but I couldn't find it."
"2666"	"(2009-02-20 (18)) I can't remember anything else, but Teller had a weird house."
"2667"	"(2009-02-20 (18)) I was watching a movie with Ezra. A girl was waiting for a guy on the beach. It was night. She lay down to wait. She started to rub her belly button with her finger and then put her hand in her pants. She grabbed something and put it in her pants and turned over and masturbated. Then she pulled it out and it was this bit of watermelon and she called it a 'bon bon' and ate it. Then I was with some people and we were mucking around, throwing things etc. Then I was naked and holding a blanket to cover myself. Then there was something about how years ago, some guy from the sky told these people something. Then he told some guys that in the past only two women were given a wish and they wanted to get married. Then everyone was allowed to get married and there was a lot of resistance from men and it cost a lot."
"2668"	"(2009-02-21 (18)) I was somewhere and this guy was there that looked like Andy (One Tree Hill) and I asked ""are you the guy in One Tree Hill?"" and he smiled and said yeah and I said ""Andy?"" and he said yeah. A few minutes later I asked if he had been on Lost too and he confirmed it. I was then a bad guy. I later remembered he had been in Prison Break too and lots of episodes of The Outer Limits but I didn't annoy him about it. Poppa had bought Poppers a new spa. Their house was different and in like a Mexican village. They were going to put up a second floor for him. Dad was there. We were on the balcony. I told Nana it was silly because Poppers couldn't walk up the stairs. There were chickens in cages behind me."
"2669"	"(2009-02-21 (18)) Two people and I went to a park at night for a meeting. I can't remember properly but we had no money or a place to stay. This nervous guy gave me a note and then walked off. It said to not turn around and that snipers were about to execute us. I saw a red dot on one of the people I was with and I said ""get down!"" and we ran out. I had weapons so I was shooting back at them. One of the snipers died and the other was ok. I searched the dead guy and it was like Fallout 3 and I took his stuff and then killed the other guy. I told my friend to search him."
"2670"	"(2009-02-21 (18)) I was watching Lost. This actress (can't remember who) kissed this guy underwater and I thought ""that looks like Ethan (Lost)"" and it was. She said he tasted nice and he said ""I didn't think you liked the taste of cigarettes"". She thought he tasted like soap. There was an interview with the actress and she said she was shocked at how turned on by the kiss she was. Then I was somewhere else and there were room. A Nightmare on Elm Street movie was playing in one of them. I went in and Ethan was like ""try to attack me"" so we closed the door. It changed to House of 1000 Corpses and there was a party for New Years or something. Mom was there. Hancock was the only movie on TV. There was a baby on the screen and it was when they did a dance, but it was near the end [made up storyline for it] . Mom said ""it's near the end"". Then I was on an island with some others. There had been a plane crash and it was like Lost. We had locked ourselves in this big enclosed outside area, as we thought 'others' were around. There was a hole in the door and I saw an eye peering through and then went away. I said ""Did you see that eye?"". As I walked up to the door, two girls hugged and kissed. I looked through the hole and then the eye came back up to it. It was a blue eye. I asked if it was Ben (Lost) because the eye looked like it belonged to Michael Emerson. He asked if I was Izzy. I stood back in shock and we let him in. He looked and sounded like Michael Emerson, but it wasn't. Then it was a show/movie. This lady, who I think was Gwen (Torchwood), lost her son and husband in the crash. She hadn't had a chance to cry yet and then I was her and I started crying. It felt good. Then it was the movie again and Mom was watching and she was like 'pfft, she's just looking for attention'."
"2671"	"(2009-02-22 (18)) I was watching Lost. Ben, Jack and someone else were around. I think Ben had set up all these things they had to do before they could get back to the island. They went into a building and this guy they needed, got in trouble because he had some metal thing in his back and when he walked through the sensors, they had detected it. They were supposed to go and rescue some person in 84 minutes, but then another person was in trouble and they had 30 minutes to help them. A bomb was going to go off. Ben, Jack, someone else and I ran out of the city and up this hill and across this thin bridge. I asked ""Is this far enough?"" and ""Why do we have to cross this bridge instead of just running across the hill?"" Ben said that there were 'too many chances for bad options'. The bomb went off. There was a red 'bubble' over the city and then over us. We went orange. Ben said it was just a light now (instead of a bomb) because we had gotten something from the island (and so were ok). Someone showed off to this girl later that they had stopped the bomb. I was then in a comic book shop with others. The shelves were really neat. I was told to 'steal' this card but then the mother of a person I was with, ushered us out. I put my phone down on the shelf and then when we got to the exit I said I'd left my phone and ran back to get it and took the card as well. As we left the alarm sounded and the gate of the shop went down. Police were around and they had their guns out. I handed over the card and got arrested. I was waiting with a cop's daughter at a computer. They sorted out the arrest and then we walked with her. As everything was weird I asked ""Are we in Spain?"". We got to a car park. He told her to stop and he had a gun with a red bit on it, at her head. She was like 'you're not going to shoot me' and then he did. I ran and opened the door to a taxi (that was driving) but it was the opposite side of the driver (American car). He pulled a gun on me, so I let go. Then this weird carriage like car was there and this weird guy was sleeping in it. I pushed him out and driving it with my foot all the way down and it could only go a maximum of 40km/h. I was going down a dark, forest-y road. I got to a deli and then it was day. I asked the guy if I could borrow a car and I had little money. He said ok. Most of the cars there were manual but there was a van which was auto and manual. These guys came with guns and the guy and I pushed a van in their way. I ended up pushing it on top of a bad guy and he laughed and was like ""now you'll squish my hands"". I shot this other guy. The deli guy got shot and I apologized and he said it was ok. As I was walking around, most of the people at the deli were dead. There was a car, which was obviously a girl's car, which was an automatic. She was nearby, dead, and I took her pink shoes and then her car. I can't remember properly, but we went up there later and gave the car back"
"2672"	"(2009-02-22 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was watching a movie with Tom Hanks [watched You've Got Mail last night] ."
"2673"	"(2009-02-23 (18)) I can't remember much, but Dennis (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) was somewhere and he was being arrogant. There were girls around."
"2674"	"(2009-02-24 (18)) I was at 'school'. Some of my classes were with Ezra. They had light blue shirts with a giant paw print on them. Then, Mom (although she seemed different) and I found a way to go back in time. We had to like run through a field. In the middle of the field, I had to grab this rope and pull myself along the grass (I was lying down on it). It was hard to do. Then I was somewhere else, in some water. There were men there from say, the 1800's and were pirate/captain-y like. They were also in the water and they couldn't see me, but could feel me and so I had to make sure they didn't touch me. They walked near me and I went under the water. This cat was watching me. They followed the cats stare and saw me lying on the bottom of the water, but they actually saw me as a black bear. Then I was in a room, near the door. A friend of Mom's was coming over and she told me to say that I was her sister. I looked through the side of the door (where the hinges join) and saw a girl standing in the hall. She asked who I was and Mom said ""my sister"". A while later I took my clothes off to do something. Then Santiago, Mom and Darren came in and I asked Mom for a shirt. Then, I was outside somewhere. Charlie (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Liam McPoyle (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were there. We were messing around. Charlie was in some water and Liam was being creepy. Charlie was going to chase me, so I ran. I ran into this castle like place and was trying not to laugh, but I was also worried about him catching me. I tried to lock the front door but it was too hard so I ran around the corner into a hallway for the toilet. I closed the first door, but it wouldn't lock, so I ran to the next door and tried to lock it. It wouldn't lock at first, but then it did. But, it was low down and there were cubicles of toilets behind me. Someone came in and it was Liam. He looked over the top. I was fairly exhausted by this point and said ""Nooo, I need to pee!"". I couldn't stop thinking 'Rose Red!' when I saw him. I'm not sure what this was, but there was a car crash. The guy ran out to protect his girlfriend and then the car blew up. Then she saw 'herself' run to the car to save her boyfriend. They were dead, but didn't know that."
"2675"	"(2009-02-24 (18)) I was at a place looking for help with a 'school project'. It was a sheet of paper with questions about boating. One of the questions was about George Clooney's wife. Everywhere I looked, it said he was married to an Asian lady, but there were no photos of him and an Asian lady. I had joked they had taken all the answers to the questions off the net. I was near some water (the ocean I suppose) and there was a blob in the water. These guys blew it up and this guy's house was really close to the edge of where they blew it up. He had a dog as well. The house was ok though. I looked down at the water and saw this grey thing quickly swim past underneath. I said ""It's Cloverfield!"". I knew some people there, sort of. One of them was a captain. He had two daughters and brought some of his crew along. One of them was a hot blonde guy. I had built this huge boat thing. It was boat like on top of the water, but underneath it was this weird, huge area. To get onto the boat, you had to climb up this ladder, which had metal steps but was attached by a rope. The captain said it was awesome but that if the ladder hit a rock it could break. The blonde guy kept saying 'awesome' and then when we actually got onto the boat, it was a living area, and I had a huge TV in there and the blonde guy said ""Again, awesome"". I had a radio at the front and shelves on the side with black boxes, which was sea equipment. The radio had a tape in it, someone started playing it and it was a diary of mine. I stopped it and rewound it. I had told them earlier I had made it myself, but I remembered that Dad and Poppa had helped me with the rope leading to the area underneath and I mentioned this to the blonde. I had this electronic thing on the outside for people to sign in and it also kept records about the people. I added the captain's eldest daughter (she was 16) onto it. Her last time was 'Cook'. She was then making out with the blonde dude and I interrupted them so I could get a photo of her to put with her profile. I decided to put the blonde guy on there too and I said ""what's your name?"" and I couldn't understand what he said, so I asked him to spell it and he said ""O-W-A-R-E"". That was his first name; I don't remember his last name. I took a photo of him and it was blurry and looked like a black lady and I thought that was weird so I tried to take another. He said that wasn't a good idea (he now had an accent), but I did anyway. I took a quick glance at the photo and realized he was this black lady, who was evil, who he had asked me earlier to help (he was disguised as a blonde guy, I'm not sure how). I pretended not to look at it and left. He tried to follow me but then 'realized' I didn't see it. I went down the rope and everyone else was down there. I said that he wasn't who he says he is. The underground area is hard to describe. It was like underwater, but we could breathe and sometimes it wasn't underwater. We couldn't float though, we walked on the ground. It was extremely tall, and there were rows of huge shelves in a dark part of it. Near the rope, there was a machine which could show you 3D layouts of cities underwater and the rocks underwater. Anyway, blonde guy came down as the black lady. There was a darkish skinned guy down there and he was supposed to be, who the blonde guy was pretending to be (his role in the crew had been taken over by blonde guy). He wasn't as hot as the blonde guy, which disappointed me. The black lady threatened to cut the rope and I was thinking that we wouldn't last long down here. But she then ran off really fast. The youngest daughter of the captain's, I think her name was Molly, was holding a little black kitten. She was between 4-8 years old. She was running by herself trying to find somewhere to hide and kept throwing the kitten to hide it, but it came back. She hid in a hole with it eventually. The crew came and they were looking at her. The captain said something about the black lady's sister (the black lady was standing next to him, disguised as a white person) and then turned the gun on her and shot her three times. It shocked everyone, including myself. My heart was racing."
"2676"	"(2009-02-25 (18)) I was watching a movie, although it was real sometimes. It was at a carnival. Two people had died and were now ghosts. They were trying to recreate the death with someone (when it was real, this person was me). Some people came and we went into the back room to do it. There was an oven in the corner and it was on. I had to climb over it, I think, and there was no room to move and it was hot. I was then a doctor and on the street. I had a table/bed thing. I needed to do an emergency surgery. I got this little blowup black pillow and put it on the end of the bed. I told people to get ready because I had to go pee. I went into the toilet cubicle. Then I was driving with Mom and I think we got lost. I was talking to Mom and Ezra and she was telling us about a dream she had and Ezra was getting angry, shouting ""I don't care!"" and I said ""I do""."
"2677"	"(2009-02-25 (18)) Eugene and I started dating. I was really happy about this, also because he was in so many dreams of mine and they wouldn't go to 'waste'."
"2678"	"(2009-02-26 (18)) I was at school. There was an assembly in some room. I was with Calvin and Samantha and we were sitting near Daryl, but then we got moved off to the side and were a little bit closer to Eugene. This boy (around 6 years old) was on the stage reading something. He could barely read. Later, I was planning for an exam/essay for English and I needed to think of romantic comedies. I put down You've Got Mail since it was the last movie I watched but couldn't think of any other romantic comedies that I'd watched recently, thinking they were all 'science fiction and horror!'. Dad suggested Notting Hill and I said that I didn't really remember it and wanted stuff I'd watched more recently."
"2679"	"(2009-02-26 (18)) I was talking to Mom about Smallville and that sometimes it was more of a 'romance' and then it would go to 'science fiction' and back and forth. I said it was lame at the moment. Some story involved a teen black girl. The actress had recently said she was 35 and everyone was chucking a spaz saying she was too old."
"2680"	"(2009-02-27 (18)) I went to Centrelink or something with Mom. It was a HUGE building. It was very confusing to get around. Mom went off somewhere. There was a computer section and a lot of people were on them. I had to climb over some at the end and ended up on this path which was covered in old water bottles and mess from Ezra. I walked down and found the room I was supposed to go to and waited outside. A few seconds later my name was called out. I realized I'd forgotten to bring ID and I said to the lady that I'd be right back. I ran out and ran across the carpark to the car and then realized I didn't have keys. I ran back and went into the room with them. I sat down at the desk and apologized. Mary Lynn Rajskub was one of them. The first question they asked was about how her character (Chloe) from 24 affected me. I said something like she was a good character and was a good role model (I put together quite an eloquent little speech). They looked quite happy with it. At the end of the interview or whatever it was, they said I could bring in the ID later. I was thinking that I didn't want to try and get around this place again. Mary Lynn Rajskub then remembered that last week (or some recent time) I had met her and had a photo taken. She had a copy of the photo, and I had almost been cut out of it (some random had taken the photo). She said I could use that. There was now a new shortcut to leave the place. The path that had been messy was now clear, but had lots of ants and cockroaches. I had to walk through it and climb over the computers again to find Mom. I told Mom that you could now just 'click on the place on the map' and you could instantly teleport there. We left through the shortcut. Later, we were going for a drive and Ezra was coming. Mom told me to sit in the back so he could sit in the front and I said no and sat in the front."
"2681"	"(2009-02-28 (18)) I was at a shop with Mom. I was bored. I saw Dad and Ezra there. There was a men's jumper that I liked so I tried it on but if fit strange. Then I was at a train station. There were lots of little platforms, instead of one big one. They were quite small and I was on one and I almost fell onto the track. I went on another and a train was coming towards me and it looked like it was just going to hit me. Then they were planes. There was a plane crash in there. I had been on it. We discovered quickly that some people were turning into zombies. Someone I knew (a family member) was a zombie. I don't remember who it was. I ended up by myself driving a car. It was American style. I decided to find Eugene. I went to his house and there was a dog out the front. It barked at me. I knocked and Eugene and his father Abraham answered. His father was black and Eugene was a bit darker which I thought was weird because I hadn't noticed before. I said there had been an accident at 'Caircock' airport or something and that there were zombies. I said ""Have you seen 28 Days Later? They're like that but on ecstasy!"". I had heard the ecstasy thing in a movie tagline before. They called someone who told them it wasn't true. Somehow I convinced them to come with me. We went somewhere and there were lots of people I had to pick up. Eugene's father Abraham got killed and ran after the car as a zombie. The people I had picked up wanted to stop at a post office thing on the street. I stopped and they got out and zombies were coming so I took off and left them there. There was lots of traffic on the road and I think I was just driving over it. I looked behind and saw that driving over had killed people in the cars and they were now all scattered around, hurt and bloody. I went to a big shop. We were trying to hide from the zombies. We went into a clothes shop and there were lots of cubicles, but they were low. I hid in one closest to the wall and Eugene was in the one next to me. We had to crouch right down so we didn't stick over the top. The worst zombie we'd seen so far was this young girl who could think, but when she talked it just came out as gibberish. She looked over at Eugene, then me and we stayed still and she left. We waited a while and then I looked over at the door, then under the door and then looked up at the door and her face was peering over at me and I screamed ""Bahhh!"" and I attacked her with something and ran out of the cubicle. Her face looked all cut up and weird. I looked for an axe but there weren't any. There was a capsule on the wall, with a ladder in it, leading up. I thought about climbing up but it looked too much of a tight fit. I looked for a fire safety thing. I found fire blankets but no extinguisher. I found a blowtorch lighter thing and I threatened her with it. I then lit her shirt on fire, but she just pinched it and put it out. I tried again and she did it again. I managed to get her in the corner. The walls were lined with clothes and there were also two round clothes racks near her, so I lit them on fire. Then this black cop guy came and saved her and I was like 'what are you doing?!'. But I figured at least I was ok."
"2682"	"(2009-03-01 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I were going across the country. I had organized to see the Dylan Moran thing there as he was not coming to my town. It was happening the same night we were to arrive. The show was starting in ten minutes but we hadn't left yet (it only took a few minutes to get there by plane). Dad said he didn't want to drive me there. I realized I didn't have my ticket. Dad got angry and I said I rushed while I was packing. We got to our destination and to the hotel. It was like a motel though and all the doors were accessed from an outside balcony. Dad had picked the room on the edge but we had to open this gate to get to that side of the balcony and it opened up weird on the edge and made it hard to get in. Ezra and I complained about it. There were three bedrooms, all straight after each other with no doors, but there were curtains (you walk into hotel room, then first bedroom, walk through then the second bedroom etc). One was at the very back of the room with one bed, then the middle had two single beds and the closest one had one single bed. The blankets were red. I lay down on one of beds in the middle room. Ezra said he wanted that room and I said that he could sleep in the other bed, but this was my room. I then remembered about the Dylan Moran thing and it was 30 minutes past the beginning. I got my clothes and went to get dressed and I couldn't find any rooms with doors anywhere so I went to the toilet. I flushed the toilet and it started pouring out water and I said to Dad ""the toilet prolapsed"". I found a receipt for my ticket and it had a barcode on it, so it was ok. We went out and then realized Dad didn't have a car here. We looked for a bus and I said I had no idea how to use the bus, except to go to University to ""I can't remember... Leach Highway?"". Then an hour had passed. I was then with Mom in the car. We were driving down the street and it was night. I saw a big statue of Green Man on top of a pub. I said ""Green Man!"" and Mom laughed and I explained that a character (Charlie) in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia dressed up in that. I looked at my receipt and realized it started at 8.30, sometimes it was 8, and it wasn't time for it yet. Also, it was the 30th of whatever month it was. We drove past a theatre with posters for Dylan Moran on it."
"2683"	"(2009-03-02 (18)) I was with a friend who did stuff on the radio sometimes. He was trying to pick up girls. He was talking to this girl for a bit. She was quite pretty and nice. He was walking to a bedroom and saw two 'hot' women on a bed in another room so he decided to go to them. He pretended he was with the radio and they became interested in him. The nice girl came in and saw them and was upset. She talked to some guy later and I told him she was interested and gave him her number. I said ""that's her [something] number if she teleports to France,"" and he said ""why France?"". Later, it was night. I was at a computer shop with Ezra. He wanted to steal something and was using a quote from The Big Bang Theory and he said he had watched the last episode. We got to the counter but I kept laughing. Then we were spies or something and we were with a guy. We were sitting down and listening to something. He had his arm around me and I rested my head on his arm. I overheard a conversation, which sounded Arabic, and realized that the people were waiting near our car to kill us. We were thinking that we'd have to walk away and that it was far. It was spooky and dark outside. There were stairs leading down underground where our cars were."
"2684"	"(2009-03-02 (18)) I was walking outside on the street behind North Midvale. There were lots of little kids behind me. The street was a lot wider. This kid who was younger than the others walked out onto the road and a car was coming and I grabbed her. Then a big, brown oil truck thing pulled up. The driver left. A female cop came and I was now with some other people. She wasn't wearing a uniform. The cop told us that we had to go in. There were bits moving inside everywhere. She said we had to tip the truck to move it so everything would click together. We refused. Charlie Day was there too. Mom was there as well but she was different. There were some photos on the wall; one was of Mom and Rob McElhenney and the other of me and Charlie Day. I was near the door and I leaned on it and there was a knock. I said it was ""the driver"". He said we were supposed to tip it, so some of us did. We made it go to one side and the furniture started clicking together. Then we turned it another way. Charlie was sitting on a lounge reading something and I called out to him and he realized what we were doing and was surprised. As we tipped down near him, I ruffled his hair and laughed."
"2685"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I was at a school. I don't know why I was there but I was bored and I discovered that a combination of pickles, these long sleeping pills and something else caused you to see ""koalas in trees"". So I took one. I text Mom to ask how much 'paste' there was. I felt tired. I saw Elijah there."
"2686"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I woke up and I was at home. I was thinking I would call to leave as it wasn't my home and then I thought 'What am I thinking; I've been here 15 years?"" Someone said there was a guy called Ethan Coatzee and then said he was ""Preston Garfield"". I saw a shadow on the front door and I got up to run and said ""Get out of my house"". There was a person there and I unlocked the door and ran next door. This guy opened the door and let me in. There were quite a few people scattered around. There were some people at a table and I explained that people had taken over. He said ""nice place your father's got"" and I said ""That's what I thought"". Then it was a game. Ezra was playing too. We had to find clues. There were steps outside and this guy was going down and disappearing. We got this thing at the end, which led to three other things. We got others to do them but the white shard was right [that's what it says, have no idea what it means] . Then it was a movie and Mom was there. This girl got pregnant. She told her mother and she told her to get an abortion by going on the train tracks. Then the train tracks had a special area for people who wanted abortions or to commit suicide. You had to hold on to something and it would electrocute you. I think she was telling her mother she had decided to kill the guy and it was her first time."
"2687"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I was on the oval near North Midvale, and there were two small concrete slabs (maybe 3m2) near the other side, close to the road. I remembered there had been a small shack on one of them and we had written stuff on the outside. Mom said she didn't remember. Someone said they should put ""useful, like a gym"". I took the bus to university and it dropped me off right outside where I needed to go. There was a very long line nearby. There was also a policeman around. I walked in and found the class. It was totally different and I discovered I was actually doing three subjects, included Communications 2. I went to my class. I had an Asian lady as a teacher. The task was we had to put drawings up on the board. She also mentioned something about zombies and when you get given something to find and then you put them all together? It reminded me of the shack. I got given a 'secret' task. Two guys in the class were gay and were touching and kissing each other. This other guy told them to stop because it was 'disgusting'. I told them to shut up and everyone gasped. They were shocked and asked why. I said ""leave them alone, who cares? If it were two girls who'd be like 'yeah, fully sick',"". They confirmed this. I'm not sure what happened next, but I ended up in a building and this guy who I didn't get along with was there. He ended up raping me although I didn't remember it. Some guy had shoved something up my butt and I could only eat lobster because it wouldn't make me poo. I was then back at school. I hadn't told anyone who had done it yet. I was in a room with him again and he tried to rape me again and I attacked him. Ezra was there too and he helped me. We managed to hurt him and he was lying on the floor, barely able to move. I found a big dildo in the room and was going to shove it up his butt. Then Evelyn was in there and I tried to get her to do it while I held the curtains shut. Her sister came soon after. Charlene was then there too and she was trying to look outside and kept pulling the curtains open and I was like 'Charlene, no!'. We pretended we were just playing. I said someone had attacked me and told them to go away. Then I was in a forest and it was a game? There was a small clearing with three cars. Jensen Ackles was there too. This lady took us through and there was an underwater section too. It got very deep and there were scary and spiky fish down there. We got to the very bottom and there was a hatch so it was easier. We went out through it and we were in an area very similar to the place with the cars. She trapped us there. We tore the net on the hatch open and followed her. We went into a house and into the kitchen. The lady had her back turned and was reading out her history. One of us stabbed her and asked if that was in there and she said no. We managed to leave. There were some videos of that rape guy doing things to people. I was worried he was going to release the rape video of me. I was on the net at some point and there were questions that had been answered by some guy, who I thought was the rape guy. There was a question about piercings to which he answered he had none and I thought 'yay', but I discovered it was Daryl, not rape guy. I did a quiz too and the first question was about 'favourite alcoholic drink' and I put ""I only like water"". Something said to put a fruity drink down. Some person was trying to burn down my room at university. I think there was a song playing and I said it was from ""nineteen ninety... something"", also thinking it was probably the original version. There was some show from the 90's and there was a guy called Charlie who had something to do with me wanting a dog and calling it Charlie. Then I realized it was Charlie Day. He was young and looked weird without his facial hair."
"2688"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I was walking with 'friends'. We went to the Midvale Leisure centre and it was open for another half hour. We went in and went in the pool. I went in with my phone. I got out when I realized but it was still ok. I was telling the guy that worked there that I'd been stabbed in the shoulder and was going to use the gym to help it."
"2689"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I'm not sure how it started but I was with Sam and Dean (both Supernatural). We were following clues. We went to a hospital and were looking for a room and I said ""it better not be room 217"". It was 180 something. I took this little thing off the bed in there. I heard the heart rate machine thingy beep and then flatline. We ran to the other room. We discovered that some guy and Penny (The Big Bang Theory) were related. This lady nurse said she called the cops on us. I said we'd have to run. So, we ran to a forest-y area. Dean was slowly walking down the path and Sam was a little further down. I started running down the path. The cops called out to me that I was only allowed out for now, but that I had to go back to jail (I had been let out to help them catch Sam and Dean, but I just agreed so I could stay with them). I started to run faster and I had this net-like bag and I would throw it in front of me, then run and pick it up and throw it again (to avoid carrying it around). Sam had then gotten somewhere else and I caught up with him. There was a shiny white van and we got in. We laughed and he started driving. A cop van came towards us (from the side) and we saw it crash behind us. I asked where Dean was and Sam was like ""Who's Dean?"" and then I turned into a demon, and I was watching it in third person. Sam was telling the demon it was supposed to possess him and the demon said no, it was meant to take over me."
"2690"	"(2009-03-04 (18)) I had some MSN messages from Ezra asking some questions but the computer kept lagging majorly. I told him finally, that it was lagging and he told me to meet him at the zoo. He was on a small canoe boat thing with an animal. I had to buy a ticket to get a boat over to him. You had to drive it yourself. I think there was a train? I got back and had to show the lady the ticket. I was holding Gizmo and had to hand her over first to get the ticket out. I went back over to Ezra. Later, I parked outside of Mom's and called her to pick us up. On the radio they played some old song. Ezra mentioned something else and liking old music like Midnight Oil and they played some song which was the song ""from From Dusk Till Dawn"" or so we said. Mom was sound asleep. My notes aren't very detailed and I don't remember any of this next stuff. She forgot which way to go. There were two lanes to choose from and she chose the wrong one? There were escalators that were sideways. We had to lie down. There were some old ladies. There was a bakery thing with lemon meringue pie. This guy let me taste it to see if I liked it."
"2691"	"(2009-03-04 (18)) I was on an island or on the beach. I'm not sure of the details. The leader guy killed some people and he kept some people that he liked. He picked three of us, me, a girl and a guy to be some volleyball players. There were only three players on each team and we were playing against girls. He was making us do this so that we got used to it and could beat everyone. The guy was Peter Krause, and his 'skill level' was 10 and ours was like 1.08. He said he'd gone running on rocks in the water. This guy made fun of his deep voice and I said that I did the same thing while watching Six Feet Under."
"2692"	"(2009-03-05 (18)) I was in a classroom, on the left side near the front, and in front of Brent and Ishaan. They were talking and then Ishaan called out to me. They asked if I'd be happy with flowers as a present (as in, would females like it). I said ""Well, I wouldn't', because I'd like something useful,"" and they asked 'like what?'. I said ""a DVD or a new computer..."" and Brent asked ""what kind of DVD?"" and I said science fiction (and the like) and then Brent said ""You're pretty cool"". Later, Classmate-F-03 came in and she and Brent were quite touchy-feely. They had drawn some pictures. The teacher was called Mr Drive or something. The class ended and it was a long way to get to the bus. There was a small building and we had to climb through this hole to get to the bus. I had my shoes off and so put them on. Brent was not too far back in the line away from me. I went through the hole and Ms Pascal was there. She wouldn't let us out the quick way. I was then at school and Calvin was there. He was doing chemistry and he got 88% on a test. His wrong answers were the same ones that I got wrong, but we had different answers (I thought he had copied me at first). Then I was somewhere and GTA 3 was on the TV and Ezra was with me. I remembered playing it years ago. Also, there was this game that I played where you walk into this room and there were two doors on the left and then I noticed this black latch in the right corner of the front wall. Then a third door appeared and I laughed, remembering that Darren had said ""shadow behind the third door"", except I thought he said something else rather than shadow. In the game, you got a rare 'fire' animal or something. [The night before I was talking about dreams with Darren and he said ""watch out for the shadow behind the third door"" or something, to see if it would influence my dream] ."
"2693"	"(2009-03-06 (18)) I had a gay friend over. There was some site which had some gay bashing thing on there. I was angry about it and showing my friend. Some of the stuff said they wanted them to 'burn on the stake' etc. There was something about Queer as Folk and I saw Ted and I was like ""Ted!""."
"2694"	"(2009-03-06 (18)) I was at university in Communications. I was in my normal spot and Preston was sitting a desk away (in the one near the wall). I had another class after but I had to go on the bus. I tagged on and sat at the back. Brent, Preston and someone else came on and sat together in the row next to me. The next class was also a Comms class. There was a sign-in thing which mentioned why we were doing this course for a ""higher TER"". Lillian was in the class and so was Preston. He sat down in one of the first seats and I sat in my usual seat. Also, I hadn't seen Preston in this class before."
"2695"	"(2009-03-07 (18)) Ezra called Mom saying someone kept leaving 'rapish' on his desk. We suggested the cat was bringing chicken in. Then I asked if he was on My City (Facebook application). He was. I had added a chemist to his and he had new stuff to add. I went home at one point. There were maggots everywhere. I was on the floor in my room and there were baby maggots on there. I went to the kitchen and got fly spray and used it on the sink and the floor. I called Mom. I was then at Cat Haven, or something. There were kittens in a cage. I was cuddling them. One was black and fluff and there was a cute Rag doll looking one. There were also puppies and birds. Mom and Ezra were around. This building had metal pipes for the roof (cube area). I had to water the metal so it turned brown. Then we used it before it got hot, but it didn't stay cool long enough. I signed in at the Cat Haven. This girl told me to stop texting and I said I was trying to get my Mom to pick me up. I asked her what grade she was in and she said something weird. I said I had graduated and mentioned I was in university now. She laughed. I don't know why. I asked where she went and she said something that I don't remember. Mom text me saying she was ages away, but would be picking up Amelia then getting me. I walked across this field and there was a hill. This guy with ""gay [something] "" was there. There was a game where people keep 'sexing'. This guy told his friend he was gay and he was like ""You're not gay, I'm not gay"". But he did say he would engage in anal sex with him. This was the last episode of a show? I decided to download it."
"2696"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) There was some chocolate and it made this guy giggle when you ate it. I went to university later where I had to show my ID card, but it wasn't enough ID. I went back and got some stuff that the girl showed me. Mom got a new cat. I was on the net and I found this huge site on Daniel Cerny, especially on Eli, but the character was called ""Eherence Eli Porter"". The nickname of the character was ""Ehe"" (pronounced E-hee). It said he hated Children of the Corn 3 and liked producing them and mentioned his first movie. Then it was something else and there was something about his third (also his latest) movie which was in Japanese."
"2697"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) Dad had episodes of shows and issues of The Walking Dead. I was transferring them over and reading The Walking Dead. It was in colour and I couldn't remember when it changed to colour. The kid had been killed off a while ago too. It changed between reality and the comic for a while, and then it was real. The characters were walking outside. One had an electronic thing which could tell them how many zombies were in the place. The zombies were sort of smart -- they had basic speech and thinking. I was annoyed at this saying that I could deal with zombies talking, but not thinking (as in, they weren't proper zombies). We went to a school and there were a few in there so we walked away. Then chickens came running out. This girl in the group decided to leave and told me and then left. This guy noticed a zombie around the corner but it was too late and it got her. There were lots of zombie kids but they were all calm ones and didn't bother us, even though we were sitting next to them. A dog bit my foot gently, and I was now infected but I hadn't turned yet. Then we were driving and one of the people had a house. I said we should go to the country and he said it was in the country, but it wasn't. We parked the car a few houses away and we climbed over the fences to get to the front of the house (all the houses were surrounded with fences). They tried to open the house. There was a park across the street and zombies were walking down towards us (they hadn't noticed us). I was keeping an eye on them but then they saw us and came up to the fence. Others then came. They called us 'wolves'. They had already sent a 'message' to others and I wondered if we could make it to the car, but there were some hanging around it. There was a young girl who had been with us and she was now a zombie. We got caught. They took us to a desert because we were 'wolves'. I tried to burn one of them with a piece of glass (tried to use it as a magnifying glass). A train came past and I jumped on but I kept getting pushed off and then it took off without me."
"2698"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) For university, I had been set up to live somewhere. I was at Nana's and there were six of us. I got the lounge room (now bare and a different shape). The other rooms being used were the dining room/other lounge and I think Nana's room. This other girl was in the other lounge room. Preston was sent to the dining room. Quinton (from math) was with me. I redecorated the room for myself but then remembered I was sharing. We had a small TV. My bed went to the edge of the bottom of the stairs and I couldn't think of how to move it to get it out of the way. Then I was at 'home'. My room was different and fairly empty. Someone came in with a baby and put it in a cot that was in my room. The room also had a door to the outside. I finished playing this game and I told Mom to get the baby out or I'd throw it out. I put all of the baby's stuff in the hall. We were going somewhere I think."
"2699"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) I think this one continued from the zombie dream. There were zombies. I could only do a certain number of steps and actions every day. Normally I didn't stray very far from the house we stayed at, but I did today. I was at the gate of the city (or wherever) and there were police there. I was on a bike and was riding away from zombies, who were also on bikes. I yelled to them that I was normal and the zombies began shooting at the cops. In the distraction, I got past. I tried to steal a car, so I had a faster mode of transport. I didn't know the controls and this guy said I was going ""-69 miles per hour"" and then I rammed him into another car and he died (accidental, I was still working out the controls). I found this girl and she said she would show me how to drive a car. I was a guy at the moment and I thought she liked me. I was almost out of energy/steps and she was staying in a clear plastic square. She got in and it was hard to fit through the entrance and was squishy inside. She jokingly said ""lick my feet"" (my head was at her feet). Then other people were around outside. I got out and went into another 'building'. They had some drug and you breathed it in and everything went slow. I didn't realize but we were all painting while inhaling. I left to go somewhere safer. I found a guy who looked like Colin Mochrie with a couple of cars next to a tree, which was next to the road. I asked him if he knew anywhere to go and he said I could sleep in his Ute. I slept and later, zombies came and were trying to get in the Ute. They had a midget and were trying to fit him through a gap in the window. I woke up and went out the other door and ran. I met up with Dad and Ezra. I found some 'active potions' which you could drink and they would give you more steps. I drank some. Then, Mom, Preston, a girl and others were there too. Ezra said he'd like to ""fuck"" the girl. I was shocked at the language and the content but was just like 'ok...'. He asked Preston what he thought and he said he was going to read the news and sleep tonight. I found a big shop and it was full of people. There were lots of storeys and they got darker as we went up. I kept drinking the potions while walking. There was a gate thing we had to go through and we had to put coins in there, then walk through. It gave my coins back. Coins also worked as potions but not as well as the one I was using. I was giving $1 and $2 to some and 50c to others. We got to the top storey which was pitch black. It was a gaming level. I used the light on my phone to find my way around. There was a room with bunk beds. Everyone went off though and went to random places. The girl came though and said I had to sleep on the top bunk. There was a toilet close by and there were very small bunk beds in the bath."
"2700"	"(2009-03-09 (18)) I was at school and was in class by myself. There was a competition and Samantha, Cedric, a quiet girl, me and someone else were in it. We had to throw cards onto these mats and match them. You would be given a ticket to the concert. I missed and the only match I got was for some girl group and that was my only concert option. There was a band there that I actually liked. Someone started singing Standing in the Shadows of Love. Then it was time for the hard math class and Jeremiah and the others came in. I heard Eugene coming. He was wearing a white singlet thing, which was dirty. I remembered he was doing MIT as well. I saw that he was wearing a ruby ring and thought 'Nooo! Eugene isn't perfect!'. I went outside and called Mom. It looked like the front of her house outside. Mr Gutenberg locked the door, but then I went back in. We then stood outside as a group and Eugene was standing with Jeremiah. I called Mom again and she answered and I could hear lots of sirens. I told her it was humid and I looked up at the sky and saw smoke. I looked lower and saw some forests in the distance and could see the flames of a fire and then they suddenly started moving very fast (like that video of the Victoria fires). I started freaking out and I ran inside (to Mom's) and grabbed my dream journals and got in the car with Eugene, who then drove away. He was then Mom and I complained that I didn't get my diaries or my external hard drives. I said ""I don't want it to be like Victoria!"". We were then back home I think. There was a shop across the road and it was on fire. It got put out and that was the end of it -- we had just missed it. I packed up a box with my dream journals and stuff and wrote on it ""incase Harper dies"". In the distance there was more fire and a mushroom like cloud. There was a show and a nuclear war happened. Then it was a movie? There was a place where all females went to make them obedient and with no personality. Dan Aykroyd was in it and he got one. She had a large lip and a guy stopped her at the scan. There was a room and there was a midget, who was a bad guy. He started shooting at the girl, who was then me. I hid under a desk."
"2701"	"(2009-03-09 (18)) I think this continued on. There were more fires. Ezra was at Mom's and was doing something to keep the house cool and wet which would prevent it for a while. We left, but he stayed. Eventually he came to us and said he couldn't handle it anymore. It had gotten to 72°C. We went back and the house didn't look too badly burnt. We were surrounded by smoke and it was hard to see. Darren said that my computer wasn't too bad and I said 'yeah, it's only the most important thing in my life'. I said 'Imagine if it had been Mom that died, that's what it's like for me'. I went to my room and the wall near my window was burnt. Half of my computer had melted and one of my externals was totally melted. The computer was still working though and it was still running, except there was a small strip across the top of the screen which was just black. I went into Ezra's room, which was finished and it hadn't been burnt at all. Then there was this white kitten and it kept lighting the front lawn on fire. I kept putting them out and eventually caught it. Then I was at home and Ezra was setting fires there. Simba ran past, on fire, and I poured water on him and it wasn't enough to put the fire out and so I got more. Where the water had gone, was now invisible. Ezra and Dad decided to put these two kittens, including the white one, and a duck toy in the dryer to kill them because they were lighting fires. I was trying to convince them not to because it was mean. I felt bad so I took them out of the dryer. I was then at a park, going for my walk. There was a huge fenced area, with some fence missing in places so you could walk through. I was walking around that with Mom. I put the kitten in a cage and left it at the start of it. This girl challenged me to a race. She was extremely fit and was far ahead of me. I went through the first opening in the fence and ran through the middle. She went through another and got ahead of me again. I was worried she was going to let the kitten escape, and she got to the box before I did. She picked it up, but put it in another cage."
"2702"	"(2009-03-09 (18)) There was some young kid at a table. Her mother and father were sitting there too, I think with others. Her mother asked her something and something about 'what she loved' and then asked her something else, to which she replied 'you', and her mother thought the daughter was saying she loved her most. But, she actually meant her father. He was molesting her. I think she enjoyed it? When she was a teenager, they were still 'close'."
"2703"	"(2009-03-10 (18)) My toy box was in the games room. I was going through it and I found a folder of Pokemon cards. I was going through them and there were lots of empty spaces. I remember seeing Eevee and there was one called 'Croteas', instead of Vaporeon. Some of the cards were shiny. There were a few plastic sheets that were thicker and of better quality than the others. I showed Mom and asked her if we can get more. I was going to ask Ezra if wanted to collect them again. There was some show that someone was watching and I had a quick look and saw Kiefer Sutherland, and it was showing him looking up. I said ""Hey, it's Jack!""."
"2704"	"(2009-03-11 (18)) I was playing this game and I was a spy/detective in it. The first thing you did was choose a husband and something else. I chose the first guy I saw, but he was really ugly and had blue eyes. The role of the guy was to take the kids to school? Everyone there was weird and had a 'handler'. There was a mini game with items and one of them was a cigarette and I took up smoking. They had a strange flavour and it felt weird and it was hard to breathe. I can't read my notes, but there's something about a robot which had another robot in it. The weight was like 94.5kg. There were Staffy's and toy plates? There were stupid places like a wall? I quit going to the Cat Haven and was annoyed that I wouldn't have a chance to develop anything with Preston (that's where I'd met him)."
"2705"	"(2009-03-11 (18)) I was at school/university. I finished math and went outside, in the rain, to walk to the bus stop. I then remembered I had Communications after lunch. I called Mom to get me so we could straighten my hair again. Dad picked me up. Darren was somewhere. I was going to have a shower, and then straighten but then realized it would take up too much time. Also, I heard a song on the radio that was by The Angels. It was really catchy and had 'January' in the title."
"2706"	"(2009-03-12 (18)) I was at school. Eugene was there. The teacher asked him who he thought liked him. Calvin was near me and said it was going to be me. They told him to write it on a piece of paper and if it was right he'd get $5. I figured he'd put down me as well and left out of annoyance. I came back and some time later I saw a $5 note on a piece of folded up paper. I opened it and it said 'Jasmine' and I was wondering who the hell Jasmine was."
"2707"	"(2009-03-12 (18)) Ezra was staying at Mom's. First, I was at home I think (maybe not). I was on the computer looking for 'disturbing movies'. There was some Asian guy and a girl too and they were pretty fluent in English. She asked what 'film' was and I said ""Same as movie"". There was a site with a list of movies. There was a movie that was short and it said people pooped in other peoples butts and so I thought I'd look for it. I found Part 1 and 3 on Youtube. I watched part 1 and it was lame. I figured they must've taken the good stuff off. I was telling Dad about it and we downloaded some movies. Then, I was back at Mom's. I was going to bed and Ezra decided he wanted to watch TV loudly. I said I can't sleep with that on. I complained because I had to get up at 6am. He refused to turn it down. Mom was on the phone trying to help. Darren was trying to convince him too. Cuddles was sitting on their bed. He had to get up at 4am. In anger, I punched the wall between my room and Ezra's. I found a soft spot but it didn't break. Ezra said if Mom couldn't sleep through it, then he'd know it was too loud. I said ""She sleeps through Darren's alarm every morning! It wakes me up all the time"". Soon after, we settled the argument and all went to bed."
"2708"	"(2009-03-13 (18)) It was the day before Ivan's funeral. There was a thing on and Mom and Darren were going and I said I wasn't. When they were about to leave I changed my mind. I was trying to find something that was ok to wear. I went out the front and Mom and Darren took off without me. I got in my car and followed them and was driving really badly, mostly on purpose. They stopped and decided to take me. It was near the sea, on a big boardwalk thing. There were a few rows of chairs. We sat in them and these people were talking about him. This girl was sitting next to me and I was talking to her about stuff. I think she was Regina. I was telling her about how I'd used my last name as a name for something and some other naming method which was quite spiffy. Later, she got famous and stole my ideas. Her last name was 'Damn'. I complained about it. We were still at the boardwalk thing. I left to go to the toilet. I was walking back and there was a confusing path. I walked down the wrong one and then had to walk back down it to get back to the boardwalk. Everyone was walking down a jetty to a submarine thing. I ran to get there before it left. There were no barriers on the thin jetty and I almost fell into the water. I managed to get in. I felt sick and we were moving. They explained there were holes in the control room, so that if there was a leak, a corresponding hole would spurt out water so they'd know where the leak was."
"2709"	"(2009-03-13 (18)) Calvin and I found this video of a girl, who had a huge dildo. It was like the size of a person. They shoved it in her butt and she was fine. We were extremely shocked and confused at it."
"2710"	"(2009-03-13 (18)) I was out the front of Mom's. We were sitting in the car. Mom started crying. A lady came and gave us a long stone, which was bumpy and was to be used as a tombstone for Ivan. It had 'Knepper and Padalecki' on the top and I thought it had something to do with Robert Knepper playing Freddy Krueger and Jared Padalecki being in Friday the 13th. I said ""Robert Knepper for the win!"". Later, I was near the sea. It was very murky and green. I was with others and we were talking to this girl in the water. I asked her about some episodes of Lost to find out where she was up to. I asked ""the one with the taxi driver?"" and she wasn't sure and I asked ""the one with Bill?"". I was actually talking about the episode of 24 when Bill got killed. She went to say whether she had seen it or not, which was somewhat suspenseful and then suddenly she got taken under the water. We laughed and then ran up the path to get away. Some skinny, murky green tentacles were flailing about. Then it was Jack and Sawyer from Lost. They went opposite ways to save themselves. Sawyer was then sitting on a playground with Juliet and was upset that Jack had left him to die. Jack was lying in a slide (it was enclosed). It was full of leaves and insects and things and he was talking to these two green snakes, about how depressed he was about Sawyer. They had a red bit on each of them, one said ""1st"" and the other ""2nd"". It meant they were the 1st and 2nd most poisonous snakes. He then heard Sawyer talking and slowly crawled out of the slide wondering why he was in there with the snakes."
"2711"	"(2009-03-15 (18)) There was a machine and people had to put rubbish on the platforms -- it rotated down to where it got dealt with. We had to leave a free platform between each one. Rob McElhenney was a worker there. Suddenly, a lot of chocolate came through and we were taking heaps off to keep for ourselves. We then heard police sirens. We discovered someone had stolen the chocolates, so we started taking the chocolates out of our pockets and putting them back on the machine. The rubbish was no longer getting off. The boss, who was a lady, said that the bottom machine must've broken. We went down and there was liquid. Rob and I had to go through it. He started talking to himself and acting odd. We got locked out the front of the place and I saw a dude with a balaclava getting out of a car. I went out the back and jumped over a fence, but they got me. I had my school books out and they made me put them all away. I put the pens in my pockets."
"2712"	"(2009-03-15 (18)) I was playing with a small Shiba Inu and I was calling it Charlie. Dmitri had a dog and I was actually playing with an imaginary dog. I said I was practicing. His dog was a Chow Chow, but it didn't look like one. I said the Shiba's come from the same place as the Chow Chow's, but his was from somewhere else."
"2713"	"(2009-03-15 (18)) I was at a video shop with Mom. She wanted some movies but we didn't have an account. We asked if we could get one and they said yes. All the movies she wanted were lame ones. She asked if Bad Boys was any good and I said I didn't remember it, but Bad Boys 2 was funny."
"2714"	"(2009-03-16 (18)) I was on the net. Uncle Vic had an email and a site which we had. I found a site that I had signed up with and had added a Preston Garfield. There was a picture and it looked like him so I figured I got it right. I was looking at the other pictures. His profile mentioned Hitman and Watchmen. It said he lived in Subiaco. I then had a 'flash' of if we had met years ago and everything would've been 'better'. Mom decided she and Darren were going to go out and she asked me if that was ok. I complained because I wanted to ""shoot some 24"". She said that I just watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I think it was playing, or there was a picture of it, with Dee and I was like 'ugh I hate her'."
"2715"	"(2009-03-17 (18)) I was at the shop with Mom. I was looking for some chocolate and I found this interesting bar which was all curled around. There was a game (I can't read what I wrote next to it, but it looks like ( [something] to see'). You had to search the area for a male and a female (could be between 1-something in a pair?). One lot I got was '14'. Then you did something with them but I don't remember. I discovered Dmitri played it and left like 10 messages. He joked about it later. I found a message he had written to someone saying he had applied for some police job. A photo of him showed him with a little ring on his little finger. I decided not to write any more? There was a dog in a cage."
"2716"	"(2009-03-18 (18)) I signed up as being a fan of a show. Also Darren was on the news. I was watching a Penn & Teller: Bullshit episode and Darren watched it too. I pointed to Teller and he was like 'what the fuck?'. On that fan thing, Ishaan had a post, something about Supernatural. Someone got a 'lawful' email from Jensen Ackles and someone sent it to Mom's email. I was trying not to read it. I managed not to for a while. I downloaded some shows."
"2717"	"(2009-03-18 (18)) My computer had been screwy for a while. It ended up getting smashed. It was mixed in with a pile of sand and other bits of stuff. I was going through and picking out important stuff -- files etc. I went somewhere and had a lame mobile phone. I text Mom to get me a new computer. She said ok. I called her and said I needed to be picked up. She said no and to not leave yet. I then realized I was outside of Cat Haven. I explained to her I quit. I was then at Nana's and I was showing her my phone, which was big and a weird shape. It had a tiny screen."
"2718"	"(2009-03-19 (18)) I can't remember properly, but Mom was upset about her father. We went somewhere, along with Ezra. He said he was glad he knew us and I said ""I'm not glad I know Ezra. Can I get him erased from my mind?"" There was a movie and this girl had a guy friend who died when he was young. There was a picture of him and he had exploded? He was actually ok though."
"2719"	"(2009-03-20 (18)) I was with Charlie Day? I think he and I were in a place and then he went away for a bit. Someone said a friend was waiting for me and a girl. There were clothes on a rack. There were lots of these black dresses and black pants and white shirts. Then someone was coming and they forced me into a room. I was naked. I couldn't bring any clothes in as this laser thing would detect them and make them disappear. I was really annoyed."
"2720"	"(2009-03-20 (18)) I was at university in Comms. The class was different and was bigger. We were told to write down our most recent dream. I wrote down one from '14 February' and it was long. It had a bit with James Spader. We didn't have to put our names on it and then we chucked them into a pile. It was quite a big pile. I was going through and I found some dreams in there written on these cool cardboard cards. I was with someone who I was friendly with and I wondered where to get the cards from and whose they were. We were near the front of the class and someone said ""Izzy"". I turned and it was Preston, who was sitting at the desk closest to us with another guy. He asked if I was looking for the person who wrote that dream and I said yeah. He asked why and I said ""Coz I want some of those cards"". He said it was him. The dreams on them were long and I figured he must record his dreams. I didn't ask him though. He told me they were from ""Cook"" and that he had gotten them 3 years ago. I asked the name of the shop again and he repeated ""Cook"". I was reading through them (there were two) and both mentioned me. Later, I was gathering all the dreams to keep. Also there were some survey things in there. One had 'best female friend' and the answer was 'Izzy'. It was Evelyn's. I wondered why she had me down there since we hadn't spoken in a year. There was a girl in the class called Sahara and she was Asian. Her survey had me as 'best plan'. Later, we were in this prison looking thing. It was inside and we were in the middle of a room. There were cells and balconies on the floor above. I was standing near Sahara, who was talking to Classmate-F-09. She said something about me and Classmate-F-09 screwed up her face in disgust. I was like 'Huh? What are you talking about? What did you say about me?' etc. No-one would tell me, then the people who believed I was innocent (most of them) were in the middle of this room, while the others walked around the outside (there were little walls around it). One of them was a black girl. Luciano and Quinton went out and Luciano distracted the outside people while Quinton and another person searched the cells. I was then searching and found a tape. It had the 'truth' about me on it. We played it and it had Christina (Ugly Betty) speaking. They called her Callie though. Calvin was also here at some point and Classmate-M-04 had said ""I'm dangerous""."
"2721"	"(2009-03-21 (18)) I can't really remember, but there was a mention of Chris Barrie and I was like 'I love Chris Barrie!'."
"2722"	"(2009-03-21 (18)) Mom dropped me off at the train station. I had gotten a letter from the school saying that I had photos to pick from last year. I told Mom to try and get them. It was inside a building. I hadn't been to this part of it before. I went down an escalator. This lady gave me a plastic folder and it had the photos in it. There was one of me, Calvin and others, but my hair was all in my face. I quickly flicked through to see if there were any of Eugene, but I didn't find any. I put it in my bag and jumped onto a train. It was two storeys. I climbed up and this guy was standing over two seats and he had no underpants on (just a shirt) and his balls were showing. There were lots of retards on the train. I asked the driver what the next stop was and she said ""Peleigh"" (I think. It started with P or B, and ended in 'eigh' -- prounced 'ee'). I looked on the map thing and the stop was miles away and it wasn't stopping at any stops in between. I called Mom to tell her. I asked if I should jump off and she said ""Nah"" but I jumped up as she said it. I forgot to grab my water though and it was now dark. It was a long walk back and Mom wouldn't get me. I started walking down a path on the street. There was a car parked in a driveway and some dodgy guys were sitting in it. This little thing started running towards me and it was a cute, fluffy little dog. It barked. I followed the train tracks and ended up at a restaurant which it went through (or past?). It was very big and fancy and I walked in at the bottom floor, but it also had an upstairs area. There was a parrot which would say ""Charlie, can I take your order!"" and some other variants. This was some in-joke which the patrons understood. I walked through and was chewing bubblegum. I was on the phone to Mom and went outside. I had a wobbly tooth. The gum got stuck on it, so I tried to pull it off with my fingers and my tooth came out. I said to Mom ""My tooth fell out!"". I said it must've been a baby tooth. I was walking on a wall and saw Spaceman on a roof, or something. I then realized it actually was Spaceman and saw ""It is Spaceman!"". There was a long drop between me and him, and so I just kept walking. I got down to walk around back to the tracks. There were lots of other obstacles. One was like a white water rafting thing, but as a slide. There were two sets of tracks going down it. I had to climb up, fighting the water and watching out for trains. So I walked around again (to walk around made it take a lot longer). I went to a chemist and bought something. Then I was watching a movie, I think. This girl was in the water, upside down. A shark was just beneath her, and presumably, thought something was wrong. She stayed still and then it started raining and the shark left. I think, eventually, I got back to civilization. I was looking through the photos and saw photos of Valerie and Ariana at my graduation. I didn't remember them being there and then I realized that ""they were there for Farrah!"". Dad asked which chemist I had gone to. I checked the bag and it said ""Auto Express"". There was also something before with Ezra."
"2723"	"(2009-03-21 (18)) I was at a funeral, but I don't know who for. I was with friends and people I knew. Then Gramps had died and we were at his funeral. I couldn't remember where he had been for all the years though. We were standing outside and Granny was crying. I was supposed to be the one pushing the coffin in (that was what happened, someone would just give it a push and it would fall into this thing). Afterwards, some others and I went to a room. There were seats and they were all layered (like steps). This teacher lady was talking. She had her young daughter (say, four years old?) who had blonde hair drawing in the front row. The teacher had brown hair. She asked if we thought only the important subjects should get taught at schools. All the people who agreed stayed. We all moved into the middle so it would look like more people were there. Evelyn left. Brent and Luciano were there and I was sitting between them. Brent's arm was in my way and I pushed it and he looked angry and pulled it away. I then felt embarrassed. The teacher started handing out pictures and things of musicians. I saw Beatles stuff and got excited. There was a John Lennon magazine? She then gave me and someone a heap of Curly Wurly's, a trolley and money and led us to a huge shop. Dad was at a funeral. I was then in a liquor store and Dad came in. I had been asked to buy this bottle, but as I didn't have ID, I asked Dad to get it ""for Mom and Darren"". Also, the teacher lady had some funeral as well. We were walking off and were all drunk. I felt light-headed and was having trouble keeping my balance. We went into this big empty house (there was a lot of us) and people started just falling asleep on the floor."
"2724"	"(2009-03-22 (18)) I was in the car with Mom. It was night and it was windy and rainy. We parked outside of North Midvale as there was an ATM on the other side of the road (it was right at the corner before that bush thing). Mom went out to it and I locked the doors and it was really creepy. She finally came back but there were some dodgy people nearby. She got in and we quickly locked the doors again. We both then imagined all this stuff that could happen."
"2725"	"(2009-03-22 (18)) I was in class, I think it was Comms. The teacher was pairing us up, but letting some people choose. The teacher asked Calvin who he'd like to pair up with, asking ""Lucia?"" and Calvin said ""No, I want to work with [someone whose name started with 'S'] "". I was near Preston and Brent, and Preston went this guy who was near him. I figured Brent and I would pair up but then he moved away and I don't know what happened. Then there was an excursion? Some buses got hijacked, but ours was ok and we got off. Mom picked me up. I called Calvin and he was still at the school. As we left, I saw Eugene on the other side of the road with his hair in a ponytail and he looked like a girl. One of the bus drivers had gotten stabbed in the stomach and his name was Thomas. Then there was a house and these creepy people lived in it. One of them was Uncle Fester [Addam's Family, but not one of the actors, just some random guy] and he was sleepy? This thing chased me and there was a special way to go to get rid of it. I had to press this button and do some other things. The guy followed me and he was like made out of seaweed. The last thing I had to do was to move one of two wires to the switch and I couldn't remember which one. I asked the seaweed dude and he showed me and then I did it."
"2726"	"(2009-03-23 (18)) I was at Northtown. There were three video shops. I went down there with Mom one night and now there was only one. It was the smallest one and had been moved a while back ""from Miss Maud's"". There were posters of DVD's and I said they were all ""killer clown movies"". Mom returned some movies for me. I was watching Buffy. Buffy was a vampire or someone else, I can't really remember. They were good though and were remembering back to their past."
"2727"	"(2009-03-25 (18)) Some others and I went somewhere out in nowhere. We were standing around outside. This girl had joined us. She was helpful but I didn't trust her. Some Native guys came and they threatened us and joked about how we'd get escape ""get in the car and drive away"". The car they referred to was rusty and didn't work. Someone then said ""then the nightmare ends"" and everyone realized I was daydreaming. They took us into a building. The girl left and started to cross a road and they shot her. Inside, I was writing dreams into my book. Some guys came in and they were like ""hey, what's up"" and seemed friendly. I was going to ask them if it was ok if they let me write all my dreams in before they killed me, but the guy gave me a huge amount of paper. It was a magazine about new inventions and stuff. There was a section about some plant and I can't remember what it did, but they realized what it was and got nervous. I pretended not to notice and realized they were growing it. I thought maybe they would leave us alive. The girl who got shot was now alive and was with them. Out the back somewhere were some cute kittens. Mom was there? Simba was also there and was trying to mate with Gizmo. I was watching something later and James Marsters was in it, and it showed how much makeup was used to make his cheeks look so sunken for Buffy. I was thinking that that was how I saw him, as Spike, rather than his other characters. Ezra bought a cigarette off a friend to try them 'again'."
"2728"	"(2009-03-26 (18)) Ezra and I were out the back somewhere. We needed to go through this cage thing but there were dogs in it. One of them had red eyes and kept growling. I leapt onto this cement block and Ezra got onto this ledge that was attached to the fence (wire fence around the back). A dog got out and tried to attack us. Ezra slid along to the other fence to where I was. We kept going back and forth, putting legs up so the dog couldn't reach us. We managed to get to where we needed to be. Then I was watching Big Brother UK. I recognized the house, but it was sort of different. I got to the Cat Haven and then decided I didn't want to do it anymore. I called Mom to get me."
"2729"	"(2009-03-26 (18)) I had to go to some weird guy's house to straighten my hair. He was like senile and today it was causing the hair straightener to be too dangerous to use. I was going to call Mom and tell her to get me a new one. Dad was around somewhere. I couldn't remember where this guy lived. Someone was taking oranges from a basket, to use for baked beans on toast? Dad wouldn't tell me where the guy lived. I was watching Skins. Sid was in class and he had this way to wake himself up from vivid daydreams. This girl took her math book to the teacher and said she did all the questions and she had told her to do and there were no problems. Sid said ""Yeah I heard you loud enough; you're not the only person alive"". He asked the teacher if she'd noticed he was failing (and why not help him instead). She basically said there was no hope for him. Also before some time, I was in communications. I got 54% in my essay, which was like 25 marks, but I did pass. Ms Ingram was there."
"2730"	"(2009-03-27 (18)) I think Ezra and I went for a walk and we went to this guy's house. Ezra knew him. Ezra or someone stayed there. They complained about it there and said the rooster always woke them up and a shadow came through the window. They told the guy we were going to the shop and were taking the chickens in the car. We kept putting chickens in, I think there were nine. We started going and then we were walking. It was dark. This dodgy black dude was singing. We didn't want to walk past him so we ran back. We drove the car back down, the car was black I think. Then I think there were lots of people walking like zombies towards the house, including the guy from before. We ran in and I told Ezra to treat them like zombies. We barricaded the basement, but there were windows which were above ground. They were actually vampires. I went to the basement and was gathering weapons, saws and sharp things and things that would come in handy, such as a chisel. I put the smaller things in my pocket and went up the top. I'm not sure what started the attacks off. I killed quite a few. The guy who owned the house, I think was a vampire. Then it was Darren and Mom. He was a vampire and was going to kill us all. Mom asked if she could go somewhere with Ezra and she would come back and he said no angrily. The house looked like Nana's. I got the saw and walked to the dining room (from the lounge room, where the computer is). Mom and Darren were sitting at the table, eating dinner. Darren was at the end of the table, facing the kitchen and Mom was on the side with her back facing the other lounge room. I went to the back of Darren and whacked his neck with the saw. It didn't cut through and I kept hacking at it. It wouldn't go all the way through and was still attached. Mom like 'what have you done? What if he isn't a vampire/can be cured?' etc. Then he lifted his head up and looked back and me and I said ""Oh yeah, it's the heart"", he laughed and made fun of me. I tried to stab him in the heart but it wouldn't go through. I was trying from the back of him and cried out ""where's the heart?!"". Before, Cuddles was rolling on the table. When Ezra and I were walking around she kept following us. We didn't have money? I think Darren died then. Mom was then at the front door with one of the Pokemon games and I was talking to Ezra, asking ""who wants it?"". It was a GameBoy game though and she had this other old game. I said ""I have that already too, oh, no I don't,"". I let Ezra have it. We closed the blinds in Nana's room and the lounge room. Then there was this guy in Nana's room, and I think he was a vampire. Nana went in to talk and it turned out she was in on all of the vampire stuff. There were some people out the back and they didn't know about all the vampires. They were still trying to get in. This guy and this girl were married. He was now a vampire though (he was the guy from before) and was changing. The girl came in and his face was half vampire. She started kissing him and they had sex. This was all on a video and he bit her, because she wanted it. Later, this guy stole the sex tape, which was on a reel, and played it . The guy and the girl were on the floor, naked under a blanket (in the video). They turned it on and showed him (the guy who had had sex with her, didn't remember it). He jumped onto her and bit her. There was a game before, where there were different genres of games -- math games, cooking games etc. When you got certain percentages on games on a certain level you unlocked something. One of them was 25% on the cooking game and 25% on something else and that unlocked this James Spader, Sims 3 character or something. I was annoyed because I didn't like the cooking games."
"2731"	"(2009-03-27 (18)) I was at university and I was on the computers. My old 15"" monitor was there. Brent was like 'what the hell is that?' at the monitor. I explained it was mine but I had a new 22"" now. I was sitting next to Preston and I felt uncomfortable. Then I was at a place and I went into this room and there were all these Asian kids in there from Beijing. They got sent over because something was happening over there. There were toys and blocks everywhere. There was a bed, which I sat on and there was a chicken thing on there. There was also some game, where you collect food, clues etc and match DNA and find the 'killer' or whatever they were. The 'killer' in one I did was the victim."
"2732"	"(2009-03-28 (18)) I can't remember properly, but there were zombies. It had only just happened. I was with Mom and told her we had to find somewhere secure to stay and she was like 'nah I want to do something else'. We went to this building which she suggested we go to. It was packed with people. The zombies got in and everyone started running and screaming. I ran up this ramp, which led into this room where you had to jump across beds to other beds. I did so to get to this bed near the wall (far away, less likely for the zombies to get there). Everyone was impressed at how I got there. The beds were very high up (like 3 storeys or so). I got down and some guys took it while I was gone. I left there to find a new spot. I complained to Mom to trust me because I knew about zombies. I had a baseball bat and was whacking them when they attacked. She went to take a car and I said 'no, you don't take a car at the beginning of a zombie attack, maybe in two weeks'."
"2733"	"(2009-03-28 (18)) I went out to this club, or something. On the way back, I was on the train. I was sitting in the aisle seat, next to this girl who was listening to her iPod. I heard her singing a new song that Liam Sullivan did. Then a while later she was singing Day Man (from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and I was like 'Hey, I love that show!'. We talked for a bit and she asked what my name was, I said ""Izzy"" and she said ""full name?"" and I said ""Izzy Conell, with one 'N',"". She had a laptop and went to Facebook and added me. She came back to dads with me. As we walked up the driveway, the curb had 'Day Man' written on it. My room was clean and I said ""ignore the poo under my chair, if any is there"". There was, so I got a tissue and picked it up. It was fresh. I explained I couldn't smell. She got bored. She decided to leave and I said that we should go back to Mom's, as it's more interesting there. I tried calling Mom but I got no answer. We started walking up the hill, and at the top it was different. Her car was parked up there. Some Native teenagers got in it. I was behind her, so I started walking towards some houses, instead of with her in case there was trouble. She told them to get out and they did and came towards her. Their father, or something, came too and they took her into an alley. I walked to a house and knocked on the door and said ""call the police!"". The guy inside asked why and I said it was an ""8"" (dream coding). He just kept asking what was happening. I started running back home. One of the bad guys saw me and started chasing me. I tried to call Dad, but he didn't answer. I called Ezra and I said ""the police are coming"" and he said ""ok"" and hung up before I could say anything. I kept trying to call back but no-one would answer. I got to dads and went inside, and the guy left. Dad then tried to start the car up outside. He complained because all of a sudden the episodes he had of Grey's Anatomy wouldn't work. The last episode he had watched had a guy called Pharaoh, and I asked ""the one with Dustin Hoffman?"" and he said he watched that one ages ago. I said I was way behind."
"2734"	"(2009-03-29 (18)) There were races. I always won. This other girl, who was like my enemy, was annoyed about it. There was a big competition. We got to the place, which was in a big gym. Two girls hadn't come. I had a text from my enemy earlier, saying if you aim for 7th place, you would get a trophy. There were train tracks running through the gym. My mouth tasted like strong peppermint? I ignored it. A train came and I was told to get on it, so I did, which later, I realized the girl had tricked me so she could win. I didn't recognize the people on the train, and I asked about my teacher and I didn't know her name. She looked like Jenny Calendar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). There was an earring phone. I called her and I said I'd been tricked to get a train. She I lost and I said 'yeah I noticed'. I said ""races are about athletic ability and they cheated!"". I got off the phone and called Mom to get me. She didn't want to drive that far. I found a train downtown, that skipped the Riverwalk and went straight to High Bridge (which in this case was after downtown going back home). I got on it and called Mom, she was breathing heavily and she told me to be quiet and I thought 'is she having sex?' and hung up. I got on a bus that was full of Asians. I had a text from the enemy girl and I was really angry. I told Ezra later and he said that it sucked. Ezra got a new DS and he showed Dad. The old one was really big and clunky. There was something about Clayton and Asians making stuff and slaves."
"2735"	"(2009-03-29 (18)) I was with Mom at an underground train station at night. Some water was trickling in and she told me about a similar time with her and Dad. Then we were in the street and the train came past home. The train was just a single, open carriage, like a mine cart and people kept going past. Mom rang this bell, which they said was ""in case of a flood"". I got given a new timetable for the next trimester. It was lame, as I had some classes starting at 6.35am, and weird and long breaks in between. The times were all weird, like 9.08am, and 12.05pm etc. I got on the train and I was daydreaming. At 'Kelmscott' I realized I was miles away. I called Mom to get me and she started rambling and I told her to shut up. I got out and it looked like Northlands. There was a pet shop and there was a cute dog in there on the floor. There were more in cages."
"2736"	"(2009-03-30 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was either living with a girl or living in an apartment near her. She had a really hot boyfriend and they had been living together for like 5 years (it might be 8, it's hard to read). He proposed to her and he had some special family ring, so the marriage would last double the time. It was plastic and green. For some reason, I put it on. It was very hard plastic and I couldn't bend my fingers and it felt like it would snap if I tried to bend harder. I was then with Nana and she wanted to look. I handed it to the guy and I said that I couldn't wear it, 'it doesn't fit, my fingers are too fat' etc.  Then the guy and I were actually having an affair. He or the girl decided to break up. Ezra and I were at the shop and got bored. We made a mess in the store? There was a call for us about Mom waiting for us out the front of the store. Ezra had music on his phone. I was going through it, and it showed all the artists sitting around a table. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jared Padalecki were two of them. There were two others who had guest starred on Supernatural. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was wearing the same jewelry and clothes that he was wearing in P.S I Love You. He was talking and laughing with Jared. I went to play Jeffrey's music, but it just played Round and Round. He had two songs on Youtube and I was listening to them, but it didn't sound like him. He was a ""rock fan"". I was reading the FAQ for Comic-Con and there was a question about whether Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were going to be coming and it pretty much said that neither of them was coming."
"2737"	"(2009-03-31 (18)) There was a new season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It had good ratings and there was something about Danny Devito joining. It was season three though. I found a download for it and I was watching it. It had a laugh track though and it wasn't that funny. I used a fake account to complain about some DVD's. I was talking to Ezra and I checked my post and there were lots of replies. I checked my quiz and 40 people had taken it now. I was then sleeping and Darren's alarm went off, but it was in my room. I took it and chucked it on their bed and woke him up. I was then out somewhere, walking, I think. There was a house on fire, which was across the road. There was some other smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Someone was setting a house on fire over there. Dad and I tried to get home and it was confusing to get back. There was a busy road with a tunnel underneath."
"2738"	"(2009-04-01 (18)) I was at Mom's. She said the cops were going to come past and so she would take me away. As we were driving out, we passed a police car. Later, Darren took some guys car. It was white and just a normal car, but he was going to do it up. I was out the front, and this guy and his friends came to the door. I saw them walking away after Darren spoke to them. Later, Darren was out the front working on it. He took the back plate off and replaced it with a new one. The guys drove past and Darren realized the old plate was still up (started with UXM). I took it off. I emptied out the back of the car, so it wasn't obvious that it was their car. Six months later, it now looked like a hearse. I was inside the house, and it looked like it was orange. The guy came back to check it. He said to Darren that six months later, it was on sale for $5000, and it was $250? He was suspicious of Darren. I was with Dad and Ezra later in the van. On the radio, Well Respected Man was playing. I was singing along and told Ezra it was in the last episode of Supernatural. Then we were in a bus. Samantha was there too. Dad changed the station and it was playing AC/DC."
"2739"	"(2009-04-01 (18)) I was at Nana's. She was expecting the cops to come over. The cops did come over. This girl had her back showing, and she entered the house?"
"2740"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I was at home, playing Sims 3. It had no lag, and the effects were ok but a little blocky on the edges. I played it for a few minutes and then I called Mom, as I was waiting to go back there. In the kitchen, Ezra needed to plug something in. I can't understand what I've written, but it looks like it says Mom's computer, my computer and two others in the car (?) outside and 2 of 4 on something. He wanted to take out Mom's computer. I asked why not one of the other ones. He unplugged one, and it started smoking, so he took it out. He then unplugged his 'Counterstrike LAN' and this other thing and the smoke stopped."
"2741"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I was watching Penn & Teller. Teller was talking and I thought he sounded weird."
"2742"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I'm not sure how it started, but I was with Buffy, Willow and Xander (all from Buffy the Vampire Slayer). We used Twitter to find out stuff about Sims 3. We did something and then decided to go on this roller coaster thing. I was next to Xander, and he said that we were ""too close. If anyone asks if were dating, pretend we're not"". I said ok and then laughed and then thought 'pretend...?' and I realized I liked him. There was a dark tunnel and trains and buses were passing by on the opposite side. Then I was outside during the day, at a cemetery looking place. There was a rat in the kitchen. This person said ""we're boring rich people, not fun rich people"". This inspector guy was asking about the rat."
"2743"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I'm not sure how this one started either, but Willow, Xander (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and I were outside in the street running from people. There were crowds everywhere which we had to run through. He took a car and was going ""20 km/h over the limit"". We drove slowly past the cops, who were preoccupied anyway. Then we were walking. We went into this building and we went to leave (and it was just Xander and I now), but we saw people running down the street and were near the entrance, so we had to find another way out. There was a small gap where a window should be, which I could fit through. We left through there. We were then at some house/cabin thing in a forest. I got a phone call and it was from some dude asking me to steal a gun back. I said no and that I thought it was wrong. He kept going on about it so I said that I'd do it. We went back to this room and there were lots of people. They congratulated me because it was the right answer. Buffy decided to go out with Xander. The next day, they were both wearing glasses. I was in a library; they saw each other and waved. Cordelia and Buffy were wearing the exact same outfit. Cordelia saw what Buffy was wearing, some kind of skirt and a ""pie shirt"". I was at university, but it was different. I was in the computer room which was huge and like a library on the second floor. I needed to know a room number and asked Classmate-F-14, who gave me the number. I checked the door and it was a 5 digit number. I went back to the computer, and Lillian was on it. I pulled the chair out, aggressively, but then I realized she was only sitting there temporarily. There was a photo of me naked on the computer. Mom and I were then at some vacation? We were at a cabin and Ezra fell asleep. I was going for a walk and there was a woman with a dog. She asked if I'd seen her dog. I had seen her before. I said no and to look behind something that was in a front lawn. I asked what kind of dog and she said ""Alaskan Malamute"" and I said they were cute. There was a park and around it was a building. There were two patches of grass. There was water in it -- something about a game? There was a 'The Making of' and [something I can't read] slows for walk. Ezra, Mom and I were supposed to go for a walk. This girl was playing with her dog."
"2744"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) Dad and I were at the shops, going up an escalator. We went to a small shop. There were DVD's, and as we looked back at them, we both leaned back on the shelf. They had Hancock and another DVD with Will Smith in an action pose, holding a saber. There was a girl in the aisle and we had to squeeze past. I couldn't so I went around the long way, angrily. We went back to the escalators, the same ones we'd gone up, but to leave we had to go up them again. We started walking up the down escalators at first. This black teenage girl was sweeping the floors and singing."
"2745"	"(2009-04-04 (18)) I had a dog, which I'd had for four years. I went to walk it and it wouldn't go. I had to bring it to the vet. There was a show Darren was watching and it had Kenny Hotz in it, and it was some biography thing."
"2746"	"(2009-04-04 (18)) I was in a car. We passed some train tracks and there were piles of rocks. We stopped at the lights and I helped moving the rocks (I was strong, and I can't remember why, but I was thinking I was like Superman). There were shoes too and we were chucking them in a pile. We went to this house, which was mansion like. There were two sets of stairs leading up. I went to a bedroom and I thought someone else was here, and I asked ""cupboard?"" I was then with Chuck and Sarah (both from Chuck). I told Chuck to run. This girl came out and attacked me. I started fighting her and was trying to protect Chuck."
"2747"	"(2009-04-04 (18)) We were in a car with Mom on the freeway. We passed a car and Dad was in the back reading. Nana and Poppa were in the front. I wound down the window to say hello. We met up somewhere. I was then 'driving' without a car though. It involved me lying on the ground. Nana was trying to teach me. I was putting Pokemon into groups of three, and if it was in a group of 3, it didn't need something (cooking, it looks like). The way they were teaching me using cooking analogies and I had no idea what they were talking about. Mom went to see a friend. Her friend looked just like Lauren Ambrose. She said she was going to buy a bar with her boyfriend. Mom said we'd be asked to go drinking. Some time before, I called 'Perf ID' to get a proof of age card but it would take weeks to get. Later, I was at a shop. I wandered off by myself. Three people were nearby talking about fat and they stopped saying to be quiet because there was a fat person nearby (me). I turned around and said 'that was subtle'. One of them was a fat guy. I said ""at least I'm not fat and ugly like you"" and he said ""stop talking to yourself"". There were clothes shops and clothes racks everywhere. Some of the shop wasn't built yet. I went to a shop with Mom, and then I wandered off again. There was a jewelry section which was really big and full of people. I tried to run through. I went to this other shop which had lots of DVD's. I saw A Few Good Men, and on the cover were Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Spader. I went to pick it up, but this other girl did first. She was like 'I want to see this' and I said ""he's barely in it"", and then said 'both of them, actually'. She was like 'why should I trust you?'. There were other James Spader movies. She wanted them. Then it was Christian Bale we were discussing and his movies were there -- American Psycho, The Machinist and a version of The Shining. I recommended those to get. Then it was back to James Spader. Mom came and I said 'that was so funny' and she asked ""Did you used to have a crush on James Spader?"" and I said ""No!"". She said when I was younger, I had picked a movie off the shelf, and it had been Sex, Lies and Videotape. I was like 'I love that movie!'. There was a shop which had photos of me and Ezra when we were younger. In one, I had lots of jewelry and I was like 'ew, I don't remember that, what was I thinking?'."
"2748"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) I was at Mom's. Ezra and I were doing some computer thing with two of his mates; it was a puzzle game thing. It was hard, and Ezra kept shaking me and distracting me and I got a bad score. I went to dads and he did the game too? My thumbs were hurting, and I tried again and still failed. Ezra was watching channel V on TV. I was trying to fix the cord at the back of the TV. Then all these maggots showed all down the screen. I looked at the back of the TV and there was a big pile of maggots there. Dad grabbed a handful of them and chased me with them. I ran into my room, which was clean. He threw them at me. Tigger had kittens and they were on my bed. I was wondering how she had any, since she was sterilized. There was a cute orange and white one. There were some under a blanket in the cupboard. Tinkerbell had kittens too. There was a Smudgy looking one and a big one. There were some puppies too and they were quite cute."
"2749"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) I think I had an apartment. There was a dodgy dude. I can't remember, but I recorded this small video of me and this girl talking. From it, I discovered she was having an affair. Later, I went back and the video had been altered. The dodgy dude had a coat and he was following me. I ran. I ran into some toilets, and there were lots of cubicles. I hid in the corner with a knife. He came in ages later and looked in every cubicle and then saw me in the corner. Then it went all black. This happened again and I was with someone, a girl I think. I hid. Someone said someone was coming. There was a small window in the toilet. I heard someone say ""Basil"" who was a big blonde dude. I decided to run. All these people were crowded around (there weren't that many). It was at university. There was an upstairs parking lot. I 'wished' for my car and when I turned around, it was there. I couldn't drive it very well and kept driving all over the curbs and I was going over the speed limit. I didn't know how to get out of the carpark. I went down the stairs and there was a McDonald's queue. There was a new ramp and I went back to leave."
"2750"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) There was a Royal Show thing. Ezra was sitting on Mom's lap. I was going on rides. There was this floaty thing in the air, and you go on it and float and fly around on it. One turn was 55c. I can't remember it properly now. This lady ran it and she explained it to me, so I tried it."
"2751"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) I was at university, which was different. The classrooms were much bigger. It was Wednesday and everyone had an extra class. Mine was a second language one, but I didn't know what the language was. The class was very full. We had no teacher. The guy in front of me started calling out ""Jello?"" and other fat names. They threw some stuff back and I presumed it was aimed at me, so I ignored them. The guy next to me had this crossbow thing with pasta. They aimed it at me, so I snapped off a piece and whacked his face with it. He got angry and then everyone was throwing stuff at me and attacking me. I ran out. I had gotten hurt between my fingers and it was bleeding. As I left, the side of the class was open. I hit a few people on the way out. I found a teacher and told her what happened. I was in her classroom and I saw her last name was Amundson, but it wasn't actually her. There was a lady in the hall teaching a second language using a drawing on the wall. It was of grass, bush and sky. She told them to work out of you cross the park, will the light be darker or lighter. As I walked back past the classroom, I slapped the girls sitting on the side and then pulled their hair back, hard. I told this teacher that I wasn't going back to that class. I went back and she was telling them off, but it was a different class. I couldn't find my bag and this guy at the front of the class found it and gave it back. I went to the next class, which was math. Preston and Regina were there. They were in the second row, sitting at each end of the row (Regina was closest to the entrance). There was a spare desk next to each of them. Preston smiled as I walked in. I went to the third row and this girl in the fourth said ""you can totally sit next to me"" and I realized she was a girl from the other class. I said 'I don't think so' and went and sat next to Regina. I told her what happened but she didn't seem too interested. She asked me what other subject I got. She said it was a ""blank slate"". The teacher was male and I knew him and was thinking he was my English teacher or something. He looked like Larry Moss from 24. I remembered my math teacher was a female, and was Ms Kuo. I decided I wasn't going to stay for Communications after this. I text Mom to tell her."
"2752"	"(2009-04-07 (18)) I was at a school. Something was happening today that caused some people to get a fever. Oz and Giles (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) would be affected because they were both werewolves. It was temporary and their heart rates got too high and then they would turn. I was watching Giles. He was sweating and about to turn, so I chained him to a desk. This other person we had was chained to the wall. I got on top of this magnet block and climbed up this high cabinet. Then I was by myself. He got free and was just a big dog. It jumped about the room and tried to get at me. It got close a few times and I had to swing my legs around. He got to the door and was about to leave, but then he paused and came back to me. He wouldn't leave. Eventually, he must've because I left. I went back to Giles but there was another one coming on. We were going to the next room but we realized we had to go somewhere else. Xander and Cordelia walked past saying stuff about a big dog (they didn't know about the werewolves). We gathered everyone and ran out. This surfer dude was around and we said ""Can we borrow your car?"" and he said ""Sure!"" happily. It was an old Ute. I got in the back and Scarlett and Mariyam were there. Then there was a boy next to me and he unwrapped a lollipop. I said ""that's my lollipop"" and kept trying to convince him to give it. As we were leaving, someone mentioned Giles in a boat with bags, and they had put a guy with him and I said sarcastically, ""yeah, don't worry about Jake Gyllenhaal or anything!"". There was a big cow in the street. Dad was then in the car."
"2753"	"(2009-04-07 (18)) I was at home with Mom. It was different though. She told me to turn off the lights, then to do something else. I was annoyed. I turned the lights off and there was a noise out the back? There was a dude who looked like Mark Wahlberg in Fear. He was a thief too? He was trying to kill us."
"2754"	"(2009-04-07 (18)) I was at the train station, which was different. I was getting picked up inside. I saw Eugene's car. I can't remember, but we followed them. Also, there was some dude who got something had photos. He, or I, needed to ask his mother how she wanted to get them. We followed them. I was then outside what looked like Mom's house. Eugene's father Abraham was there. His mother was there too and she was skinny and looked young. The other side of the road was just grass. Nana was there and I sat with her. Eugene called her Nana and asked about Poppa. He asked me something and we started talking. I asked ""what are you doing this year?"" and he said ""Engineering"", then he paused and asked if I'd gotten in trouble for all the school I missed this year, saying he'd seen me at the train station ""100 times"".  I said that I took the train to university. He mentioned he had an older sister called Trish. Somewhere else, his mother was on the ground having a seizure. There was some game I played earlier. There was a Keike family, which I thought was based on Preston's family."
"2755"	"(2009-04-08 (18)) I was doing math, doing sequences. Doing them enabled me to solve crimes on this game that was like Sleuth."
"2756"	"(2009-04-09 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was in some building with some others. There was this thing, which had this wood bottom and then a net around the outside. There were lots of these on top of each other.  You could sit in them or whatever. Someone opened this door and all these insects came rushing in, they were dangerous. We all started running. There were lots of halls and such. To get on the net thing, you had to pull yourself up on a rope to get to the higher ones, and then use the wood to pull yourself up higher. I got to the top level and there were three people in it, so I went to the one below it. Other people were stomping on the insects and trying to kill them. Finally they were all gone. But then another door got opened and there were more of them."
"2757"	"(2009-04-09 (18)) I was out the front of Mom's, but it was different. Uncle Gabriel came over to help with the building. There were lots of little things going on, rather than just the wall. One of the things was a 'bomb shelter'. He told Mom it would take at least 3 hours to cover it. There was a ramp of sand. Uncle Gabriel asked me something but I couldn't hear him and we were both like 'huh?'. There were puppies in the sand, and I can't remember how, but one of the puppies came alive and I gave it a pat."
"2758"	"(2009-04-09 (18)) I was in a building. There were people in chairs. We had to get into them to imprint something. Xander (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and someone else from Buffy the Vampire Slayer were there. Ezra was there and I was talking to him about some games. The person next to Xander got up, so I sat there -- it was squishy. Faith talked to me later and told me to tell Xander how I felt."
"2759"	"(2009-04-10 (18)) There was a family reunion thing. It took place on a 'ghost ship'. I went alone. Abigail was there and I asked her to call Mom and Ezra and ask them again to come. There were lots of people there. I was in a room where there were people I knew, along with others. Buffy, Willow and Xander (all from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were there. We had to take our clothes off to cover ourselves with stuff. There was meat, newspaper etc. We rubbed on this slime and put it on. None of my stuff would stick on. We were all nervous about taking our clothes off. I only had my pants off though. I put on lots of this glue but all the stuff still just fell off. I went into this bedroom, which was pretty cool looking although there were no beds. It was given to Ezra. I got a less cool one. I had no laptop and said I had to get it."
"2760"	"(2009-04-10 (18)) I was at university. Our speech was actually a play that we had to do in front of the whole school. We were in large groups. I asked our teacher how we were supposed to remember all the lines and she said that we would. Ezra was in the audience. Afterwards, we were given the day off. I was going to ask if she meant we could go home, or we still had to stay there. She said ""Are you going to ask me something? Shut up"". I walked out and called Mom and she said she was busy seeing a heap of people. I said I was let out early and she said it was too bad. I went to the bus stop, crossed the road and the bus was right there. There was a car coming towards me in the wrong lane. I got onto the bus, sat down and then went and tagged on. I didn't know the route though. When it was close to where I needed to go, I got off. I ended up at a shop. There were two Targets in it. I got to the door to leave, and it was all dark. I was with someone else (a girl) and we were trying to get away from someone. We went out to the carpark. We found the girl's car. This other girl was chasing us and she got in, so we ran. We went to this other car and the key worked. We got in and locked the doors. The seat was low down. I put it up and then started to drive. It was hard to see. The lights were red, but I couldn't stop in time and I drove through as it turned green. I think I went back to a bus stop."
"2761"	"(2009-04-11 (18)) I was at some building. At the entrance, there was an escalator which went down to the carpark. The carpark was confusing. I was walking with Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and I think we were dating. We were walking through and there were other people in these robes, but I think they were aliens. They had this dark space where the face should be. We went into this section and there were lots of other people too. We had to fill these 'holds', which were big cubicle like sections. The first two were full and Angel and I went into the third one. Someone else I knew was also in that one. Ezra was in the first one. They started giving random people guns and I realized they were going to make them shoot people. I was sitting on the floor and I got up and went and sat closely next to Angel. I remembered that we had had an argument not too long ago. Farrah came in to our hold, holding a gun, saying she knew who she wanted to kill and aimed at me, so I closed my eyes and she shot. She had shot the person next to me. I said to Angel ""we have to escape!"" and we ran out. I was thinking I had to get Ezra out. I was then by myself and I opened a door which led into an underground carpark. It was pitch black and was really scary. I heard a muffled cough, which freaked me out, and I moved quietly out. I ended up at the entrance. It was night, and there was an alarm light. There were people trying to break in. They got in and I threw something at them and then ran. Some chased me down the road. This guy stopped his car and told them to leave me alone. He said he'd help me. I didn't trust him though. His car was old and a manual. I said I'd walk with him and he agreed. We went down the road and this other guy's car was stopped and there was a loud high pitched noise, which I thought was a radio signal. This other car stopped and there were these white tiger things walking around. They chased us and we ran. We went up a park like thing and then they were gone. We got to a road and I asked ""which way is Midvale?"". We started walking down one way and then we were back at the place I was before. There was a section where they made burgers (giant sized). Then the guy who had helped me was, or at least looked like, Robert Downey Jr. and we hid in a burger (separately). I called Mom to tell her to meet me there. We left and she was behind this car dressed as a penguin. This was something to do with Robert Downey Jr. and 'The Whole of the Moon'."
"2762"	"(2009-04-11 (18)) Farrah and her 'mother', Jill, came over to see us [instead of Uncle Vic, which was happening in real life] . Jill looked like a blonde actress, but I can't remember who she is. Anyway, they had this small cute puppy. We were standing near a road, and it kept running out onto the road and I kept grabbing it back. They said it was a Jack Russell cross. We were then at some wildlife place. I recognized it. It was made of wood, the floors and the walls, and the rest was caged (it was up high too). I walked into this section I remembered going into with Dad at the Gold Coast. I realized there were lots of snakes in there wrapped around the poles. I walked away but got caught on something. A green snake opened up its mouth and I called Mom to help. It jumped at me and I grabbed it and threw it away. I could see a dude on the ground below talking to a group of people and he had a baby owl. It looked like a puppy and was extremely cute. Farrah was talking about a dream she had where ""we were human and these two killer queens..."". I thought of 'Killer Queen' and I said ""like the Queen song?!"". I think someone wanted to get an owl now."
"2763"	"(2009-04-13 (18)) Ezra, Mom, Clayton, some others and I went to this basketball court, which was near this round booth which the cops used. There was a cage with a dog and if you set the alarm off, it was allowed out. We were playing on the court and the alarm went off, so we ran. We got split up. I was walking around the streets with Mom. There were lots of people standing around in groups. There was also a Chow Chow around somewhere and it was tiny. I was thinking that they were too small and that I had to look at other dog breeds."
"2764"	"(2009-04-14 (18)) I can't remember much, but Spike and Buffy (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were hanging out. She was teasing him because he had gotten scared of a scary movie and he was saying it wasn't a big deal."
"2765"	"(2009-04-15 (18)) I can't remember the beginning but I was with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and someone else in a house (or something). I asked what time it was and someone said it was 4 in the morning. We opened the door and it looked more like 4pm. It was cloudy though. I think I was a vampire too. I had pants on and we grabbed a jacket to hold over us and we ran out. Spike ripped a branch off a bush with leaves to hold in front of his face to protect it. We went to this shop. It was really confusing to get there from where we were. I had to jump into this little thing, which was like an elevator. It was like a waist-high tray, which you stood in and had to control it yourself. It was hard to control, and would tilt and could go upside down. I wasn't very good at it and had to keep holding on to the ropes and going up really high, when I needed to go down, etc. This lady was waiting and got impatient and made it go back to her. Eventually I got into the shop. I was in the aisle with the chocolates but they all had expired years ago. I was looking at the Chomps, Kinder Surprises etc. Spike asked me for them, and then we were sneaking them into girls' bags. He told me earlier he was in love with Buffy. He was talking about it, but it seemed like he actually liked me. There was a competition thing which a bunch of girls had entered by filling out forms. There was a guy with a gun and he shot this dog and it fell over in a dead heap. A policeman captured him. I was lying on my back on the ground and Spike came on top of me and we started making out. Later, or maybe before, Mom had met this guy who could go invisible but he couldn't remember who he was. He came over. Ezra heard some people planning on robbing Poppa and he was going to try and infiltrate the group. I was at home. There were two dogs there. One was at the bottom of the pool. One of them was called Adam. There was also some guy who had made this path, and some tiles had fish patterns on them. Certain ones would break if you stepped on them and would crumble away."
"2766"	"(2009-04-16 (18)) There was a game, which was like Sleuth, but you could walk around to places. There was a playground and I went in and it was sort of dirty and gross. Ezra and his friends were talking in a private room and I was in the playground, which had a section above the room."
"2767"	"(2009-04-16 (18)) I met up with some old friend of mine and we started hanging out quite a bit. A cat appeared, which I recognized, and they tried to get rid of it. It kept coming back and they decided to just keep it. I can't remember what happened, but I killed my friend. I attacked her and pulled her face off, etc. I left and then sent her a message to ask what she was doing, to try and cover it up. Then it wasn't me. The person, who had killed her, was having vivid nightmares that she thought were real. Then it was some weird day where people turned into whatever they were thinking about at a certain point in time. This fat lady that I knew was talking to me. She said she had just had sex with this young guy, who was called Brad (he looked like a surfer)."
"2768"	"(2009-04-17 (18)) I was in a house with some others. There was a dinosaur outside and I had to get onto the roof to get away. I was jumping from roof to roof. I jumped to one, and missed and was hanging on to the ledge. I then swung into a kitchen. We then lived in that house which was in the country. We got this kitten but it still in an egg (which was how they came). I had to look after it. It was nearly ready to hatch, and I put it under the tap to soften the egg, but not too much, although I thought I might've left it under there for too long. It looked chicken-y. I put it in a cup and then took it out. Its eyes opened and started to hatch. It was then a normal sized kitten and it was orange. Mom said if we were going to be getting a new cat, this would be it. Darren then came back. They called it Ray, but hadn't decided on what to name it. I was playing with it and it fell asleep. It liked me and Mom noticed and said to Darren, that they would get him one later (it was originally supposed to be for him). Then he was another guy and he was trying to bond with it, Ezra tried too, but it still liked me. I was on the computer and Mom came in and said that Aaron (who was some teenage guy) said that I could stay over to try out some computer. I downloaded some program which did some blood sampling thing, toxicity levels and other stuff."
"2769"	"(2009-04-18 (18)) I did a scratchie and won $2250. I was reading about Dylan Moran on the net. I found some pictures from something I did. I was in them, but I can't read what it says next. I showed it to Mom. I went to this place in the woods and got this cabin in the woods. I was with Eugene, who was my boyfriend, but sometimes he was/looked like Robert Knepper. This guy there was creepy looking and looked a bit like Robert Knepper. I can't remember what happened for most days, but we suspected the leader guy of being dodgy. I 'remembered' having sex with Eugene near this river. It was actually a movie sometimes and that happened in the movie and I was imagining it, very vividly. Anyway, one night I decided I wanted to have sex with him. The lights in the cabin weren't working, but one little light came on. I was on the floor doing something, when Eugene came in. He lied down in the bed and was talking to me, while turning off the lights outside. I took my clothes off and went over to the bed and climbed on top of him. We kissed and then I realized the lights were on outside and someone was watching us. I got up and covered myself with a shirt. Eugene then found a camera under the cupboard and we realized they had been spying on us. I put my clothes on. We were packing up to leave. Earlier, I was going through a video camera that Dad had. There was a video of Mom on the toilet, pooping. I also found some video of Eugene and I having sex, but he didn't film it."
"2770"	"(2009-04-19 (18)) I was watching Lost. They had finished up at the DHARMA initiative. They were getting flashes again. Kate and Ben are the only two who I remember. Then I was getting flashes, along with a few others. This girl and I went to this train station thing to wait for another person. From the future, there had been a girl with curly blonde hair. We were trying to look out for her because she was a bad guy. I saw her and we had to ask her to hold onto this brown board of wood. We knew she would betray us, but had to get her to do it. We got onto a train. There were mirrors on the sides, which showed 'reality' -- the food had maggots and such. The bad girl left. We then were at a house and it was night. We had to leave. We went out the door and it was pitch black outside. I saw (bad) people hiding in the bushes and such on the other side of the road. We carefully crawled out and went behind bushes instead of going near the road, and made it to the back of the house. Then the girl I was with was Anya (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and she was talking about jobs she wanted -- including an ambulance driver. We saw a group of people and I assumed they were religious singing people. We went over and this girl who looked just like Anya hugged her and it was her mother (she didn't know, as she had taken over a body). Her mother asked her where Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was as he had been her boyfriend. Then I was at a library/book shop and it reminded me of Planet Video. Ms Ingram was there. She was trying to help me find handouts for my speech. We decided on a poster of Watchmen. I wanted this 'real' one which had Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the corner, but I could only find cartoon ones. There was a real one but it only had Jeffrey Dean Morgan on it. Part of my speech mentioned Lisa from The Simpsons and Ms Ingram showed me some Bart and Homer pictures. There were some South Park pictures which were 3D-ish and smoothed out. There was something that had Cartman talking and I couldn't work out if it was his real voice or not."
"2771"	"(2009-04-20 (18)) I can't remember this dream properly, as it was all over the place. I was on MSN talking to Ezra. I was friend with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). There was this rooftop looking place, but it wasn't a rooftop, where there was a moving block that came from the ground and was what Spike used to get into his underground area and back up. I remembered back to when I was young and watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Spike had hung out here all the time. I laughed and told him about him sitting 'cool' and with a skeleton on top of a coffin. People kept resurrecting family members. I remembered walking around the block and how almost every girl had watched some movie. I don't remember what it was and I was telling Ezra about it."
"2772"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) There was a spaceship and it reminded me of Battlestar Galactica. Something happened and the first 13 floors got flooded. I was on the 13th floor and this girl and guy told me that they were teleporting away to a planet and would come back for us. The timer had already started and they disappeared. I went to tell others."
"2773"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) Mom and I went to a friend's who was selling puppies. They weren't anything special and she was trying to force us to buy one. She put them in the back of the car and we said we liked it? Darren was there too. I was saying that I didn't want to get a dog I didn't really like."
"2774"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) I was at a restaurant with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Dad, I think. Spike was eating a bloody piece of meat. I think I was a slayer. This girl came and we started fighting. She held Spike at the wall, holding a stake at his chest and I told her not to do it and ripped her off him and told him to run. She had others with her. I ran out into a big shop. I ran into the stairwell and bolted down. I think Samantha was the girl? Someone was eating a hamburger on the stairs (I was above them, looking down). I ran out onto a floor and hide under the escalator. They were looking for me. She turned off this fountain they had inside. I then ran the other way. There were no shops with anything I could use as a weapon. I ran into a wedding shop. She followed me and we fought again. I asked if I could finish writing in some dreams before she killed me and she agreed. I text Calvin, saying ""weps and camera. 20 mins, bush behind bride shop. Bring like 20 people"". Outside, there was a bush/forest thing. I ran out the back door and hundreds of people were coming through the bush -- all the people Calvin had gathered. I ran in the direction they were heading. I got there and thanked Calvin. I realized I didn't have my phone and I went back and found it. There were teachers from last year there. Eugene's car pulled in too."
"2775"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) I can't remember properly, but Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Ezra, Dad, others and I were outside, during the day. I realized this and I asked Spike why he was in the sun. We were on the way to Nana's. He started to burn so we walked in the shade. There were two paths to take, one which had bush covering and therefore totally shaded from the sun and the other was a long way around and not shaded. I said we should take the bush path for Spike but they ignored me and went the other way, so I went up the bush path. I got there first. I went into the backyard and walked towards the kitchen. I saw a giraffe in there. Nana said ""Oh there's a giraffe in the kitchen"", like it was normal and I said ""Yeah... because that happens every day,"". Dad came next. Inside, there were photos on the fridge. One had two Jared Padalecki's, with a guy and a fire in the background. Spike and I were also in it, hidden behind the others talking to each other. I was like 'oh I remember two Sam's'. Ezra was like ""good times""."
"2776"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) Ezra came into my room, which was different. I had a TV as a monitor and wallpaper on the edges of my wall. I had piles of stuff and he started doing stuff and I was telling him off and explaining why. I complained to Mom about it and she just told me to shut up. Ezra got angry and started throwing stuff and was like crying angrily and was about to slam my door and I stopped him. He squirted me with choc milk and I went into his room and did the same. I was trying to tidy my room and he came in and helped to do something on the computer. I went onto Facebook and somehow found two accounts called Matthew Clark, but his name was actually Preston Casey? I was going through his photos and I was going to get them but Ezra was watching me. I had posted something on there before, so I deleted it. Some guy said ""42"" and then I (or someone) said ""oh, by 80"" and saying that some other model was better than what he had. My webcam was called ""Izaela"" and I said ""No I call it Vera"". Then it was Adam Baldwin on the computer and he said ""Yeah, coz everything's so much easier if it's called Izaela""."
"2777"	"(2009-04-22 (18)) Mom made me go into the shop and we got this weird shaped key, we had $10, but it was $20 so I went to Mom. I then decided I didn't want it and got the money back. Mom was babysitting Amelia. It was stormy looking outside. She said it was going to storm badly and she was going for a drive. I went along anyway and Ezra sat in the back. It said it was 4.40, which meant we were late. We ended up at Darren's parents, but they were all different and I didn't recognize anyone at the table. I started feeling weird. They all wanted to hold hands. I said I didn't want to join in, saying ""I'm not doing any stupid religious stuff"". Darren started crying before because his mother was sick with cancer, I think I ended up attacking Mom; I dug my nails into her. Everyone got confused. I left, still feeling odd. Everyone was ignoring me and staring at me. I was then walking with a group, including Giles (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), in a grassy area. The rest were teenagers and had to do something to stop them from getting up to no good. We were walking down a path, Giles no longer with us, so I called out and he came. I think he was angry with me. There was a pool table and he was playing pool and won. He cheated I think. Ezra was on a computer and he was watching a Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) montage. Darren said the music used was ""cute"" and fit the montage.  Then he said ""Ew, he has a freckle on his face!""."
"2778"	"(2009-04-22 (18)) I had some mail and it was my proof of age card. The envelope was big and was full of other stuff. The photo on the card was stupid. My mouth was open, but it had three mini photos and my main photo was me on a 3/4 angle with the front of my face over the top. I called Mom to complain but I couldn't get through. I tried to call the DPI but I kept getting disconnected. I went for my walk with Ezra. We went across the road and there was a lemur. I called out ""There's a lemur eating Ezra's head!"". It tried to get me, so we ran. It was bouncing around. I was then watching something. There was a boy and he opened the door and there was a creepy scarecrow and I screamed."
"2779"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There was a second Buffy. I can't remember how she was around, but she was like the Buffy-bot. Spike was with her and angry with it because it was annoying. They were doing a strong spell and Dawn was doing it, which I thought was strange. Tara was with her. She stopped for a second and then there were two Tara's and they were doing the same thing. I was looking for Buffy stuff to download for Sims 2. There was lots of Spike stuff, but I also found Buffy outfits and a Spike Sim. There was a forum post and people replied with numbers, one of them was ""167th!"" etc. They were making a list of people who Spike had 'slept with'."
"2780"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I don't know where we were, but Raquel and I were far away (like a few hours drive). The train only came every 1-2 hours. There was one coming in a few minutes but she decided to catch a ride back instead. There was a big truck thing and a fat dude was driving. We asked if he was going into town and he asked where we were going and we replied ""Centerville"". We had to sit in the back. Raquel jumped out after about one minute. I told him to stop and I tried to go after her but I had to run through some sand and it was hard to run. She pulled up with a Ute and I got in. We then tried to get on the freeway, but ended up at a factory place. There was lots of smoke and we had to drive through it, so we wound up the windows. It started coming through the aircon (which didn't work). I said that I got lost here once with Mom. I was then out of the car hanging around outside the factory. There was a box of kittens and they were really cute. Someone called my name and it was Ezra and he was moving sand?"
"2781"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I was watching a movie like Scary Movie. The guy with the mask was on the phone to a girl at the start and mentioned killing a ""skirt"" and then told her to ""look out the window"" and her boyfriend was tied to a chair wearing girls' clothes. The next day at school, he was actually gay and acting very flamboyant and snapping his fingers. He was Indian-ish. He had become friends with this guy and he went up to his friends and put his arm around them, and snapped his fingers and left. His friends were all confused about it."
"2782"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I was with Nana. We were going to Michael Palin's house. We were walking up to it and the house was big (mansion-like). It had a big driveway with a bit of garden. I was telling Nana that I had deja vu. We were going to meet him on the oval. There was a fake battle going on and there were people in costume. We went inside and he was with this lady secretary called ""Ms Fichtner"". His kitchen was big and had a dining table spreading over two rooms. There was a big bowl of bowl of big bananas. The room was very glassy (lots of windows etc). Then Nana was Raquel. There was a shop section in his house. There was a food section on the outside of a clothes shop. It had desserts on it and Raquel eating them. I had a few bites, but I was full. She ate a lot and when they were finished they put new ones there."
"2783"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I can't remember what show, but it was X-Files like and then Mulder and Scully were in a hangar warehouse thing talking."
"2784"	"(2009-04-24 (18)) I was with a guy friend and we were in bed. It was then Xander and Willow (both Buffy the Vampire Slayer). She asked ""did we sleep together?"". Then I was somewhere else on a bed with others and there was a photo of Mariyam at a party and she had her pants off and had a guy's penis in her mouth. We were all like 'ew!'. Tigger was at Mom's on my bed, and then went under it. Ezra was reading off a file and Jayson's photo was next and I realized it was my PowerPoint presentation. I got it off him and put it under my bed. Then I was with Chuck (Chuck) in a carpark. We liked each other but I think I was like in Sarah's position, but then I was just a normal person. Sarah was there too and she had something in her head that let her scan licence plates. I was on the net and looking at Yvonne Strahovski and Zachary Levi's profiles on Flixter or something. I tried to download the latest episode (it was up to season 3), but I accidentally downloaded a season 1 episode and then one from season 2. Then Darren had his own house and we went over there. He had a sister called Astrid. It was night. I joked to Mom ""What a lovely name"". They told me to be quiet. There was a monster? It had a sharp jagged claw thing. I managed to cut its arm off. It stabbed Darren, but he was ok. We were then in a carpark again and it was lying dead on the ground. The police came; one of them was a young guy. They asked us what we were up to, 'drinking' etc (they were suspicious of us). Ezra was with us. I said ""Yeah we're out drinking with a 15 year old"". The cop grabbed Ezra's hand and was questioning him about not having a job since he was old enough etc. Then, I can't remember properly, but I was in a game? There were zombie things and I ran into a room and I had to do stuff to get to the next room. There was a hole in the wall and I opened a latch and this octopus/squid thing was in there. I pulled out the tentacles and then I had to punch it in the head. I then had to reach in and grab its eyeballs. I did so. I put the eyeballs in the door slot and went to the next room. I was in a hall with tools on the walls. I grabbed a hammer and a chisel. I walked through to the next room and Yvonne Strahovski was there. We had to do excavation type digging and I had grabbed the right tools. I told the girl next to me I did this in robotics. Then I was with Chuck and Sarah and we had to take the elevator to the top floor and to the roof of this building. There were 11 floors. I got in and an Asian dude got in too. It passed the 11th floor and I got off with him. I don't know what I did, but I was then coming back down the road and there was a plane on the freeway (this was on the roof?). This lady pointed me in the direction of the door. I got in the elevator and this guy came and I tried to close the door before he got in, but he got in. I thought he was dodgy. He pressed the button for the first floor. He got off there and I was now 'Chuck' and had no intersect. He got off but I went to the floor below because I couldn't be bothered running down the stairs. I ran outside and there were dodgy cars. There was a bomb thing but I didn't know where to go. I ran and hid behind bushes out the front of the shop. There was lots of gunfire and I was now Ellie and she cried ""Chuck!"" (quietly)."
"2785"	"(2009-04-25 (18)) I got a game for something. I got a Pokemon game and a doctor game thing. I was playing the Pokemon game and I had to heal three types of Pokemon but you also got other animals coming in that needed healing. You could then use them on a farm. Ezra was there too. The Pokemon came through yellow, blue or pink, and they just looked like flippers. The setting was in like a portable hospital (it was like a caravan). I told Ezra what to do and said to use something -- you had lots of choices. We shoved it in (the needle or whatever) and it died. We then were following the steps off a guide and it was all working. Then we were in the ground because we had to plant a tree. Someone played a joke on me? I was then at a school. I was in class and Ms Ingram asked who liked to work alone. I put my hand up, as did Preston, but then he also put his hand up for working in a group. I had an argument with this guy on the oval and I called him a 'tard'. He started calling me fat and ugly and I said ""at least I'm not retarded"". He got angry and was like 'what did you say?!'. I was far away from class and started walking across the oval to go home. I realized I forgot my shoes and walked back. I went back to the class and three guys were chucking shoes onto the roof (there were lots of shoes). I realized I had 'three' of my shoes. They had also stolen something else (Freddo's, etc). As I took them off him, they were on my face again (that's what it looks like, it might not be 'on'). I had a fight with him and after that he was friendly towards me. He played soccer. Later, I was at Mom's, which was totally different and in a different area. It was night and very dark. My computer was outside. It was on the edge of a hill, which I walked up with this old lady and Mom, Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and Dad were there, outside another house. Poppa started trying to have sex with Nana and pushed her on the floor. They were joking about it, and then Uncle Wilbur went on her and Poppa and his 'boss'. Everyone was laughing and joining in while I stood in shock. I just got what I went there to get and walked back. There were some people with a cute kitten and I said it looked like their old one and then they killed it. It came back though. They kept killing it but it just kept coming back."
"2786"	"(2009-04-26 (18)) I complained to Darren that Ezra's carpet was better than mine. They were going to be doing something to mine, so we decided to change it. We were getting paper and rubbing off the floor to put carpet down. There was a layer of 'carpet balls' and they were small. I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They were in a caravan. Buffy was upset with everyone for not noticing her, then she invisible. She left and time passed (it was only a while for her). She went to a house and there was a guy who looked like ""James Spader or Jimmi Simpson"" (that's what I thought). He was young (in his 20's). She wasn't invisible at the moment and she was inside. She passed a mirror and he had no reflection, so she staked him. She went to leave and then he said that it wasn't going to stop him. Then the cops were at the door. He went out and so did Buffy. He walked out into the sunlight and was ok. She went to the Magic Box, but it was closed down. It was only a small shop on the corner of a street. There were puppies and kittens left inside (it had been a pet shop). She went inside. She was now invisible again, but this old lady came and could see her. She told her to do some stuff and then she went all senile and said ""you have milk with your milk!"" and got angry. Buffy left and she was now me. It was starting to get dark and vampires started coming out. I was staking them and got in a car. The old lady said ""you'll never get your licence!"". I was running the vampires down and there were groups of them at every turn. A teenage guy was at a skate park thing and there were long jumps. His 'friend' asked him if he'd ever done some cool trick and he said yeah, but was obviously lying. They were near a school, which I ran into. We were then all running around in the stairwell and using this broken bit of wood as a stake and some vampires didn't 'dust'. There were lots of different sets of stairs and it was really confusing. The vampires would bite people and they would turn straight away and keep biting, so they just kept increasing and there were heaps. Cordelia was there and was like 'what is going on? Zombies?'. I wasn't very scared of them and was going straight into them and staking them. I was then hiding out in the stairs with a few people. The vampires called everyone down and a small group and I went up this set of stairs, quietly. We got to the top and it was just a small balcony at the top of the gym (where everyone was), and no way to get off. There was a huge crowd down there. The only way to get off was to go straight into them. So, we leapt off onto this mat, which fell into them and some people fell off. We staked some and then the mat bounced back up and the next one fell into another group of vampires and we lost some more of the group. We tried to get to the next one but they got us. There were only three of us still human. They put us up against the wall and asking if we wanted to be turned or just killed. There was a video shop right outside the gym. Some guys came in and the vampires saw them and were like 'tasty snack'. One of the guys then turned around with a gun pointed at them and he was Colin Farrell and I was like 'oh no, Colin Farrell!'. I was thinking 'please don't let Colin Farrell save the day'. They were shooting and I was trying to work out how to escape. Then I was in a cinema with Dad and we were watching some Colin Farrell movie. I hadn't actually watched it and it ended, and everyone stood up and applauded it and were crying. I was annoyed, thinking that I'd wished I'd watched it."
"2787"	"(2009-04-26 (18)) I was in a car with Mom, Darren and Ezra. Ezra was using my iPod because I had a heap of songs from this new R&B singer guy that I didn't like. Two Princes came on the radio and Darren was like 'Oh my God, I love this song!'. We dropped Ezra off. Darren had a shirt that Dad had. Then it was like a dream I've had before and no-one could touch anyone. I was with Eugene and a guy and a girl. There were zombie things too. There weren't many though. We went to this shed building. It had lots of floors and every one was the same and empty. It swayed too. The floors were just big rooms. We picked a floor and we lied down to sleep. Eugene and I slept next to each other, as we always did, and wore gloves and were completely covered in case we touched. This lady and son had something to do with it and they wanted to start it up again (it was like on a farm and it produced something?). They saw us and gave us food and it was weird and squishy and in balls. They gave us fruit too (lots of fruit). The guy was weird looking but I thought he looked a little like Michael Palin. Eugene and I never said we liked each other, but we and everyone else knew we did. One day I somehow fell off a cliff and he grabbed my hand and pulled me up. We looked at each other and realized we were ok and then we started making out."
"2788"	"(2009-04-27 (18)) I called Ezra to ask him something and I was on my way home. I was then outside (it was different) and there was a party in there. There were people on my computer, which was right next to a window with no curtain. I tapped on the window and they ignored me. I stormed in, angrily, and said ""Get off my computer!"". They were people from school last year. They were actually not on my computer and Ezra was. He quickly got off and I pulled the desk behind it away (they had been sitting at a desk where my computer usually was) and I put my computer back. They complained about having to move. I went on Facebook and I had a message and it was from Duane. Silas was in my suggested friends list."
"2789"	"(2009-04-27 (18)) I was at Mom's, which was different. I was talking to her about PETA and saying that there was a Penn & Teller: Bullshit episode about them and that I thought they were evil. A group of them came over but they were like carpenters and were showing us different things we could do around the garden. We weren't interested and then this guy was like 'I'll get them with this one!' and Mom decided to go with it. This singer climbed up on a railing at his concert and then jumped into the crowd. They caught him but he was bleeding. Mom and I helped carry him away. This lady was trapped outside? I said ""Darren's gay"" because he was there. Someone was being distant towards me. I told Mom that someone had made a name by themselves by pretending they were male because ""no-one reads female writers"". There was an episode of Heroes and we (?) were in a safe and we used phones and ice to block others?"
"2790"	"(2009-04-28 (18)) I was taking another IB course somewhere else incase I failed at Westland. Ezra was doing it too. Ms Myzshka was on the teacher list. The class was big.  The first assignment was a speech and we had to introduce ourselves. It was Wednesday and I was missing out on the MUPC to be there. I decided to leave. I text Mom but then went to Westland by myself. I was one hour early so I decided to skip it altogether."
"2791"	"(2009-05-01 (18)) Mom took me to something and I decided I didn't want to go in. I waited in the car. This guy who looked like Ezra came over and opened the door and attacked Mom. He had a brick and was hitting her with it. I said at least he's not holding it down, or something, and then he did. He was really hurting her and I tried to get him off."
"2792"	"(2009-05-01 (18)) I discovered some bombs, I think. I pushed them away and closed a gate. Some kids, others and I lied down and covered ourselves and it went off. Then it was a desert place. There were a few houses and a few things in the sand to stay in. There weren't many people left, no electricity etc. I was trying to work out with someone what we were going to do with everyone. There weren't many male children, and they were mostly black. I can't remember what happened but this girl and I were in an airplane thing and the guy started to take off. The girl was Judy Reyes sometimes. I peeked over the top and he was going to commit suicide by flying into the mountains. He stopped to take a break. We got out and we ended up in a carpark. We ran behind a building and took a car. We saw his car coming back (it was a red sporty looking car). We drove at full speed away from him. I was then running and was in a building at Westland. I was going up and down stairs and ended up in the library and I didn't know where to go."
"2793"	"(2009-05-01 (18)) I pulled off my thumbnail, which was quite long and there was a short one underneath, which confused me. They both easily peeled off. I tried to put the long one back on, but it felt like I had two nails on there. I showed Mom. Ezra and I were then in water and there was a bit where you hold onto swings and then you are shot forward, and there was a long 'obstacle' course in the water."
"2794"	"(2009-05-02 (18)) I was at Nana's, which was different. There was a big room full of beds. Outside that room was a shop thing. The aisles had horror posters, puzzles etc. There was a Child's Play one and a haunted house one. It spoke to me (it had an audio thing). I went to bed. It was dark in there as people were already sleeping. Nana and Poppa were in a bed. Dad and Ezra were in another. I said to Ezra later that instead of building one big bedroom, I should've them and a shop separately. We were clearing out movies. We had heaps missing including The Langoliers and The Happening and others. I found Ezra and he said he didn't take them, so I was looking for Dad to ask him. I went into a computer shop to look for him. I left and realized I needed to go back (we owned it and Dad had stuff there?). I was walking outside and I saw Turk (Scrubs) walking below. I yelled out ""Turk!"" but he didn't hear me, so I went closer to this fence and yelled again and he heard me. I told him to tell them to close the shop; he smiled in acknowledgment and ran back."
"2795"	"(2009-05-03 (18)) There was another season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it was season 9. Her mother was a bot, and I think Buffy was too. Her sister was a baby. Spike was over. All these robots came and, like vampires, had to be invited in, but they had some way around it. I was then Buffy and I was shooting them and giving weapons to others. One then got out this clock thing which we knew was dangerous and so activated this thing we had and ran and got sent into another world. We were at a school and Buffy was sitting at a table in a grassy section talking to a friend about slaying. Someone there fixed our device so we had more control over where we went with the device. In that world, people could change their names whenever they wanted. In the next world, her mother was still alive, but she wasn't. I was watching Smallville and Clark and his girlfriend, who was Mena Suvari, were going to have sex. He was lying naked on the bed and I thought that was odd for Smallville to have full frontal nudity. Lana was in the room too and she was a bot and was naked and lying on the ground."
"2796"	"(2009-05-04 (18)) I can't remember properly, but this guy and his mother lived in a fancy house at a shopping center, as they had shop things there. One day he saw someone who was vampire like and he stabbed them in the heart. He told people about it and they thought he was crazy. Soon after, there were lots at his door and he was stabbing them all with sharp things and then he found his mother and asked if all the doors and windows were locked. She said they were. They closed the blinds and snuck along under the windows. They looked out a window and they could see the entrance of the store (the store was circular). There were some vampires lining up. They went out another entrance and they turned around and started coming at him. He managed to kill all of them. Then they got back up and it had been set up by his mother to show him that there were no vampires. It now had been an episode of a show and I had thought it was a good idea. Jasper and Fatso were back and they were all at Ezra's room."
"2797"	"(2009-05-04 (18)) A submarine had gone missing? Some others and I went to investigate. It was connected strangely and I picked up the top bit out of the water and there was a little section where you sit to control it. I emptied the water out of it and pulled it to the surface. I got in and there was a guy talking on the intercom, but he was speaking a different language. It had then been a movie and he was Jean Reno. He had a daughter on there too. I discovered the submarine was full of zombies or vampires and so got out. It had started sinking again and it was hard to get out. I had to swim back to the top. Eugene was part of the group and we had a kid and two puppies (they were all with us). A bunch of vampires came towards us, but it was day time. There were these hard plastic arrows on the ground and we stabbed them with them. We got rid of that lot and kept moving. There was a section of the place (it was school like) that was messy and there had obviously been a big fight there. There was a giant arrow and I said ""ooh, can I have this?"" and someone said ""They'll get you before you pick it up and turn it around to them"". We were then given darts to get them with. More came and I had extremely good accuracy, getting them directly in the heart. I missed a few though and kept stabbing them until they were gone. Some ran towards us at one point and I had an arrow and a dart and held them out and killed them. We put our son, plus this guy's daughter whose name was Kara and our puppies on a roof to keep them safe. The kids were around 5 years old. Also, one of the puppies was called Mikey. We walked into this section with dorms and a classroom with stairs leading down. I was worried about the kids. There were vampires scattered around, just wandering around and dopey looking."
"2798"	"(2009-05-05 (18)) I was at dads. I think Granny was over, or we were there earlier and she gave us microwaved chips for food. Ezra ate some, but it was gross and I didn't want to eat it. I called Mom and she told me to text her because she couldn't talk. She said she was looking after Amelia. I wanted to go back to her place to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Later, Ezra and I were crossing the street and Ben (Lost) walked past behind us and I was like 'Ben is awesome!' and Ezra was like 'meh'."
"2799"	"(2009-05-06 (18)) I was at home. Ezra was having a party and there were lots of teenagers there. I was secretly going out with Neil Flynn and he was there too. He was a bit Janitor-like (Scrubs). Ezra and I were in the pool but I wasn't putting my head underwater. This guy was in a costume with a creepy mask and it gave me chills and freaked me out. There was a tall, pale guy but Neil was still heaps taller. Some girls, Neil and I left and we ended up at another party. There were some people sitting on the lounge, including Neil. I sat on front of him and he was subtly touching me with his foot. Also, Ezra was saying that he thought he was gay and Mom was like 'no, you're not gay'. We all left again and Lindsay Lohan was with us now. There wasn't enough room in the car. Lindsay was usually the driver, I think, but she moved into the back to sit on someone's lap. I didn't know where Neil was and I said ""Where's Janitor? We can't leave without Janitor"". But then he was in the driver's seat. I couldn't see over his head because he was so tall (I was behind the driver). While driving, he asked ""Izzy, can you hand me some of those handwipes?"" and I asked ""KFC ones?"".  There were a few scattered on the floor. I picked one up and handed it over and he gently held and stroked my fingers as he took it. I fell back in my seat, really happy and thinking that no-one in the car knew or saw it. I don't know where we went then, but it was possibly Mom's. It was different though. I was on the bed, and Neil was on the computer which was against the wall next to the bed. He was looking at pipes and stuff -- because he was a janitor? I had found my dream books earlier, which had been in a cupboard at home. There weren't any 96 page ones and they were small. I was going through them and mentioned a recent dream. Neil asked ""was I in it?"" and I said ""yep"". He said something about the room and I said ""it's got a lock on the door"". I started putting away stuff on the bed. I was watching Scrubs and Todd said ""Yep, everyone's a fart"". Then, Neil's character was called Todd and I thought it was odd that I never noticed there were two Todd's. Some time before, I showed Mom some books. This girl came into the room and said ""sucks he's not interested in me"" and I responded ""I don't care"". Mom was watching Supernatural. It was the end of season 2 or a TV movie. There was a weird cloudy thing in the sky. There was a guy with a dog and a car. I was watching episode 2 and was making fun of Dean's face. I was thinking that now Mom would now who Sam and Dean are."
"2800"	"(2009-05-06 (18)) There was a shop attached to where we lived. A family was moving into this section we used to play in sometimes. It was going to be a kid's bedroom (a very big one). There was a Subway right across from it. There was a young guy there and Mom thought he was hot and was being flirty with him. Mom and Darren said they were going for a drive, so I came. We got there and got out of the car and they put on masks to cover their eyes and black jumpers. I asked what they were doing and they said they were breaking in to get files off a computer. I waited in a room with a Chihuahua. It was looking at me and trying to nip our feet, so I started talking to it aggressively to let it now I was the boss. It went away and put its head down. Tigger and Gizmo were then there too."
"2801"	"(2009-05-06 (18)) I was at Nana's. There was a girl talking to a guy to get a movie part in the dining room. He told her to take her clothes off and I told her not too. Later, we were out the back and I can't remember but he got something and was trying to attack me with it. I got this ""triple fly swat"" and hit him with it. We ended up on the ground and to save him another whack, I hit his eye and it turned white and he was then blind. I was like ""I'm sorry!"". But he got up with his weapon and I ran in and told Nana to lock the doors. I asked for the car keys so we could try and leave."
"2802"	"(2009-05-07 (18)) I was at home. There was a door in the kitchen leading out the back but it had been blocked for years. Tinkerbell and Tigger were outside and I let them in. I went to my room and it was clean, but still a bit messy. My shutters were open and so all the light was natural light. There were pillows and cushions on the floor as well as a giant slug. The latest episodes of House and Lie to Me were out. This girl dropped something in a bin and Jennifer Morrison got it, I think it was drugs. Later, she was with Chase (House) and she was giggly. House found it in the bin."
"2803"	"(2009-05-07 (18)) I remembered this movie, but I couldn't remember its name. I had remembered about it because I found paintings of it on my computer and the stuff had happened to me. It was Asian like. I was walking with guys from Prison Break and Michael Scofield was walking next to me. I was thinking how T-Bag and Bellick were the most dreamt about from Prison Break. Anyway, I think the movie had Bellick in it and Willem Defoe. I found it on the net, but I now can't remember what it was called but it was from 2000. I went to a shop where I had first found the movie. In the movie, there were people in cars and there was a spooky thing happening outside. One scene had a car in the water and there were electric wires sparking in it. At the shop, I found a little shop -- the aisles were squishy and they all leant on each other. There was a squeaky thing. There was a girl with downs syndrome and she kept doing a kick in the air. I got out and I had a call from Darren saying that Mom had left town, which meant she was borrowing a car off Poppa. I asked if he could pick me up -- I was at Meadowbrook. He was on a motorbike. I was going through my phone and I had Eugene's number and I accidentally dialed it, but quickly hung up."
"2804"	"(2009-05-08 (18)) I was telling Ezra about the last episode of Lie to Me, the one with the prison, while I was eating. Mom was making pudding in the oven and it had peas and corn in it too, to make it warmer. Then I was half watching/half living it. There was a prison. There were 5/10 people left that knew something. Two of them were supposedly in there. One was called Claire and she had a kid in there who had been killed (I think) and hidden in a vending machine. There was a room and I got dragged in there by a bad guy. The room was full of 'good' prisoners. The guards came in and all the prisoners killed them. I knew which people knew the thing. I said, to a bad guy, 'I'd like to say I'd last 50 years [of torture] , but I wouldn't last one year' and that I didn't know anything. I was offered a comfortable room. Scrubs was on TV and Carla knew a patient's illness, but was waiting for Elliot to get it. The Janitor was somewhere too, and someone proposed to Elliot. Then there was a game and it was Left 4 Dead like and I had a computer team. We had guns so were shooting the zombies. Then we hid in a big bathroom (it was really big, like the size of the kitchen and lounge room or bigger). It was full of zombies and there was a witch one (from Left 4 Dead) and it screamed at me and I shot it. I kept opening the door and shooting whatever was there.  Then two of the computer team came. Dylan Moran was in there too and he got bit. I shot him in the groin/stomach area. He was confused about it and I told him he was going to turn. He was upset. His hand had been shot on the side and it was bloody and gross. I sat down next to him and ran my fingers through his hair, thinking I'd always wanted to do that. My gun was on the ground and I saw him tense up so I moved it away. My phone rang and it was a black team-mate (a computer player). He asked ""Where are you?"", I replied ""Uh... bathroom"". He hung up. It was time for a herd. We got given an extra gun, mine was heavy. I put my back up against the wall and put Dylan Moran in the corner so if he turned I could shoot him. Then Jack and Ben (both from Lost) had been in a fight and Ben had died, but he knew who the last person was (of those people that knew something) and so brought him back. Ben was visibly happy and Jack warned him about these 'fairy' things. One of them, if you got bit, there was no coming back. Then he was saying Turk (Scrubs) didn't want to know. Ben was cheery and then he got hit in the back with a paste from the fairy thing and I was thinking 'no, they can't kill him twice'. Also, I did end up having to shoot Dylan Moran. I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Mac was with two guys. I was like ""Who's the other one? Charlie! Duh, my favourite!"". Mac was working in a pizza place or something."
"2805"	"(2009-05-08 (18)) I was invited to a party. I went with Mom, Ezra, Dad and Nana to check out the place. The people there were really friendly and had glasses of a chocolate drink. I had a taste and it was really nice. I liked Coke too. They left and then Ezra and I were left there. Ezra was then a friend of mine. They told us to stay in a room and they took our phones. Eventually, some guys were playing poker in a room next to us, but downstairs. They were smoking and drinking and laughing like they were going to do something bad. My friend was now Zach Braff and we were joking around and he accidentally grabbed my butt. I said ""why'd you do that?"" and he said ""I don't know, I didn't think ahead"". I'm not sure how long after, but a girl started screaming and they tried to get in our room. I tried to keep the door closed. Outside the room, they had babies and puppies and were dropping them off the balcony (an inside balcony). I tried to call out to one of them and they laughed and it was really evil sounding. They were raping girls. We kept trying to escape but it was impossible. It then reset to just before Mom and co left. I let them leave again. The same stuff happened, but I got my phone back and tried to call the police. I said I didn't remember the street name and it was written on the fridge, but I said it was in Dianella. Then the person on the phone started talking weird and I realized it was one of the bad guys. I realized my phone had been modified. I tried to send a message on Facebook, via my phone. By the way, when it reset, Ezra and I remembered everything but no-one else did. It reset again and this time I got my phone back before it got modified, but they gave me my friend's phone and my phone to them. My friend was now Calvin. I text Mom the address and told her to get me now. This time we managed to escape and Calvin, others and I ran into a shop area and all the bad guys were chasing us. It was night. Some of us got caught. A few of us also hid in a bush but some got up and they saw us. A few of us (including myself) ran into a tunnel, which were train tunnels but they were like sewer tunnels. We just ran blindly down the tracks and tunnels and up and down sets of stairs. I called Mom and one of them answered. I couldn't outrun them so I tried to hide under a set of stairs. Then a head was next to me and he said ""hello"" in a deep voice, which scared me. It reset again (to before Mom and co left) and I said ""let's go now"". Dad was in a Ute and I was standing outside waiting to get in. The sky was cloudy and evil. I was telling Dad about what kept happening and he said they had to lay off the 'scary' stories."
"2806"	"(2009-05-08 (18)) This was similar to the dream before. We were being held at a house. I went to the toilet and there were no walls. Then there were vampires and so we were staking them. There was a couple having sex standing up in some clothes racks. I walked in on them and said ""carry on"" and left. There were two dodgy guys starting to walk towards them -- they were vampires. This girl, who was part of the bad guys, seemed to not like the bad guy side. We said we needed something and mouthed for her to say to let us out. She had Turk (Scrubs) in like, a cage. He had blonde hair. I said to get his hair cut. We left, but had to dress up in 50's school clothes and we had to participate in a sports game."
"2807"	"(2009-05-09 (18)) I was in a shop. I can't remember properly, but the Janitor (Scrubs) had this grape like thing and I had to plant them (it was like in the game, Wandering Willows). There was another plant too. Some didn't work out though. Oz and Willow (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were there. Some of the plants started working and she was getting hopeful."
"2808"	"(2009-05-09 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I think it was the future. I went into a classroom and everyone was very emotionless and I thought it was like The Invasion (saw a glimpse of it on TV last night). I copied them and this guy was next to me and he was also playing along. A teacher was keeping an eye on us. They gave us work to do. They realized the guy was faking and then they were suspicious of me as well. If you killed them, they would regenerate in a chair. If you got them at the start, and pulled off their head that would be the end (they were sort of Cylon like). I stabbed the teacher and they regenerated in a chair at the front of the class and I pulled their head off and eventually they disappeared. A girl at the front of the class said something so I threw a chair at her. They were all left. There was an episode of Red Dwarf and Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was in it. I was reading about the actress and she was born in 1944 and I was telling Mom said she was 50 in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I was shocked."
"2809"	"(2009-05-09 (18)) I can't remember properly, but it was like, the end of the world. We were all packed on trains. They would stop now and then. There were also different trains and they would look for certain people, etc. Anyway, I was with JD (Scrubs). At one stop, we found a room and had sex. It looked like my room and we were in the dark and I was on top. It was weird, because I remember all of it. Later, I found out I was pregnant. Elliot (Scrubs) was also looking for JD because she wanted a baby, but I think when she found out about us, she just went looking for anyone. I think if you were pregnant you either had privileges or didn't have to do something. Sometimes trains would get close and you could jump to a new one. We did and ended up at a cinema. I was then with Calvin and they had this really fast rollercoaster and we got in the back of it and then quickly let go. There was a room with a stage and people were dancing. I was with Elliot now. The president, who was Laura Roslin (Battlestar Galactica) was there. A big ball of smoke came in through a vent at the top of the wall behind the stage. It then spread out we all lied down. Roslin tried to redo the dance, some dancers slipped off etc (because of the smoke). I said to Elliot that she was an idiot and then she was like ""hey, I'm the president!"". She then worked it out and a bunch of us were still lying on the floor. I was listening to my iPod and I took one earphone out to listen to her speak. She said that no-one was listening and I put my hand up and said ""I'm listening!"". We left there and I was then with Dad, Ezra, Poppa and Poppers and we were walking outside. We had to pick up ""Quincy from England"" and Mom from home. I asked ""Are we still in America?"". We found this pub/saloon thing. We went upstairs and there were two muffins. Poppers then wanted some Coke. Dad gave him a warm glass (without any Coke). I was carrying heaps of stuff and got stuck on the stairs and no-one would help."
"2810"	"(2009-05-10 (18)) There was a new season of Scrubs. The Janitor said ""I'm Dr. Matthews"", but he was actually talking to Dr. Matthews. Then he realized who he was talking to. I don't know where we were but had a list of certain personalities he did and when. One of them was an Australian cop and said ""Badge!"" (or at least, it looks like badge, it's hard to read). He also talked about kangaroos. He named his tools and his mop didn't work now? I looked at his family tree and he had a son called Eugene. It had a weird layout and it said he was called ""Eugene 2nd Eugene"". I started fixing it up. Ezra was there too. Mom said it was offensive without having been asked to fix it. Turk (Scrubs) was somewhere."
"2811"	"(2009-05-10 (18)) I had a new timetable for MUPC and I was doing German, French and Home Ec. It was a lame timetable though, and on Wednesday I had class from 8.30am. On Thursday I had class at 7pm. I was going to change my subjects. I showed Mom."
"2812"	"(2009-05-11 (18)) I had two rooms at Mom's, which was different. One was a temporary room with my computer. I woke up and Mom and Darren said someone had broken in last night, but had only taken unimportant stuff. They got extra locks for the back door. We had bush behind us and Abigail lived nearby and we suspected it was her. She came over. Also, this guy on a motorbike was a kid when we met, and we met again, but he was now my age, in the bush."
"2813"	"(2009-05-11 (18)) I was in a shop and running from robots or something. As I ran, I stopped at the aisles to grab stuff, Pokemon cards mainly. I grabbed red packets instead of blue. Ezra was getting them too, but blue ones. We fought off the robots. Then I was having a race with Dee, Mac and Charlie (all from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia). I got lost because I went the long way, so they counted it as a win."
"2814"	"(2009-05-12 (18)) I was at school and had a math test. We had a relief teacher and he was in the seat next to me (the class was different). He had the role with our results and my new mark was 46/56. I put in my calculator and it was 92% and I was thinking it was lame. Some time before, Jeremiah and someone were talking and I said I was top of my math class. Josephine had made something and we had to watch it -- her, Thuy and someone were running through the bush and there were weird angles of Thuy holding a tree. There was a board and people had written their Runescape names and I wrote mine. I think I was level 72. I got invited to a party. People were talking about me. Dad, although he wasn't at first, took me to a nightclub thing because he wanted me to ask people for dreams. I refused and left. I can't remember properly, but I was walking with Dad around mountains. There was music playing and it was an Erasure song. Some lady had a sandwich and said ""I don't know about you, but peanut butter makes everything go away"". The mountains were white and foggy. There was a sign about trout and semen -- to dodge it? Christa Miller was around (or on TV) and I said ""Ugh, she sounds so annoying now"". There were timeline pictures of her. Darren was a werewolf? He had almost killed a girl he hated, but remembered something and left her, but crushed her car."
"2815"	"(2009-05-13 (18)) Mom and Darren bought some stuff for an experiment I needed to do for school. There was other lame stuff ""to pass the time"". I can't remember properly or read my notes well but me and some friends pulled up like four 'beds (which had two [something] each)' or something on the road. Mom was there? There was an ambulance and we needed to go park and so we moved two into the carpark. Then I had socks on and I was with Alejandro and someone else. We had to go somewhere. I walked around wet patches and went to put on my shoes and one had a big nut or acorn in it and I cried out ""Ow. Ow!"". Zach Braff was there. I left with Mom and she was doing a dental course thing and you got points. There was a 'History of Russia' thing and something about Anton Yelchin and I said ""He's Russian right?"". We didn't know any of the questions. Alejandro and I were ahead of the group -- we had to climb up steps and step on the right answer. We were at a high one and we ran out of time. We were asked something and I someone said ""yellow- red"" and someone else (I can't remember if it was me, or someone else) said ""It was yellow or red"". We dropped down the other side; the others would go back around. We ended up in a cafe thing and someone mentioned his 'wife' and said it was actually a lie. Zach Braff then came in, exhausted. Also, I had had a kid but I didn't know when and I wondered why I counted myself as a virgin."
"2816"	"(2009-05-13 (18)) Mom was going for a drive. We were looking for keys and then the front door was locked and she was about to leave. We left and went past dads. I went in, but I fell asleep and Mom called me and said ""I'm waiting for you"". I went out and Ezra was in the front seat. I complained because he was there last time. I went to the mailbox and I heard the door slam open and Dad came out of the house. Ezra's report was in there. There were also chocolates and stuff. I ate a chewy thing and it got stuck to my teeth and really hurt. I was on my computer earlier and I had changed my desktop to a different Scrubs one. I went back on it but it was different. I couldn't find the picture again anywhere. Then I was infected or something and I was locked in the cage and my feet were shackled. I had a toilet and a bed. Then I was someone else and was seeing someone who wasn't really there, but they 'were' and I was helping them. They were an actor, I think, but I can't remember who. There were coffee beans and he dreamt about them? Everything was still and he and I were walking through. I told him to imagine stuff happening -- kids playing with skipping ropes and the like. I then told him to imagine finding what he was looking for. These people had folders and the coffee beans were in it."
"2817"	"(2009-05-15 (18)) Eugene and I had been together for years, or so I thought. He was in bed lying on his back and I got in next to him and put my arm around him. We were talking and laughing. I was at a shop and it was like a huge Big W. I had a trolley and to get in there were these doors that would open and close continuously and I tried to get through it with the trolley, but it kept getting caught. Then I got to the counter and I had to pay to get in. Eugene was around the other side and he didn't have to pay and so he gave me $2 so I could get in. We saw Dad and so ran, laughing, down an aisle to hide and into a freezer. It was big and warehouse like and cold. He went over to the wall to get juice. I thought I heard someone coming and I didn't want to get in trouble so Eugene told me to go. I went through this other door which went into the same section of the shop. I saw a guy who I thought was Dad at the door to the shop and so I ducked. When I looked back up, he saw me and was actually a cop. I could see him motioning for others to get me and they called me the 'juice thief'."
"2818"	"(2009-05-16 (18)) Mom went off to someone's house and Ezra and I were stuck in the car. He decided to have a go driving and was going over the speed limit. He turned corners wide and wouldn't stop in time at lights, which I thought was the 'same thing as me'. He stopped and I said I'd drive now because it was safer. I pulled out of a driveway then turned the car. I was going up the street, fast and wouldn't brake. I turned left and then took the next right, and then I couldn't brake or control the car and it crashed into a house into the lounge room. This lady came out yelling at me. I said the brake didn't work. The window was smashed and there were two kids inside the room. I went inside and she yelled at me still and I yelled ""It's not as if I went out tonight thinking 'Oh, I might go crash into a house',"". Ezra traded lawyer details and ours was on a poster with contact information and his name was Christopher Leeley, or something. There were pictures of him too. We left and the brakes weren't working well and there was a screeching noise. We found Mom and she was with a dude who had milk."
"2819"	"(2009-05-16 (18)) Raquel and I were in a shop. We would walk past people and say stuff. I saw Charlie Day and said ""you're looking hot today"". I went to the toilet and was doing a poo. Classmate-F-04 from math came in and I laughed and said to leave and then I heard a plop from the poo. Anyway, I got covered in poo somehow and Raquel and I went under this shower and she was naked and a bit fat. People were watching but we just kept jumping around and laughing."
"2820"	"(2009-05-16 (18)) I was at a shop looking for posters of The Beatles and Monty Python, etc. I couldn't find any. Ezra and Emery were there too. I did find some Beatles bags but they were lame. Mom was also there. Ezra said that Dad had put all the Pokemon clothes together. He had a cool one. Only one of the rest sort of fit, but it was too tight and was green with a Pikachu on it. We were then at a house. Nana was there. She asked if I wanted something and I said that I didn't know what it was and she took out ice-cream tubs (like in the shops). There was pink and blue stuff and then white as well. She reached her hand into it and handed me some of the blue (it was light blue). I took some off with my finger and ate it and it was nice. Then there was green, which was nicer. She gave me an icypole thing but it was attached to seven others and they had to be eaten in order and the green one was third. Nana said to not eat more than one. I went to Ezra and Emery and they took the first two. A young James Spader was in a room. Dad and I were outside and had to climb up this big vertical net thing. When we got to the top we didn't know how to get over. I went through a hole and then Dad did. I don't know what happened then. Dad had a site and the address had INXS [something] and then a slash. I couldn't remember it and Dad was annoyed. My site had a background of space and stars and I had dreams on it. They were in a firey colour and it was hard to read. Dad complained about it. I said I was going to go to a list of dream characters and he was nervous about it. The page wasn't there though and he said he didn't want to see 'boys' there."
"2821"	"(2009-05-17 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were in the car on the way to university. The car was fire truck like. They made sandwiches and I didn't know where mine was. It was outside, on the windscreen, but I couldn't reach it. Then it was Dad instead of Mom. There was also a muffin with 50g of fat in it, but I ate it anyway. It started pouring down. The front of the university had big glass weird angled things and the rain would just slide off. They dropped me off somewhere and I got lost. I wandered into an arcade and my teacher was there. Then there was a lockdown.  I was also with a guy from class and he was quite hot. It was then a game and we had to shoot something out of a hole. There was a boat and you had to get two rocks onto it and it would take you back. I decided to leave. It was now like a big shop. There were lots of something I can't read (looks like straps). The hot guy, someone else and I were in a room. The hot guy started singing and I joined in. I then realized it was 'What's Going On' and since I hate it, I stopped, wondering how I even knew the words. The song had a mention of Morgan Freeman. There was a change room with toilets. Every cubicle was open and scattered with clothes. There was someone in one. There was a girl smoking and being rude. I left and she followed me. I went back to the room with the hot guy and I saw the girl still around so I locked the doors. She banged on it and wanted to get in. I needed to put my bra on and some pants as they had my SmartRider in them. I couldn't find them. I was now with a girl friend. I told her to make sure the webcams were turned off. I got changed and then I was some hated girl in a TV show. My friend used to be a main character that did drugs and alcohol and had problems with anorexia etc. She came back once before and helped someone. She had light blue hair. Anyway, she planned a way for me to leave. She got a heap of people to run out in different directions and so people would follow and allow me to walk from the school to the train station. Daryl was one of them. I got to a path leading up a hill and Turk and Carla (both from Scrubs) were digging up dead bodies. A girl said ""say thank you"" and the person she was talking to said ""thanks baby"". I went to a restaurant thing and I decided to get a job application. Then the 'bad' girl saw me. I ran and ended up on a beach. The girl friend came and grabbed her hands. I ran up a wood thing. I can't read what happened, but she did something to her and threw her shouting, but she was dead. Also before, some girl did websites and a girl was upset because she stopped doing them?"
"2822"	"(2009-05-17 (18)) This guy had a dream book that started in the 1930's, though he wasn't that old. A bird was in the book and had stayed in a nest in there for a long time. Darren took it out and then I realized and he put it back in. It then got out on its own and I told the guy. He came to look and it was gone. We then found it out the back of home. It was now a kitten and it fell in the pool. I dropped my iPod and jumped in. At The End had been playing, but now it was loud. I grabbed the kitten and tried to bring it to the surface, but I fell forward and so did the kitten. Then there was another kitten so I grabbed that one too and put them both on the ground. I realized my iPod speakers were in the water and was making a fizzle noise. I told Mom we needed to get new ones. We went to the shop with $50. We got two eggs for something (it was medicine). They had the old dream books I used to use, so I got seven of them."
"2823"	"(2009-05-18 (18)) Ezra and Mom were going to be checking out a Technical College thing. Mom had to go look after a shop and juggle lots of different tasks. I was talking to Ezra and asked what he was watching. He was watching The Fugitive and I said, excitedly, ""Transit cop! Neil Flynn- I mean Janitor! Yay!"" and left. I was saying Janitor like JD does as I walked out. I went to Mom to remind her about the Technical College thing and she yelled at me, but then left. I was watching Scrubs and JD and Kim were in bed and she was pregnant and cuddling JD from behind."
"2824"	"(2009-05-18 (18)) I woke up and saw a gate out the back was open (the house was different). Darren had three dogs and I didn't know what their names were. I had to put a chain on one of them. Later I asked Mom what their names were, they were Sam, Samson and Smith, and the first and last were girls. I was friends with a lesbian. For some reason we were lying in bed and she was naked. I can't really remember what was going on, but she was rubbing herself against me and I was kissing her bum/back area and bit in. Mom came in. She started calling me a lesbian and I shouted ""I'm not a lesbian!""."
"2825"	"(2009-05-18 (18)) I was at a new 'president's' like, welcoming ceremony. I was holding on to a flying fox thing and I think I was making a speech. I went to get some food and there were no plates left. Mom and Granma were there and she was going to get me a plate but then changed her mind. I went to get a plate, but then saw someone else's one that was clean-ish and got a piece of chicken. Someone said to smell it and it was a weird colour. It tasted funny."
"2826"	"(2009-05-19 (18)) I was watching Arrested Development. There was something called, what looks like, 'railpots'. Someone asked ""What are they anyway? They're never around when you need them?"". And something that looks like 'boat in the water, out of the water'. There was laughing. I was talking to George Bluth and he didn't know what railpot was. Eugene had sold the rights to Mr Banana Grabber and Gob was selling them again and it was in boxes of stuff. Eugene was telling him that he couldn't. There were two Asians and Eugene said he wanted food as a trade. I remember Tobias was around as well."
"2827"	"(2009-05-19 (18)) It was Battlestar Galactica like. There was a ship and it wouldn't let me on -- it had to get to know you first and it wanted me to have experienced something 'horrible'. I was made to do labour work. I was on platforms that were floating on a liquid. I had to pull up rocks from the liquid. I fell in and I saw something scary and got out. Raquel was in a kids section. Robert Downey Jr. was there and we were friendly and we were all talking to Mom and Dad. He was talking about an ex of his and he said that she said, putting on a French accent, ""If you love music, then I hate music!"". Ezra was around somewhere too and he was pulling down people's pants. Later, Ezra and I were doing stuff to get citizens on MyCity."
"2828"	"(2009-05-19 (18)) Ezra and I drove off from Mom. We went to the shop and Ezra wouldn't let me drive. Later, I was somewhere in Brookland. I went to a bus stop and waited. I saw this Native lady, who I recognized, and she told me to go to the other side, which I was going to anyway. She said to say hello to Mom and I asked her what her name was and she said 'Ateena'. The map on the bus stop was hard to understand. The bus came and I asked the driver ""Miss?"", but it was a guy and I asked if the bus went to Princess Rd and he said it did. We drove around the other side of this rollercoaster, which was abandoned, and then went down all these random side streets. I was confused so I got off at a weird place. I text Mom to get me. George Bluth (Arrested Development) was on a walk and I said ""what about Lucille?"" but she was there too. I had no shoes and so I couldn't walk back home."
"2829"	"(2009-05-20 (18)) I was watching Arrested Development. Tobias was talking to George Eugene about girl/boyfriends."
"2830"	"(2009-05-20 (18)) People were complaining about Michael Cera being in the Arrested Development movie because he wasn't going to do it originally."
"2831"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) Dad whispered something and he had a secret about something. Mom was going to admit that she knew. I was at a shop, which was in Northtown but the layout was screwed up. Mom, Ezra and I went to the pet shop. There were lots of kittens. We had to walk around a long way to get back. We were going to get food."
"2832"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) I had Sims 3 and was playing it."
"2833"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) I was at work. Someone found a head in a pipe. I cleaned out the pipe one day and found two more. I hit an emergency button but not 'worry'. Later, I went to check if I had calls in the office. I said to Ezra that I found two heads and he said he'd call back. There was a guy called Roy Wyatt. Gob (Arrested Development) was on a motorbike and I said ""you should wear thicker pants"". He laughed and then he took off altogether? I picked him up, and I can't read the rest of what I said. Then I went inside."
"2834"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. I saw a Ute with rubbish on the back and Tobias (Arrested Development) was on it. I said ""I'm Ms Featherbottom, would you like a banger in the mouth? Oh, I meant sausages!"" and laughed. We were then at a shop and I was with Dad. I had a puzzle book. My teeth were hurting and started falling out. We left and were in a red convertible. I looked behind us to check if anyone was following us. Then, Jeremy Northam and this guy were talking at the shop. It was a movie and it showed Jeremy going to war and they would meet after he got back each time and they would chat on a bench. The last time they met, they had aged quite a bit. One day, Jeremy didn't return. But, then the guy saw him and a girl, explaining that he faked his death because people were after him. They got a mission and they had to pick up some stuff from a letterbox. I was with them. We pulled up on the other side of the road from the place (it was night). It was like an apartment block. Jeremy went out to the letterbox out the front of. A light went out in a top apartment. He opened the letterbox to check it and then someone shot at him. He ran back to the car. We drove off and pulled into a lady's house, who was a doctor. As they walked up to the house, I was watching a movie again and it was called 1, 2, 3 Life. I said ""I always thought it was Fight Club"". Brad Pitt was in it. We got inside and turned off the lights. We heard a car driving fast past the house. Jeremy had been shot and the doctor went with him to help him. The rest of us hung out in the dining room (which was part of the room where you first enter the house). The lights outside could be change from switches inside and would change the patterns of the lights. I stupidly played with it. I heard a car drive past and quickly turned them off. It came back past and then screeched to a stop. We all went quiet and listened. We heard people get out and I ran to the back of the house to warn the lady. The blinds on the windows were mostly open and so we were all hiding under them and next to stuff. I kept moving. Two of the guys, including the guy from before, were hiding behind the table in the dining room. I joined them, but then I ran back and I saw the bathroom and that it had no windows. The bath was like a bunk bed and took up all of the room. There were blankets and stuff in it; I figured that must've been where the lady had been keeping Jeremy. Then the bad guys were coming through the windows. I ran into a room, where a guy was coming through the window backwards. I grabbed him and from behind, put my arm around his throat until he went limp, then I got a knife out of my pocket (or wherever I was keeping it) and stabbed him in the chest. I took his gun. Two guys were coming down the hall and I pointed the guy's gun at them, then the people said ""now"" and the rest started coming in through the windows. I shut the door of the room, which was a sliding door, and hoped they would go for the others. I opened it and they were still there. I couldn't reload the gun so I ran into them and one shot the other one accidentally. I got the knife and was stabbing his hand and I shook the other one off to get his gun."
"2835"	"(2009-05-22 (18)) Harlan had asked for help on something, but he hadn't left a 'comment' and I was unable to reply. I caught up with him and told him what he needed to know. I was at a place with computers. First, there was a competition for Sims 3 and people were running up to win a race for it. A team with the fat person won. Anyway, Ezra was on a computer playing a game. Classmate-M-06 was there drawing on people's [something I can't read] . There were people from last year and Ezra mentioned Eugene. He was the top player of the game. I was telling Mom about it later. I had a candle in a bag? It was like a cigarette? It was slowly burning away until it was just [something I can't read] . There were kittens outside and Mom and I brought them inside because it was raining."
"2836"	"(2009-05-22 (18)) I was getting in the car and two people we didn't like were there. The Winchesters (Supernatural) had a little sister. I didn't like her. She was with us, in the backseat between Ezra and I. Dad was driving and Dean (Supernatural) was in the passenger seat. Up ahead, at the lights, there were people washing car windows. There was a scantily clad woman with big boobs. Dean and Dad both commented, Dean said ""She has a nice... pencil"". She came to the window and she and Dad flirted. She said that not many good-looking, funny, single guys around. There was a pause and then Dad asked for her number and she gave it to him. Then we were at Nana's. She was there. The inside was different. There was a warehouse and they had copies of my chair there, but they went back more and were recliners. Poppa was in there. I left the warehouse and it was near where the water tank was, at the top of the path next to the fish pond. There was a duck on the bridge. It followed my movements, so I ran, screaming, up and closed the gate. Nana got it and I ran inside."
"2837"	"(2009-05-23 (18)) I was in a car with Nana and Poppa. They were going to drop me off at Mom's, but it was confusing to get there and they kept missing the turn. We stopped the car and were going to walk. I crossed the road, but then decided they needed to drive a bit closer. But, as I walked I bumped into Mom."
"2838"	"(2009-05-23 (18)) My boyfriend, who was Eugene, suggested I finish school early so I could go to the movies with him, but to not tell Mom about it. I agreed. I was then with Farrah. We found a shop so we went in. There was a Timezone, which was packed. There was a Science Museum like place. There was a dark room, and there was a corner where you would fall over. At the door you got shot out by a burst of air. I was with Eugene now too. We waited outside another building, and then there was gas. This guy opened the building which was a big room full of single desks which had paper and pens on each. The instructor said to draw your last dream or a pedophile. He said we would have to present it in front of the class. He handed out paper and mine had my name on it and I wondered how he knew it was me. Then Farrah didn't know how to do something on Microsoft Excel (we were now on computers). She wanted to superscript a single word inside a cell."
"2839"	"(2009-05-24 (18)) Mom was watching a movie and I went out and it was Beetlejuice. It was in French and so I changed the language for her. Later, Ezra said her phone kept ringing and it was loud. He was with a baby, as in, he had to sleep in the same room as it. On the TV, it said 'Will Arnett' and there was an Arrested Development advertisement, which he, Portia de Rossi and Michael Cera were in. Will Arnett and Michael Cera were supposed to be more like 'father and son' in the movie (or whatever). We went for a drive. Ezra got a call from Roland, who said he was at a rave or something and he went to the toilet and was 'pooping' and thought of Ezra. There were two cars in front of us, the drivers of which were obviously drunk. There was a set of lights up the road. One of the cars slid out and went into a ditch. Then there was a bridge near us and the other one went over the edge. We stared in shock and it was slow motion and then a crash and it flipped and was totally owned. I was happy about seeing this because it was exciting. Then the cops were there and I was thinking of what I rate it. Mom asked ""what should we rate it?"" and I was thinking a 4/5 because of the bridge."
"2840"	"(2009-05-24 (18)) I did a third course at the MUPC called House. It was run by House (House) and there weren't many people in the class. He told us what was in the exam, but didn't know when the exam was. He told us what books to study so I thought about going to the library to get them. Emma Watson was in the class and had taken a file thinking it would be helpful. They were building plans. His journal was on the desk. There were weird jokes written in it. He thought it was Calvin who had taken the file, but someone had noted that it was Emma. There was a note about me and my dream book, but he didn't know what it was. There was a photo of me when I was younger. There was another photo of Ezra and Ariana on a cow print chair. I was telling Mom about it later."
"2841"	"(2009-05-25 (18)) I was at a shop, or a shop-like place. Laura Roslin (Battlestar Galactica) was there and she was the president. I was friends with her. I was paranoid about some work of mine, for Communications, and went to ask her if she could copy it and put a presidential stamp on it so it was known that it was mine, but she said she couldn't."
"2842"	"(2009-05-25 (18)) The Sims 3 teasers were offline at the moment. There was a game that Ezra and I played where you play tennis in a jail-like setting. It always reminded me of Bellick (Prison Break). I was at home and I needed to change my shirt but had nothing that fit (it was all my old clothes). Someone in the family was over with a kid and someone was pregnant. Mom said that her pregnancy test was negative."
"2843"	"(2009-05-26 (18)) I was at Mom's and my room was a bit different. I had my computer and this other thing positioned around my bed so the light was away from it when I slept. Dad and Ezra were there. I emptied all these little bits for a puzzle thing onto the floor. Ezra was on my computer and started watching Gossip Girl. I glanced over to see Chuck. I decided I didn't want to watch it and needed to go to bed because of an exam I had in the morning. Dad ordered a pizza. I can't read what it says next, but it looks like 'squeaky times', then ""sorry""."
"2844"	"(2009-05-27 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was walking home past Midvale shops (like through the carpark and down the road behind the church). There was a girl with short, curly hair who was often there. She followed me, which creeped me out, so I called Mom to get me, she agreed to reluctantly. She took me to a party and the girl was there. She wanted to talk to me and I ran. It says something about a theft play and something. We got out and took her in with others? Calvin was with her. There was a theatre. Ezra was there. There was a video of Yuckfou, supposedly, giving a speech. The videos were all [something I can't read] and stuff to make. Something was level 88 on Runescape."
"2845"	"(2009-05-27 (18)) I was watching Prison Break. Bellick and someone -- a prisoner guy who no-one liked -- did a poo and then it was implied that they put something up his bum. It was Battlestar Galactica like."
"2846"	"(2009-05-27 (18)) Nathaniel was in my room, which was different. He was acting shy-like. I asked him what was going on, but I don't know what he said. I can't remember what else happened."
"2847"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) I had a hotel room. I went to it. There was an elevator (that was four sided). It was hard to get one though. There was a place on the stairs if you wanted to complain. Dan Aykroyd came with a bald head. We were told that if we saw famous people, to not go up to them saying ""I loved you in..."" Then I was on a lounge with some people I knew and a teacher. This guy started singing a song which was from Scrubs, and it was perfect for the situation we were in. The teacher also reminded me of Perry (Scrubs) and I was laughing. He asked ""what's that from?"" and I answered ""Scrubs"". Someone said that everyone was excited? Also, some time before I was watching Battlestar Galactica and Lee and Gaius were talking."
"2848"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) I was in a carpark. I needed to pee. This lady was there. I saw a little kitten and I grabbed it and put it in the car, which I went into to pee. I was going to bring the kitten into the pet shop, but it ran out of the car. Fido was running around. I chased the kitten and Fido was too. I tried to stop Fido and he ran into the shop and before I could do anything, he ate it in one bite. I was like 'noo!' and shocked and upset. I went to the toilet, which had dodgy doors. I did a poo and I heard it hit the water. I got up and the toilet wouldn't flush."
"2849"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) I was on another planet, and I assumed it was a Cylon planet. It was abandoned looking and I was there with some others. There was a building that was falling apart. There was a weird language written on the walls. I went over to this park bench. Helo and Athena (both Battlestar Galactica) were there. I liked Helo. Athena had these bits of tree and was folding them in half and then using this thing to cut in the middle of them. She stopped as she and Helo were mucking around. They went off to have sex, so I took over. I looked over to where they went and they were lying naked with a blanket on the grass."
"2850"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) Ezra mentioned liking 'Lloyd'. I said ""which Lloyd?"" and he said from Entourage. I was like 'I didn't know you watched Entourage'."
"2851"	"(2009-05-29 (18)) I was reading about the Arrested Development movie. Michael Cera had said he wasn't going to do it, presumably because he thought he could do better. I was like ""how can you do better than Arrested Development? It's the third best show ever... and that's pushing it"" (as in, the top 3 are all so good, it's hard to make them lower than the other). There weren't any comments from David Cross at all. There was a character called Gaius. I was talking to this guy (I was me, but different) because I wanted to get into some film group. He mentioned something and I said that ""I'm not wanting to sound like Battlestar Galactica"" but he refused. Someone said something and shot all others (it's hard to read). There was a list of high rated TV shows and Felicity was on there with a picture of Keri Russell. The show worked like, she would write in her diary and there was a voiceover and that was pretty much it."
"2852"	"(2009-05-29 (18)) I realized that it was the 8 June and so I was going to get The Sims 3. I was on the computer and on some site which had Eugene's profile on it. It said he liked The Sims 3 (I had been on here before, and it used to say Sims 2). Mom was babysitting Amelia. There was a pub and another shop next to each other. I had somehow transferred a problem to the pub and something in there started hissing and someone tricked a bum (can't read it properly). Also, someone asked me to get something out of their car and I asked if their car was the ""fat brown thing?"". But then I was supposed to go to the daycare because their son had it. I went over and was getting the thing they wanted out of the son's pants. His name was Devon. I was then outside a shop and I was thinking it was Midvale shops. A lady got off a motorbike and had a gun. I pretended not to notice and walked to the street. I walked across with some other people. Nicolas was in the crowd and saw me and started running, saying to get away from him. I ran after him and called out ""Oi! Nicolas!"". I looked behind me and I saw someone on the bike coming after me. I went down a path which was on a hill, and then there was a loop. I tried to call Mom but I couldn't, so I text her instead. Then I was lying on my stomach, pulling myself along these pipes and it was a tight fit between them. There were lots of others behind me and they complained about me going slow. When I got to the end, there were copies of Sims 3 on USB's (there were four of them). They were a weird shape. I checked one of them, but it wasn't on it. The second one had Sims 3 and the first season of Angel. I used my iPod to transfer them over."
"2853"	"(2009-05-30 (18)) I went into the bathroom at home. I had had a bath earlier and there was still water in it. My gloves were on the edge. One fell in and I got it out and was wringing it, but the water never seemed to stop coming out of it. I was going to Bali alone. Nana and Poppa suggested a hotel for me. It was cheap and just across the road from the airport, but was supposed to be really good."
"2854"	"(2009-05-31 (18)) There were heaps of seasons of Battlestar Galactica. Roslin found out she was a Cylon (one of the final five). They took her down to a planet, on a train without telling her. She was upset. Ezra was watching an episode and there was a black guy on the outside of something that I can't read (it looks like it starts with an 's'). I asked ""Is that Sam Anders?"" and then it had a picture of him. He had a ball with shapes on it and it was gold and was like a quidditch ball (the little flying thingy). Also, I had done something with some people. We were in a building and there was a TV and Eugene was there. He was listening to AC/DC and watching nature documentaries and I said ""you're like my Mom"". Calvin was there too. It looks like it says 'at the end', but it says there was a photo of us and a cutout and Eugene wasn't in it. I was watching 24. Jack and Aaron were climbing up a hill and they needed to warn people about something."
"2855"	"(2009-06-01 (18)) There was a sports thing on. I flew to America and back, but for some reason the ticket made me go back to America. The airport was different. The people at the counter were in water. I asked for the flight home. Mom and Ezra were there and it was now a sports thing for Ezra. There was an assembly thing, but I decided it would be packed and boring and so Mom and I left. Ezra was made to stay. Then I was by myself and I had 'made' stuff, like a ship and something else and a bathroom, but I hadn't set anything, for it to function or whatever. I was then in water, which was inside a building, and it was sometimes a computer game. Then Mom was with me. It was really dark because I hadn't made it properly. I kept going under and it was like neverending so I had trouble getting back up. At some point I was on a computer playing Runescape. Eugene was on the computer next to me (which was facing me) and I stared at him for a bit, thinking he was hot and then went back to my game. We both started humming the same song. Gaius (Battlestar Galactica) had something to do with my game. Tyrol (Battlestar Galactica) said he was ""born as a different renegade in 1909 in their [something I can't read, it looks like 'right [or night] train much' city, Oogle""."
"2856"	"(2009-06-02 (18)) It was raining, or at least was cold. I was going to university and Mom was driving me. I got in the car, then it was raining. I decided I didn't want to go when we got there, but I went in. I got to the line for class and decided not to go in and this guy said to count me in with the dead, which was a term used for those who just decided not to go. I saw Ms Ingram in the class. She saw me and pulled me aside. There was a huge book of notes and it had notes for every subject and also the exam results. I waited outside in the carpark and Mom and Ezra were across the road at a deli. They picked me up. I got 61% for communications and for math it said ""11-12"", which was a bad rating. My rank was 195/250."
"2857"	"(2009-06-02 (18)) David and Keith (both Six Feet Under) rented a motel because he got one of ""the last ten tickets"" to a show. The motel was stingy. Then it was Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and a girl he liked. It also changed to Laura Roslin and Bill Adama (Battlestar Galactica). But then she was actually someone else and everyone had had their memories wiped. She was no longer interested in him. Then it was Eugene and I. The room had a little TV in it and there was a video player on the other side of the room (the door was in the middle of the room, the bed was on the left side, TV in front of it on the right and the video player straight ahead). I was unplugging the video player because there was a red light on it, which would annoy me and was closing the window. We got in bed and he turned off the TV. It was a double bed, but it was more like a single and we had to snuggle up. I think other people were then in the other rooms, Calvin was one of them. Eugene and I were having sex and Ezra came in, but we didn't realize at first."
"2858"	"(2009-06-03 (18)) There was a new quest on Runescape and I needed to have watched Quarantine and I was annoyed because I didn't want to watch a remake. I was making pots (?) while I was there and my inventory was full. Ruth (Six Feet Under) asked me for help with something."
"2859"	"(2009-06-03 (18)) I was talking to Ezra about the new quest on Runescape. He commented on there being so many more people. He said he found stuff of Emery's and said ""yay FRIEND"". Since we saw Star Trek, he had been calling me ""Sulu"", who had been played by Simon Pegg. I said ""it might be funny if I was a guy and bared some resemblance, but I don't look like Simon Pegg"". Ezra made a 'uh heh' noise and said ""yeah you do"". I insisted I didn't and ""it's more of a compliment than an insult"" and he was like ""Oh you think Simon Pegg's hot then"" and I said ""no but he is more attractive than ugly"". Ezra said he couldn't stand him and I said ""I love Simon Pegg; he's one of my favourite comedians"". We had fish and chips and I grabbed a heap and asked if he was using the tomato sauce, which he wasn't, and went to eat at the table."
"2860"	"(2009-06-03 (18)) I was watching Angels and Demons [I haven't seen it yet] . It was an early cam, but it was a good copy. It started off with teenagers (sometimes the movie was real). One of the guys liked this girl (who was me sometimes) and I liked him too. We were at a shop and Silas and Ezra were there and put beanies on their heads. I can't remember what the joke was. Anyway, we were in a car and some trees were on fire? Then it was a movie again. The Chief from Grey's Anatomy was the president. There was a flashback which showed a group getting ready. At first, it looked like they were bad guys, except for me and they tied me up. There was a really cute puppy. Then I was in water and they saved me and then a light went on and the 'cops' were all around me (in a circle) and fired their guns. Then there was a flashback and we were in a house or something. I was with my guy friend from before and a girl. It looks like it says [mag had he after] , but I don't know what it's supposed to say. Anyway, he was wearing a jumper that was an expensive brand. I was wearing the jumper Mom made me. There was a fire and the guy was joking and grabbed me saying ""hold me!"". We were then at a place where the bad guys were. He tried to pretend he was one of them, but they were suspicious. Then in real life, I told Mom what I was watching and that it was funny. Ezra was there. She was watching The Da Vinci Code and I said that the first one sucked and I wondered where Tom Hanks came into the second one. There was a video that Jayson made, although he was Silas sometimes. It was a funny version of what happened with me and the bad guys."
"2861"	"(2009-06-04 (18)) I was at a pet shop. There was an open area with little dogs and it had flaps. Later I was at school or something. There was a room with a bed and a bedside table and my dreams were on it. Preston was there and he read one and so I moved them. Seamus was on a computer playing Runescape. He had pretty good levels. I left and went on another computer and talked to him on Runescape. Ezra was on too. I got distracted and logged off. Seamus asked me to lunch and so I went. As I went to leave he called it a date and I said that ""it wasn't a date, it was food"". He insisted it was a date and asked me to meet him in the cafe again. I walked off. Later I left class. There was an upstairs section -- which was where the cafe was. But from where I came from, I had to walk a fair way to the stairs. I could climb this frame and go through a hole, which I had done before. I tried now, but I couldn't do it. There were stairs on it, but on the roof of it, upside down. I went the long way and past the cafe to see if he was there. He wasn't. Then I heard him call to me and called me over. I shook my head and walked away. Then there were demons, but they were nice. One said that someone was in the ""rear view mirror"" -- it was Seamus, disguised. I was then in a cinema and something was playing and it said ""Harpo"" and I said ""Marx! Please be Duck Soup!"" But it was something I hadn't heard of. I went through a door in a hall and a girl came out of the toilets that had the male symbol on the door. A bunch of girls saw and laughed. I went further down the hall and I was back at the pet shop. There were some people there and they were turning back and forth between humans and dogs. They went a bit crazy with light (or it could be night, but I think it's light). One of them was Boomer (Battlestar Galactica). Her boyfriend had been in the car with her when she changed and she had grabbed his hair and ripped off his skin. Seamus was also one of them and Rico (Six Feet Under). He was sometimes Seamus. I was trying to help them. I went outside and got in the car with Mom and Ezra. They were coming towards the shop still and I told them to stop. I got out and went over to ""see my least favourite person"", who was Seamus, and he was standing outside the shop."
"2862"	"(2009-06-05 (18)) I was outside. There was a game thing. Ezra was there and you had to jump from these high poles, which had a flat round thing on top. They would get further and further apart. Then it was Calvin and he was with a girl. I ran to swing off a rope thing to get on and Calvin grabbed onto us and I said 'you want [something that looks like last] ' but he did and we fell straight away. I said it took 'ten years and some amount of months off' and he said '140 weeks'. I was then on a bus thing with Nana. She asked the girl in front of me to put her chair back and it hit my leg. I was playing Pokemon on my DS."
"2863"	"(2009-06-05 (18)) I can't remember properly but there was a machine in the walls of this place. Someone had to unplug this thing and plug in something else. There was a robot thing and he had to avoid people who worked there. He was at the last one and he (it was me now) got Cuddles to distract the robot and he threw this thing to make her go to it. It was in a hall. Then I was at this place and this lady had a house which was up high. I was on it and there was a section with an edge. There was a fridge and the house moved, and as I was trying to get around the fridge was moving too and I said ""ah! This is too hard!"". Dad came back to get me -- he had taken Ezra earlier. We went to a place with a rollercoaster and I thought it was a ghost train at first. The max weight was 50kg, and said 39-50. A lady explained why."
"2864"	"(2009-06-06 (18)) I got my results back from the MUPC. My mark for communications was 60% and I had gotten the top math score, which was 98% or so. Classmate-M-11 was second. I went through the marks and they had crossed a right one and I couldn't work out the real percentage. Nana was there."
"2865"	"(2009-06-06 (18)) I was watching Battlestar Galactica. The ship was different and was actually like a planet, where the main action happened in this building and there was an outside area with a pool. Gizmo was there and I was trying to get food and water organized for her but the room I was in was on a slope. I saw an explosion in the distance and got down. The window smashed, along with other things. Starbuck and a guy went into this room to have sex and Adama walked in on them. I went looking for Roslin. She was on a balcony outside; oblivious to what happened (it had affected the whole ship). I opened the door and she asked what happened. There were gates, like for the SmartRider, but they were all closed. I remembered another way to go. The bad guys came and were going to shoot us, but there was another explosion and we got away. I would see fire in the sky and we would duck down. I said to stay away from the windows. I saw another and said ""get away from the windows!"" and ran around a corner to get away. There was a loud explosion and I looked around the corner and called ""Laura!"". Her arm was a bit burnt. In the control room, Adama and Starbuck were talking. When the camera was on Starbuck, her nose was sometimes painted red and with lipstick to match. They were joking about Adama walking in on her. There was a flashback of these two Asian nerds in a small ship in space. They saw a fireball and they were like 'what's that, what should we do' etc. They flew off and said to warn Gaeta. They also had this virtual game, which had a sex option. In real life, we got the game, which was really cool and there was a virtual world option, but it said it had to be registered to use it and we had an illegal copy. But I then found these squishy packets that had different virtual things to play, ie one of them had 'give guy a massage' and one had 'cute boy helps you'. There were pictures of Freddy Krueger (Nightmare on Elm Street) in the Foxtel guide."
"2866"	"(2009-06-07 (18)) There was a Kenny vs. Spenny movie. First, Spenny and I went for a walk and we went down the street next to North Midvale Primary School. It was night and dark and spooky. He was with his kid (or someone else's). I said it was dangerous and he said he had a 'scythe'. This black guy walked past us and I could only see his clothes because of the contrasting darkness. Then, Kenny, someone else and I were running away from Spenny, or all of us were running away from someone. We ran into a toilet. The three of us went into a room with the toilets and closed the door. I tried to lock it and it was a switch lock (like on the front door), but I couldn't get it in time and he burst in. They were yelling and then Spenny reached into his pocket and this guy fired his gun and killed him. The guy said ""he was reaching for a gun"". Kenny checked Spenny's pockets and there was a pack of chewing gum. He said ""a tic-tac? You shot him because of a tic-tac?!"" Kenny was like 'he's my best friend!'. Then there was a second one (like that was the first way the scene was shot), which was what had actually happened. There were teenagers talking in a room. One said ""that was how we were originally going to shoot it"" or they were going to bring in a twin of Spenny to keep in, but it wouldn't have worked."
"2867"	"(2009-06-07 (18)) I woke up to people talking and Amelia crying. I tried to get back to sleep for an hour with no luck. I got up and closed the hallway door and yelled at them to shut up. This girl was there and was Quincy's girlfriend. Darren was there. I managed to get to sleep, but I woke up again from a movie. Samantha posted a comment on Facebook about how there was a bridge which had her name on it. I checked the time and it was 3am when I went to bed. Everyone was asleep, but later on Ezra was out there. On Battlestar Galactica, Helo's last name was Penikett. Boomer was in the episode too. This girl got pregnant but the guy was pregnant and they shot him because he wasn't human. I needed to do five things but I couldn't work out the fifth (I was a medical person). I pretended it was done. I said to a girl that Helo's name was actually Penikett."
"2868"	"(2009-06-08 (18)) I was at a house and I had a different family. I had three brothers called Tom, Aaron and David. I went to ask my 'mother' for something and this guy was naked in her room, so I kept walking. I went to hide and went in Tom's bed. He was naked and threw the blanket over him. His bed was next to a balcony (an inside balcony). Because of this, we would often see a naked girl up there as he would bring random ones over. I asked why he didn't have anyone over this time and he said it was in order to hide me (because if there was a girl there, no-one would think to look for me... that doesn't seem to make sense now). Later, someone misunderstood what happened and broke up with him. I tried to explain it. Then I was playing a game where I had to catch the bus and trains at certain times to level up. Later, a few of us were in a classroom. The teacher asked for a volunteer, and I knew it was going to be me and I hated doing it. The girl next to me volunteered but he made me do it. I had to make 3 (the number was a random number between 1-4) sandwiches. Dmitri was in the class and finished his sandwiches. The teacher told me to get them finished by the end of this week -- it was Thursday. I decided to leave. I went to text Mom, but at lunch, the teacher was in the room and I couldn't. There was another teacher and they were playing Runescape. He was riding a bike and it was slow because his agility level was only 21. I said that I'd been playing for five years."
"2869"	"(2009-06-08 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were in the car and had to pull up on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and it was night. There was a car in front of us. Then there was another car crossing the road. I saw the licence plate was 8ZE-963 and I realized it was Eugene's car. It turned out his father Abraham was in it and his name was like Meluson and he was dead? I'm not sure what happened but we were then walking. I had no shoes, only those socks I have with the little doopy things underneath. It was day and the ground was hot. Then we were using rollerblades and were going really fast down the road. We went into a shop and were getting chocolates. I got a Lite Mars Bar. I heard two people talking about a robbery, and I realized they thought we were going to steal. Ezra said ""figures"", referencing the fact that we weren't dressed in expensive clothes in this posh area. We went to the checkout and left. There was a cat outside that kept hissing at everyone. There was a girl and two days after her birthday something had happened. The lid on my water bottle was gross and I was going to take a lid off of someone else's that was on a table outside, but I then realized that was disgusting. There was a forest across the road. Police and other people were scattered around. There were a lot of cop cars. I went over and then they all came back to one place. Then some others and I were running through it and everyone chased us. I climbed up a tree and the people walked past looking for us. I got down and started running again. Then Eugene was with us and he was my boyfriend, I think. He told me to keep running one way, across the road, and then there was more forest which was thicker. I kept running and I got separated from him. After running through some forest on the other side, there was a field and then there was a hill a while away with some woody forest path. Then there was a UFO and it got too close and caught on the power lines and crashed into the ground. I yelled at everyone to run back and it exploded. Then it was like a Government tape I was watching and had end of Cloverfield like writing on it. I turned it off. Then it was a movie and for the sequel they wanted me to return, though I was supposed to have died. Eugene had survived and was upset about me having died. In the first movie, at the beginning there was a jetty with boats in the water. I can't read the next bit [something about countries] , but it then says that the land wasn't ok to live on. There weren't many in the first one but in the sequel there were more of them. There was a female president, or at least, I assumed she was the president."
"2870"	"(2009-06-08 (18)) I was with Calvin, Silas, Elijah and Theodore somewhere. We had been chased through a forest along with heaps of others. We got to some shops and exchanged $10 for a ""$5 note and coins"". Calls were $8.70 but I didn't have enough money and I had no credit. We went to a bus stop and waited. The sign was on the ground. I asked if it went to Midvale and Silas said it did. I said I didn't know how to catch a bus and he laughed at me and I said that I could take the train and bus to university but I didn't know how to take it anywhere else. We saw the bus coming. I got my wallet out and the front of my SmartRider had come off (it was just blank and white). I thought that was odd, but it still worked. Calvin went to the back of the bus and it was a big bus. I went with him. Everyone else sat in random places. Sawyer (Lost) was on a chair that had wheels next to the row of seats in front of us. He kept slipping and had to hold on. I accidentally nudged his foot. There was some silence and I was trying not to laugh."
"2871"	"(2009-06-09 (18)) I was at Nana's. I can't remember properly but there were girl and they would ask us questions in different ways. This girl asked me if I had drawing equipment and beans. I said ""Beans? What do I need beans for?"". I can't read the next few sentences, it seems like she asked me if I needed something that sort of looks like 'coins' and I said something that looks like ""said I inks"" and something about movies. We then chatted. Nana asked if I wanted to see how much weight she had lost and said she was ""late"", which had something to do with weight. I was then on a bus and I got off at a house I thought was Nana's, the bus started to leave and I realized it wasn't. I ran to catch up with it and I managed to get him to stop. I told the guy and then said that I left my bag. He said he couldn't wait and I asked when the next one was and he said ""five minutes"". I got my bag and then I was at some school in a place that I can't read but kind of looks like 'Piranha' (whatever it says is an actual suburb, but I can't remember or read it). It was stingy. It was a place for all the poor or troubled teenagers. As I was leaving I hid my phone. There were some people fighting. Silas and Theodore were there. I ended up missing the next bus. I waited at the bus stop with others. A different kind of bus came and it was squishy. I asked the driver if it went to Newtown or Midvale. He said no and I asked what the closest stop was and he said he didn't know but there was a place I could go to ask and it closed at 9pm. It was 8.20. He said he would take me there. It got close to 9 and he said we wouldn't make it. I text Mom. Someone at the back of the bus got up and Tiana sat down a seat away from me. I asked the girl next to her to move, thinking I would sit next to her and [something I can't read] went back. Dmitri came on the bus. I got back to Nana's and I had ""three meows"" from Dmitri, which were like a message or something."
"2872"	"(2009-06-11 (18)) I was at a shop. It was small and Mom and I were in an aisle that was close to one wall. It was a really tight fit and we could barely move. There was a door on this wall that led to another shop. I complained to Mom about the size. Then, Calvin had to hand out ice-creams to these people on an oval. I was with him. They were playing a game. Michael Trucco was there and the game was called Pyramid and I said that was weird since he played Pyramid Ball in Battlestar Galactica (he was actually a character though). There was a mud flavoured ice-cream."
"2873"	"(2009-06-12 (18)) I was at dads on my computer. I had gone back to play Sims 3 but hadn't yet. I had been there for hours but hadn't bothered. I went to the lounge room and played the Wii. Then I was watching music videos. The first one they played was the one I wanted. I can't remember what it was but it was hard rock and the band's name was two words consisting of two letters each but was sometimes called 'TOC'. I was going to call Mom soon. I had the music down low so Dad didn't get annoyed."
"2874"	"(2009-06-13 (18)) I was watching a movie. A spy lady had been married to this low-life guy. He went after her kid and her love interest (unknowingly). She came to the place he was holding them. Also, there was some special knife. This guy got stabbed and fell into some water and died, but he got back up. The spy lady came and shot them. I was with some people there. There was a big gate and I went to go around and she shot this other dude. I asked ""why didn't I hear your gun click?"" and she said ""no-one can"" and I said ""Oh yeah a silencer, duh!"". I told her new boyfriend she was married to him. I went inside and the guy said something, like ""think I've seen this before"". The bad dude tried to run me off the road."
"2875"	"(2009-06-13 (18)) I was inside some place and there was fairy floss and it was like a blanket. Farrah and Ariana were there. They asked for some and I said ""sure"". There were some others and everyone just took a bit off. Ariana was very polite. Ezra was there too with a fairy floss blanket. He did something mean so I ruined something for him. Then I was with Mom and we were driving past Midvale shops and she was driving fast and was all over the road. She had a packet of drugs and was licking the inside of it. Once she had enough she drove normally again. This girl kept popping up on the street and it scared me because she was everywhere. There was also this guy who hopped across the road like a rabbit."
"2876"	"(2009-06-13 (18)) I was watching Quantum Leap. It was Sliders-ish. I was in Scott Bakula's world and he decided he wanted to check ours' out. We ended up in a shop at the top of an escalator, which had those little things you walk through, with the metal and it clicks. He said ""there are kids working!"". Then we were in a forest and were trying to do this thing to get back to his world. There was a symbol on the ground and we put water on it. His hands were on mine and he said he didn't think it was going to work, but then we realized the symbol was gone and we were in his world. Then it was like The A-Team. Dirk Benedict was standing next to a wire fence and I snuck up and grabbed his shoulder. I was thinking that maybe I should I go to Comic-Con. Then creatures and people that Scott Bakula had come across in his travels were there (as in, ones he had killed or stopped). They started attacking us and then it was a quest on Runescape. I was about to fight the boss monster which was a dragon, but I got scared and teleported away. As I ran through the forest, things attacked me. I didn't know where the closest bank was."
"2877"	"(2009-06-14 (18)) Mom, Ezra, Amelia and I were staying at dads. When it was dinner time, she hadn't made me anything so I had a Vegemite sandwich and complained to her. In the morning, she came into my room with Fug and I said to get out of my room. I went on my computer and it was in a different place (the house was now totally different) I was reading the IMDb forum for Jim Sturgess and looking at pictures. Someone said about him, ""nice cleft and asylum"". I was also playing Fusion Effect, which was different. People came in and I saw Silas and Seamus. They had a camera. They were talking and laughing and I turned off my monitor so they couldn't see what I was doing. They wanted to get a photo taken with me. I was like 'I just woke up!'. They showed me their MySpace page and they had been getting pictures taken with everyone from school. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt. I went against the wall and Silas was next to me. He sort of put his arms around me in a hug and I was like 'what the hell, don't touch me!'. Seamus stood a bit in front. He mentioned that on MySpace, photos of me and my photos had lots of negative ratings, so I went on later and put lots of thumbs up on them to make them positive. I was talking to Calvin later and he was now where we were. There was a video with this weird aquatic creature, they called it a jellyfish. It had a weird mouth. I said I would've kicked it in the head. I was saying how when survival guides, and the like, tell you to do certain things, that it's never your first thought. Then there was a lizard and it was chasing me. I ran and closed this door to trap it, but the door didn't close all the way (it was like a sliding door, but with the folds in it) so I ran, squealing. It kept following us. We all jumped up on stuff, I jumped onto a desk. It came to me and hung around the bottom of the desk. I jumped off, because it would like copy you, so I was trying to act out ""jump off a cliff"", so it would die. I tripped and was on my back and it ran towards my face and then I woke up."
"2878"	"(2009-06-15 (18)) I was at a Dylan Moran thing. The place was small and the seats were lame (there weren't many, not layered and squished). He was on the side in a room, which was like where the people sit outside of a recording booth. He did music stuff sometimes. He was doing one now and all these people came up on the stage, including Eminem, Alejandro and other celebrities. People left for a break and I got up and sat on a seat in the middle. Audriana came and sat next to me and was talking to me. She said ""Life is really hard right now. I'm doing George Clooney and Alejandro,"". I said ""What?!"" in shock. She giggled and said they would say ""silly things"" to her and then she paused and said ""You're kind of retarded"", I said ""not really"". I presumed she said this because she was just joking, but I get the feeling she was telling the truth. Poppers wanted to steal from some company and blame it on Uncle Vic. Mom made me keep an eye on him while I was at University. She had a big file full of important files and timetables. My timetable for this trimester was in there and Ezra started at the Technical College this week too. I had nothing on Tuesday and Monday went from 9.30-11.30 and was 'science'. We were then in the car and we drove into a shop, which was half outside (like there were bits of roof missing, sort of market-like). We didn't know how to drive out. I was with Mom, Ezra and Dad. We had to walk up these stairs. We had cakes from Nana and Poppa and we were supposed to give them back, but we had forgotten so gave them back now. We were allowed to take some for ourselves, so I took some and ate a couple."
"2879"	"(2009-06-16 (18)) I was on the computer and it was yesterday. I was on IMDb and there was a guy called 'random_guy'. In his reviews, he mentioned having seen 3309 movies. I had caught 10-15 minutes of this movie earlier. I can't really remember it, but something fell from the sky. It was a baby and it was raised by these wise Asian guys. I said it would've been better if it had been more suspenseful, mainly complaining about the music. I was then watching South Park and Kyle and Cartman were playing the piano and were in sync and sounded good. I went to comment on it, but then couldn't be bothered. I realized it was nearly 2am and I had to get 6am. I went to the kitchen and was filling my water bottle up. I said to Mom ""you need to do my hair"" and she said it was already done and then I remembered. I got another water bottle and went to go to bed."
"2880"	"(2009-06-17 (18)) We had moved house, I think. There was a Sims 3 thing which recorded the number of times the songs were listened to [note: I found the site LastFM a couple days ago, which records the number of plays and I am currently obsessed with it] . Africa by Toto had a high number of plays. On the radio they said they were going to play 'rock' and they played Toto. It was a song I didn't know but then it changed to Don't Fear the Reaper and I was singing it. Mom and Darren were asleep on the lounge. I woke her and said I was going to bed. Also, some guy had found a sewing machine in the backyard of Mom's and because they hadn't 'claimed' it and he was going to take it. A friend of Mom's came over and Mom was going to get her to take it for now. I was then at dads and he was in the kitchen throwing out food, but it wasn't him? The fridge was where the old fridge used to be. I heard Mittens meow and she was outside. She jumped up onto the window sill. Tigger jumped up too. There was another cat which was orange, brown and white and was ugly-ish. It looked a bit like a dog."
"2881"	"(2009-06-18 (18)) I was at a school. I was with Autumn and Evelyn. I went off with Autumn and she was being all religious-y and good. I went into a classroom and went to do something and I realized the teacher was in the class (a lady) and I moved and sat on some chairs at the back of the class. They were close to two filing cabinets and other stuff. I moved to the front to fight? I pushed a desk and it hit a desk with a coffee on it. I did something that I can't read and then moved. The teacher complained and I said something back to her and we left. Our class was somewhere with Mr Reilly. Then we were inside the class and it was shop-like. I had 'broken' a chair and threw it. I was with Calvin and he was watching. Mr Reilly said the chair broke all the time and it was hard to hear him. He came to me and Autumn and asked what school we went to and we said ""university"". He said to not feel bad if we were the worst because we'd do better at something else. Her name was Jordan or something and my name rhymed with it. I said that I never noticed that before. There was a group of people for the Westland thing. There were two girls called Eevee and a black girl. There was a house and this lady was doing a tour. She said to ""look at the ceiling and the fireplace"". We went upstairs. Then it was a movie/TV show. Kenny Hotz didn't want people to know he was poor and from a poor area. Someone told these guys and they said to not worry about it. Then it showed Kenny like 'ok...'. But they came after him and these other bad guys. Then these guys took over the house. I was outside with Ezra. I forgot the names of the characters in some show and I said ""why do I have to remember so many names?"" and I mentioned Jack from Lost. There was a party in a house. There was a caterpillar on my foot and I called it a ""moo cow caterpillar"". I got to the front door and I was worried it was something gross so I flicked it into a plant pot."
"2882"	"(2009-06-19 (18)) I was watching Battlestar Galactica. Adama was in Caprica and cheated on Roslin with a teenage girl in a car. He fell asleep and Roslin came and saw the girl coming out of the car. He was dead and she was crying. I was watching it with someone else and I was thinking 'why do they have to kill off my favourite character just as I start to like him?'. Then he twitched and came back to life and they hugged. I was on the net and I found a video of this guy called Yan, though sometimes it was a longer name that started with 'D'. He was Russian or Swedish or something. They were all short videos. Either I found out from the videos, or this email he sent me, that I had actually written them and sent them to him. The last one was done in April 2008. I didn't remember anything about them at all. The emails were in his language although he spoke English fine. I had already done plot summaries for the last few; one of them was about a girl getting raped. We lived at this different house. Dmitri also lived there. His hair was orange and spiky. I was in my room and Michael Trucco was over, I think he was a relative. He had a kid called Melody and she was trying to get into my room and crying. I 'lifted' the door off the hinges and put it down and it wouldn't fit in. Mom told me off. There was an advertisement for Yan. He thought the handwriting that the stories were written in was his, but I showed him that it was mine, but I don't know where. I was playing Sims 2 and one of the Caliente twins had babies. Also on the Sims 2, a Dmitri Sim and a Mackenzie Sim got together autonomously. Because of this I didn't know whether to marry my Sim Self to a townie that I liked or to Dmitri but then I remembered that I didn't even like Dmitri anymore. I got back from somewhere and I forgot where my room was. It was the ""one with the pretty green door"". Dmitri's door was green too and was two doors down from my room. I walked into my door. Ezra was there too."
"2883"	"(2009-06-20 (18)) There was a movie out that I wanted to see. Dakota Fanning had written and starred in it, but it looked cool. Mom wouldn't go to the cinema. I went to university and got to the normal place I go and I had a bag of stuff, so I went to a safe, which was in the middle of a path and I put my stuff in there. I then went to the lab, but it was actually a room with grey patches on the wall. Mr Epstein was there. By putting your face up to the patches you could see a dream in 3D, or a thought or whatever. Ezra was there too. Then the images were like 'real'. I went into one and it was my dream. The Rock, Ezra and I were in a house. I saw this huge slug under this thing and it had like, two heads. The Rock went to get it and then there was a spider on his ""bum"" and he stabbed it. The slug crawled up him and then there was a huge rock monster outside. People were running around screaming everywhere, but it was after me and Ezra. It would open its mouth and roar and punch its fist down and we would run. We got into a car and The Rock wanted to get in but it would fully break? He got in and told me to drive through the oval -- there were kids on the oval and he said it would eat them and get distracted so we could get away. So I drove through. I got out of mine and then I went to Ezra's one. He tried to kill me because he thought that he was in mine and I said it wasn't true because mine was lame and in a dark cave. In Ezra's, he had made a village with a friend. Then he stopped and I said to check mine out. Then there was another dream thing. I got into a car on a hill and Buffy's mother (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) got into the passenger seat and Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) came to my window and said ""I'll drive"" and then we 'combined'. This was a thing that came from a wish she made. It was then reality again and the movie I wanted to see was like my dream with the rock monster. Mom was now ordering tickets but they were saying that it was full. There was one in some place called Maykeby (or Maykelou or something, I can't read it), which was really expensive. The reviews for the movie were all really good. Then we were in like a cinema. This guy was there, who was the lead singer of a hard rock band that I liked. At first, he sounded like Phil Collins. Anyway, he told them off and then he and some others put sand everywhere (on the walls, windows etc) and then threw snacks everywhere for us to get. I was checking the fat content but they were all too high. Also, I don't know when it happened, but I was in bed and my phone vibrated and I had a text from Dad saying like, 'nub' and it was 1pm. I got up annoyed that I had slept so late. I was looking the mirror and I punched my self in the face, with my right hand which hurt and then my left hand, which barely did a thing."
"2884"	"(2009-06-22 (18)) I woke up and Gizmo was on top of me. I rolled over and something vibrated. It was my hot water bottle. I threw it out of the bed and wondered why they vibrated. Later I was getting my Dream book ready for publishing, with the correct formatting etc [Note: I was on Lulu last night] . Some of the formatting didn't match up properly. I had big headphones that were really soft and comfortable. I put them on and they were really tight fitting, and 'clapped' right over my ears. I thought it was cool that I could listen to music more often. I was reading about Grey's Anatomy. Some lady said that someone on it needed eye surgery because she had googly eyes, but it was a set up. Izzie (Grey's Anatomy) worked on the surgery but then she was George (Grey's Anatomy). I was then outside undercover. I was sitting at a bench with Calvin and Liesl. I asked Calvin if he got to do his exam and said that we did but didn't get a timetable. I asked if ""she"" did exams and he said 'no why?', then I can't read what it says. I saw Evelyn not far away and we tried not to laugh and I told him about this book (?) which was now a game and I said it used two random pictures and said whether they were good together or not and Evelyn got Darius. Then I saw Eugene there. He was near Evelyn and was looking for something."
"2885"	"(2009-06-23 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was out with Mom in the car. It was almost time to go to the train station but I wasn't dressed properly. We went to dads and he was there. I got dressed and there was a new pack of underwear so I changed into a pair. My timetable was dodgy for the day -- I had a spare hour between each hour of class. There was a sport thing too that was a high energy boxing like thing. I needed my lab coat from Mom's but it was now like 8.21am and I started at 8.30am. I think it was some time before, but I was going to bed. Tigger was in the lounge room so Ezra left the door open (they were sleeping in the same room)."
"2886"	"(2009-06-24 (18)) I was walking home with a girl. Some guys came up and were on the grass and I said ""get off my property"". They went after my friend and I ran next door. An old guy answered and I explained what was happening, but then the guys came over. While they were over there I ran home and inside."
"2887"	"(2009-06-24 (18)) I was at university and we were doing an experiment. There was a pretty blue solution. Raquel was there. The next experiment involved noodles. I was then walking down a street and some guys were saying something. Someone asked something about ""Audrey"". Someone said that I'd been having sex with her and I was like '...what?'. I got home and went into my room. There was a girl in my bed and my computer was not there. I asked Dad why there was a girl in my room and everyone was saying that I should know since I'd been sleeping with her. I had never seen her before."
"2888"	"(2009-06-25 (18)) Ezra did something at Westland University too. His teachers were the ones I had last year. I was in math and it was weird? I took the same train and bus but I didn't get off. He looked behind and said he would try and look closer? This part is hard to read but it looks like it says that I (?) said ""you'll remember the truck (?) all by yourself?"" Then something that looks like 'moochy l'. I was looking for a desk at this place. But, wherever the desk was the space had to come with it, so I was trying to find one with a good amount of space. I found one and I pressed a button to try it, there was a huge computer and an old mouse, but it said physical contact was needed. I went to this room to touch the guy and he said to stop and then put his hands up. My hands were sweaty and he was 40-60? He took my hand and said ""ooh, that'll do"". I thought that was kind of creepy, but ignored it. We went back to the computer and he said clothes came with it. He gave them to me and he went to lock the door. I put the shirt on over my shirt but it fit well. He said ""these are the sleeves"" and they looked strait-jacket like and I decided to leave. There was a door behind me leading outside. Then it was a movie or something. This person was saying that they should let him rape them. Mr Garrison (South Park) had died instead? Someone said ""But Lisa wasn't so lucky"" and they were talking about The Simpsons. Whoever it was climbed up this wooden frame, and at the top was the guy's room. There was a singer guy and he was at a concert on stage. He ripped his clothes off and a fake penis fell off. I can't remember who I thought it was but it said Dancing in the Dark, but it was Cover Me and I realized it was Bruce Springsteen. Jeremiah was also over earlier and said something that I can't read."
"2889"	"(2009-06-25 (18)) Dad got a house in Bali. I was showing Mom pictures of expensive furniture. I was then at university but it was like, 1am. Ezra asked why it was so late and I said something about studying and he said ""why are you always at [something I can't read] then?"". The place that I normally did something (I can't read what it says, but it looks like it starts with an 'f') was actually close to home. I was then back home and the wall out the front had been moved out and into a 'hangman' (like, a wooden model of a hangman game). I asked Darren why and he said ""you don't know what a hangman is?"". They were where the grass used to be and were ugly. I was then inside and I needed to go to bed soon because I had to wake up at 6am. I was singing A Glass of Champagne. Then people kept making noises and coming into my room while I tried to sleep. A friend of Dad's was like a dominatrix and had a photo of this girl he scammed and threw it into a big bin. I was then in the car with Mom and Ezra. She was singing and I told her to shut up. She was like 'I have a good singing voice' and I said 'yeah that's why I complain every time'. Then it was night/early morning. I took a bus and got off, then took another one and I kept doing that for some reason. I also started taking trains. I pressed the button (on the bus) and I got dropped off at a $8 a night hotel/motel. I text Mom to get me. I was reading about Spongebob Squarepants because there were questions about it for something. Mr Krab was called 'Increased [something I don't remember] . He also took up some violin thing called a ventillion, or something."
"2890"	"(2009-06-25 (18)) I was at Mom's, which was different. The front room had windows at the front and no curtains. I can't remember why, but people weren't supposed to know that I was there. I saw ""Officer Barbrady"" coming, but it was actually Bellick (Prison Break). I ran out the back and hid behind something. After he left, a bunch of people found out that I was alive or whatever. Granma was one of these people. She brought a bag which had another bag on it under the shoulder and another going out to the stomach. The backyard was big and farm like. Then we were out somewhere and Granma was acting weird and we realized she was drunk. She was driving me and Mom. We saw police up ahead at a booze bus, but they let us through and we were like 'lucky!'. Then I was watching a movie with Kevin Spacey. I had written down the ending before watching it to see if I was right. I was and I was telling Dad it was easy to guess. Then it was like the sequel or something. Robert Downey Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were in it. Jeffrey was a bad guy and in his Watchmen outfit. He was on the phone at a desk (it was like in the movies, where it's a dark room with a lamp on, on the desk) and talking to the 'good guy' and I thought 'damn his voice is hot'. Robert Downey Jr. was wearing a cool coat and I said to Mom that I wanted a coat like that. He was running down a street. Someone's mother, who looked like Judith Light, was at her work in a big building. She was in a big meeting room with ladies all around the table. There was a scream and it went in slow motion and it exploded. At the end of the movie, it showed Robert's character getting a job and sorting everything out. I said that I liked how it sorted all that out at the end, to get ready for the next movie. I think it was a Batman movie, and I was glad that it didn't suck as much as The Dark Knight."
"2891"	"(2009-06-26 (18)) A guy had written Twilight. He decided he loved Alice so everyone thought he was going to bring her back to life in the next book [note: she didn't die in the book] . I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Buffy and Giles were acting weird and they leant in to kiss and someone entered the room and they backed off. I remembered in the last episode they had made out. The others left and Giles was locking the front door and closing the curtains and then Spike was there. He said ""Buffy"" and he thought something was going on. People were complaining about not knowing what Spike could do (without the chip)."
"2892"	"(2009-06-27 (18)) I was at home. I was with Farrah and Ezra had Roland over. Dad was home. Every time we went into my room something was different and it was spooky. There was a piece of paper (like paper from a magazine) which was an application for a concert. It said ""Michael Cain"" and I figured it meant Michael Caine and said it was spelt wrong. One of the times I went into my room there was a new sheet on my bed but when I tried to show someone it was gone. The bed was in the middle of the room, coming out from the wall. Stuff moved around, like the lights etc. I was at the window and Farrah was doing something that I can't read but says that she slowed down for something. Also, Farrah was sometimes Tara from True Blood. Another time she found an old notebook of mine and it had the original copy of the magazine application and we showed Dad. Then I went to Brookland High to do something before going to university. It was a Friday by the way. I went to a room at the back of the school, where the psychologist was, who was a lady but was sometimes a guy. While I was waiting I was talking about a dream I'd had. She asked if it any religious stuff and I said no and told her to not mention religion. A while later I checked the time and it was 11.30 and I was like 'flip, I missed it' and text Mom to get me. Then the psych was a guy. His mates came and he said 'another [something] dream'. I saw Mom's car and took off. She yelled at me for not telling her sooner. Ezra and Roland were in the back. Then it was just me and Mom. We heard a siren and it meant there was a storm coming. There were clouds in the sky but were far away."
"2893"	"(2009-06-27 (18)) I was in veterinary science. We were getting essays back and I got 99% on mine, which was obviously an A. The teacher told us to not tell each other our scores yet. I was sort of friends with this girl who got a B. Her name was either Chloe or Barbara -- there were two girls but I couldn't remember who was who. Then there was a storm outside. There was water in class, which was supposed to be there. The teacher told us to go to the middle of it. Outside it was dark and stormy and there were waves (there was water right outside the classroom too). The girls and I swam to the front but kept getting flung back. There was some event thing on. I was then in some place with Dad, Mom and others. There was mail on the table and it said ""James R. Spader"" and I said ""Ooh, can I open James Spader's mail?"" but it was already open. There was heaps of stuff chucked in other envelopes with Beatles stamps. There was other Beatles stuff and I said to Mom that I 'must've changed my mind' (referring to the fact that it was a dream, and I changed the mail). Then I joined in with the event. It was my third time but because I was still too 'young' I had to go with a partner. My partner was a guy. I had to go in a floaty ring and then try to attach something behind me as part of our task. I was just outside this building on like a patio, without the roof bit. Then our task was to wear these suits, which were a dark grey and were metal like and there were zips at the front and back. There were strips of metal on the feet and it was heavy. There was a big container of fruit (the bottom was like the big freezers at the shops with the cold foods and it had clear plastic walls on top, and a space where you could reach in or whatever). We had to eat the fruit and the weight would be recorded from the strips on our feet. The fruit tasted funny. I had a strawberry and a licorice bar (which was disgusting, as they are). The blue one was the only one with licorice in the middle? The guy went with his friend and took off his suit and was eating the fruit. I said that it only counted it with the suit on. I went inside and there were computers. For the next task you had to listen to music. The most listened to song had less than 60 plays. It was 'If I Was' and I said ""Oh Midge Ure!"". There were lots of songs with 27 plays. I started to listen and then I saw A Glass of Champagne and I was excited. It also had 27 plays or so all by one guy. I found him and went to where he was and then I had the song stuck in my head so was singing the robot-like bit ""glass of champagne""."
"2894"	"(2009-06-28 (18)) I was at the train station. I think I was at Westland. It was different. I had to get a ticket from a machine near the tracks. They were called food stamps though. The train was coming in two minutes. I tried to get to it but this lady pushed in and the train came and she got on but me and this old guy were left behind. I ran to it and tried to open the door but I couldn't get it open far enough. The next one was in ten minutes. When it was close to one minute, it said 30 minutes. People were running around on the tracks. The trains were really fast. This girl and guy ran into a nook and the train just missed them. I was on a platform and it moved and this train started flying towards me (it went around though). I said that ""I almost peed my pants!"". Eventually, I was on a train but I missed Centerville. I called Mom and said that I missed it and to pick me up from the next station instead. I can't remember what happened then, but then I was at a shop. These people were wearing different coloured clothes in pairs. This guy and his daughter were blowing the shop up. He was with his daughter when she blew up, but he left just before she did. I was trying to run away from them, but they chased me. I ran into this blown up bit. A part of it was pitch black and I came across a dead body. They forgot about me later and went off to explode so I ran out. Then it was a show or something. There was a shoe shop. This guy came and he was like ""shoes are shiny"" and this girl flirted with him. He tried on some shoes and then ran. We were nearby. Ezra was in some water but came back and said that 'you get to be more brave' etc. Then it was dark and night time. I called Mom to get me and I had tried calling her all day and she kept saying she would come, but never did. I went down a path and it was spooky. This guy got up and started coming my way, so I went back. Later I went down it again but gave up. As I was going down, Mom had actually come to the place but had left after getting sick of waiting for me. I called her again and she said she couldn't be bothered. I told her she could've called ""Dad or Darren or someone else!"". The next time I called her, she said she wasn't feeling well and wasn't home."
"2895"	"(2009-06-29 (18)) I can't remember properly, but David Tennant as the Doctor (Doctor Who) was in the past when there was no electricity, etc. There was a monster and it was coming and he discovered a way to teleport this building with these gems. He managed to do it at the last second. In the new place, this lady had gotten squashed by the monster as it was moving and so was now dead. There was more but I can't remember it now."
"2896"	"(2009-06-29 (18)) I woke up and it was 1.30pm or something and my alarm hadn't gone off. I complained to Mom about not waking me up. I checked my alarm on my phone and it said couldn't go off today for some reason."
"2897"	"(2009-06-29 (18)) Aunt Sally, except it wasn't, wanted to do a dream experiment. She had to pick between me and Ezra and chose me, since I know stuff about dreams. Chef (South Park) was going to go to sleep and then I had to come in later and check whether he was dreaming. It was early in the morning and I was really tired. I said that REM doesn't start until 1-2 hours after falling asleep and she said that she thought it was more like 3-5 hours. I said to look it up then. We got on a computer and it said 3-10-250 hours. I said ""who sleeps for 250 hours?"". I went in and his eyes opened and then he pretended to be asleep. I told her he was pretending. Then she was Nana. We went outside and it was day now. There was a cage near the fence edge, which was near a road. She was going to put a bed in it for me. I said ""can't I just sleep inside, like on the lounge?"" and she said ok. I went to the back door of her house and people came from the garage. Ezra was asleep on the ground and he woke up and curled into a ball with a weird expression. Nana went to go in and they grabbed her. I ran to the sliding doors going to the lounge room and got in, but the guy had a gun and I only had a screwdriver and so I gave myself up and went out. Ezra and I ended up getting into a fight with them and they were all pointing guns at each other and we realized they were fake. Then we were walking outside and I was wearing bunny legs."
"2898"	"(2009-06-30 (18)) I was in the lounge watching TV. Mom and Darren were talking and then started looking for something. I asked what they were looking for and they said a spider. Darren said to keep our hands on our throats as they were poisonous. I looked for a bit and then went back to my room. My left leg was a bit numb. I went to my computer and was playing a new song I'd found. It was then Homeward Bound and then Electricity."
"2899"	"(2009-06-30 (18)) I was on the computer. I was having problems with something and the only solution I could find was for an operating system I'd never heard of. Daryl and Dmitri had both posted on the post saying that ""Windows, Mac, Host and Moses should have fixes"" or at least for the first three. They were all operating systems by the way."
"2900"	"(2009-06-30 (18)) I was in a car with Dad and we went under this bridge. There was a little plane, a van and two cars in a crash. One was upside down and there was no glass on the road and no people around, but we could hear sirens on the way. Dad said ""I bet that [name of guy] guy is like 'what the fuck happened'?"". We wondered if the plane crashed and then the others crashed. I was then somewhere else on the computer and I had downloaded about 2gb."
"2901"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) I was on the train which was different. I can't remember properly, but there were different ways to get to places. I was at home out the back. Kiki was out there with kittens and some were black. There was a little black one that was really cute. One day it was gone, but I came back later and saw it. Kiki let me walk past her."
"2902"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) I was in a car with Mom. We drove down the road and there were guys on the road selling smokes from another country, which were heaps stronger than normal smokes. We were at the lights. Police came down the road. Mom waited without indicating. When the cops were gone she went to the guys and bought some. It was like marijuana or something. I was then somewhere else and I had a list of stuff to watch or listen to. It mentioned Michael Palin's Himalaya's and Electric Light Orchestra and comparing it to some new stuff I'd never heard of. There was something about Blue Oyster Cult, but it wasn't actually them. I was then at a shop and got some noodles. It had 'stirfry' and had these yuck carrot bits. There was a cake with 40.3g of fat in a small slice. Mom made a cake too that was full of fat."
"2903"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) Ezra was on the computer and I was watching him install game. Mom was there too, I think. I kept calling it True Blood, and it was actually a True Blood game."
"2904"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) I can't remember the beginning, but Dad, a young boy, Darren, Mom and I were at this pool thing. I don't remember what happened there. Anyway, we were driving down a road and there were lots of really different sections of scenery. There was a lake thing with a chair ride that was old and faded. There were other rides there. There was a field with these tall purple flowers. They were creepy and I said they looked like they were from ""lollipop land"". There was a small section of water that was beach like (over sand). It was a very light blue. I said it was kind of pretty. We then ended up at this hotel and it had a big pool. I said it was 'luxurious', although it was actually kind of cheap looking. They we were in there and Mom was waiting for Darren, ""in case he's dead""? She tried calling him. No-one else was here, by the way. There was a plate that had biscuits in the shape of us with bacon and other stuff in them. I took a bit of one then a lady and Darren were at the table in there. Then it was Dad there with the lady. They were acting weird and they said he'd eaten breakfast. They gave us food and said to eat. I asked what it was and they wouldn't tell me so I chucked it back on the plate and said ""I'm done"" and walked off. I went into a room which had a big garden. Dad and the lady came in and she was angry at me ad Dad kept her off. He said, in this deep booming voice, ""I am Sing Tha, son of Urie"" or something. Then he said ""I am God"". I was like 'yeah right, ok'. He said he was looking for ""Eve"" who was a lady who had married into our family."
"2905"	"(2009-07-02 (18)) There was a quiz game show thing. Celebrities were on it and so was I. There was now me, Natalie Portman (or looked like her), who was the champ from 2001, and a singer guy whose name started with 'M'.  Natalie Portman had 9 points. There were two groups and one had 42,000 and my group had 41,000 (I only had 10 points and I thought that there was something not right). The questions were like quotes and producers of movies and stuff and was hard. Mom said we couldn't leave now and so Ezra and I were now tied for the same prize. I can't read what I wrote but it looks like it says she had 'picked us to go to [something starting with a u] ?'. The prizes were left over birthday presents. One had Payton on it. On Facebook, there was a guy called ""Thalky"", which I thought must be Preston Garfield's real name."
"2906"	"(2009-07-03 (18)) I was at my first lesson of chemistry which I only had on Tuesdays in the lab. It was in a different place. I got into a mixed group. There was a guy teacher and he was pretty lame. He yelled at me for not having my safety glasses and I yelled back that it didn't say to get any. He told this guy with long hair to tie it up. Later, we had started and then he told me and this girl that we needed to tie our hair up. I said no and he went off at me, mentioning the glasses again, and that I was just standing around. I yelled back and started to cry and grabbed my stuff and left. I was walking quickly down the corridors outside (the place was different) and I saw Regina. She said hello and that she didn't get into the course she wanted and had to do another unit. I wiped my tears away and said ""what, you have to dance on stage or something?"". She said that Samantha was showing her around and left. I came back later with Dad and it was either Wednesday or Thursday. I had to go back to chemistry though. I saw Ms Ingram and Ms Kuo. Ms Ingram gave me a skirt and said to try it on and this guy told me not to worry about it. I got to class and the group from chemistry saw me and they were annoyed and trying not to smirk. I asked for my results. Some time later, Calvin and some other people were playing a game. Silas was in a cave? Calvin had peed down there and told Silas that. He didn't believe him and I said it was true and he realized it was and vomited. There was a show, which was in book form too. It was romance and the guy looked like Michael Emerson and the girl thought he was ""cute""."
"2907"	"(2009-07-03 (18)) I was watching a movie, which was The Hangover, but not. I think Michael Cera was in it. There were two guys and one of them cheated on his wife or girlfriend with Heather Graham's character? She went to his wife/girlfriend and said she had some STI and the wife was like ""and...?"" and then realized that he had slept with her. Then the two guys and a girl were in a bed and there was a knock on the window. They were all naked. One opened it and it was his wife. She said something, but I can't read what I wrote, and I thought that she thought that he was gay. Then she realized Heather Graham was naked. I laughed because I hadn't noticed. She held her shirt up and the guy told her off for being naked. I mentioned the movie, Moon, to Ezra. He said he wanted to see it and asked if I could download it. I said that I didn't think it was out until November. I asked why he was interested since it was a ""sci-fi drama"". He said he didn't know. I was thinking 'Sam Rockwell, yay'."
"2908"	"(2009-07-04 (18)) I was on the train. I saw a girl and guy who were from One Tree Hill on there (not real ones). I sat in a seat a few seats in front of them. Hilarie Burton sat down next to me and I commented that lots of people from One Tree Hill were on here. We talked for a bit. I can't remember properly, but I was then in a car with Mom meeting someone in a carpark. We had like $1 million in the car in cash, all in $100 notes. We had no bags or shoes and packed all our stuff up in a towel. The police checked out the car. There were some notes sticking out and we gave it to the cops, laughing ""we keep finding these [letters?] "". We ended up at this house which was far away. Then it was a movie or show and this black guy and this kid were in it. They looked alike and I thought it was good casting. They left the wife behind to go there and the kid wasn't happy he had to leave again. Hilarie was then there with me and was sitting on a bed and there was stuff all over the floor and the bed."
"2909"	"(2009-07-05 (18)) My teeth were falling out and I ended up with like 3 (they had fallen out like this before). I went to the doctor. I had to get a ticket like when you get meat from a shop. I grabbed two and later this girl got there and I gave it to her -- the tickets were in the 50's, but it was now up to the 130's. I don't know what happened there but I was then at a shop. Mom had a raffle on. There were 10 slices of cake to win. She won a piece and she let me pull out some of the winners. I closed my eyes and it said ""Scratched"" and I was like 'who the hell is that?' but it was Santiago. He came and got cake."
"2910"	"(2009-07-05 (18)) I think there was a monster. I was outside somewhere, jumping on the roof and walls to get away. Then it was Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). She got to the 'end' and they were going to kill her but she walked away. Then she was shown images of her friends and family on fire so she went back and sacrificed herself."
"2911"	"(2009-07-06 (18)) I went back to dads. I was talking to him and he had lots of mail on the table. One had my name on it and I went to open it and he came back in. He said they were other offers and he mentioned the new apartment. I said ""what apartment?"" and he said 'the new one' and I was thinking 'finally he tells me'. He said that when he owned it, he was going to ask to take Tigger. Later, I was playing World of Warcraft and I was in a scary area (because it was full of high level monsters). There were spiders and tornado things and they kept attacking me. I was looking for something for a quest. Later, I went on a train and was at university walking to the bus stop. I walked over a zebra crossing and there was a car near, and my knee was hurt and I tried to run. I went through the tunnel under the road, which was different and you could see the traffic. There was a bus coming with the next lot of traffic but was held up. I ran to the bus stop. There was a guy there and he got on too. I sat at the front of the bus, which had seats facing to the middle of the bus. There was a couple next to me, to the right. I went to check my phone and it wasn't in my pocket. I grabbed the guy's sleeve/arm and he was like 'what the hell are you doing?'. It was in his hand and I took it and put in the opposite pocket. I said that ""I'm lucky I'm paranoid and check my pocket every few seconds"". The girl said something that made it seem like they were going to hold us up. I held up this paint scraper thing to the guy's throat and told the bus driver to stop. I was going to get off, but it was dark, so instead I told the girl to get off. She was angry, but she got off. Then I asked the driver to take me home and he did. I text Mom to get me from somewhere else. Then it was something else and whoever had held the paint scraper to the guy had slipped and killed him. But it was now a girl's body and they kept her in a room. This guy kept seeing her like 'balloons' with sand and empty with a pole inside her. She would 'talk' to him. Then it was South Park. Cartman looked after her body, which was kept in a room like a bathroom. There was a knock at the door and Butters peaked under the door and he came in with Stan and Kenny. Cartman locked them in (he was sick of looking after the body). The girl's last name reminded me of ""a movie with Dustin Hoffman"". I was then looking in a book with Mom, reading about the 'movie'. I said ""I feel like watching a spy movie"". My iPod had a bunch of songs on it which I had been listening to that I hadn't heard before and I had four of them left to listen to. I went into a shop or something with Calvin and I was choosing music for something. One of the most listened to songs which had 707 plays and was by The Tavares, but I didn't know the song. OMD were playing and this teacher said ""ooh OMD"" and I said ""Yay OMD! My second favourite band!"", they asked ""What's your first?"" and I said ""The Beatles obviously"". She was like 'no-one likes The Beatles' and I was like 'what the flip, are you serious?'. I mentioned that I listened to the 60's and 80's and had started with the 60's. She said 'oh that makes sense then'. I said that I had Petula Clark in my playlist at the moment though and starting singing 'Downtown' in my head."
"2912"	"(2009-07-07 (18)) We found three litters of kittens. There was a weird looking one but it was still cute. I was at university, which was different and I found a magpie with a broken leg so I told a bunch of teachers and they told me to sort it out since I cared so much. Later, there was like a storm and it had been getting worse. Today had been quite bad. I was at dads and it was very windy. I went into the bathroom and the bath and the shower were covered in this orange liquid, which was seeping onto the floor too. It was because the top of the roof was melting and it was coming through the bottom of the window too. It meant that the house had only a few days left, but then the rest of the 'glue' came off and came out faster through the window so we only had two hours or so. Mom and Ezra started packing stuff up. I was trying to keep Tigger and Mittens out of the room."
"2913"	"(2009-07-08 (18)) There was this holiday thing on for something for school. There was a place which did 'enactments' and you could give them details and they would make it like that for you to experience. Raquel was going to it and since it was booked out, the school made up one with a similar place. We were at a shop; I remember seeing Calvin and Eugene there. There were lots of clothes racks. They said that it was going to be like a prison and the guards were like 'aliens' and looked rhino like. There were lots of toy packets, with guns, walkie talkies etc lying about. They said they were going to get this room organized by tomorrow and get rid of the clothes racks and put debris and the like in. I asked if the walkie talkies worked and they said they did. I opened a packet and gave one to Calvin and the others to the people behind me (the packet had four in it). It was like an iPod and I put it in my shoe. We were then all lining up and went through this door and we were told to kneel. I was excited and trying not to smile. They were calling people out to answer questions, one was ""are there eight questions"", the girl said ""yes"" and she was wrong and was sent off somewhere. I was telling Mom about it later. I was at home and Abigail and Brogan were in the kitchen. I didn't know why they were there."
"2914"	"(2009-07-08 (18)) I was at the train station. The next train was in ten minutes. There were buses which went downtown. There was a bus that looked like it was the 98, but then it was 96. I asked the driver (an oldish lady) and she said it was the 98. The bus had heaps of old people on it. I tagged on and I sat at the front. I can't remember properly, but there was a crash over this hill. There were two buses and some cars. We were out and I was trying to slow cars coming down the hill, there was a huge line of them. Some of the crash vehicles looked like they were going to explode, so someone said to take this other bus and find help. This other guy got in to drive. This other guy and I raced to get there first. There were people on the bus and I got on and saw there was blood on the seat. Everyone on the bus and blood on their heads and were dead. I picked up a hammer and I thought the guy who came on with me had done it. I hit him and chucked him off the bus. Then I realized it was the guy driving and I hit him but he didn't fall and I kept hitting him but he just seemed drowsy. I don't know what happened. Later, I found a rubber finger in my room and I asked Ezra ""What the flip is this?""."
"2915"	"(2009-07-08 (18)) I was outside a shop. There was a grassy area, but I don't remember a carpark. There was a lady a bit in front of me. There was also a tank or something. It was aiming at her and we both ran and I wondered if it was actually aiming at me or her, but then we realized it was me and she ran off. I was trying to run away from it and it started beeping along with a timer. Then it exploded. Then it was like a second me? It had something to do with Jude Law who was suspected of being involved with this Italian pizza place. This cop went and was asking them questions. I snuck in and heard Jude Law talking to this guy about 'getting it taking care of'. It was then a TV show and the cop was Tony Hale and his character's name was Hale or something. My character was called Izzy, but I was trying to think of a cool last name. For some reason I wanted it starting with a 'T', though I thought of Pritchard, and thought 'no, because it's obviously from Eugene' and Winter. I thought Travers, but I thought it was from a Sims 2 legacy I read and that it was kind of gay."
"2916"	"(2009-07-09 (18)) I was in a car with Mom and Ezra. It was late at night and we stopped at the deli on Arkana road. She told us to lock the doors but she locked it with a key. I had to go to dads for a bit for some reason. She came back to the car then couldn't find her ""migraine medicine"" and said the guy who served her 'must've kept it in his hands' but then she found it. Some girls had asked for a donation and one of us said ""I'm just here to get [something I can't read] "" We went to dads and waited. He came home and got changed and was walking around in a towel. I asked why I was here (he had asked me) but he didn't clarify. It was 10.30 and I said I needed to go to bed because I had to get up early for university tomorrow. Mittens was on World of Warcraft and was a human warrior with the same professions as me. I then felt like playing. Then this girl had made this blue and green Sim for Sims 3 and I was trying to decide on colours for [something I can't read] outside and then I felt like playing Sims 3."
"2917"	"(2009-07-10 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was doing a quest and slaying something like a boar. I think I was in a new area and then I went through a portal. I wandered into this humanoid camp and this dude, who was like the leader, had 610hp and started coming after me. I had what I needed to get, and ran. I looked back after a while and he was still coming. I ran for ages but he kept following me."
"2918"	"(2009-07-10 (18)) I think we were at Midvale shops and it was late at night. Mom and I were sitting in the car. She had a packet of drugs and kept sniffing it. She drove somewhere off road. This young black kid came up to the car and asked for something. We locked the doors and he called us racist. She kept driving and sniffing and I was worried we were going to crash."
"2919"	"(2009-07-11 (18)) I was playing a game with Calvin, except it was real. I think it was World of Warcraft. We got to this city with this other person. We had to sleep on this small platform in the air and it had a barrier on one edge, but you could fall off the sides."
"2920"	"(2009-07-11 (18)) I had a new timetable for university. I had nothing on Tuesday and Monday, but I had classes on the weekend. Lots of them went until late. I complained about it. We went to Nana's and they had gotten rid of the middle fish pond and had had just kept the pond there (all the plants and the gazebo area were gone). She said they were getting rid of the other one, but were waiting to see if frogs were in there. She was grabbing fish with the net. I showed Dad my timetable. We went to this shop. There was a retard guy and he kept making this weird 'blklbll' sound and Dad and I were trying not to laugh. He kept following us, which was creepy. Then I took a train to the train station, but I missed the bus because the one I had been on had missed my stop, but Mom came straight there."
"2921"	"(2009-07-12 (18)) I was at dads and he finally mentioned the new apartment to me and I said ""what new place?"" and he told me. I found out from Mom that he could back out and that he wasn't took keen anymore. I asked Dad why he wouldn't tell me, what if I wanted to move back etc."
"2922"	"(2009-07-12 (18)) I met this girl and we were sort of friends. We were in some fancy area. We went to this place and these two girls were there. When my friend left they asked why we were friends because ""you're not very pretty"". I said ""neither are you"" and proceeded to make a very well-spoken speech about how ""looks aren't going to inhibit me from whatever I want to do, unless I wanted to be a model"" and that in the future when I was making lots of money, they would be working in a checkout."
"2923"	"(2009-07-12 (18)) I was at home, but then we were going somewhere. Mom and Ezra were in the front of the car and Roland and I were in the back. We were passing Dog Swamp shops and I was thirsty and my water bottle was almost empty, though it had been full when we left. Roland said someone should play Runescape and I said I was going to earlier, but had played World of Warcraft instead. We got to the train station and were waiting for a bus. Roland was wearing a black shirt that said 'Rainbow' in red and I realized it was the band. The bus came and it was the 451 and I then realized we needed to take a train. Mom wouldn't listen to me, and then she did. She went to the toilet to check herself in the mirror. Ezra tried to draw on my face with a red texta."
"2924"	"(2009-07-13 (18)) I was dating this Indonesian (or so I think) guy, and I was pregnant but I had cheated on him with this other Asian guy [note: watched paternity tests on Maury Povich last night] . Sometimes I was Ezra and he said he didn't want his kid around the Indonesian's sister, who was younger and was like 4 years old. Then I was meeting his parents? But then, I was with another lot of parents and I introduced the other guy I was with as my boyfriend, who was called Rupesh [note: watched Torchwood the other day] . Then I was somewhere else and I was actually going out with Eugene. We were at a shop looking at fans and he was getting one similar to one that I had, though I was thinking it was pointless since we were always in the same bed. There were chairs there. I was watching him at one point and I was thinking like, that I was lucky and he was hot. I went to touch him and then pulled my hand away. Then I was at some other place and everyone had found out that I'd been sleeping with the other guys. Eugene was upset and went to this other room. I was upset about Eugene and fell into a heap, then the second Asian guy, who was now Felipe from chemistry, got this ring and was trying to propose to me and I cried and told him to go away and hit him with this tray. Later, I was playing World of Warcraft and killing these red spiders and usually there were birds there, but they weren't now because it was a different season. Eugene sent me a message over the game asking me what I was doing, then sent back saying oops, he forgot (that he was angry at me, I guessed)."
"2925"	"(2009-07-14 (18)) I can't remember properly but I was playing World of Warcraft. Mom was telling me how something tasted ""like a turkey sac"" and it was a drink. I said I never had it and she said she was going to make some and I said that I wanted to have a sip."
"2926"	"(2009-07-15 (18)) I was at Mom's. There were cops at the door and Mom was telling me to be quiet. I went to my room. Darren was using the lawnmower outside. My room was different and was lower than the ground outside and when I looked through the window I could see the grassed area clearly, but looking up. There was stuff all over the floor and I realized they were spider webs. They were everywhere and there were lots of little black spider eggs on my bed. I told Mom and she just kept telling me to be quiet. I got a tissue and fly spray and I had to squish them all because they would bite otherwise. I got a few and they would squirt out purple juice. Little Willy was playing. I went back to my room later and it was different. My computer was on and my bed was long (?). I yelled at Mom. I was then walking with Dad, Ezra and Mom to go somewhere. Dad mentioned his new place and I said ""what new place?"". He said ""the apartment"" and I said 'I thought you would've talked to me about me, what if I wanted to move back' etc. He said it was to avoid tax or something. We went to a petrol station and this cop talked to Mom and she thought I called them. Then Dad took me to this place called Connections, which I thought was a restaurant. I remembered people saying that it had a strict dress code and I said that I wasn't going to get in. Michael Cera was at the other end of the place with a friend, who was underage. They said something, but I can't read what it says apart from a small section which says ""dress as a girl"". They left. Michael Cera came back with a fancy towel thing and chains and jewelry on his neck. He was then with Ezra and this other guy with a towel around him. The guy checking ID's and such was watching them and so they decided to go in together. The guy let me in without checking my ID. I thought it was weird. There was a young girl with Calvin and they turned her away. Inside there were arcade games everywhere. There were tarot card ones, Pokemon ones, slots etc. When time ran out, the screen showed a cabin and everyone would get in and a bear would come. There was a drawing on an air hockey table, which included a tall gargoyle? Someone had to write ""be a [something that looks like writer] "", but it wasn't neat writing."
"2927"	"(2009-07-15 (18)) I was talking to some girl about music and movies (etc). They mentioned a song by someone and they pointed to a picture of them, but then it was weird they like, kissed me, but it was the picture. I was like 'what the hell?!'. The picture was of Sam Rockwell. They said to check out a song called ""Touch Light"" or something. I said ""I like him as an actor, so I'll check it out""."
"2928"	"(2009-07-15 (18)) I had stayed at dads. Mom and I were driving back home late at night. I noticed that this lot of woods was burnt and I realized there had been a huge fire. I was like ""Oh my God, oh my God!"". We saw that Mom's house was fine and I was like 'thank God, I didn't want to have to lose the only other thing I care about [my computer] ' and I thought about Tigger. It was really dark and once we got out of the car, it was pitch black. We heard a noise across the road. I ran up to the door quietly, and we could hear someone coming. I told Mom to get the keys and open the door. This guy came and I threw a plant pot at him. It was a small cactus, but it was heavy. I got a container with water and he snuck past me and I poured it over him and smashed him over the head with it. He fell and I got a broomstick pole and stabbed him in the eye, the ear, then whacked him and stabbed him in the chest (he was now dead). Then I went inside to go back to my computer."
"2929"	"(2009-07-17 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft, although sometimes it was my test. There was a movie or something and there was a guy with two kids. One of them was a 5/6 year old boy with a French accent. I thought it didn't sound real. They were in the car driving. They went to some place and they wandered off. Then I was with Dad and Ezra. The material my pants were made out of made Ezra sneeze and he was telling me to take them off and take them far away. I went inside somewhere and people from Arrested Development were there. Alia Shawkat screamed. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman were also there. Jason Bateman came over to where I was to a camera and video player thing. I was recording. I went outside for [something I can't read, but it looks like pant) and something about a deer. Then the French people were chasing a cat [something I can't read, looks like 'go missing'] . There was some insect on this thing and he said it meant this girl had taken Mom and I for a drive? Something screwed the road up and it made us ""drift"" and slide all over the road. There was a guy with Pokemon cards. I thought about buying some. I managed to get to the 'end' -- it was World of Warcraft again. There was a Pokemon like Celebi. I went up a hill. I had to fight it to get this girl back."
"2930"	"(2009-07-18 (18)) I was staying somewhere and so was Eugene. We had been there for a few days and we were sort of friendly. I was packing up, as I was leaving, and Nips are Getting Bigger was playing, and then Don't Tell Me Now. Eugene was playfully kicking things at me. He handed me a pair of socks and our fingers touched. Then we were at Nana's and they were locking up the door to the hallway and the dining room. I had to go into the hall, then go to the dining room and lock it, but it didn't lock and the alarm went off. Mom and Darren were outside on the rocks. I asked for help and they were like 'we don't know what to do'. There was this waterfall slide which I went down but I didn't take a big enough breath. Calvin was in the water. I was then on World of Warcraft. Eugene was alliance and Calvin was a gnome. We were on a quest or something and we had to go to the 'reproductive system' (doing it in Human Biology at the moment), from the stomach to the female parts. Dennis and Charlie (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were wearing robes. Charlie was a small gnome. They fit in, but Dennis stood out a bit. Once a year for a 'week', Dennis slowed down and it only lasted like five minutes though and then he was back to normal again. I was trying to remember who were best friends, whether it was Dennis and Charlie or Charlie and Mac (in real life)."
"2931"	"(2009-07-18 (18)) Ezra and I went to this place at university, which was different. It was this hairdressing section which was huge. They had a little shop there too. I was going to buy snacks. There were huge shelves and I was looking at magazines on them, looking at the hair styles. There was a picture of Catherine Zeta-Jones. I was then at home. Ezra was in his room on a computer and I was in my room on the laptop. My roller shutters were open. I can't remember what was going on, but some people were being dodgy. I walked back to my room and I saw a dark dude walking towards the house. I called Mom and told her to come now. I said we were hungry and I squealed that someone was coming. I went to tell Ezra. I went back to my room and he was in the house. I ran to the family room and I was trying to find weapons. Then there were three white guys and a black guy. I stabbed the black guy in the head (there's something else written here that I can't read). I got a lighter and set one of them on fire in the bathroom. I closed the door. They tried to get the door and I hit them with a wrench or something. They stopped the fire and were ok. I got them outside and they came through the window, it showed us at the bathroom door and they stretched (like that episode in The X-Files). I thought it was gay. It took a long time too. Some time before, one of the guys went into a cupboard thing. He opened the door and sunlight came in and he burned. I was thinking 'why not do the Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) thing and put something over you'. He was actually on the roof of a building. He went to the edge and jumped. His skin was red and burnt. He landed on his feet on the ground and was ok. Then he went to the hairdresser place because there was a girl there he liked and she let him in do something. There's something I can't read and then someone said ""Damn it! Sam and Dean!"" and I think 'what would they do in Supernatural?'"
"2932"	"(2009-07-19 (18)) I was at the train station, which was different. I got distracted and the train left. The next one came and I had to tag on at the front of it, but I forgot my bag. I put it on my back and the doors were closing, but I managed to slip in. It was like a bus inside. I took a photo of this black guy, who I knew, because he had been in a dream. The next thing is hard to read but it looks like it says that everyone stopped (or got on, I'm not sure) at a mountain and they hugged and greeted this model. I was then at home. Mom and Darren were there and I asked them something that I can't read. Darren said 'oh I'd probably evaporate'. I was worried about cops? Then I was back on the train, which was now like a tram. This guy started talking to me, so I stopped my iPod. I still couldn't hear him properly, and I had to keep asking him to repeat it. My ears the unblocked and he repeated what he said which was like 'storm draft' or something. I asked what it meant and it was something to do with people fighting in the war. I said ""who the hell would do that?"" but then they were getting everyone off the train because no-one had volunteered, they were taking all of us. Mom was in now charge, although it wasn't her. I asked her why she picked me. Ezra was also there. There was an airborne disease and they gave us the vaccine and I said something I can't read and 'it's only temporary'. Outside it was snowy. We passed this sign saying 'Obsession' and then I felt tired. Everyone fell asleep. When I woke up it had only been like two seconds. Ezra and I escaped and started running. There were lots of mountains and things. The road was foggy and there were lots of cars, so we waited and then continued running. I had a quest on World of Warcraft to hand in nearby, so I went and did that. Then we were a young brother and sister. They wanted to go home and sleep so they could 'play at the beach' tomorrow. I said 'with the seaweed' and I said that I hated the beach because ""you get sand in your pants and attacked by seaweed"" and also mentioned sunburn and that I hadn't been to the beach in ten years. They then hid in a house in a cupboard and fell asleep. When they woke up, the doors of the cupboard opened and these alien/insect hands reached out to the girl and she screamed. Then it showed the kids and they had been transformed into them (it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, when you go to sleep and you turn into them, except they actually transformed into an alien). I was thinking that the vaccine was a waste of time. Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was now the leader. Sometimes it wasn't, but she was very serious and this guy spoke through a shield. Then it was a movie with Kristen Stewart. The reviews said it was ok but it mentioned 'Cullen'. It also had something to do with ""Brave New World by Aldous Huxley""."
"2933"	"(2009-07-19 (18)) This dream seemed to carry on from the last one. I was on the run from some people. I had to go back to the place where they were. I got inside but then this girl saw me and she went to tell the leader. I was then with Dad. I went into the stairwell and ran up. I got out at a balcony thing and there was a guy working on there. I ran across and went into this other stairwell place and ran down. I had a gun and I shot this girl in the head. I ran out of the building and there were people outside and I was trapped. They were getting people onto a bus. I saw a lady getting into a car across the road and I ran towards her. I pulled her out and drove off. It was then like a motorbike and then a mount on World of Warcraft. I went far away and through a bush and then there were houses, but I kept going even further. I ended up in this new neighbourhood, with houses, but no people lived there yet. There were two guys looking at houses. I think I helped them with money for a house. I ended up getting a house and changed my name to Izzy Lynch (referencing David Lynch). I 'still' did veterinary science. One day, which was the 16 July, I had planned to meet Dad. I was listening to Save Your Kisses For Me. Then it was the day to meet Dad. I didn't remember anything since the 6 July. I talked to my teacher and I had missed heaps of work. I said I didn't remember anything. I then went to see Dad and there was a turtle. Dad was saying that they looked younger as they aged and I said ""Hey Mr Turtle!"". At some point Mom and I were in a car and it looks like it says 'the sun was hitting' (or possibly gun, or something else) back slightly. Then it was a movie and this girl was now an old lady in a bed. They sent her back to her time. Then it was a sequel. I can't remember it properly, but this boy was in a baby seat. This guy got him out. He got a pair of scissors and cut the kids throat. Then it was in a room and the kid was lying dead on the floor covered in blood. His sister and mother came in and I think he killed the girl and I was like 'ook...'. I was telling Dad that the sequel was cool too."
"2934"	"(2009-07-20 (18)) Someone in a van took me to dads house, but it wasn't (it looked like it, but I didn't recognize it) and gave me an envelope to give to this person and they told me to say ""Hello I'm Sam and I need to retract this envelope from you"". The person was Jared Padalecki, although I didn't recognize him. I opened it and there was a charge of $2 and a cancel of a credit card. He was going to email them to find out who they were. Mom had a small car. It was squishy and they also had to sell a heap of their stuff?"
"2935"	"(2009-07-21 (18)) I was at university in Communications and I had Ms Ingram as my teacher again. I saw Evelyn in the class and we sat together. I had been away yesterday and was copying her notes. I also had to do a before and after picture and my ex was one? This girl was upset because her parents wouldn't let her watch TV or anything. I can't read what it says properly, but it says we dreamt about something. I also was talking about movies at one point and I said that ""I hate happy endings"". Someone asked me about Lord of the Rings and I said that I liked the first two and they asked what Gollum's name was and I said ""Frodo, I mean Gollum"". At the end of the lesson, I still had more to do but finished it at home later. The next day the teacher complained because I hadn't signed it and they couldn't accept the work and was saying that I didn't work hard enough. I got upset and angry and said ""Screw you!"" and left. I picked up a bin and threw it and it hit two cars. This guy who owned one of the cars came after me trying to bash me. I ran. I think it says the guy was driving my car and the seat was far over. Then I was leaving the university. I had to take this other car and it reminded me of Stuck in the Middle With You. I got in the car and locked the door and then there was a person at my window with a gun and said ""Say hello to my little friend!"". I drove off. I text Mom saying that I was on my way and Ezra replied saying he didn't know what she was doing. I drove back to my car? I ended up in a room which had an elevator at the front and there were other people there. The elevator kept moving and didn't have some sides so that it would match up with other rooms. Some people were using it to slide out, but we were too worried as it moved fast. It started breaking through walls and it made a crack sound and then the dream went weird. 'It' was teaching me things. There were dots on a world map and it would 'fly' to them and explain different things. There was a 'forensic science' and a 'geography' one. There was something about the tide and it caused the sea to produce corn (on the cob). It showed lots of corn lying on the beach. I threw one. The voice went silent. I was then on a street and there was a milk carton on there so I grabbed it. The voice said ""a rurie is a thing and a Grurie is a thing you really like"". I saw something come flying down the street and it looked like the Grurie from a dream I had ages ago. I freaked out and splashed milk on it as it flew past. It came up with a notice like on World of Warcraft, saying that I had a request. It came back and it went to drink the milk and I said it poisonous and something about where it was from and traps? It left and I was telling Ezra later and I said that the dream I'd had was the freakiest thing and scarred me for years. I assumed the guy from the car was the Grurie in disguise."
"2936"	"(2009-07-21 (18)) I was driving with Mom. I was talking and then asked where we were going and she said 'you know where' and I said that I didn't. She was going to Dad's new place. We went in and he had moved in already and it was different from the pictures. Dad asked me how I liked it and I was like 'eh'. I asked where I was supposed to put all my stuff and he started going on about how I could ""ship it back to the US"". Mom had some pencils which had recordings from some young boy called Christopher who had played with snow. I cried and yelled at Dad saying 'what about my stuff, what if I want to live here' etc and that I loved the old house. I saw Tigger and gave her a pat. Mittens was in a cupboard in the kitchen. Ezra said that he liked the new place. I realized I was late for school and said to hurry, but nobody did so I didn't bother going."
"2937"	"(2009-07-22 (18)) I was at home and it was different. I was playing Sims 3 or a similar game, and the babies died of starvation and were skinny and creepy. There was also a movie playing, which I had seen before and had Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It was called 'Me and You' or something. His nose got broken and it looked weird. When I went to bed, I put a Nurofen and a drug tablet that I took in a sealed bag. The next morning, Mom saw it and tried to look, but I took it and hid it. Her and Darren then started looking everywhere for it. I went out the back, jumped a small fence (there was a small sand strip and then a big fence). I buried it in a small hole. She then drove me to university and dropped me off at this shop, which was connected to the train station. There were jetties and water, and it was hard to drive across the water. I went into the shop and it was hard to find the train station. I ended up finding a black room which had a curtain you had to walk through. There was a girl and we sat together in this cinema. They were going to play a movie which I'd seen. Then it was Bruno. The train would take 96 minutes to get wherever I was going. I asked the driver if he could stop. He did at the lights (the train was on the road). There were a few bus stops, but I didn't recognize any of the numbers and had no idea where to go. I called Mom and started crying that I was late for class now (it was Wednesday by the way). I managed to get back home. I had decided to take the drug to university to get rid of it. I took it out of the hole and put it in some water. I had some soap/meat flashcards and they got wet and erased. Mom saw me and was curious about what I was doing. I was then out the front and she started going through my bag and pulled out a lot of Lite Mars Bar wrappers. I got angry and upset and yelled at her. The next door neighbour was running by and stopped and looked in the window and I said ""who the hell are you?"" and he laughed. I had the drug in my green jumper. She said she would call the police to search me when I got to the train station. It fell out of my jumper and I stepped on it and I said that I put Nurofen in the bags and when I woke up it was still Nurofen. I took it and threw it in the bin. I can't read the next bit but then it says that I didn't want to be accused."
"2938"	"(2009-07-23 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was in the water and killing stuff for some paper, I had 4/6. There was a player named Eugene and he was a low level. It turned out it was actually Eugene. On Facebook he had been helping someone from last year fix their computer. I thought the way he was explaining stuff was cute. He left notes at the bottom of this lake (on Warcraft). I went down and read them and they said 'Izzy, stop reading/following me' etc. One said ""I know that you love me..."" and ""give up"" etc. I crossed the love out and put 'hate' and did similar things with the others. Then Cuddles, Simba and Gizmo were in the water and I killed them and they respawned. Eugene and I ended up talking and hanging out for the rest of the day. Someone made these cake things. They were filled with cream and covered with chocolate, but the cream was actually on the outside. They were nice. Steve Buscemi was at Nana's. I gave him a cake and when I came back later he had killed himself, after finishing a movie. Anyway, I made a Murloc sound at Eugene and he laughed and did it back. Then we were at school and we took the same class. One of them was in a pool. I was asking him questions about Warcraft, he was level 17, but he had started again. He asked me how I got home and I said that I took the train and he came with me. I didn't know what the people there were talking about and left. I went to the shop. Mom told me to get something and then she got it. I was complaining to Nana about the new house. Nana had a box of blocks that I used to like. I saw Poppers, Granny and Aunt Sally outside. Uncle Wilbur said someone didn't want to see me. I was then outside walking up to the back door and Johnny Depp was walking past and I said ""hello"" and he said ""Hi Izzy"" and I asked ""How are you?"" and he said ""Good, how are you?"" and I said ""Sensational"". As I was walking up the ramp, he said ""Bye Izzy""."
"2939"	"(2009-07-24 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. Some Horde guy owned this Alliance guy in an elevator thing. I think I was swimming on there for a bit too."
"2940"	"(2009-07-25 (18)) I was watching a movie. A boy and his parents were at their house. They looked out the window to see a huge dinosaur/monster in the distance. The husband was a scientist or something, so he sent his son and wife away and said to contact some guy if they needed to. They ran, but didn't take their car as they thought it would ""be easier to see"". The monster was just flattening buildings. Then I was there and as I ran, I looked back and saw it flatten their house and I told the wife. They ran into an underground section of a building. There were a few others there and it was pitch black. They ran upstairs and I followed and said we should stay underground. We ran up a few floors and it was a shop, and it was circular, the shops were around the outer edge and the middle just had escalators and the like. I repeated that we should go back underground and then there was a scream and it was in the building. There were some elevators, but they only fit 1-2 people in them and they were a cylindrical tube and teleported. They were also randomly distributed. I was with Farrah and Charlene and we were trying to find one. We ran into a small shop and we all managed to get in. It started shaking (as the monster was coming closer) and then we were teleported up a few floors. We ran and got to the top floor. There was a room and it had a TV, shelves, lounges and piles of books. Calvin was there now, along with quite a few others. I said that we had to find somewhere to hide. I took a window off and there was a small balcony going right around the room. There was stuff piled up in front of the windows, enough for us to sit behind. I was telling them to sit behind those areas and to be quick and to not move when they got there. They didn't really listen to me and some were painting this small wood section of the wall black, from white. Then we realized the monster was coming and everyone got into place. One girl was in some oxygen thing and was floating in the fish tank. Calvin was lying on this wood railing that was joined to the balcony and dipped down a little and I said that it was a good idea and I went on there too, but then I realized I couldn't see the room now and it was uncomfortable but it was too late to move. I thought I was going to fall. Then the monster came and it stuck its head out of the window and it didn't see us, but kept looking back out. I realized it must be able to smell us."
"2941"	"(2009-07-25 (18)) Ezra and I got a kitten each. His was weird and was a girl. We could put them in this water and they would be ok. I was trying to think of a name for mine. I thought of Dean, but remembered that's what I wanted to call my dog, then David to reference David Lynch and Michael C. Hall's character in Six Feet Under, and Darren to reference John Lennon but couldn't use that since we already had a Darren in the house."
"2942"	"(2009-07-26 (18)) We got into the car and Mom and Darren were in the front with Ezra in the middle of them and Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were in the back with me. Darren called my phone and I'm Henry VIII started playing. I complained about being squished in the back. Also, at some point we went to pet shop and it was late. We knocked on the window and they let us in. They had ugly dogs. We were asking for help with some weird pet. Later, I was at a party with Jensen. We left (it was late and dark) and we both fell over on the path. He told me to go ahead to the car. I walked down the path and there were some others too, but then I was by myself. It was spooky. There was a fence right next to the path and I looked over it and I saw Jensen getting taken into an ambulance. I went to the carpark and I somehow got into a fight with this guy. He got into his car and I pretended my car was a different car and he slammed into it and then parked to get out. I got into my car, quickly put the keys in the ignition and reversed out. He realized and reversed back out. He missed me and I drove part, driving fast and crazy to get away from him. I got home (or somewhere). We had a shop and I saw that it was messy. I unlocked it and there was a note from the guy and a cake with powder/flour to make it messy."
"2943"	"(2009-07-26 (18)) I can't remember properly, but it was like the movie 'They Live'. This lady with short black hair was on TV and her name was Anita Noo. They were taking aliens everywhere. Her voice kept going alien like. She was saying stuff like 'pretend', 'don't answer to your home (?)' and something about the number 31076. They said they were coming tomorrow and insisting that we couldn't live without them."
"2944"	"(2009-07-27 (18)) Eugene and I were friends. He was on a computer next to me. We were talking on MSN. His number was in my phone, but it was at the bottom. Calvin was looking through it and found it and laughed."
"2945"	"(2009-07-27 (18)) I was standing in the dining room at Mom's, watching TV. The second Twilight movie was on, and we watched it for an hour, but all they did was sing and it had nothing to do with Twilight. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were in it. But then Kristen Stewart was Leighton Meester but she looked really gross and Mom and Darren said that she was really ugly. I realized that it was a preview. I was telling Mom that the books were addictive, but the movies suck. Dad picked Ezra up to go somewhere. It was raining and really late. In the morning, Mom took me to university as she was taking Ezra to something up that way. She dropped me off at the train station and said she would get me in a second. Then it was World of Warcraft and I was waiting at the edge of the platform. This level 10 called [what looks like Thedd, but it's messy] was getting attacked by Murlocs and crabs. I killed them. It was nearly time for my class to start, so I called Mom and she said something I can't read, but it was on Facebook and there was something about a movie and I assumed it was a bug. My car was now there and I drove it to the other side and hit the wall. The guy next to me gave me the key to his car and took mine. I tried to get in the back. I think it says 'quick fingers'. I was then at Nana's at the table and there was a $10 Royal Show thing. There was something about long hair and a joke about something I can't read."
"2946"	"(2009-07-29 (18)) I was playing Scrabble with Mom and Ezra. Ezra had his turn and got 75 points, but then I looked at what he did and he had done a word connecting other words, but half of the words he had made weren't actually words. I kept having too many letters in my rack. Some band came on that I liked and they started with a 'T', but I couldn't remember who they were. It took like 1-2 hours to get to the place we were going to."
"2947"	"(2009-07-29 (18)) I was in Human Bio, but it was different. Felipe was in front of me and Aliyah was next to me. I was in the third row (there were five rows). At the end of the class, Felipe said he wanted to ask Aliyah to a dance but couldn't afford a dancer. Then he said instead of asking the 'pretty girls', he should ask the ugly ones. I thought 'here we go' and he said ""Hello"", obviously pretending to ask me (and he was being mean, not joking). We got given a new experiment, at first it was already filled out but then it was new. I started going on about everyone being shallow, but he just walked off. Aliyah waited for me in the hall outside and we walked together. She went into a room and then two people were talking. She went behind this bookshelf (which was sticking out in the middle of the room, and there was a hidden space behind it). She sat in this thing in front of the wall and there was a hole behind it. It was small and she went through it as a shortcut out. There was no way I could fit, so I left and went out the front door (the place was like a mansion). There were thin wires all over the lawn (which was huge) and so I was jumping over them. Then there was garden bed and I crawled through it to the path. I realized I had forgotten my shoes. I had to cross the road for the bus and I was thinking I should call Mom to get me."
"2948"	"(2009-07-29 (18)) I was at university. It was Tuesday and I had chemistry but I forgot my lab coat. I was annoyed about it. I needed to get changed and wandered into a building, which was like a house. There was a young girl in there and she had a Furby and I was like 'I remember when they first came out'. We chatted for a bit and then I left. I went into my class, but it was full of random students. Then I needed to go to the toilet and someone showed me where one was. There was a huge queue, which had girls and boys, but then there was a fork where it separated into separate toilets. I finally got in and it was a huge room with toilets everywhere and no cubicles. There was a cubicle one but it had a weird spray of water about head level. Some boys came in and attacked this girl. They threatened me and I was like 'what the hell, I don't even know who you are'. They tried to attack me and I tried to punch but it was slow and difficult."
"2949"	"(2009-07-30 (18)) I was at university in class talking to Jakob and some others about our marks, hopeful TER and failing last year. Later, I was talking to Samantha and she was in the last year of her course. I asked her how many hours a week she did and she said she did 15 yesterday and I was like 'what?!'. I complained saying that it takes me an hour to get there and that I have to get up at 6am when I start at 8.30, which was three times a week and that if I had a 15 hour day, I wouldn't get home until like 1.30am. I was then in a room and there was a riddle on the board -- the waiter had [something I can't read, looks like 'moar'] and we figured it meant a plate. I was then watching Thank God You're Here and Hamish Blake and some guy were on a bush walk and they stroked this horse's penis to find out where they were, which everyone found funny. A friend of Mom's had written her a letter saying that was praying for me to do well. He was at war or something."
"2950"	"(2009-07-30 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft, but it was real. I can't remember properly, but I was in village, hiding behind walls and trying to find a way past (I had to run in between buildings to leave). I realized that I was friendly with them and neutral with some others, so I just walked in. I went into a house and a dog started to growl, so I got a broom, which had a long, yellow feathered end and a short pole. I don't know what happened, but I was then in a forest running."
"2951"	"(2009-07-31 (18)) I was at the old house in my room. Cuddles, Gizmo and some other cats kept coming into my room, then Ezra's. I went into his room and he had all these old shirts in a rack from Brookland and they all had a patch of bright colour on them, there was a blue one and a green one (that I remember). I took one off to look at it and then put it back on. Ezra woke up and I said that a cat had knocked it down."
"2952"	"(2009-08-01 (18)) Autumn joined the MUPC. We were in human biology together. People were complaining about Ms Edmundson being a bad teacher. I was talking to Autumn as we were leaving and I asked how she got here and she came on this huge truck thing with like a water tank and wheels like a tank. It would suck stuff closer to it. I said that I took the bus, but she offered to drive me back. I was unsure about the truck, but agreed anyway. I text Mom to say I was getting a ride. We also discussed failing last year."
"2953"	"(2009-08-01 (18)) I was with Eugene and he was wanted by the cops. I can't remember what happened but they saw us and chased us. As we ran, we were holding hands. He tried to boost me a few times, but mostly we ran at the same speed. He said we should split up at one point and meet up at another, but I misunderstood and split up now. He ran through a corridor and I kept going on the other side and I could see him through a sheet of glass between us. We ran into a cinema and sat down. I said we shouldn't sit together, but it was too late to move. A cop came in. I had lipstick so I put some on so that I would look different but because I didn't know how to use it I was worried I would get it on my face. The cop was asking people questions. She sat behind us and started asking me stuff. I spoke in a girly voice (softer, higher pitch) and she asked if I liked ""Platinum in Lancaster"". I was like ""what's that?"", but it actually had something to do with whatever Eugene was involved in. It had something to do with getting possessed. At the end of the questions she gave me a chocolate. There was a True Blood ad with a dog in the kitchen at it ate some Pez. I was like 'I'm sick of seeing this show and what does Pez have to do with anything?'. I said this because I wanted the cop to think that I hated vampires. Someone said that someone was putting dead bodies in the Pez (in reply to what it had to do with True Blood). Then there was a fire announcement and we were told to leave. I got up and Eugene wanted us to separate (as they were looking for a couple), but I said that the cop lady already thinks we're together and we'd probably look more suspicious if we were apart. We put an arm around each other. I was a little bit taller than him. There were two exits and people were crowded around each of them. We left and then realized nobody else was outside and it was a trap for us. It was pitch black outside and we quietly moved to the edge. Some cops came out and were asking each other where we were and they started searching for us but said they couldn't see anything and to bring a torch. They came back and were shining the torch around, they turned around and as the light hit Eugene, he ran (it was only him, I had already run off). They caught him though. I was hiding in a garden. I got up and ran. Some cops were searching nearby and saw me and started chasing me. I ran around a corner and there was a lady with a red car, and she was doing something in the boot. Her son (maybe five years old) was tied up like a cocoon to the top of the boot. I jumped in the boot and was like 'please ssh, I won't hurt you'. She started to cry (she was sobbing and there were tears). The cops asked her where I was and she said I ran ""up there"" and pointed up the street. When they were gone I got out and I asked if she could drive me somewhere and she agreed. I lied down in the back of the car and said if anyone asked, I was her daughter. There were police lights coming up behind us and I said to keep going and then pull over. She opened the boot for some reason and the cop saw the kid and told her to get out. I figured they would take her, so I took off with the car."
"2954"	"(2009-08-02 (18)) Darren went to some place that was like a party but it was brothel like. He had sex with this young girl, who someone said later was only 10. He got worried and tried to find out some information, but then it looked like she was only 8. He tried to talk to her and she cried and acted like he did something wrong. Later, I was at this place which had lots of storeys. It was just a square building with water in the middle and ramps around the edge. There was a party or something going on. There was music playing and I heard Talking Loud and Clear playing. There was a room to the side which was like a classroom. Andy McCluskey was in there at the front sitting by himself. There had been some voting thing for bands and people had voted for their favourite songs and the bands for each were tallied. Andy won with 1003 votes. No-one clapped or did anything, so I clapped and said ""Well screw all of you!"" and Andy was like ""thanks"". There was this huge eel like monster in the water. It had tentacles that were like 15 feet long and they were flat. I managed to tie two of them up around a pillar."
"2955"	"(2009-08-02 (18)) We were at Mom's old house, which was totally different. We still had all our stuff there but had only just moved back in. It had like 4 storeys and only had stuff on one side (it was nothing in the middle, stairs on the edge and then a big platform at the back). The roof had a bit you could sit on. My mobile phone was really old and was the size of an old video camera. This lady was checking through it. Mom showed me some undies with Mewtwo on them. Ezra said ""I'm 22"" and that ""we're too old for that"". At the Hop was playing and I was tapping my leg along to it."
"2956"	"(2009-08-03 (18)) I was at the shop with Mom. We went there for something but then something I can't read but looks like 'tram' turned green. Something I can't read, but looks like 'CH quest for bar for blue' and something about $45. Some guy asked ""why"" and I said ""because we want blue check thingies"". This guy with a motorbike smashed something. We left and Mom's car was getting broken into. I called to Mom but then we realized it was the wrong car. It was night. We couldn't remember where we parked and there was another entrance at the shop (it was at Midvale). This car followed us as we walked around the carpark to the other entrance. This girl got out with a gun and we just kept walking. Mom unlocked the doors. The lady shot and took Mom, but I got in the car and drove off. I yelled out to this girl to call the police. I drove up the road where they were rebuilding the bar and then I went back. The people were leaving and Mom was walking alone and her hair was messy and started walking down the street. Later, there was some big building with lots of others and it was like a movie or something. This guy there had a French name but his real name was Jake Oriente. He was standing next to me and I thought that he liked me. He put his arm around me. Then it was a movie and everyone there took their clothes off, me included. This kid got an erection (like 8 years old or so) and this other guy bent him over and started having sex with him and complained about his poo. Everyone watched in disgust. This other movie that Jake was in, these girls saw maggots everywhere and spoke weird. Then they would start to bleed and then they would die."
"2957"	"(2009-08-04 (18)) Ezra, Dad and I were staying at Nana's. There were photos there from something where Samantha, Calvin and Silas had come back there after something. One of them we were sitting at a table and we looked like we were 4-5 years old, though we were actually 12. Anyway, Ezra and Dad had gone outside and I decided to check the time and it was 1.43am. It was still light outside and they were at the back door and came in. We were annoyed that Nana and that were going to wake up soon and wake us (from the kettle etc). Later I was at Mom's and Ezra had a heap of friends over. They were playing games such as soccer. They threw the ball to Ezra and he kicked it. I remember seeing Leroy and Brantley there. I went to bed early. When I woke up it was 11.26am. It only showed 'J' which was a code for 11. I was annoyed because I had missed my lab and I woke Mom, who was sleeping outside and she just fell back asleep. She got up when I asked when we were leaving for the awards ceremony. There was a scoreboard and I had 7 points in a bunch of stuff because they were using me as a placeholder or something. There was a song in my playlist that was like 'Boy name Cry'."
"2958"	"(2009-08-05 (18)) I was watching Entourage and this thin secretary lady was standing between Ari's legs. Mom came in and I explained the situation because he wasn't cheating. Vince was also talking to some people. In real life, Clark Kent (Smallville), Ezra and I were friends. There was this living 'virus' thing which looked like a seahorse. It could talk, or something. Ezra was really smart and did these calculations of how potato, wheat etc production would increase with the virus. There were pictures of it too. The virus was hanging out in the water. These people were after Clark. I wondered where Lex and Tess (both from Smallville) were and then I remembered that Lex was gone and Tess was dead. The people found us at the lake thing where the virus was and they were looking for it. I jumped into the water before they saw us to try and catch it but I had to come up for air. It wanted to bite me -- which would make you into an autotroph. They got Clark with it or something else and he couldn't use his powers for a few minutes. I don't know what happened but then Clark and I were on a bus. Chloe (Smallville) was also there at one point and she said ""shit"" and I was shocked that they allowed swearing. The bus was full of people. I'm not sure what was happening, but I realized that the bad guys were after us. I told the bus driver what to do to get away and he did it straight away. He stopped because the bus in front of us stopped. People got off and I did and there were dead bodies piled up like hay. The door on the bus closed, due to powers that the bad guys had. I tried to get back on, and the bad people were coming back but I couldn't open the doors. Clark ripped the doors open and helped me on, then fixed the doors. We drove off and there were two other buses, one with good guys and the other with bad guys. I think there was a mutation. I got off the bus again at one point and was walking ahead to test the ground -- it was in a forest. I saw the bad guys' bus coming and I told the bus driver to go. I jumped on and held on from the outside, while it drove on and then I got in. He decided to use this whistle thing and I held on tight, but then he used this 'tear gas' and something else. The tear gas was supposed to put them to sleep and I can't remember about the other thing. I ran off the bus so I wouldn't get affected and Clark chased after me. We started feeling sleepy and all the buses had stopped (we had been driving through a school). We ended up collapsing. There was a short video of people in a house, they were mutants and only ate 'PMZ'. We woke up and went back to the bus but they wouldn't let us on because we had mutated, but they had mutated too. They let us on when they realized but they were still suspicious of us."
"2959"	"(2009-08-06 (18)) Some friend of Mom's was having a party. There was food, such as steak and noodles. I was hungry and Ezra was there and he wanted food too. I was playing a game, which was like Sims 2, but was an RPG. We were in groups and ours accidentally caused a nuclear war/explosion. There was this small safe which Rick (The Walking Dead comic) had got it for us to use, but had misjudged the size. We hid in this nuclear safe building so that we would survive. We were looking for a bank. There were zombies around too. I think we got captured at one point. Turtle and Vince (both from Entourage) and someone else went to see some people, but they were bad and chased them. I was somewhere else and they came after me and this girl I was with. I took a car, but my friend got taken. I was driving fast and fell into a lake while turning a corner. I didn't know which button to press (it was now a game), but I managed to get out and then got on a bike and rode fast down the path and I got back. Then I was back to Turtle and Vince. They were on this ramp thing that was high up and Turtle fell and then left (he was on a mount that was like a hippo). They started to follow, but then Vince stopped them and was speaking Spanish and tried to hypnotize them. He managed to calm them and pushed them off into the water. We got captured again. I was thirsty and this girl took me to a deli to look for water cartons but there was no water. This black lady zombie came in and pointed at me -- they knew who we were because they had pictures of us. These zombies came in but let us out. It was a trap and the bad guys took the girl and I drove off. There were also traps, one was these strands off cotton attached to this electricity thing and it would shock you. We all then got through. We found somewhere to stay. The girl came back and I said ""didn't you turn bad?"" and she said she was normal again. This other girl said ""oh, it's the Janitor"", and I thought she meant the Janitor from Scrubs, but it wasn't. We ended up with Eugene, Bradley and Darius. There was a video and they were made to strip. Eugene had really bony hips. He was also wearing this ring on his second finger and I was thinking 'damn it!'. They had no bites. This sporty guy was there. There was something about water contamination and salt (it's hard to read). There were Youtube videos on how to make clean water. There was also a video of young boys in a bath and I was like ""pedo vids!""."
"2960"	"(2009-08-07 (18)) I was on a bus at the university and it was waiting for people to get on. Calvin came on first and was covered in spider webs because of something that he was doing. Alejandro was also there and had to speak another language. He put his bag on the top shelf (shelves were in the bus, like on planes). My class was huge. The girl sitting next to me was Matilda. Classmate-F-20 came in and she was jumping around and did a spin and fell and people laughed. There was an interview thing on TV with Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Mom was admiring him and I was like 'yay there's information on John Winchester' and 'yay Winchester'. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were in the audience and he called them his family (jokingly)."
"2961"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) We were staying somewhere. Santiago had this expensive place. He was in a spa full of girls. He was acting weird and we thought he was going to rape some people."
"2962"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) I had gotten a job at some place and moved to a better one. This guy I was friends with moved to mine and it showed him talking to a guy behind the counter about getting a job."
"2963"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was fighting some monsters and needed a group. I was then in a shop with Mom. There were costumes there. Mom and I bought some chocolate and it was all melting. The girl behind the counter told us to go back and do something I can't read. There were pieces of paper with stuff written on them. We took them back and the girl had something to do with a special quest on World of Warcraft."
"2964"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) Some kid was acting odd and I think he was sexually abused. This other kid was acting similar. I was talking to their father with some people. I think he was a doctor. We bashed him? The police were called and the place got set on fire. They got out us out."
"2965"	"(2009-08-09 (18)) I was at home. Mom and Ezra came and Nana and Poppa crashed into a pillar in the garage. There was a box of gnomes and Ezra said it was something to do with Sims 2. The newspaper said that Eric from True Blood had ""just arrived in town"" and I thought I might go. On IMDb, someone was saying that he was hot but 'George Clooney is hoter' and suggested some black woman or Reese Witherspoon as a replacement of Sookie (True Blood). We saw Transformers 3 at the cinema. The first 40 minutes were really good and only had Shia LaBeouf doing stuff (nothing to do with robots), then Megan Fox came along and I was like 'great now it will suck'. It was night in the movie and there were bits in the Earth, that were like a raised dome made of glass and all the robots were under the Earth and were planning to come back. There was a friendly one who was now under evil control. It was started stomping around and they were bigger than normal. In the cinema, most of us ended up upside down on the chair, hanging on to them. Then it stopped. It was really awesome and it was from like a strong air for effect. I went to the toilet and bought a ticket to some gay girl movie. I couldn't get back into our cinema because I had to get the ticket off Dad. When I got in the car, my hair was messy."
"2966"	"(2009-08-10 (18)) I was watching True Blood. Sookie and Bill (who was a werewolf), were sometimes me and Eugene. We went to this patch of forest. There were some trees, flowers and a lake and it was a pretty place. This cop was there. We had a picnic blanket and we started making out on it and then had sex. I told someone that he was very violent sometimes (because he was a werewolf). Sookie was in trouble at one point and Eric came to save her -- it was during the day. I was in the car later and there was a fire. I was then in a deli and they had Lite Mars Bars for 90c. I put money in this box and started eating one. I told the guy behind the counter. I realized I left my wallet but was standing next to it but my money was gone. I asked the guy about it angrily and tipped some coins out and he insisted there was no money in it, but had taken the coins. Then some people came in and we suspected they were going to do something. They had taken my money, which was $300 and these guns that I had."
"2967"	"(2009-08-11 (18)) I had a magazine and it had a scratchie or a competition thing with it. I checked if it was a winner. I had three 8's which won me $10. I told Mom about it. Then I realized I got something else and wondered if it would still count -- it did."
"2968"	"(2009-08-12 (18)) I was watching Burn Notice. Eugene used to be a rebel and his mother asked him about his favourite item which was some telescope, because it was good for ""picking up chicks"". It showed his first meeting with Fiona. It was night and they were outside. He was on all fours and she was licking his bum and saying like ""Oh Eugene"". This other girl was at his feet making out with someone."
"2969"	"(2009-08-12 (18)) I was at a train station. I tried to tag on and something went wrong and then I didn't know whether I tagged on before or if it had worked. I asked a policeman to scan it but nothing showed up. I think it says I posted it on a forum. The train station was huge and inside. There were heaps of shops and escalators. There was a message on the forum and some girl said she was bisexual and for ages she had [done something I can't read] and that it might be the reason for something. There was a group for a plan or something but I can't read what it says. This screen said ""John Wonchomber"" but it meant Dean Winchester (Supernatural). My tag off hadn't worked. I told Mom and Darren later. I also went to university for a few hours. I was at a shop which was actually a house? I was looking for a door. Outside it was rainy looking, but hot."
"2970"	"(2009-08-12 (18)) There were zombies or like zombies, vampires and stuff or something. At first it was Torchwood. I ran to this place that was on fire. It was night. It was near a body of water.  Owen and Jack had been in the building. Owen was dead. Jack got back up. I saw something floating in the water and I thought it was Ianto. I went over and then it got up and it was this freaky pink fish thing and it started chasing me. Jack started running too and he dived in the water, so it would chase him, and I ran around. I ran through the gates to exit the property, and there were more of them outside. One was yellow. We both ran through. I don't know what happened. Then Dad, Ezra and I found this pizza shop. We were going to stay in the fridge. I had parked my car up at the front door so the passenger side was at the door. I saw people coming and I locked the door of the car and moved out. They tried to get in. We ran out the back. It was farm like. There had been a horse. Someone killed it for fun and I think there had been other people with us before but they had died. I jumped the fence and ran along the side of the road. There were a few cars. At one point, I was with Dad and someone else, I think, and it was night. Some areas were pitch black (we were outside). Some guy told us not to go on the path. We ran through this grass area which had some trees and bushes. I saw a path in the distance and there was a girl and two guys on there (it was lit up). They pushed people onto the ground and the guys would put something through their head. The girl suddenly started listening carefully and we fell to the ground so she didn't see us, but she heard us. We started to run and we jumped over this small ledge and there was a creature like Gollum (Lord of the Rings) near a campfire. She came looking for us and we hide under the ledge. This girl saw my toe sticking out and helped us."
"2971"	"(2009-08-13 (18)) I was watching a movie with Robert Downey Jr in it. First, we had gone to some restaurant thing. I was wearing my normal clothes which usually wouldn't be allowed in because they were too casual, but I was let in anyway. Mom and I were at the shop later, where the restaurant was. I couldn't get into it without at least jeans. I needed to get shoes too. Only one shop was open and it only sold girls clothes. We grabbed a pair of black sneakers and we had a look at jeans and Mom said they were gay. We tried to get into a bigger shop. Then it was the movie again. I can't remember it properly, but Robert Downey Jr had been taken by this woman. He had escaped. Then I was talking in a stairwell and I remembered them mentioning an echo and I found them. I told Mom about him going for dinner with his ""wife and son"", who were both different and his son was like 3 years old."
"2972"	"(2009-08-13 (18)) I don't remember how, but Classmate-M-16, Jakob, Leilani, Verity and I were carpooling. Classmate-M-16 was driving. It seemed to be taking a while to get there and I thought the train would be quicker. We got on the freeway and Classmate-M-16 started smoking and when he threw it out, it flew back in and I squealed. It was the day before the human biology test [which is today] and Verity mentioned that she sucked on the chemistry test and I said 'yeah but you were on holidays for two weeks'. A song came on the radio that I liked and Jakob, Classmate-M-16 and I sung along a little. Another song came on that was Feels Like the First Time and it sounded like Foreigner [note that I haven't heard the song before, but it was quite vivid] . It sounded like a cross between I Want to Know What Love Is and Hot Blooded. There was an ad that mentioned yoghurt and this guy was copying Michael Westen's (Burn Notice) voice and there was a Burn Notice competition about the yoghurt. I laughed. We got to university and we were waiting outside the class (which was different). I said I should've studied and Classmate-M-16 was like ""Izzy!"", which I took as 'you will do well anyway'. Jakob asked when I finished for the year and I said ""I'm doing the same units as you man!"". I went into class and Mr Epstein was in there and he said that calculators were allowed in the human bio exam as long as they didn't ""take up time"". Then he told us to start the test. The first question was about before a game starts and ""opposal adversary into solute silver"" and something about resolution. I put my hand up to say it was wrong."
"2973"	"(2009-08-14 (18)) I was at university in math. Ms Hayward was my teacher and she decided to make the rest of the course English and writing and drawing skills. We had to write paragraphs on how we felt about things. Then she drew a picture on the board and we had to guess who it was and draw it ourselves. The person had blonde hair and a green jumper but it was this Arab guy in the class called Peter. Later, I was at Nana's. Ezra had been there for like two weeks and hadn't showered at all. He was wearing a big blue shirt and there were patches of sweat and cockroach babies were flying around him. Dad came up and I was going back with him now and Mom was going to pick Ezra up tomorrow. Nana had food for us."
"2974"	"(2009-08-14 (18)) I was in a forest and it was like Lost. I was with some others and we wandered off. There were cabins. I went into one and someone walked past and we freaked out and ran. I got a message somehow to go to this place. I went but then it was like university and there was a huge lecture theatre and awards thing. At the bottom, Raquel and two girls were there. We sat on the floor but then Raquel found chairs for me and her."
"2975"	"(2009-08-15 (18)) I was at Nana's and she told me that she was going to Granma's for lunch ""tomorrow"". I said I wasn't and said that she didn't remember what food I didn't eat, as examples I used pumpkin and the salty gravy she made. I had a pedometer that said something I can't read. 24 was on the TV, then it was Heroes and there were lots of episodes on in a row up to episode 30. Robert Downey Jr was in the last few episodes. He was also in a music video with some girls. There was an Iron Man 2 thing and I said ""oh, I've managed to not think about it for like 5 hours!"". Also, I was watching a movie with Dad and Ezra and they asked for a big screen. There was something about Sin City 2. I was in a building where they got everything ready for the movie (Iron Man 2). I pressed a button and then it was part of the movie and I was disguised as Robert Downey Jr. This lady came and she talked to me and gave me an ID to use. The name was 'Rupert Sphincter' and there was information about 'him' too and he had a wife. This bad guy took it before I could read it all and asked me what my full name was. A friend of mine took it back. We went for a walk and I saw a cat. I was about to squeal ""Gizmo!"" but realized that would give it away and just said ""a cat"" instead and I gave it a pat. I was then at Nana's again and we watched this gay game show. Then it was Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Anya, character I didn't like and Willow were talking. Someone complained about cushions and Willow kept saying ""Oh I hate cushions"" and everyone else was like 'they're cool'."
"2976"	"(2009-08-15 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were in an outside area, like a park, but there was a path and everything else was bushy. We were at a table. We were meeting some bad guys. It was Tricia Helfer. There was good waiting for us and I was eating some. Another time we were waiting, we had a food fight and when she came there was no food left for her. Sometimes it was a guy that came. I gave them some of my cake. Another time, Mom told me to go chill for a bit. I had a skateboard/bike thing and a rode it up the path, up a hill. I was thinking maybe there was a car waiting (incase we tried to escape) but there wasn't, so I left, but then I saw one coming. It started coming down the path and trying to run me over. I got back to the table and Mom realized what was happening. We ended up in a car with me and Mom in the front and Tricia Helfer driving. I thought she was going to jump out and I told Mom to be ready to close the door if she did and then she did. I was driving the car and then handed it over to Mom and we were getting chased through the traffic. Then me, Ezra and Jayson ended up on a bus. It was really old and full and had compartments with doors inside. We pressed the button to get off at the next stop but it went past it. I yelled out ""excuse me, you missed our stop!"". He missed the next one too and said that he was picking up 'Cassandra'. We got to a house and it was Alia Shawkat but she was older and pretty. We got off at Northtown and I text Mom to meet us at ""Brumby's"". We waited near the bottle shop. There were pictures on a wall of us and one's of Darius and Eugene. Mom said that Dad's house needed to be vacated."
"2977"	"(2009-08-16 (18)) I was staying at some house which was near a huge forest with skinny trees. I went down to the beach (through the forest). Some guy had made this chart where if someone preferred 'choice A', they would always choose 'choice B'. There were pictures of females and I was picking the most attractive one out of each lot and they mostly corresponded to the chart. Anyway, I ended up walking/swimming down the beach and was near a cemetery. It was far away from the house. I was walking back and I had no signal on my phone so I couldn't call Mom to get me. I finally got back and Darren said there was ham, but they both called it something else at first and I laughed. There was a really tall building and lights from it reflected into the water to the sky and it looked pretty. I told Ezra that Mom called Supernatural stupid and said that it was the ""first episode of season 2 when they had the car crash and the Reaper is trying to rape Dean and their father dies"". He was like 'aw now I feel like watching it'. I was talking to Alejandro at one point and he was talking about his passport expiring and I said I applied for one and that the furthest I'd been was the other side of the country. I was thinking that I should get him to fill out the information for the witness thing. He was talking in another language."
"2978"	"(2009-08-17 (18)) These people were all writing a story. They were in a shop and it showed the path of writing. It all ended up with what looks like 'TeOkde' which meant people needed something and they'd die. I told Mom and Darren."
"2979"	"(2009-08-17 (18)) There were these photos from a holiday with Dad and others. There was one with us on this floating ledge. I was there later and I saw this guy over there and he was floating and then I realized it was Michael Shanks' character from Burn Notice and he called out 'how'd you get a caravan?' and there was something about a time traveler. I called out something but I forgot his name and trailed off with ""your mother"". Mom made fun of it. Some time later the photo of the floating ledge looked fake and I said ""it was quite photoshopped""."
"2980"	"(2009-08-19 (18)) Dad and I were in the car. He was picking up a friend. He came out exactly on time. I was watching Burn Notice and Michael and Fiona had a fight and she had some necklace that one gave the other to say that they would never be apart. She had thrown it in the ocean and she was looking for it. The 'camera' showed it in the water behind her, drifting away. As she was walking away she saw it and I was like 'pfft lame'. Eugene and I were then at 'university' and Michael (Burn Notice) had been captured and was being tortured. They said they were getting a ""shrew to give you a heart transplant"". They put it on his chest and it started burrowing in. We were trying to save him. There were some Arrested Development posters. One had Tobias in bed with a bandage on his head and everyone standing around. One had Gob on the left of the others, laughing and one with someone patting Michael's (Arrested Development) head. Anyway, I was putting these coin like things into piles in a test tube rack looking thing. Eugene was trying to find a way of getting in. Fiona went to some old guy and this machine made her temporarily looking like him. The people there had lots of kids. Eugene was disguised as Michael Jackson. Then Fiona as the old guy was walking down the street but she was someone else and two of them were talking and this student laughed. Eugene got in and we got Michael (Burn Notice) and then we had to leave because an alarm went off. We ran, along with everyone else. Eugene said we had to get to some room to plant evidence. We got to this elevator and I said it was probably safer to take the stairs. We went into the elevator anyway and this lady had to scan your ID. Our ID's both flashed red and I said that I was here every day and she seemed to forget about it being red. We got off and walked slowly and then once we were out of sight, we started running down this hill. This black security guard started chasing us and started shooting the ground at our feet. I started slowing down and Eugene kept running, but this other guy got him and brought us back. He was talking to us and he had these weird pink tubes in his arm, which was because he used to be an alcoholic. I was thinking that I figured they were always a drug addict or alcoholic. I managed to pop this button on his gun holder, which was at the front of him. I told Eugene to grab it when he had the chance. He suddenly grabbed something from him and started running. I ran after him, saying 'what the hell are you doing, shoot him!'. But he ran to this car and got in the passenger side. I got in the drivers seat and he started it up. The belt went around the bottom of the seat and was in the way of the pedals. Stuff started exploding, this car nearby and then just decorative stuff around, like barrels and chairs. We tried to drive out and I got onto the road. I couldn't brake in time and I pulled up on the side of the road, it was also a manual car."
"2981"	"(2009-08-19 (18)) I was at the post office or something. There was a box with envelopes and I found one with my name on it, but it was just a shirt. There were two more with my name but they weren't filled yet and I was annoyed. There were some photos of me, just my head and neck but I was naked. I was wearing a necklace and I was really grossed out by it. I was then at home waiting for the delivery truck. A car drove past but it was a hearse."
"2982"	"(2009-08-20 (18)) Calvin and I were at home or something. I can't remember what we were doing but Eugene joined us. I think some time before, we were in a classroom and Eugene sat next to me and Calvin started making fun of it and I tried to shut him up and not laugh."
"2983"	"(2009-08-20 (18)) I watched a movie or something or reading facts about the 1700's. Darren said that Mom should take a cooking class and they were expensive -- like $940 a day. I was saying that in the 1700's it was $60 for cheese (like a 3cm size block). Some lady in the movie industry back then could drive and stuff and females weren't allowed back then. I found a photo of Jayson on some social networking site and I was telling Ezra, starting with ""Remember Crispy Bacon?""."
"2984"	"(2009-08-20 (18)) Dad and I went to a cinema thing to see some creepy movie. It played lots of different things, like there was another movie, then an episode of Supernatural. It went like a cartoon and these balls of light came to this guy and turned into these weird dragon things. They said that these balls of darkness near their planet were actually dragons getting bigger and they would come back in 35 days and will wipe out their sun. We were going to leave the cinema, when the creepy movie started and we sat back down. Then it was actually a stage and Steve Burns was there. He was asking people to go out and walk backwards down the hall. We went to and as we were leaving I asked Dad ""did you get the water bottle?"". We realized we were the only people and I felt stupid. Steve then met up with us and he was in different clothes. He took us up the hall and then turned a corner. I realized it was the stage and stopped but Dad didn't and kept going. He took him to the far end of the stage and was talking to him. Nana was then there too. I couldn't hear them but I heard him say ""if you let me fuck your daughter"" and they laughed and were like ""how do you know she's over 18?"" and he said ""she's got her licence right?"". Nana came out and said ""I think he likes you, you're library/biology teacher"" and I said ""it's the dude from Blues Clues!"" and she said she knew. He made Dad drink water and eat popcorn. He was encouraging him and said ""with your little cat mouth"" which was really funny and I was trying not to laugh."
"2985"	"(2009-08-21 (18)) I got ready for school but Mom took her time to leave and when she finally did it was 7pm. I said I wasn't going to go and she asked why and I said it finished ""2 hours ago"". She was like 'oh'."
"2986"	"(2009-08-21 (18)) It was today, and I was waiting at a bus stop for a bus to Centerville. Autumn was there and Tiana too. I was talking to Autumn and she mentioned Whitehall and I was thinking that maybe I should've stayed there. The bus came and stopped in the middle of the road. I ran across and tagged on, but the gate closed as I stepped on. I was wearing shorts because it was hot but I remembered I hadn't shaved and decided not to go, so I got off. I tried to use a teleport on my phone but I had to stay really still but this car was coming at me. I called Mom and I started to walk down the path. She said she was coming that way and then these two doctors and a stretcher ran into this building. The lady asked me if I could help her and I said ""with what?"" and she was like ""age, gender, problem"" and I said ok. She had a pregnant lady and I had to hold one of those air things. I had to help rearrange the room. I saw Mom outside and I waved and she came in. The lady doctor was now Ms Hayward and had a black eye. I asked how she got it and she said it was from her husband. She still needed me to help and was asking me questions about how I felt about the job I had done and I said the usual doubts 'that I didn't listen to the instructions properly, made a mistake' etc."
"2987"	"(2009-08-22 (18)) I was in chemistry and it was different. My desk was next to the teacher's desk and there was a glass sliding door. It was then a house. I went back to class after and Ms Hayward's file was open and it had the class list so I read it. It had notes at the bottom. Most of them were about me, such as ""Izzy scored 97%"", ""Izzy was away"". There was something about me getting into some 'fast track' course. I decided to take a photo of them all. I heard Mom talking to her in another room and she said that I had taken a photo of the class list and she came to check on me and I left. There was some water outside and I went into it to hide, but it was weird so I got out. I asked Mom if the water was safe. I wasn't wet when I got out. She confronted me later and I was saying I was only looking at my name. I had a score of 700/800. We argued for a while and then she told me to rewrite them all."
"2988"	"(2009-08-22 (18)) I was with some people, some of them characters from Entourage. I was with some guy who was setting up a sniper in a hotel room. I wandered out into the hall and I saw the guy next door setting up one too. There were some people in the hall. The 'bad' people came and knocked on the door. I ducked down (behind the bed, which was near the window). They came in and I got back up. We escaped or something and I only remember Turtle and they were hiding out in this place which was owned by a crazy lady. There was a small fire and it started to burn this car that Turtle liked. I turned the power off and saved it."
"2989"	"(2009-08-23 (18)) We moved into Nana's. I was in her room. One day Mom packed up all my stuff and moved in there. I got really angry about it. I complained about lack of privacy and that I have nowhere to sleep now. She was just like 'oh well'. I said it would be better if she and Darren stayed in the room in the hall because Ezra's room was near mine."
"2990"	"(2009-08-23 (18)) I was playing Super Mario. There were new levels and places in the game before that went nowhere that did now. This programmer guy had programmed Mario's fingers to climb up this tower in a certain way because that's what he did when he 'kissed a cute girl'. There was a place with lava monsters. Some guy who helped make Sims 3 had added a train in it after some guy gave him a map, which had like Australia on top of Canada and everything was all close together. It took 37 seconds to travel around the whole thing. I was then at a shop and there was a huge row of computers. They had Sims 3 on them and there were a lot of computers (thousands). Mine was the second computer. I hadn't been there for ages and there were lots more people. Thuy had the first computer. My Sim was called Ruby Harper. Thuy's was called Cane Nathan (first name and second name, can't remember the last name). The guys next to me were Arab and wanted me to swap seats with some guy to make it less squishy. Thuy said ""I want to sit next to one person!"" and laughed."
"2991"	"(2009-08-24 (18)) I was watching something about South Park and Trey Parker mentioned liking Journey and Don't Stop Believing was playing."
"2992"	"(2009-08-24 (18)) I needed to bring my birth certificate and some stuff to school for something. I told Dad about it. I got there and went to the 'gym'. I asked ""is Mr Billings here?"" and they said ""no"". I was then at home and something was on next that I said to Ezra I might watch. Something came on which had these nails but had a drip of fake blood on them. There was an insect that was huge and had this yellow and black end on it. I told Ezra it was a bee but he didn't care and I realized it couldn't be a bee. I can't remember it properly but some and others and I went into this dodgy place to save some friends. There were desks set up outside like a classroom. I had to crawl past and then there was like an entrance. There were kids guarding it. I grabbed a metal pole with a pentagon shape. They pretended to feel threatened and I hit them. This guy got an axe but I hit him with the pole. We got caught then I think. I was then in a room with this guy and a bad guy and lady. The guy said he didn't have to 'fix?' the room. They let us go. I said it was like Marlon Brando and he said he saw some guy and I said it was Marlon Brando (I don't remember it now, so I have no idea what I was talking about). I think I got out and went back with a girl. We crawled past the desks again and now there were old people. We got to the fence surrounding it and realized that we got caught and allowed to leave so that we would come back. My friend accidentally told this old lady and they realized we had escaped and so I said we had a girl on the inside. Someone was called William."
"2993"	"(2009-08-26 (18)) My room kept getting broken into. One time I had this bottle of pills. I went back to my room and it was messy and they were gone. I had a torch and I flashed it in Mom's room and Ezra's room and it was really dim, but then when I went to my room it was bright. I discovered my window was moved and Dad said he would fix it. One of the times I looked out my window and saw 3-4 Native women were in my car. I called out to Dad. He went out and scared them off with three small naked boys. I ended up with two women and three guys coming through my window into my room. I got this knife and Ezra was helping me. I was stabbing them in the back through the heart while they came through. My first weapon didn't do anything on this one guy. Each person that came through was harder to kill. Then I was outside and this woman came. I stabbed her and she fell to the ground and I walked away. I saw her breathing and I went back. She was on her stomach and I stabbed her again and started slicing back and forth into her back, but she kept talking and laughing and I started getting really angry and annoyed. She was actually a demon or something. Anyway, one day I was on the bus and I was ready to get off and I was holding the button in my hand. Leilani was on there but we hadn't met before, she asked what stop I was getting off at and I said ""Barlow way"". I saw the street sign and hit the button. It was actually Princess Road though. I walked across to the park with Leilani. There was snow on there and water with ducks in it. There were polar bears and a seal and others too. There were lots of people walking along the path. Bradley was amongst them. I got to Mom's which was different and there were actually two houses and they were like huts. One was mine. It was empty except for my desk (which was dark brown and completely different). Dad was in the shed fixing my window. I told him I needed insulation on it to keep the light out. He was flirting with Leilani. I poked him in the belly with my foot. Then I was eating some food and Leilani said ""Does Jakob know?"" and I asked ""What? Who's Jakob?"" and then I realized she meant Jakob Healy and she was like 'that you're on a diet and there's a baby' -- Mom had Amelia over."
"2994"	"(2009-08-26 (18)) I was watching something and there were two best friends in a house. They were young and the guy asked the girl ""can you kiss me?"". [Note: I watched the first three episodes of Dawson's Creek last night] ."
"2995"	"(2009-08-27 (18)) There was a killer. Me and someone else were running from it, but there were two of them (they were the same, but they were each a half). It was able to run really fast and just glided along in a straight line and turned really quickly. We ran into a police station and tried to tell them there was a killer, but they just sort of wrote us off and told us to leave. It was coming, so we ran out. We ran into a toilet and locked the doors and hid. It was coming through one entrance so we left through the other. It was night and there were a few buildings. The killer was like a shadow. It ran into a building and killed everyone in there in a few seconds. Then it was from its point of view and it was actually a girl who was looking for her body which was in the sea. One half of it took off and called the other 'Amy'. This lady was at the top of this tall building. She got a call from someone saying they were here and she sobbed and jumped off the edge to kill herself. This was already planned if they came. They caught us and put us in a cage."
"2996"	"(2009-08-27 (18)) I was pregnant and close to giving birth. I was at a hospital and I was thinking back to the beginning where they took ""15mL"" of the father's blood (don't remember who it was) to give to the baby. Then it was Peyton (One Tree Hill) and I wondered if she was pregnant because the actress was pregnant in real life."
"2997"	"(2009-08-28 (18)) I was at university and Eugene and Autumn were doing the MUPC. I wondered why Eugene was there. The teacher was saying that those who did well were offered an earlier exam. I said to Michael (on accident) that it was lame and he said it was probably like it was going to be on the ""14th instead of the 18th"". We were doing some math revision and I didn't remember any of it. There was an episode of Supernatural. This lady was in a house in the lounge room and her son was watching TV on the floor. Behind her the lounge moved. She looked and nothing happened but then it moved again and she asked her kid if the lounge had just moved and he said ""apparently so"". The TV moved too and she ran. It was night. She ran to a crime scene and asked Autumn (Supernatural) for a lawyer. I can't read the next bit but there's something to do with a Sakata chip."
"2998"	"(2009-08-28 (18)) I was watching a movie. This guy went to this crashed plane to check for survivors. It was a rescue/emergency plane. The patient was totally dead and he discovered the pilot was too. I was there now and he gave me this video camera to work out how to get to some place. We walked along a path next to this cliff (not high). We ended up at some water with a rope hanging down off this high jetty. He climbed up easily, but I couldn't climb it. He easily pulled me up. We walked along the jetty and had to jump back in the water to get to the shore. I jumped in but got sucked all the way to the bottom (it was far). I started swimming up, but it was hard and I almost ran out of air, but got out. There was like a village nearby but there were no signs of life. I think we went into this building and everything was weird -- stuff was upside down or moving sideways. There were these different coloured blobs and different sections of the place had different gravity. We tried to get past without being touched. Ezra was there now. We got out of there but the blobs started chasing us. We were then running through Nana's house and down the hall and out the door. We ran to the park and the guy gave me a push so I would go faster and he told me to go there and wait. Ezra ran with me and there was a garage thing. We got into a car. The guy came and got in. Some bits of blob started growing out of the guy's ear and then it was a movie and there were lots of guys in the car. A guy cut the blob off because it wouldn't let them drive. Then they drove off. They got onto a street back in that village and there were lots of cars all parked along the road. We accidentally made stuff come to life and we ran into a shop. There were lots of other people in there. We and some kids had to hide under clothes racks. There was nowhere for me to hide so I went under this high bed near the front door and covered myself with this white sheet. The blobs were now aliens and I was thinking that the CGI was bad. Some girl fell in love with this black alien and when people complained about it she accused everyone of being racist. Then I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Jen were on a bed. She was a virgin and wanted to have sex and Dawson said that the first time should be ""with someone you love or at least... like a little"". They got into bed but didn't do anything. I was reading a magazine that had a 'where they are now'. I remember seeing Aidan Gillen and Alan Rickman there."
"2999"	"(2009-08-28 (18)) First it was a movie with Ben Mendelsohn, but then it was me, two guys and a girl. We went to this place which had been taken over by aliens and it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. We went there to infiltrate. We were welcomed by this lady and taken to a building with lots of storeys. We were all taken to separate floors, which I was annoyed about because I wanted either a friend or this guy I liked with me. There was a lady at the desk and the place was full of people. It was also dark as there were no lights. She gave me this thing that was a little bit bigger than a computer mouse to hold. It also went over the top of my hand and she started it up and it got tighter and then there was a little prick, which was going to alter me, but we had gone through stuff so that although we would change physically, we wouldn't be under their control mentally. I pretended to fall to the ground and sleep and they were happy that they had a human. I got up eventually and asked to visit my friend. I went to walk up the stairs and it was really dark. I saw glowing eyes and it was breathing heavily and I was like 'hello?' and it went after me -- it was a rhino. Everyone started running and I ran up the stairs and I got to a floor with a balcony outside a window. I jumped through the window and ran down the stairs. I climbed up a little tree and I thought it was going to break. The guy I liked was in a bigger tree near mine. The rhino eventually left and I got down. I found cards of everyone and the animal/thing they would turn into. It was based on either things like hair colour or shape of their face etc. Samantha had yellowish brown hair and she turned into a snake of the same colour. Dawson (Dawson's Creek) had one and his was a tree. Some of them were quite funny. I told one of my guy friends that I thought the girl had changed and was under their control."
"3000"	"(2009-08-29 (18)) I was at a cinema with Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and Ezra. Dawson accidentally tipped a pot of oil on the carpet. The lights showed where it had gone all over the stairs. Dad was really angry at Dawson about it. I said it wasn't his fault. We got cleaning supplies to clean it."
"3001"	"(2009-08-29 (18)) Some friends and I were in a building, but we were playing an online game. We had to clear the area with the mouse. Then we realized that the people had left and it was going to explode and I yelled ""duck!"" and fell to my stomach and then it exploded. I got up and everyone was ok. I was then at dads house and the fridge was in the kitchen where the breakfast bar is facing the dining room. Dad was moving out soon. I took Tigger and put her in a bag, which her sticking out over the top. I left the house and just outside there was a cat head on the ground. Ezra was there. It joined to the body and I was like 'what the hell just happened'. I can't remember it properly, but Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and his girlfriend were pregnant. He was busy somewhere and she and I were going to the hospital to get it induced. We took the bus there and she contacted Pacey (Dawson's Creek) to tell him to get there but he had forgotten. She sat in the seat in front of me next to some pregnant African woman. Sometimes it was Aliyah and she was pregnant and she said that she went to France and slept with her boyfriend. When we got there he was waiting outside though. Dawson also turned up as we walked in. His girlfriend was filling in forms to get in. Someone asked him ""what are you going to name her if it's a girl?"" and he said ""Samantha"". I said ""I'm sick of Samantha [as in the name] "" and I mentioned Samantha Mueller. Dawson looked really worried and was standing close to me. I was annoyed about the whole situation because I liked him. I was going to ask a friend of mine for their mobile numbers, thinking that I couldn't get them because in the 90's they didn't have mobiles so I couldn't get it from the show."
"3002"	"(2009-08-29 (18)) I was pregnant. I was in the car talking to Mom saying that I had been taking it easy so as not to go into early labour. I was getting a caesarian in like two weeks. Then it was time and I was at the hospital. I was asleep for it, but I remembered getting my stomach sliced open. I woke up and Mom and Austin were there. He mentioned to Mom about having an affair with me and I was like 'what the hell I never did that'. Mom said she would call Ezra. He came but then it was Jack (Dawson's Creek). He had been asleep and was the father, or so I assumed. I had given birth to a girl by the way. Ezra came with lollies. Amelia was on the floor and he was handing out lollies and reluctantly threw a lolly at her. I thought it was funny and she ate it. He threw orange snakes at her and she just kept eating them. At first she was like smiling but then she seemed to be getting worried."
"3003"	"(2009-08-30 (18)) It was a movie then it was real. I was at a house near a big window (like the room was just made of windows). A teacher and some kids came past and told me not to worry but there was a hog on the loose and I saw it standing behind them and I said ""yeah it's behind you"". I ran away from the window and it came to the window. Ezra was then there with me and we locked ourselves in the bedroom and tried to work out how to escape. We called Ms Edmundson because she knew how to get rid of it. Sometimes she was Nana. She got us out and we ran across an oval to get to this huge building which was like a motel/house/thing. It was then Dawson and Joey (both from Dawson's Creek). They got in and they had some sort of supernatural powers. Bad guys wanted to get in and they walked past people waiting for an invitation in. This girl grabbed this guy's hand and went in. Someone sprinkled cinnamon on them to get a spell off. The guy went inside and this other guy made out with an invisible girl. Two guys were also making out. Outside in a forest, Dawson and Pacey (Dawson's Creek) were talking. Pacey and Jen (Dawson's Creek) suggested having sex and Dawson took it as an insult because he couldn't go through with it. Pacey said ""I wish I waited"" and I wondered if he meant for Joey or Andie. Then I assumed he meant wet dreams and he said they were just kids. Then there was some husband and wife and one of them said ""I'm still a virgin""."
"3004"	"(2009-09-01 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek and Dawson and Joey were friendly again. I think they got back together. Someone killed a pet or a person and Pacey had blood on him. He wanted to talk to Joey and went to her but couldn't tell her. Dawson was talking to an old friend. It was then late and I was with Mom and Ezra. I realized it was only 10pm. We needed to get in Dad's house and we were saying that we should just wake him up. We went to a bed and breakfast and they joked they had ""no bed"". Dad was then there and they played a song."
"3005"	"(2009-09-01 (18)) A few days ago I watched half of this movie that had Joshua Jackson in it. Then it was today and I watched the rest of it. At the end he had turned fat and this girl had turned skinny. Everyone fell to their stomach. Some people melted because it was hot. I was watching it with Dad. There was a battle between Joshua Jackson's character (who was not him now) and Maryann (True Blood). It was in like an elevator. She did something with air and fizzy water and she said she was ""a water Pokemon"". He attacked her for a while but she was fine and attacked him and he got owned. He brought comic book characters out to help, one of them was Batman. In real life I was then at home and Joshua Jackson or his character was there. Some friends turned crazy and tried to kill us. We locked them outside and we ran next door. We knocked and they let us in. There were lots of people there all lazing about. A guy was on the phone. A friend and I picked up the other phone and were listening to his conversation. He was talking to a guy and it sounded like they were in a relationship."
"3006"	"(2009-09-02 (18)) I was at Mom's which was different. Farrah was over and she was young and weird. She went into the fridge and I closed the door. Mom and Darren were doing drugs on the table right next to her. I pulled her away so she wouldn't see and she wanted to play with my 'toys'."
"3007"	"(2009-09-02 (18)) I was at a shop and got a haircut. I left there and went to another shop and this lady told me that there was a job for a statistics person near a video shop/cinema. I had to this strange online quiz thing. There was like a bush scene and I had to press a button when certain people popped up (like a shooting range). I clicked the wrong person and I tried to restart it but it was too hard and I left. There was a black cop/security guard for the video shop and he had accused me of stealing chips before. Then there were zombies. I was with a bunch of people including Dawson, Joey and Jack (all from Dawson's Creek). I can't remember the beginning but we were in a bathroom. There was a zombie tied up. For some reason we all decided to have a smoke. Joey and I went into the shower and I took a puff of the smoke and I didn't choke or cough. The cop came and told us off and made us leave. As he told us off, the others took off into a stairwell and I followed them. I then realized they had run off because zombies were coming so I thought it was lucky that I had followed them. We were in like an underground carpark before we got to the stairwell. I was running really fast up the stairs and then I noticed that everyone had stopped and I realized there were heaps of zombies coming down the stairs. We ran through a door on that level and there was another stairwell across the room. We started running towards it and there were lots of zombies in the way. They were all doing different things, like one was doing the dance from 'Thriller' and other things from the game, Plants vs. Zombies. We started climbing up this thing on the wall. We had to move across it to get out. I was holding onto this small unstable bit hanging out of the wall. Underneath us were lots of zombies and they were reaching up to us. We complained and Jen (Dawson's Creek) got angry because she had the hardest job and she went across to the end, using up all the good spots (which fell off after being used), but I went across. I got to the end and the key was like a contact lens and I dropped it in the crowd of zombies. Dawson and Jack somehow managed to wipe out the whole room. I jumped down and it was much easier to get everything done. I was covered in blood and started wiping it on Dawson's back, which he let me do and we joked about it. He offered to someone there to join our group and said he had ""nine contacts"", such as a weapons dealer."
"3008"	"(2009-09-02 (18)) I was in a deli with Mom, Darren, Neil Flynn and others. There were quite a few people in there and lots of weird/cool stuff, such as lots of squishy things like a rat and those balls with the wiggly bits. Neil Flynn was joking around and pretending to be like Frankenstein's monster. At one point, Ezra, Dad and I were talking about Jurassic Park Dad said to Ezra that if he didn't remember it he had to see it again. I was watching a bit of it and James Van Der Beek was in it and he was talking to someone and I was thinking that I didn't remember him being in it, then the camera turned and Kerr Smith was the one talking to him and I said ""And Jack!"" and Ezra questioned me and I said ""the gay dude"". Then we were actually at a huge shop and there were also shops outside. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Robert Downey Jr. were also with us. I was also going out with Eugene and having an affair with Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Robert Downey Jr. Then Mom and I were looking for a friend of Mom's. I went into this deli which had lots of chocolate things. It had a restaurant connected to the left of it. A song was playing and I realized it was 'Theme from a Summer Place'. There were some gay guys in dresses sitting at a table. There were lots of people there. On the other side was an outside area where there was a concert or a sports game going on. I was with Mom again and I asked ""where are RDJ and JDM?"" We went into the proper shop and Mom's friend had contacted her saying she was in ""Fontaine's"", which was an extremely fancy clothes shop. We were walking towards and this lady walked towards us and said we couldn't go in because of what we were wearing. Mom walked off through this corridor and I chased after her because we weren't allowed in there -- it led into the fancy area. A security guard saw us and we got out before he came to us. Later I was doing an experiment and I poured a solution into a test tube and it turned pink. I did it three times but did it wrong every time. Mom helped me. I then realized we were using a cobalt solution which was wrong."
"3009"	"(2009-09-03 (18)) I was watching a movie and it told the same story from six (or so) different point of views. There was a bomb in the building. The first one was like The X-Files, but I only remember Scully. She was in a small office room and her and some others were questioning someone. The guy with the video camera handed it to this other guy and said ""can you see anything?"" and this other guy said ""he's got a camera"" and then he shot him. Scully saw and realized the cameras were guns. They wrestled the guy for it and he shot the 'bomb' before they grabbed him. The guy in charge came in and it was Joshua Jackson but he was young. I was thinking that he was turning up everywhere lately. Then the point of view was of a young couple. The alarm was going off and they split up and the girl started running down the stairs in a stairwell but now it was me. I ran out at the basement level and this guy was directing everyone outside. It was raining. We were standing in front of the building and there was a window on an upper floor with some people just sitting and watching. One of them was James Van Der Beek and I was like 'more people from Dawson's Creek!'. It was cold and I had shorts on and was soaked. There were people still running out and I saw Eugene and Bradley. Eugene had longer hair and he was wet too. I then thought that I was at State University. When they were 'satisfied' this bubble went over the top and covered us so we didn't get rained on. We had to sit down. I sat down near Terrence and Gavin came along and sat next to him, then this other guy came and we moved to fit him in. Then Emery came and we had to move again. Then I was at home and he was staying over. I was sitting with him and Ezra in a bedroom and he had these dildos on the bed. One was purple and Ezra hit me in the head with one. Then I was on the floor watching TV. I saw an ad for Dawson's Creek with Pacey talking to Jen. I clapped excitedly. Then there was an ad for the movie that previously played out and it had a long name."
"3010"	"(2009-09-04 (18)) I was telling Mom about Freaks and Geeks and how Lindsay was one of two female characters I liked in any TV show/movie. The second one was on another show and was also played Linda Cardellini. I had never noticed before. I think Raquel was there too."
"3011"	"(2009-09-04 (18)) Mom and I went to a shop. There was a light yellow dress and it was really gross. There were ugly jumpers. There were some flowery shirts and Mom asked why I didn't wear something more presentable, such as the flowery shirts. I said ""Do you know, every shirt you like has flowers?"" A friend of hers got a genie with unlimited wishes. There were magazines and books about Twilight nearby. Mom's friend wanted me to look in the magazines to find out how Katie Holmes' did her hair. Mom's friend spilled something and summoned the genie to clean it up. I was talking to it and said that my guess is that most people wish for the ""person they like, money and beauty"". Then I was trying to get off the train but it didn't stay open for very long. I got out and I was inside and had to walk up an escalator but I went the wrong way and had to go down and walk back again."
"3012"	"(2009-09-04 (18)) Dawson (Dawson's Creek) was worried that he wasn't going to get into college. He applied for some school and he had to write an essay about Elvis Presley. He got accepted by it but decided not to go."
"3013"	"(2009-09-05 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Joey were on a school trip and were at a small motel. They were sharing a bed with their parents. Dawson decided to sneak off and go to this pool party. Joey didn't. The teachers found out and went to look for them. Dawson's mother helped look. They were in a small room with a little pool. Later, Dawson and Joey came back there. The light was dim and Joey called it a ""dinner light"". She said she had turned some other lights down like that. Dawson's put his hands on it to turn it off and it went bright, but when he took his hands off it went dim again. It wouldn't turn off, so Joey tried it but it did the same thing. Then the room changed or something and it was really scary and felt cold and horrible. Sometimes I was there. I can't remember what happened properly but these strange things kept happening. One that I do remember was that there was a small table and two people were making out on it then we realized it was Dawson and Joey (another set) and Jen was now there and she yelled at them to make them stop. They ignored her and took their clothes off, had sex and then put their clothes on. They then aged and were now old people and the real Dawson or Joey said ""how does this night end?"" and the old Joey said to the old Dawson ""I love you"". Also, the real Dawson and Joey had a partner and they were both in the room too. Then the old couple got into bed. I was then on a drive with Mom. We got out of the car and it was night and in a suburb and everything looked weird, but it was subtle. I looked at the road and it was on a funny angle. Then I was in a pool and there was a pool toy boat. I picked it up and hit it down on the water and changed to this flat thing and then it changed again. It was creepy. Then Dad was in there. The weird stuff that had been happening everywhere had now happened in a music video, which reminded me of the suicide scene in The Rules of Attraction [note: I watched it last night] . Dad said that he thought all music videos would be understood by Ezra now. I said that that music video was the creepiest thing I'd ever seen. I realized I was naked in the pool. Creepy stuff was still happening in there. I was in that small room later and a girlfriend or something of Dawson's came in and she tried to burn some of my dreams. In one of them I had had sex with Dawson. I snatched them off her and so she set my jumper that I was wearing on fire. The fire looked weird. Jack (Dawson's Creek) was there and he helped me get it off but then she came back in and started pouring petrol over the floor and I cried and screamed at her to stop and attacked her. She was a celebrity, but I don't remember who. I can't remember how we stopped her, but we did."
"3014"	"(2009-09-05 (18)) I was in a car with Ezra. It was night. He was in the passenger seat and I was in the back behind the driver's seat. He had it driving on 'autopilot' and a turn came up and I jumped in the driver's seat and tried to steer it but it was hard and I went all over the road (we were on Wanneroo Road, just before Northlands). I saw cop lights behind us and I managed to pull over. I quickly got back in the back seat. The policeman came to the window and I explained that the autodrive was driving and it went out of control and he was like 'I understand but I still have to do something about it'. I said that we can't drive and had to get somewhere and he was like ""Oh well, that's easy"" and said that since November people without a licence couldn't use autodrive and I was like 'What I didn't know that!' He seemed like a nice guy and seemed to like me. He went to this place to get it removed and so there was no record of anything happening. Later we went to Dad's house. Jakob came too and was friends with Ezra. I looked in the cupboard for food and there were a few packets of M&M's but they had all expired in 2005. There were some lamingtons too. Ezra said he preferred movies to TV shows and I said I preferred TV shows at the moment. Jakob said he hated them but he had watched a DIY one."
"3015"	"(2009-09-06 (18)) Mark Wahlberg's character from Boogie Nights was dating this girl and her family was annoyed about it [note: I watched the first half of it last night] . It was in the olden days. Then one night they had sex. The next morning he seemed bored with her and she was with him in the kitchen. Her siblings picked up on something different and said they thought she had had sex. He said she wanted to do it again and her siblings told him that she was actually only 16 and lied about her 'papers'. He said he had to go if that was the case, but then the mother went to the daughter's room to check on her and heard sex noises. Then I was outside somewhere with Mom, Dad, Ezra and Nana. It was night and we were on the way to Dad's new place. It was really far away. He wanted a room mate. Some witch/psychic predicted Mom's future. One time she put a spell on us so we could control these car placements. Then all females had numbers on their tongues. First it was letters and mine was an 'F'. You couldn't see it unless you put a certain light on it. Then there was a video Mark Wahlberg's girlfriend from before had 23 on her tongue and he had '3' (girls now had two numbers, guys had one). These people came to kill him. I watched Dawson's Creek later."
"3016"	"(2009-09-06 (18)) I was watching a movie. It was like a documentary sometimes. This young guy (like 12) was at a shop. He ended p trying to help this teenage girl and her young brother from their father, who was violent. He went to their house and was now Heather Graham. I joked to the guy they should have sex on the 'squeaky couch'. The kids were like 'ew'. She was now the boy again. We went to leave and they got in the way. The daughter went to the father and then the kid realized it had been a set up so the father could rape him. I read the end of some book and asked someone if they had seen the movie yet and they said it wasn't out until next month. I was then at the cinema with Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and Pacey (Dawson's Creek) came."
"3017"	"(2009-09-06 (18)) Mom's house was weird. There were lots of different sets of stairs and there were no walls on the rooms. It was only temporary. Ezra's room was near mine and we heard this noise, but it was just a cat. We then ended up in an alternate universe or something. Some stuff came through with us and it had this thin black tape (it was like film from a video tape) hanging off it. This guy helped me to move my bookshelf which had come through but the piece of black film was attached to another shelf thing which had to be carried with it. I thought that if it ripped it would disappear. Some people there got suspicious of us and so I told Ezra to pull the fire alarm. A friend of mine was there and I told him to grab some of my dream books and put them somewhere safe and he did. I hid under a desk and the water started pouring down. Everyone, except a few people, ran out. Ezra and I finished moving the shelf. I mentioned the word 'movie' to someone and they didn't know what a movie was. Later, I was watching a movie that had Michelle Williams in it. At the end she got together with this guy and said ""Oh I'm a Virgo aren't I?"" and giggled and I said 'I was going to say that' (it was a reference to something that had happened earlier in the movie)."
"3018"	"(2009-09-07 (18)) Nana and Poppa cleaned our house with Fluorine. It did stuff to your teeth if it got in your mouth. I used it for a bit and then my teeth started hurting. It felt like my teeth were covered in like that crackle stuff but lots of it and it hurt really bad if I bit down. I couldn't talk properly. I rinsed my mouth with water but it was still there. Later, I was ok and I was in the back room sitting on the floor holding a small baby. It was quiet and kept staring at me. It started to pee on my arm and I threw it onto the ground. It was now a black kitten and it started running around the room and I said that the baby was like a kitten. I called it 'Lily' [note: In Dawson's Creek they had a baby called Lily] . I told Mom to close the back door, but she didn't and it ran outside. I chased it and caught it and brought it back in."
"3019"	"(2009-09-07 (18)) I started working at this takeaway place. First it was inside and one day I 'floated'. But now, everyone could float (we just sort of hovered in the air). I was saying that it happened a month after I floated. Then the place was like a wagon outside. I asked this lady where to sign in and she told me to go to the office, which was a huge shed/warehouse thing. Elijah was there along with some others that I knew. This chubby Asian lady said something weird and Elijah and I were giggling. He was kind of hot. I went to the office. There was a swamp in it with crocodiles. There was a really hot guy there whose name was Joe. I went in there, I think at some other time, and I took this book which had everyone's names. His name was Joe Jayone and he was born in 1985. I saw two school bags lying about and I realized he was a killer and I saw him throw them into the water for the crocodiles. There was like a rope and when he left, I swung past and tried to save them but I couldn't. He was coming back and I was with some friends now and we went to hide. I didn't hide in time and he saw me. Somehow I got away from there and I was now at a park at night. He had chased me there and we had a struggle for a bit and I managed to get him on the ground and I was sitting on him trying to stop him. He kissed me and then rolled me over so he was on top of me and we had sex. When it finished, Ezra came and I pushed him off me. He got arrested later. I read on a profile of him that he had killed lots of people. I was in the car with Mom and Ezra going to the movies. Mom said that it was my ""first clean fuck"". Leroy was then outside the car and he wanted to come along and he had lots of USB's. I was then watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson married this rich girl and he was on a farm and they had lots of land. The others annoyed him about it."
"3020"	"(2009-09-09 (18)) Andie (Dawson's Creek) was going up an escalator. People were stopping random people to ask questions. The first one they asked Andie, the answer was 'no'. They asked her if she had a problem with sex and she was now Joey and she said ""I've only had sex twice and used a condom twice"". They continued asking sex questions and she got annoyed and said ""Do you want to know their names so you can make sure I'm not lying -- Pacey Witter,"". I was then at a shop. They had this chocolate with mint cream and it had 14g of fat. Ezra was there. This girl said she would give me money to swear and eat one, or to kiss her and eat one. I said that ""swearing makes me feel like I'm taking my clothes off"" and James Van Der Beek was there and said ""or you can do that"" and we laughed."
"3021"	"(2009-09-09 (18)) I was watching Lost. They had a way of killing off characters -- they would show them and then it would fade out (with white). They killed off Ben and I was annoyed about it and told Ezra. I accidentally read that Kate died. Then Mom and I were in Venice or something. We were at a shop and at this little shop which sold jeans. I said ""I don't want girls ones"". This security guard guy there laughed. We didn't know how to get to the main area of Venice. There was a big body of water outside the shop. Some guy shrunk and jumped in, but it was from my point of view. He was extremely tiny and held onto a normal sized inflatable ring so he didn't sink. It took a long time to hit the water, which caused a lot of water to splash up. I was watching Dawson's Creek at one point and I realized I thought Jack was hot. I was annoyed about this and I started cutting out a picture of him to put in my presentation. I wondered whether I should update my top 10 for this month, but I didn't want James Van Der Beek to lose the top spot. Then I was watching True Blood. Some bad vampires were after Bill. Eric and some other good vampires were with him. Something had happened and they could now go out in the sun but it made them tired and like really badly sunburnt. They had been chasing them for days, walking through this rocky place. The bad vampires eventually tired and decided to sleep. The good ones coincidentally decided to do this too. Eric just 'fell' into the ground to sleep. Then somewhere else there were two graves on a hill near a house. Some girl said her boyfriend was still alive and everyone thought she was crazy/in denial but he was actually a vampire. The graves were empty underneath the top layer and then there was a wolf skin on top of some wood and then a big area for them to sleep in. I can't remember properly, but the guy wanted to get rid of the girl, I think."
"3022"	"(2009-09-10 (18)) There was some food somewhere (like a dinner or something was going on). Eugene's father Abraham was there and I was thinking that maybe I could find out what his name was. I was looking at Eugene's Facebook page. He was coming over now too and I had Dawson's Creek as my wallpaper, although I only remember seeing Dawson clearly. I thought maybe I should change it incase he saw it. We were now at Nana's. I went inside and Emery was on a lounge in the lounge room. Dad and I were going to go scuba diving or something. We were going across the water to get to the place and there were waves. This girl said that the instructor was ""really cute"". We got across and then we had to walk along next to this wall. The waves came up and so we had to hold this rail so we didn't get pulled away. We went into a restaurant. This foreign guy sat us at a table and brought us food. I was thinking that the waves were too strong so we were going to have to do it another day. We went to a school another day and Dad had gone there to talk to the principal. I was friends with him."
"3023"	"(2009-09-11 (18)) I had this vampire guy as a friend. He was young. He was saying that he was gay and he had had a crush on James Van Der Beek when he was young, but he was born in 1948. He said he wrote him letters that he didn't send and had material that was ""not repeatable"". Then it was True Blood. Bill and Sookie were in bed together. We were at Granma's house but it was different. I needed a tissue and I asked her for one and she gave me these small squares of tissue. She wasn't happy about vampires. Uncle Gabriel walked in the room as I was closing the door on the other side, but left when he realized we were going to bed. Sookie and Bill were now other people and he wouldn't suck her blood but she wanted him too. There was some jam stuff you could eat which did something to do the blood (I think it produced more). There was this new thing out where a van would park in a carpark and encourage people to exercise. There was a meeting there one day and there lots of people doing stretches. One guy there had a heart condition."
"3024"	"(2009-09-11 (18)) I was watching True Blood. The town was still crazy but it was different. There were some young kids (like under 10) giving out death sentences. They gave one to a friend of theirs, who pleaded with them but they just showed no emotion (I think they were under the control of something). Sam and Jason met up outside somewhere and it zoomed in on Sam's mouth, which was in an open smile and then he turned into a rat. Jason did too and had only acquired this power recently and was still confused about it. Then it showed them naked on lying on the ground talking to each other. Then it went to some kids and they saw something and one of them said ""ooh look at that"" and then it showed an injured pig lying at the bottom of a hill. It was making squealing noises. It was actually Maryann and I said ""Maryann got raped!"". I wondered why she wasn't in her human form."
"3025"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson was going out with some girl, but asked Jen to the prom. At first he was Pacey and the others teased him for going alone, but then he was Dawson."
"3026"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) I was watching a movie. There was a couple and they had a kid when she was 19. It was a cartoon sometimes.  There was a flashback and the guy was like 'trailer trash'. He said he hoped she was going to run off to college and she said she was but she got pregnant and didn't. She was then at a party which a guy who looked like a young Anthony Perkins, who was her 'rich' date. She left him for the poor guy. When she was older she slept with some guy and the guy and her daughter caught her."
"3027"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and I were going out. We were in this hotel/motel place and there was a small competition. There were 6 files and 4 of them were winners and you won a weekend (or so) in a spiffy room there. Pacey entered and was given a file. It was full of paper and if they all had stuff written on them then it was a winner. We lost, so he bought another one. He was then Ezra. He went to the toilet with it and then came out and said it was a winner and showed us a filled out page. I opened it to have a look and saw that the rest of it was empty, so we had lost again. He was now Pacey again. The guy running the competition was someone we knew. We asked him for another one and he gave did. Then I was at a table and Pacey and I were eating all of this pie (it was a dessert-y one cut up in slices). Then Dawson and Joey (both Dawson's Creek) were staying in the hotel room and it had a spa. Later we were somewhere else. Charlie (Dawson's Creek) could tell the future. Years ago he had said that Dawson and Jen weren't right for each other. He now had this small purple ball which predicted things. I asked him if he was the same guy who had predicted colour pictures over black and white pictures and he said he was. He got Dawson to throw the ball, which would go to 'his future'. It went to me. I was on a roof type of thing and was next to them, and when he threw it in front of him it turned around and came back to me. I kept throwing it away and it kept coming back. Then I was in some water and there was a weird looking black and white cat standing nearby. Jen came to me and said she was thinking that she and Dawson needed to break up. I asked why and she mentioned the spa in the hotel room (which had now been shared by me and Dawson). I said ""he spent more time with Turk [Scrubs] than me!"". She was relieved but still wanted to leave Dawson. She was later sitting on a ledge near the water and someone threw the ball which hit her in the back and made her fall into the water. Jen finally told Dawson she wanted to leave him. We were then in a room. I asked Charlie about his future and he said he didn't want to know but I threw the ball to find out anyway and it went to Joey who was standing outside, talking to some guy. It floated near her crutch and she tried to subtly push it away but it kept coming back. We laughed. Then she was actually standing out there with Charlie and Dawson said she would do this shoulder shrug as she walked away (which meant she was attracted to him) and she did. Then I was at Nana's. I was in the lounge room with Dad and Ezra. It was smaller. I was reading a book which had stuff about Stephen King and there was a smoking quiz. One of the questions was about why smoking was more relaxing at some point and the answer was because it meant that the bills were paid. We were watching something on TV and this woman died which looked like Kristine Sutherland and I said ""what is this, Buffy's mother?"". Dad said no it was her (one of the characters') daughter. But then it was real and Ezra wondered if they would get rid of the body now and I said, sarcastically, ""no they're going to keep her here a few more days to keep her fresh""."
"3028"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) I was going out with Eugene. We went to a cinema and were watching 'Goosebumps' movies. We left one and went into another. There was a row at the back of only four seats and a guy sitting on the end. Eugene walked past him and sat at the end and I sat next to him. I lifted the arm rest up and moved closer to him. He kissed me. I moved away worried that I would squish him and he put his hand on my thigh and asked why I moved away, so I told him. He wanted me closer so I moved back and then we watched the movie. It was already like halfway in and this girl was in a car which had just crashed into the water and she was being bothered by ghosts or something. All of a sudden it went weird and the sound was loud and lots of stuff started happening on the screen. I noticed that everyone in the cinema looked bored. The guy at the end of the row next to us was like staring at us which a creepy blank expression. I pointed out the weird behaviour to Eugene. Other people were slowly eating popcorn and no-one seemed to actually be 'there'. He said we should get out of here so we climbed over the seats in front of us (as that row was empty) and walked out. To the left of us was the hall which led to other cinemas and it was dark. We went right and we were scared and sort of panicky. There was a doorway and when we walked through that, to the left was a brick wall, so we went right, which led down a small hall to the lobby. Nobody else was around. We walked outside. Lots of buses came past. I wondered whether to call Mom to get us or to catch a bus. One bus stopped and the driver asked us if we needed help. He said he needed to find some ""woods"". He got out and I asked if he went past Centerville and he said he did. Then he asked if we knew where ""KFC airport"" was and we didn't. The bus then started going down the street (which was on a slight downward hill). The guy turned around and noticed it was gone. It turned back around and was heading right for me. I started running to get away from it. I ran down to where it had come from and went behind a parked bus but it kept turning and trying to get me, but then it stopped. Then the guy from the cinema, who was now Robert Pattinson, was there saying that I ruined his life and ""I can't live without you"" and so was going to kill me. He was throwing small sticks at me. I grabbed this thick branch and threw it at him while backing away but it just landed at his feet. He called me Sasha (but pronounced it 'Sarsha', like posh people do). Eugene was also getting bothered by some girl. She started tying him up in this net. They were in the middle of the road. I picked up this long sturdy stick to attack Robert Pattinson with, but then I saw a bus coming down the road and I pushed the girl out of the way and put the stick through a hole in the net and pulled Eugene to the side of the road and the bus just missed him."
"3029"	"(2009-09-13 (18)) I was at university and it was night. I went into this shop to leave and Matilda and some guy were in there playing with a ball (sometimes they were aliens). I went to walk out one door and Matilda said to go through this other door (which would be quicker). I said that it was always locked and so went through another one. The problem with this door is that it led out onto a long path and some steps and there were no lights. People got attacked all the time on it. I text Mom to come to the back to get me and to text me when she got there. I saw Sherilynn Fenn wave at me from a window, which I assumed meant that it was safe and so started along. I was later reading something on IMDb about Dawson's Creek and whether they thought Dawson was a good filmmaker. They gave Pacey a rating of 40% on filmmaking. There was an episode where Dawson walked in on Pacey masturbating to his own sex tape. I can't remember which girl it was though."
"3030"	"(2009-09-13 (18)) I was at Nana's. It was someone's birthday. I went to walk into the dining room and I heard a movie playing that sounded like someone masturbating. Poppa came around the corner and told me to get out of the room. I went to the lounge and there was nowhere to sit and I kept wandering back into the dining room, so I ended up just sitting on the floor of the lounge room. Uncle Wilbur came out of the dining room saying ""what the hell?"". Dad and Ezra were sitting in the lounge too. I text Mom to pick me up and then she was there. She and Dad were standing close and their hands were touching slightly. I checked my phone for a reply from her and she had sent me one a few minutes before she had arrived. I couldn't find my water bottle. I looked everywhere and I found a full cold one but then I saw my one on top of the car. It was pretty much empty. Clayton was in the front seat and I told him to get into the back."
"3031"	"(2009-09-14 (18)) I was watching a movie about a girl who was getting stalked by demons or something (like Drag Me to Hell). She thought she'd got rid of it and she got pregnant. One day it came back and it wanted her baby (she was now pregnant with another one) and she was like 'no, don't take my baby!' but it like, flew into her stomach and ripped it out. Then Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and I were looking for it. We asked a friend of ours to check for similar occurrences such as ""weather patterns"". This guy had this puzzle where you had to get rid of this imprint. He said if I did one I would get a prize and I did it. This girl was talking about 'endocrine' and I said I knew it what it meant and that I wanted to be a vet because ""I like animals. The only other things I like are movies and video games"". She said ""vets don't get paid that much"". Then I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson, Joey and Pacey were at this farm thing. Joey had a full break up with Dawson. He broke down, crying saying ""I love you, I need you, I can't live without you! Oh God!"" and fell on the ground crying. Pacey comforted him. Then these people wanted to get photos of them and Dawson walked up, like nothing had happened and said ""hey guys"". Then it was the next morning and they had all been drinking all night. Pacey joked about it, but then they found out someone had died. I wondered where Jack was. This guy told us to say something to warn him because he was going to die. He liked swearing? Then it was his wife and she collapsed from a heart attack. The guy kissed her and it resurrected her."
"3032"	"(2009-09-14 (18)) I was watching Supernatural. This girl was looking for Sam because she wanted to get a photo. I wondered where Dean was."
"3033"	"(2009-09-14 (18)) Pacey (Dawson's Creek) was with some animals. They joined a group. They drove up in some underground area with water. These other animals killed everyone they could and then we ran (me too) and we jumped underwater. I then took a bus to the shop down the road. It got $30 to get there and I had $108 on my SmartRider. The shop was different and the lady there didn't like me. I called Mom and the lady yelled at me about gambling. They had a notepad thing I wanted to get for my dreams. This other time I went there and it was night. We were in the clothes section and the lady was being nice. There was a board on the wall that mentioned Calvin and I having done something. My Little Lady was playing and I said 'I like this song!'."
"3034"	"(2009-09-15 (18)) Charlie from Fringe and a girl friend of his were in a building and there were these long poles that you attached to at one end and you could stay up high. They were both single and they ended up kissing and realized they liked each other, but then all these people came in."
"3035"	"(2009-09-15 (18)) Calvin, Ezra and I were somewhere. Muse were on stage and we were with them as they got ready and then they let us stand near the stage when they played."
"3036"	"(2009-09-15 (18)) I was in a car with Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and it was night. We were in this cornfield place and it was foggy. We were looking for proof of something and it made me do something without thinking. We got out and there was a construction site nearby. We heard a baby crying and then people came looking for the baby. I picked up some stuff and found a lady and she had been making the noises so people would find her. We went back to the cornfield and Mom said that Raquel had been in lots of advertisements lately and I said I had seen her saying something about that on Facebook. I was on my computer later and Ten O'Clock Postman only had like 60 plays."
"3037"	"(2009-09-16 (18)) Eugene and I had a baby girl. I was thinking her name was Chantelle but realized that I hated the name and thought it was Isobel, but I hated that too. Then I thought it ended with an 'a' and said ""Diana? No, that's too old"". I went to university and Eugene worked part time at night and looked after the baby. Mom also went to university and she was ready to leave. I was annoyed because I had to wait for Eugene before I could leave and I didn't want to look after the baby. Ezra told Mom that he had lots of dreams collected now."
"3038"	"(2009-09-16 (18)) Ezra and I stayed at Granny's. It was Christmas the next day. We were cleaning some dirty cutlery. The next morning she gave me a math revision package, but it was all really easy stuff. The first question had a 4x4 square and people standing on the edge of each small square and you had to work out what number went in each square depending on how many body parts were touching each one. Some had their arm, hand or something else. Some Girls was playing."
"3039"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) Dad had downloaded a bunch of educational stuff. He and Ezra were going to read it all. They started with human biology and I said ""you'll know everything I know"". Later I was at home and Ezra came into my room. I had Tigger. He pulled my door to when he left. I said 'thanks' and he looked shocked and then said something polite in return."
"3040"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at the shop getting an almond magnum out of the freezer. At first I checked the fat content of the cookies and cream one. Mom was lifting me into the freezer (I was almost all the way upside down reaching in). My shirt started falling up and there were some guys nearby and so I tried to keep it down. This guy pointed out an acid spill on the floor. We went to the lolly section and I wanted to get some. It was self serve like. I ate some of my ice-cream. When we were leaving I opened a packet of lamingtons. We went to the checkout and then it was like a game. I was in a multistory like hotel but each room had things like poker games going on. No-one was really around and there were some aliens. I kept getting chased out and kept not getting out in time. Then one of the times I got out just in time. To get out though you had to go through the proper checkout and if you didn't you had to go through those rotating metal things. I crawled along the ground and took a photo. Later Mom and I were in a car driving down Beach Road. This cop and a girl were on a motorbike and the cop was trying to make her get this ball and kick it on the grass (so she could arrest her and get a blood sample). She wouldn't do it and said she would only give information to help. The cop slowed us down and then she arrested her."
"3041"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Audrey and Pacey broke up. He went to some island/boat with a friend and he was happy that he was away from Audrey, but his friend brought her there and they were happy anyway."
"3042"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at the shops and it was night. Mom went in and this guy was being dodgy and we locked the doors. He went to the back and tried to open the door. He waited and then got in when Mom came. He told us to do stuff for him. Then it was True Blood. Bill and Sookie, though not at first, went somewhere. She didn't know he was a vampire and he was old. She worked it out though. I was then there and I was looking for a room and I found one without a bed. Jeffrey Donovan's Twitter was talking about Burn Notice and something about having a lifetime of a ""sucky career""."
"3043"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at Nana's. I was walking past the family room and I saw Marmaduke standing out the front. I went out there and some others had seen him too. We were then in a room and we were watching a movie or TV show and he was then sitting next to us, but only Poppa and I could see him. Fido came up to us. I told Ezra that it was all probably due to an ""alternate reality""."
"3044"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at home but it was different. I looked out the window and the buildings looked weird. Mom and I went to look. It was night. We walked near it and there was smoke. Firemen and lots of people were crowded around. Mom asked if any help was needed and they said yes and she was like ""oh I was just kidding"" but grabbed a hose and started to help put the fire out. I had no shoes on. This guy fell asleep or something and his hose started going everywhere so I grabbed it to take control of it. Then there was a loud roar and I said ""Cloverfield!"". We ran back home. I turned back around at one point and I could see downtown and all the buildings were on fire and smoky and destroyed. We got home and I packed up my laptop to put it somewhere safe and then we left. I asked Mom why we weren't taking the car and she said it would be quicker to leave if the monster showed up. I saw downtown again and all the buildings were collapsed in a pile. There was smoke and fire still and there was a bridge half collapsed next to it. I was shocked by it. I was then in a car with Eugene and Pacey (Dawson's Creek). We drove over a bridge and I realized that downtown was now back to normal. Pacey turned around to look and we assumed it was fake. It was now day and it was cloudy. There was a helicopter flying around. He decided to find Audrey (Dawson's Creek) who was downtown. I think he made us walk and I was by myself now. Then I was in some flying vehicle. I dropped out at this ""lip island"" which I think was the center of the universe and was in the water. I dropped into the water next to it. I had my phone and SmartRider in my pocket. I dropped my SmartRider in the water and I couldn't grab it in time and it started to sink. I watched it sink and I felt that nothing could be normal again. I held onto the middle of it and started taking photos of it with my phone. The lip was now in the shape of Pacey and the photos were turning out with Joey, Dawson and others. We all went into it. It looked like Ikea or something and was kid like. It was colourful and there were other people there. There was a dopey girl and she said they would hide under the lounge. Then Pacey was back and was cooking. He saw Joey and kissed her and took her into a room."
"3045"	"(2009-09-18 (18)) I was talking to Dad. We went past a takeaway place and a lady served us and she knew him. He ordered 8 of some chicken thing. He said she got angry at him the other day and made him eat cold chicken things. I told him about this guy playing Rock Band and said that I put a link on Facebook and to go to 2.30 minutes and he said he just looked at it now. He couldn't get to it because it had been deleted or there was maintenance."
"3046"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) There was a new Quentin Tarantino movie with John Travolta and Uma Thurman. In real life, John Travolta was pregnant with Katie Holmes (like, he was the one that was pregnant). Most of the movie consisted of them on the bed, so the scenes with his belly showing were filmed after he gave birth. The dialogue was really lame. In real life there was a door or something that led to 'Hollywood'. I walked through and Katie Holmes was on a step (it was actually Britney Spears though). I said hi and she didn't say anything. She had a few kids following behind her. There were heaps of people around. I said ""what's up?"" to someone and they (or someone) said ""you seem shy"". I don't remember who, but someone said ""I don't know anything about her, but just got [invited? It's hard to read] to her house"". It was next to the entrance and I thought that Kerr Smith was supposed to live there. Then I saw him walking towards the house. He looked like he did in season 5 of Dawson's Creek. I said ""sup?"" and he gave me a high five. We were friends and had gone on holidays together. Jack, Dawson and Joey (all from Dawson's Creek) were sitting on a bench and there was a space between Dawson and Joey. I said that we (Jack/Kerr and I) weren't good enough friends for an excited high five. I put my hands up to Dawson and he grinned and did a double high five (crossing our hands over), pretending to be excited. We laughed and I was thinking that his smile was adorable. I sat between he and Joey and he jokingly moved away so I moved towards Joey and then we both moved back at the same time. There was a 'flash' of us sleeping next to each other and we were in the same position. I was then in a car with Mom and Ezra and we were talking about The Beatles and I said that I was sick of them now (from playing Rock Band). A song was playing on the radio that I didn't know and then Even the Nights Are Better was on. Mom wanted to go to Mexico to do something to do the car and we were going to drive there. I said I didn't want to go because it was a really long drive, saying ""it takes like 10 hours to get to America"". I was then at home and Darren was doing some homework about causes on the media and stuff about drinking and celebrities and things that promote 'closing'."
"3047"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) I was on my bed with a lady, Verity at the end and I was in the middle against the wall. Michelle Williams and James Van Der Beek were talking on another bed next to mine. The lady mentioned rats and Verity was like 'are those the small creatures that eat mice?"". She said ""I live in Italy and I sit on the steps"", to explain her lack of common knowledge. She asked if they could grow so big that [something I can't read, but basically really big] and I laughed and said that it was the minimum size. I looked over at Michelle and she was sitting, holding her legs up into the air and she had no pants on. I pointed it out to the person next to me and we realized her and James were both naked. Michelle saw us looking and she said ""we had sex"". Then she was sitting next to me and referred to him as Dawson and I said that's funny that you call him Dawson. There was a book about Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Joey were in a car 'years' later. They were dressed up to go to a dinner with some important people for Dawson. It was from his point of view and it said ""I'm on a date with her"". He looked over at her and thought she looked good and he was thinking 'I bet I can win this bet' and then it said he didn't. They had stopped somewhere and had sex ""twice"". It said their ""nephrons"" were in close proximity. The next page started ""after I jesm"" and that he felt relaxed. I woke up at home later. My computer was hanging off my door (which was normal). Mom was talking to Poppa and saying that she tries to keep up with events and wanted to see them. Then Nana and Poppa came into my room. I remembered my dream and they left and they wanted to go to an expensive cooking class. I was patting Spaceman."
"3048"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) Some people from university and school and I were sitting on a bench which was connected to the wall of a building. I was next to Verity who left after a while. She came back with two huge bowls of kiwi fruit. Everyone took some and started eating it. I got my phone out to take a photo of the bowl. There was a clock on the wall above us which wasn't working. I asked this foreign guy to get this tray for me which had batteries. He did and said something about his friend. There was no battery holder in the clock and I asked Verity and she said she had broken it. I sat back down and Elijah sat down next to me. Verity was then collecting confessions. I got up but came back as Elijah was writing his confession. He gave it to Verity and she wrote something down and handed me a bit of paper which said ""he really likes you"". I was then watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson was on a movie set with Todd. He was only a props guy or something. He was angry with the movie because it was taking so long and all they were doing at the moment was building a house for it. He yelled at someone and said ""fucking"" and I thought that it was odd for Dawson's Creek to have swearing. He yelled at Todd with a play on words of the movie to say that it sucked. Then he went to yell at some lower level people. I was on Facebook which was different. I had messages from Elijah and different things. The ones from Elijah were now from Selena. One of them mentioned some show that Donald Faison was on and he had left it, but then came back and then it was worse."
"3049"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) I was at Nana's. The cage outside had kittens and puppies in it. One of the puppies was really pretty and had long floppy ears. I was in the computer room and it started raining. All these people came to the door to get in from the rain. Nana let them in. I left the room. Ezra was watching a movie. I heard him say ""Alejandro"" and I went into the lounge room and he was sitting on the floor. I sat down there with one towel around my top half. They were watching a movie with some lady and I asked if it was Adaptation and it was. I said it was lame and didn't make sense. At the end, this black guy said ""PC!"" and I said ""Pacey!"". I asked Nana if I could play with the kittens. I went out and the puppies were gone. I went into the cage and it was small. Later, some people ran into the house (or someone was already there) and they turned off the power. Nana joked that we didn't have something I can't remember now, but stuff that people used to turn off power in the movies. We wondered why the power was out and then we realized it was to turn off the ""security system"". We ran into the hall to turn it back on. This agent lady went out and said Walter (Fringe) was at the gate. Peter (Fringe) was with us but I didn't know who Walter was. We saw cars coming and Peter said we should just leave, but there were people at every exit. Peter and Joey (Dawson's Creek) were in the laundry and I left. I went to go back but there was a girl outside the kitchen window with a big mouth/teeth. Outside the laundry door, Joey had earlier placed a pool, so the girl couldn't get around. We grabbed some toys and we opened the door and left. I gave the toys to Peter. We got in my car which was in the carport. My computer had a Supernatural wallpaper. I was watching Dawson's Creek, but it was actually a movie with Joshua Jackson. There was also some movie which had happened in real life, but was slightly different. This girl (who had been me) looked at him and he realized he kind of liked her (he had no wife or anything)."
"3050"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I was watching Fringe. Olivia was on a train. Sometimes it was me. This lady said something to her. Olivia showed a girl pictures of these 'aliens'. The aliens were two children with big blue eyes. They had been caught holding hands. I was helping Autumn study for the chemistry exam. We were in a toilet at a university. I was trying to get her to write formulas on her hand. She went into a cubicle and started pooping. I heard her sniffle and I coaxed her out and said we had to leave. Dan (One Tree Hill) was working at the university, but then he was Dad and we passed him as we left. We ran to class. It was 10.24, or at least 24 past something and the exam was at half past. We got to class on time and this popular girl got in trouble and the teacher said something about blowjobs. Later I was playing Guitar Hero or something and there were lots of notes for the song. I had to hold down 3 buttons at a time. There were different versions, such as one where you play as jumpers and all the notes move around. I was then watching Queer as Folk and they were talking about some girl and Tom Cruise and which they preferred. Brian said he preferred the girl and Emmett said he preferred Tom Cruise."
"3051"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I was watching a movie. This girl was friends with a guy who liked her. They were on a plane with some other guy, who started having a rant and then paused and then said ""that's my angry rant"". His name was Andrew and he had shot his father. They were at his house and he walked outside and buried his father. His house was weird. The front door was a gate outside. I locked it, but I could still jump over the bits on the side. I was then at a shop with Mom. There was a Mickey Mouse bath mat which was the same as one that we had years ago (not in real life). Ezra was with us. Then Mom and I wanted to go to the markets and it was Sunday. They were all closed though. Mom met a friend there. They hugged and kissed and gave Mom a box of Fruit Loops, but we left it on the floor because we didn't want it and some kids took it. Later we were outside a petrol station with Mom and a girl friend of hers. We were talking about birthdays and I said that ""I like to play with myself"" (as in gaming). They joked about what I said and started saying I needed to find a guy to service my needs and I said that I don't get sexual urges, ""I'm asexual"". We then were having a conversation about Dawson's Creek and she said they looked so much better in later seasons, especially James Van Der Beek. I said that I thought the opposite, saying ""Katie Holmes looked like she was sick in the beginning, like anemic and tired. Every time I saw her I was like 'geez, she looks tied', now I think 'oh look there's Joey'"". I said that Dawson had weird hair but looked better then and that Jack was fug to begin with, but then he got better, but that ""I don't even like the guy [actor] "". I said that ""Andie"" (Angie) always looked the same. I said Jen went back and forth and ""Joshua Jackson's forehead annoys me"". I was also watching Dawson's Creek at one point and Joey and Jen were in a kitchen and it kept cutting away at certain points so we couldn't tell who had slept with who. I had to write theory at a party."
"3052"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I woke up from Mom and this guy talking loudly. They said it was 7am, but it was actually 11:30. My phone said 8:40. She had been cleaning up and had chucked a heap of boxes in my room with 'my' stuff in them. I took them all back out. She was standing in a towel and was annoyed about me moving the stuff back. Ezra had bought this blow up chair with doopy things coming out and it was motorized and dangerous in races? It was blue. We went to the shop where this guy friend of Mom's used to work as he supplied us with the chairs. When we got there I asked Ezra what his name was and he said ""Silvio"". There were other people we didn't know working and they told us it was dangerous. I was sitting on it and bouncing around. We walked into some girl shop. As we left this group of girls pointed and laughed at him and he threw the chair at them. This other girl hit him and he punched her. I said ""you totally head crabbed those girls"". We went into this shop right next to the exit (around the corner from where he punched the girl). Ezra was talking to the guy about some shirt and asked if it was the 'same'. The guy was Jared Padalecki. I was going to ask him for a photo but was waiting for the right time. Ezra didn't seem to notice who he was. Supernatural was playing on a TV in the shop. Dean and Autumn were at a clothes shop and it was a new episode. I was about to ask if it was weird watching it when I got a tap on the back. It was some lady and she said her husband was going to make her eat a horn and something else and needed someone to watch and wanted me to follow her and I said hell no. She kept insisting and Jared said he'd go, but the lady said no she wanted me. I was later reading a list of Brad Pitt's favourite movies. They were mostly weird ones I hadn't heard of, but also had Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Get Real."
"3053"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I was at a shop. I was looking for a dress to wear to some event. I was friends with Jensen Ackles and Sophia Bush. Jensen was my date or something and Sophia was helping me look for a dress. Most of the clothes were gone though. Bethany Joy Lenz had a shirt which was the same one I was wearing. It was purple with flowers. The shops were closing and I looked in this other shop but they had nothing."
"3054"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) I was watching a movie. There was a young nerdy guy in a street and I realized it was Jared Padalecki and I pointed it out to Ezra and I said something I can't read and we laughed."
"3055"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) I was in a library like room. I read Paths of Glory and the movie had George Clooney in it, but then it was Bruce Campbell. I went to class and sat at a desk and they were collecting something that I can't read. I had six and someone took some and then I had three. Some girl mentioned Gossip Girl and I followed on saying ""is retarded, yeah"" and people laughed. There was something about a pack which had effects and something about a murderer."
"3056"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) I woke up and got on Facebook. I had a message from Nana about having burnt my birthday cake and then another later because I hadn't replied. I was then in her kitchen and she saw me and I said I was just about to reply. We talked for a bit and then brought me into the dining room to give me my present. It was a chocolate maker. I had to try it a few times because the chocolates would 'age' quickly. You had to put cocoa, flour, etc into this little shape; it looked like a spade (from a card). You left it for a few seconds and then took it out and hold the short ends together, then rip them off and hold it. It turned grey and we had to chuck it out (it usually happened to the first few). My tooth was hurting so I looked in the mirror and I had teeth coming through under my teeth on both sides. I told Nana I had to leave soon because I had to study for my chemistry exam. I called Mom and a lady answered the phone. I said ""it's Izzy"" and she said ""hey... nanna?"" and I said ""daughter"" and she said oh and mentioned a crazy one (she was Mom's secretary or something) and I said not that one. She said Mom was at Uptown shop. Ezra was with me too. We left and I got a call from Dad asking about exams. We went to Mom's work, which was on the side of the street along with other shops. We went in and waited. All the workers there left alphabetically. The secretary lady saw us and she asked for an explanation because her last name was ""Wayas"" and I said Mom's was ""Wyatt, yeah!"". Then the other daughter was there and she was Michelle Trachtenberg, I said something to her. She had accidentally married some guy. We waited in the car and it was making strange noises. We ended up driving down the street and turned it onto a bridge to park. We went into the middle of like a park and this net came over us. There were a few people there and we were no longer in the car. There were little red and blue balls shooting up. It was then a TV show. I thought it was lame. Then it was a game and to get out you had to go through this hole which got smaller? People got angry when you left. Someone started doing something weird and I got a call on my phone, a picture of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson was on there (as they were calling), but I called them Kenny vs. Spenny. Rik sounded just like Richie (Bottom). He said not to do it."
"3057"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) There was a kid and Locke (Lost) and two others were after him. They wanted him for bad stuff, except for Locke. They went into a shop and the kid saw the guy in the mirror and ran out. There were trying to think where a kid would hide. They went to a daycare and found a $5 note, a pencil and a wallet. They looked at a note which was actually a picture the kid had drawn. They said it was of the 'Queen' (which was like some monster). I was playing a tutorial of some game. I was walking with others outside and it was night and we were standing in light. There were creatures around and our lights went out. We ran. We made it to this room which was like a safe room before we had a fight. We had to fill our shoes up with milk. We were wearing futuristic armour and our shoes were like high up. There was a little thing on our neck with stuff to shoot and lights. To stock up on weapons and stuff, we had to play Guitar Hero and collect stuff as they fell. Eugene was there too. He had stuffed up somehow and I was making sure he was ready. You had to chuck lights too and you could only hurt the creatures when they were in the light (they were like shadows). Mom text me saying she didn't have to work tomorrow because it wasn't going to be sunny or something."
"3058"	"(2009-09-22 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Joey was at Dawson's. She left at night. She got Dawson to ride his bike down the street (they lived in a suburb/city street) to make sure nothing happened. Then he came back to his house. This guy across the road yelled out to him and started coming towards him. Dawson ran up these steps in front of his house and locked this door behind him (it was still part of the path to his house). The guy tried to unlock it but then realized he could just walk around it (it was just a door, no fence). I was inside with Grams. The next morning she said she hadn't seen him. I went outside and he was lying on the ground with a bloody mouth. I helped him in. His nails were heavily bitten and I said ""that's adorable!"". The lady across the street was having a go at him, because the guy who had beaten up Dawson was her son and had told her that Dawson had actually beaten him up. His sister was faking it too. She yelled at us and I yelled back and said ""fuck"". Later, her son called her a slut and whore and I said that I've never even said those words and I probably haven't heard Dawson swear. I said that maybe five times in my life I'd gotten angry and she realized that her kids had lied. I got a text from Dad, and I had a new phone and the buttons only appeared when you were pressing them, but you got Foxtel on it. He said that I had won a recycling bin scholarship at State University. I was then home, or at least I assumed it was home. Ezra was watching TV with some mates. Chris Barrie was on the TV and I said ""Chris Barrie for the win!"". This guy there said he'd seen Mulholland Dr. and I said that I was cool enough to watch movies because I wanted to and ""David Lynch owns"". I argued with the guy for a bit and I said Stanley Kubrick was the best director. He said that Spielberg sucked and I said his movies are ok, but that he wasn't a good director and then he said ""Why are we arguing about movies?"" and I said ""there's only like three things worth arguing about and that's one of them"". The show with Chris Barrie was about him having travelled to some place and he had painted his face with some black stuff called 'slat'. I was studying for chemistry later and there was stuff about femur, mitosis and meiosis and tigers (but we could leave that stuff out)."
"3059"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I was playing Beatles Rock Band. There was a really hard song which was going really fast and I was playing on hard."
"3060"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I woke up and I could hear Mom giggling, like 'stop it'. Then she started moaning and saying ""don't stop moving"", and then finished off. I was grossed out by it. I turned around to go back to sleep. I had a bag with me and chipped the wall. Something had a kebab thing in it and there was mayonnaise and it was on my bed. There was a video of a Paul McCartney concert and this guy was in the audience looking bored."
"3061"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I got my chemistry exam results back and it all added up to 73%, but they hadn't done the multiple choice yet. I text Mom to tell her. I was annoyed about the low mark. I thought it may go down yet, from the multiple choice."
"3062"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I liked some guy, but went out with someone else instead. We went to a hotel and had sex. We ended up breaking up so I could go out with the other guy and I said to him, ""there's something I should tell you, I'm not a virgin"". He was like ""what..?"" and realized I had slept with the other guy. I said I didn't plan it, it just happened. Then it was Dawson's Creek and Joey and this guy were talking in bed and she said ""you said you didn't... and I don't know what that means"". He said he didn't enjoy himself. She had recorded it and he found it. Then I was watching One Tree Hill and someone ran a restaurant and was looking for plates and went to Nathan, even though he had never gone to the restaurant. Haley was fat."
"3063"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) Granny had some underground thing with people they used to feed the poor. I saw her pouring oil and singing into the drains (it was night, in some spooky American like neighbourhood). Then Cartman (South Park) followed her and people who were sick got put on this big stone and cooked, there were about four there. Granny was there with other people. I was at a party like thing with Mom. Margarita came up to me and said something mean and I ignored it. Later there was a big cheesecake like cake and it was from KFC and had almonds. I showed it to Dad. It looked really fattening and this guy said it was $50. Hilarie Burton was actually from here, and her and some guy came back and were playing at the beach. Margarita came back to me and apologized and mentioned me having kissed Duane and said my secret was safe with her. I was now Haley (One Tree Hill) and she had a friend who could read minds. They called her and said she had dreamt that she was in a car and something bad happened. She said Nathan did that, but ignored it. She was then in a car with Jamie and they crashed into a building."
"3064"	"(2009-09-24 (18)) I was in the chemistry exam. Mr Reilly was supervising. I had done the short answers and stuff already but we all needed to do the multiple choice. I hadn't done the extended answer, so I was going to do that when he gave it back, but he had already marked that section. I had gotten 80% for short answer, 70% for calculations and nothing for the extended answer. I finished the multiple choice and Calvin handed it up for me. The teacher left the room for a second and Melodie and some others started telling the others the answers. We waited while he marked them. We were all silent and I saw Spaceman and I said ""Spaceman!"". I was going to text Mom to get me but I didn't. I got 82.5%. I had the back sheet and it looked like Eugene's, and it had a Flickr ID and I was going to check it out when I got home."
"3065"	"(2009-09-24 (18)) I was at a shop. I had a bag with some matchboxes and a big box of them and a bag with pants. I lined up at the counter. Someone was before me. Then it was 5pm and everyone left and I was like 'aw'. I walked out and the alarm went off so I chucked the matchboxes in the bin. My car was small and a baby green colour. I couldn't find it and it was dark. Mom and Ezra came and Ezra went to look in one section and Mom drove around. I went along side her but in another section. I ended up at like a construction site. I thought I saw the car a while away but there were some dodgy guys around. Some where near me too. They started chasing us. I attacked them and I think I had a pole. I got through them and went to the car. Mom was in the front seat and I thought they had killed her and I opened the door and she turned and her eye had been cut out. Her lip was bloody. She didn't know what was going on and I moved her to the back seat. I started to drive and it went backwards and I realized they had changed the controls and it went weird. I got onto the road, which was like a freeway and they were chasing us. I managed to get off and then I was somewhere else and not in the car. There were tunnels and monsters. Each tunnel was small and led to a 'cave' (like a dungeon in World of Warcraft) with the next set of monsters. Some were like spiders. I attacked them and moved on. One of them was like a lion. At first I tried to kill it but then Ezra pet it and it purred and calmed down. We got it to understand that we were on a team and we had to attack all the other stuff. Then it was a movie and Michael Rosenbaum, James Van Der Beek, Ryan Kelley [I was doing my Wiki last night] and Devon Sawa were in it. It was like Final Destination. I thought it was odd that Devon was in another one. Michael was bald still and I thought it was weird that Ryan Kelley and others from Smallville were in it. One bit was them sitting at a table in this room and Devon saw a chandelier above them and thought it was going to do something. It sparked and one of the bits fell onto the guy next to him. I was saying to myself, ""how did he die [in the first Final Destination] ? Oh, it was between movies and brick in the face"". Then some guy got a brick in his face. In the background, James Van Der Beek and his mother from Dawson's Creek were there. I said ""look at Dawson"" and he was like 'can I go home now?'"
"3066"	"(2009-09-25 (18)) I was at home and I had been studying. I got distracted and Ezra and I found extras that came with a movie. We had to plug a cord into a slot of something. I was about to go to bed and I heard someone like "" [something] thing is in the respiratory system"" and trying to break in. I went to my room and they did break in. I called out to Darren ""someone's in the respiratory system"" and he was like 'go away'. They said like ""shit!"". Darren refused to believe me and Mom encouraged him to believe me. Then he got up but the guys were long gone. I said I would never joke about that, ever. There was a movie with Kevin Kline and he and a bunch of others were like spies or something. Their names depended on where they did stuff, eg, Ms Solomon and some guy ended with ""aizal"". Some others called Beason and Eastland. Kevin liked this girl called Izzy. I was annoyed at how Americans say my name. His black friend said he should ask her out. It was The Big Chill like. Then James Van Der Beek and a friend were at a table. He liked the guy (he was gay), but he was young and I said ""what is he, 12?"". Then it was a movie and there were zombies. We were in a room and at first there was only one zombie but then there were heaps. I called the guy down and I was in like a storage section of a food shop and said to bring weapons like brooms, but he got killed. The movie was in stages and the next bit showed a zombie waking up and this young guy was going around the shop. James and a friend watched. This girl was having a smoke on a bench that his friend liked."
"3067"	"(2009-09-26 (18)) I woke up and I was in bed with Eugene and he unclipped my bra. I decided to go downtown. I started walking but forgot I had to go on the freeway. I called Mom to get me and take me there and she took like two seconds to get there. She came with Ezra and they had two cars. We had to get help from someone to get them both back. There was a movie where this girl got accused of digging out her dead grandmother and she was having an affair with some guy (she was accused by his wife). Then it was Dawson's Creek. Jen, some teacher guy and I were there. He wondered who could get into this room first. I had seen someone do it in a previous episode. Then it was just me there and Jen and Joey were in the other room. I had to get Jen out and distract her so Joey could do something. I saw Dawson and was going to ask him to do it, but he was involved in another part of the plan. I went there and said ""Can I talk to you Jen?"" and we walked outside. We walked past classrooms. I was trying to find somewhere to stand outside the view of the students. I didn't know what to talk about, but I brought her to a shelf with those water cooler bottles and asked her to help me with one. She did. We walked back, with her walking backwards but she kept looking behind her. I saw Jack with a guy hanging around. Jen started to suspect I was luring her out and I got my phone out to text Joey to get back and she thought that was what I was doing so I started smiling and she thought it was a guy I was texting and asked who it was. I saw Joey and Dawson run down the path next to us (separated by a block of classrooms). When we got back they had only just run in, laughing and Joey fell. Jen got upset and told me. I said ""I never liked you"". I said I watched the show and from the beginning I never liked her because ""you stole Dawson and I liked you for a bit in season three and four"" and when she was friends with Jack, but then she stole Dawson again. I mentioned her sleeping with every guy she met. I also mentioned Jensen Ackles and she was like ""your man"" and I thought we must've been dating. I apologized to her."
"3068"	"(2009-09-26 (18)) I was with Dawson, Jack, Joey and Jen (all from Dawson's Creek) in a dorm or something. This guy came in and said he just got tested for HIV and we should too. We decided to do it now. We got to the front of the building and realized Dawson wasn't with us. We kept going. It was night. There was a van in the middle of the carpark and it had this big gun looking needle and you had to do it yourself. Joey and Jack went first and put ice all over their arm to numb it. Jack said it would hurt like hell in the morning. I decided not to do it. Jen anxiously waited for her turn. Then I decided to do it. I got in the back of the car and asked Jack what to do. He said to make a small cut on my hand, so I tried but I couldn't get it big enough so I asked what next. He told me about the ice. Then there was this thing where Jack had written about the experience and someone had said the hard thing wasn't the pain but being tested."
"3069"	"(2009-09-26 (18)) I went to university to do something quickly. I walked out and I saw Jamison. I said ""Jamison? You take the train?"". It was dark there. I ran to the bus. They left the door open and I had to stand right near it and I almost dropped my phone. There was an elevator at the train station (and it was inside and not train station like at all) and Sineita was in it. It was clear and went sideways and fast. When I got off, I ran down the escalator to get the train. I got in, but it was a stingy carriage. It was really small, crowded and dark (there were no lights). I saw a cat jump onto the track. We stopped at Stirling, which was Belmont, and then went back to Westland. I called Mom and I had a text from Ezra about Guitar Hero and a book. Also, the train had finished at Stirling as it was a new thing because not enough people were using the stations past Stirling."
"3070"	"(2009-09-27 (18)) I was at dads. I was getting ready to go somewhere. I got there and stayed by myself. It was like a 2.5 hour drive. I was in a big room and there were no curtains (just those frilly things). I was watching a movie that was 2.5 hours in and still had 2.5 hours left. It was dark and rainy/stormy outside and I saw shadows of people. I text Dad telling him to drive here now. He sent back saying 'you scared?'. I went to this other building with some people while I waited. There was this guy there who I kind of liked. I thought people were watching us unlock the door and then we had to put this thing out so no-one could get past. Then Ezra was there and we had to do it again because we had to let him through. Then it was 4am and I text Mom to say Dad still wasn't here."
"3071"	"(2009-09-28 (18)) I woke up and my room was different. There was a lizard on the floor. I went to call someone, but accidentally took photos of it. I got a call from Ezra and I said ""you sound like a girl"" and then they said ""It's Tracey"". It was a friend of Ezra's. I was then in the lounge room and there were a bunch of us. The lizard came and we tried to scare it away but it wouldn't go. I was squealing. Ezra was playing a game and smoking."
"3072"	"(2009-09-28 (18)) I went past dads to get something. I was with Mom, Darren, Ezra, Ando (Heroes) and another friend of Ezra's. We were going to get my car too. There were drugs on the breakfast bar. We left and it was squishy in the car (Ezra, Ando and I were in the back), but we decided to go like that. I was next to Ando and his foot was touching my foot and moving up and down. I was thinking that we secretly liked each other. We got to this place and there were lots of escalators all connected that went really fast. They also turned and went straight, etc. We got to the top and I went off with Mom. It was like a market. She was looking at the clothes, which were all really small and I said ""only Asians can fit into these"". There were some mystery bags for $4.50. We got one and all it had were seven packs of cheap gloves. We met up with Ezra and he had my water bottle and there was only a little bit left. There was a cabinet with stuff for sale and one of them was a fat lady's head which was in the corner in the dark. There were some people on the ground reading. Then I worked for some people who were aliens. They took over and were rounding up random people. I had to go with them for a while. There were people dressed in costumes and had to climb up this wall. The aliens showed us all this game -- I had to work out how to get a basketball into the hoop (it was like a computer game). I did it by chance and this guy was angry with me for not using math to work it out. Then everyone was normal. I went into this computer room and saw this guy doing something on a computer and I asked what it was and he said he was looking for his soul mate. It cost 1000 credits and it went through all the people here and he said it was because he was bored and I said 'fair enough', since there was nothing else to do. I wandered off and this guy was running crazily down the hall, going down and then back. There was a hot guy on a computer in a hall that got my attention. He looked a bit like Joshua Jackson. I told him about the soul mate thing and he only had 300 credits. There was a sheet that had George Harrison on it. There was a list of the people and I saw Gavin and Terrence on there along with other people I knew. I found my name but it was my 'original' name and it started with a K (or maybe an E, it's hard to read) and my last name was Mueller."
"3073"	"(2009-09-29 (18)) I was going out with Eugene and knew Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. They were both from different comics and Jensen was Batman and Jared was Superman. I was good friends with them but I was interested in Jensen. We eventually had sex. I woke up in his bed. I saw Jared later and he knew what had happened and I was sitting with him and he said that he understood that ""you weren't overcome with the urge to screw me"" and I was like ""yeah..."" and took a drink, thinking 'not quite!'. He was angry and didn't pick up on it. I was then climbing along a wall at night. I was trying to get into a friends house. He let me in. We were going to expose something. I was discussing comics with Ezra. He and Mom were sleeping in the same room. I borrowed her phone."
"3074"	"(2009-09-29 (18)) Sylar (Heroes) was killing people for their powers again, but he was sometimes John Lithgow and sometimes me. He was in a carpark and the cops were looking for him. He grabbed a kid and walked off (to look like a parent and not get noticed). He went into a building and he knew who had what power, but couldn't do so much at once. He would use mindreading to make everyone not nice. He went into a shop and this girl said the money was in the back (to give to him when he returned someone). He went to get it and went crazy again. He cut open some snake looking thing and was trying to convince people that it didn't hurt it. There was a dog cut open and he cried saying that when he returned it he would get money for being a hero, but it was hard for him."
"3075"	"(2009-09-30 (18)) On Facebook, Dmitri had said ""Dmitri says: Alana and I just spent a few hours in a hotel room"". He had lots of comments and some were from and about Calvin and Elijah. He had also uploaded new photos and they didn't even look like him. I was at school at an assembly. I went back in time to when Gramps was alive and he was there (still at the assembly). I saw Noah Bennet (Heroes) in the crowd and I said it was weird seeing him 'normal'. I sat down with my laptop at the front next to the wall, not on the steps. I was going to get on the network and take any photos they had. There was a small TV in front of me and this girl next to me said Diesel was playing. She mentioned Sausalito Summernight and I thought she said it wrong. I said that I liked Down in the Silvermine too. It played an advertisement with Aunt Sally from years ago. I recorded it with my phone. I was then in their house and it was decorated for Christmas and looked nice. I said to Gramps that I was from ""2009. End of 2009"". He 'knew' that I was telling him the truth. I also told him that he was dead. I left the house and got picked up by Dad and Ezra. Ezra took the laptop and went with Gramps. I went with Dad. He took me to the old house. I was waiting to leave and I saw Tigger and Mittens and a black cat on the breakfast bar. They were really skinny and we were out the back. I turned the lights on and it was evening. I asked if I could feet the cats and he said he was going to ask me to. I emptied the old food into the bin and there were maggots in it. One fell on my jumper sleeve and I squealed and got it off and was like ""I'm going to be sick!"".  I cleaned a couple of bowls and then went somewhere. I came back and there was this weird creature on the floor. Ezra was there now. It was like an anteater. Ezra sprayed it with fly spray. It came towards us and I ran into Dad's old room and I was now with Dad. Ezra led it up the hall and it went into my room. It said it could put us to ""sleep"" using anything. Dad opened the door to look and I pushed him out and he fell to the ground asleep. I ran out of the room into the kitchen. I was waiting for it and trying to find some weapons."
"3076"	"(2009-09-30 (18)) I was at a convention thing. I was in a shaded part and some people from Heroes were walking past and I saw Zachary Quinto and I was like ""Sylar! Sylar!"". He stopped and took off his sunglasses and waved. Maki Oka also stopped and said hello and I said ""hi Hiro!"". Then I asked him for a photo and he said they couldn't because they were filming. He walked off, but a short time later he and James Kyson Lee came back and said they weren't filming yet. I stood between them and got a friend to take the photo and then another one. I went to this food place that looked very market-y and Asian-y and cheap like. There was lots of rice. Masi stopped the guy serving and let all the people eat for free. Hilarie Burton and someone were there. She got into a fight and was upset and angry and was living in the food place. I was then at university which was random and different. I had to go back for a bit but I couldn't remember what day it was or what class I had. I went up some steps to go to chemistry. The teacher there gave us our marks. I got 89.8%, which was a tie with this other guy and someone got 91% and another got 100%. I text Dad telling him my result. Evelyn was there and had done society and environment and got 55%. Elijah was there too. Some girls in the class were pregnant and were excused from some stuff. Then I was watching some show where this girl would appear in places randomly and so was always wearing different things, etc. Then it was me and I saw Simba at this vet place. I pet him and was then like ""is this Simba?"" and the vet guy said ""I dunno but he's bleeding to death"". I said ""Oh my God it is Simba!"". He had been taken in for problems like that. I was sad about Simba, but thought we could replace him with Tigger. Then it was the girl again. She was also bleeding. Then I was watching Heroes and Sylar turned up at some friend's house saying he would give them a 'freebie'. She flew him to the next building. Parkman was helping him with something. I ended up on a plane with Ezra. I was spying on some people for the police. Then this cop decided to crash the plane. It was bumpy and we fell out of our seats. We landed on the freeway. It had almost stopped and Ezra and I got out. We laughed because we were the first out. I realized it had all been planned."
"3077"	"(2009-10-01 (18)) Calvin and I were hanging out. He was reading some of my dreams. I had this big board and it said ""I love"" and the next bit was covered by another board. They got separated and it said ""Mr Nixon"". I grabbed them to cover it up and he was trying to look at it then Mr Nixon walked past. There was a dream about Dmitri and I was waiting for Calvin to say something, but he didn't."
"3078"	"(2009-10-01 (18)) This girl had taken a photo of her family and some famous people, including Deborah Kara Unger, in some setting. Something to do with this caused her to get an unlimited supply of drugs from Bob (Seth Rogen in Dawson's Creek). She decided to go get some, but then it was different and he was actually stalking her or something. He ended up chasing her on a bike. Then she was like his half sister or something. She went to a college or something and his full sister went there and looked exactly like her. She went to her room and locked herself in. He tried to get through the window (it was on the second floor or so). Then he was Charlie and she was Dee (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia). She was going to help him through and then she saw his sister sitting across from the window (it was like an alley just outside her window, and she was sitting on the wall across from the window). She climbed down and there were bags of alcohol, onions and bread. She climbed up with some alcohol to join her. She said she was leaving and something I can't read. Either before or after, we took a car and it was normal, but we were in America. The brakes were dodgy and it was hard to slow down. I was trying to stay on the road and drove into a shop and then through the car park and there were lots of people."
"3079"	"(2009-10-01 (18)) I had a collection of Pokemon cards. I got some rare one because Mom bought it. It was expensive and you couldn't get it any other way. Darren was annoyed about it, but eventually gave it to me. I said it evolved from Crobat."
"3080"	"(2009-10-02 (18)) I was at dads. I went out the back and Darren was wearing a towel and Mom was out there getting clothes for him hurriedly and I asked what was happening. They said Darren might have taken the wrong ""truck"" (though it was a van). We heard someone pull up and we went out to check and it had pulled up next door. I can't remember how it started but we had to get to the guy before he found us or whatever. He was killing people, I think. Darren walked up the street looking for him. My car was in the driveway. I got in the back and Dad was in the passenger seat and Ezra was in the driver's seat, but Dad was controlling it at the moment. Mom was behind the car and they were close to hitting her and I said to watch out but they kept going and ran over her. I was like 'what the hell are you doing?!'. I told Ezra to stop but they said no. We backed out into the street and she was lying on the driveway and I said to Ezra to get out of the driver's seat and he was like ""yeah right and listen to your music"". I said ""I don't care about the radio!"". He took off and I saw Darren up the street and he looked like he had been hit and I said to stop because it looked like the guy's van in a driveway, but they still refused. There were other signs of the guy but they ignored me. I was really upset and angry and I said to Dad ""after I finish packing I never want to see you again!"". There was lots of wide stuff on the roads, palm fronds etc. Dad said he'd heard about stuff happening on the radio and I said that Mom had mentioned a bad storm coming earlier. Eventually they stopped, but it was too far away for me to get back home. I went into a shop and they left. There was now an apocalypse happening. It was partly my fault, I think. I had powers, like I could generate heat from my hands. The best way was to hold a small bean bag tightly and I made flames. I was in the DVD section and I was trying out my powers. I met up with a 9 year old girl who was quite pretty and knew about what was happening. There was some lava on the ground, which was coming from behind an aisle and it was like a slug. My hand got red, but there were no flames. A mother and her young daughter came along and asked if some movie was here and I said ""no... try here again tomorrow"" and the girl smiled and her mother said ""that's the most inspiring thing I've ever heard"" and I thought 'that doesn't even make sense' and the girl hugged her. They went away. I told the girl I was with that I wish I didn't know an apocalypse was happening tomorrow. We went down a back hall and Mom was now in the all of the loading dock. We walked there but she wasn't there and I said ""I don't know if that's a good or bad thing that she's not here"". There was some show, that I think was called ""You Look Young -- 59"", or something to that effect. There was a guy with two kids and it was quite funny. He was high and the cops were outside. He sent his kids out and then they were either with or were Cartman and Kyle (both from South Park) and they were singing? Kyle stole the driver's door from a car and they left (I think)."
"3081"	"(2009-10-02 (18)) I was on a plane. This German lady asked me how to ask for tickets to see a pyramid and she said she knew how to say that she had pajamas. I saw Ms Bigwood on there. Sometimes I was with Joshua Jackson, who was young. I said jokingly, ""I hate that Pacey guy, every time I see his face I just want to vomit"". He looked at me and we started laughing. Later, I was at home and Ezra had knocked on my door but it was locked. I was getting dressed and when I was done, I said come in. I was watching Supernatural and I had it paused on Sam making a face, so I unpaused it and paused it again on Dean. No-one came in. I continued watching then I heard a scraping and he and Mom came in suddenly. I was like 'what the hell?!'. They were looking around and they implied that they were looking for proof that I was masturbating. I was like ""uh... right, can you go now I'm trying to watch Supernatural"". They kept coming into my room so I didn't leave the room. The mailbox had Nurofen and other drugs in it."
"3082"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) There was a book and a movie about some criminal. I told Nana about it and she had seen it. It was about some girl who was living in a small town after running away and she had changed her name, etc. This guy there had started getting suspicious."
"3083"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was watching Supernatural, but I can't remember it now. Then, Ezra and I were outside at night. Jared Padalecki was walking down a path and Ezra went running down there, then freaked out and went the other way. We laughed. There was a big net thing, which you could hang on (like in the army training). I was hanging from it and it was hurting my fingers, so I had to keep getting off. Jensen Ackles was on there with Jared. I was then at a shop with Mom and Ezra. We were at the checkout and she asked ""want anything else?"" and I said ""just my other stuff"". There was a small hole to exit the shop and I realized we wouldn't fit."
"3084"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was at the library at university but it was different and was very neat. I bought a blanket because the toilet had scanners and it was to cover you up with. Everyone in the library was talking about sex. I got the lady to scan something to check and I said it was my first day and she was confused. I left and was looking for my car then I remembered that I take the train. I ran across to the road and there were buses going both ways (on the same lane). I ran for a bit then walked up to the bus stop. There were two buses but they were both full and this guy and I got left out. The bus stop was actually like a bus 'port'. This girl and I started talking and we got on a bus and then we were like 'what bus did we just get on?'. It took us downtown. It was busy and weird. We didn't know where to go. There were food places and she yelled at me because she was hungry. There was an empty pizza packet. To get to the different 'levels' (they all went to different places) you had to go down these weird stairs. There was a rail and then a swirly thing. It was quite high. The girl almost fell and I grabbed her hand, but it slipped and she swung out to stop and she grabbed the rail and climbed down and I said ""I saved your life!"". I grabbed the top of the stairs and let it fall and it dropped me gently to the ground. We still didn't know where to go. We went into a dark hall with more halls leading to places, and there were colourful signs saying ""60's"", ""70's"" and ""80's"". I ran down the 80's one and into the platform. It was colourful and said FancyFire everywhere. I then realized I had no pants on and ran back to the stairs (where they had fallen off) and put them on and got my phone and asked Mom what train station I should get off at. She said Stirling and I said that I meant on a different route. There was lots of yellow in the platform. I was taking photos with my phone. I was then dressed in a yellow bird-like outfit. I found blocks of chocolate and it had three different flavours in one block. Two of them were made of ""boxed flowers"". They tasted odd. Sam (Supernatural) was there and he said he almost died getting them and I joked ""Thanks Sam for dying!"""
"3085"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was watching an episode of some show. This guy had like hundreds of clones of himself, at all different ages. He was about 40 years old. He was a professor and extremely smart. His younger ones were also really smart. This guy thought that he was dodgy and quit his job at a school. The principal, who was black, gave the other guy a job and then this girl found out. She was then Joey (Dawson's Creek). She brought kids over to this house to catch him out. He blew up his house. There was a fountain nearby and this blue guy had a hide-out underneath it. The guy was going to send off some clones to breed to see if the intelligence was passed on."
"3086"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was watching Fringe. Peter knew he had died and was trying to explain to his mother. He said that his favourite memory from childhood was actually Doug (Dawson's Creek) and was saying that Walter knew about it. Walter had red and black bits to show how there were two paths for everything."
"3087"	"(2009-10-04 (18)) I was watching the Supernatural auditions. They said that ""originally, Dean was a character with flaws"". Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were both there and they both had goatees, a moustache and long hair. They both wanted to read for the same character and Jared suggested they do both and then swap."
"3088"	"(2009-10-04 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a petrol station. I got out of the car and some petrol spilled out. I went in to get something. There were pets and there were some really cute puppies and kittens and some weird ones (with big eyes). I was like 'there's so many pets, we should go looking for a puppy'."
"3089"	"(2009-10-05 (18)) I was with some lady in a car. She text her boyfriend for sex and then she ran off with him. I went into a house, which was dads old house. It was still furnished, etc. I went to my room and it was dusty."
"3090"	"(2009-10-05 (18)) I was watching an old episode of Supernatural. It was night. Sam ran down a path into a group of black ghosts and he screamed like 'wah!' and ran the other way. Ezra and I were talking about it later. He showed me an episode where the setting 'changed'. I said it was funny that I could read the plot for something and then picture it in my head. Ezra and I said it was the screenwriters fault for the setting change. We were then walking towards a building. The path lit up and was flashing and I said it was morse code. This guy in a car was playing drums and I started doing drumming motions in the air and was thinking that I needed to play Guitar Hero. I went up some stairs to get water from my room. It was pitch black so I used my phone light to see."
"3091"	"(2009-10-05 (18)) I was at home trying to sleep. I closed and locked my door. I managed to fall asleep but woke up like 5 minutes later. Layla was sitting in my chair doing stuff and I said 'get out of my room!' and I slapped her back and pushed her out of my room, asking ""how did you get in here anyway?"". I ate a Mars Bar and then went back to sleep. Later, I had this little ball, which was like the TARDIS; if you opened it, it was bigger inside. I can't remember properly, but I went to the future. The other me didn't like me. She was with a group and they did something but I was never clear what. I was then in a car with some people and this cop friend of mine was driving and he stopped this guy who was walking down the street with a trolley, because he was pushing it the wrong way. I was then at a shop with Eugene, who was my boyfriend. We walked into this area and I had my arm around him and we switched so that we were holding hands. There was a book place getting set up. We had a dog with us. I asked if the shop was Myers and it was. We went into the shop that was actually open and we were walking around. I lost my phone and found it on the floor. We went to this section with beds and then we split up. I walked past this couple who were on a bed and he was masturbating her and she was making a movie of it. I was like 'ok...' and continued along. I left the shop and went to my cop friend. He said ""all you guys went in with 2 and only 1 of you came out alone"". He made us go in to look for Eugene. Then we rang his phone and we heard it ringing in the elevator shaft. Then it was Jared Padalecki down there and he was a bit younger. He was in a section under the elevator chained up. He was trying to break this weak bit of wire above him to get his phone (he was directly under the elevator). He had been captured by aliens. He broke a water pipe to get water. He was let out and he was talking to me about it. He said something about pregnancy and I said ""what did they do to you?!"" and he was like 'oh none of that, just ""scrambled my brains"",'. He said they carefully watched him while he ate. We had encountered these aliens before."
"3092"	"(2009-10-06 (18)) There was this hot guy who I think I was dating. Tony Soprano (The Soprano's) was his best friend. He thought he was alive, but they told him he was dead and he realized. But then they were in a motel room. Tony was under the bed with a slit throat and then he came back to life. We kept telling the guy that he was dead for a while. Then I was in a big pool that had like, beds on the side. It was fancy. He sat next to me and I told him Tony was dead. I was crying and he did too. I leant on his arm. Mom mentioned something about 'strawberry corn field'."
"3093"	"(2009-10-06 (18)) I was going down a street to get somewhere. I went up a hill, which was sandy and there was a car coming and there was a scooter in the way. The car was then a motorbike and I moved the scooter out the way. The guys who owned it came out of some place talking to each other. I left and went into a building. They followed. I kept scaring them down the stairs, but they finally came all the way. One of them was really smart and they were all fairly ok people. Someone asked why I wasn't dating any of them and was like 'they're small!'. One of them was called George. He pat this blind puppy's paw. I got the dog and I asked, ""how do you do it again? George?"". He was talking on MSN. Two guy friends were sharing a house thing (like a flat). There was a gay couple across the road. They got into an argument outside because the gay couple because there was no fence. They were saying that they couldn't raise ""our baby""."
"3094"	"(2009-10-06 (18)) This guy was asked on a date. He was then Pacey (Dawson's Creek). She left him and Joey (Dawson's Creek) was hanging out with him, lying on a bed and said ""why didn't you ask me?"" and he was like ""now I'm on a date with you""."
"3095"	"(2009-10-07 (18)) I was at Nana's. Aunt Sally was over. Sometimes it was Smallville. Clark, Chloe, Ezra and I were messing about. Then something was after us. Chloe and I got into an elevator but it was dodgy. It opened and we jumped out just in time. We hid in a bathroom and waited for someone to come in and scare us. We walked out and then it was real life again. Bryson, Nathaniel and Braden were in the family room. I walked in there because I thought Nana was in there. Bryson was on the computer. There was bubblegum all over the floor. I asked Nathaniel why and he said it was easier and I said to put it on the chair because there was 'less taste of carpet'. I helped them find something and they gave me something and I said ""Thank you for this lovely piece of bread"". It had icing sugar all around the outside of it. I tasted it and it was weird but edible. Aunt Sally had a baby. Suddenly it appeared in front of me and I (?) started chucking coins. Nana said she found my Goosebumps shirt and gave me a packet of Goosebumps stuff. I told her that when I was packing up my stuff I found my Let it Be shirt. I was then in bed trying to sleep. Eugene was next to me and we had a baby boy called Adam. I was thinking that it was weird and that I felt weird. Then people were trying to find something about the IRS or something. I showed them what it looked like online and where they were. There was an accident across the street and we had fake ID's and got in. There was a girl slumped over the computer and this guy said he found that she had fallen from a higher floor. There were lots of people there watching. I was watching The Soprano's later and Tony lost his memory or was confused. Adriana was in FlashForward and this guy was with her called Silvio who she was having an affair with. He eventually killed her in 'Chapter 2'. They were sitting on a rooftop, which was made of glass and was possibly a green house. He was swinging on this thing because he knew he wasn't going to die and she said they had to end the affair."
"3096"	"(2009-10-07 (18)) Eugene and I were out somewhere. We went on a bus and decided to go to England. There was a taxi near the door and all these other people had stopped. We went backwards for a bit. The airport was like a train station but it was inside. The bus drove right in. There were people everywhere. We didn't know where to go. We went into the stairwell and there were lots of doors and more stairs. There was a group of people in there who were on an excursion or something and they were going into a room. We found the place finally. There was a lady at the desk and she asked for our passports. I still didn't have one and I gave her Uncle Wilbur's one. We had a few bags with us. I had Grey with me. I was thinking about backing out, but I wasn't going to."
"3097"	"(2009-10-08 (18)) I had this little thing which I held onto in water and it would go really fast. Sometimes it looked like an iPod. Dad and I had to share a bed somewhere. He was moving and I realized he was masturbating and he finished and then realized I was awake. Later I was at a restaurant. There was a girl called Izzy Riss and she was a real 'goody-goody'. Then the next day I saw her at some place with a rock group and she was acting wild and she didn't recognize me. Then it changed to college band and she told me she could manipulate the environment. I had a scratchie and won $200 on it."
"3098"	"(2009-10-09 (18)) I was at dads. Some stuff was still there, including my computer. I started watching Supernatural and I told Ezra later it was a funny episode. I watched The Big Bang Theory too. John Noble was in a previous episode with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Jared was like a Goth in the episode and I read on a forum, ""Jared paints his nails black"". Dad was at the door and Mom told him to go away but then realized who it was and I let him in. I was about to play Guitar Hero. I asked Dad if he wanted The Big Bang Theory and he said he would download it later."
"3099"	"(2009-10-09 (18)) I went to near Dad's new place. There was a toilet and it was like a seat on a bus and I decided not to go. There was a huge lump of pipes. I started to climb down and I realized I needed to be up (it was on the edge of a platform and went a few meters down). It was pushing me down though. My hands got sore. Some guy who had been in it had blisters. Some guys helped me out. I wanted to contact Mom but nothing was in my pockets. Later, she had a laptop with a webcam. The cops were watching her for illegal downloading. Sometimes it was a show and it was about a lady and her son, who was Shia LaBeouf. There was a game that Dmitri played and he made his name ""LaurenIsAHag"" as a joke and I hit him. Ezra laughed. There was a second movie and they had changed stuff and threatened to close the game and he changed it something else."
"3100"	"(2009-10-10 (18)) I met Jensen Ackles and had sex with him. It was then a gay guy who had had sex with him and Jensen was in a restaurant/cafe. The gay guy walked past and Jensen saw him through the window and stopped him. The gay guy was annoyed. Jensen came out and the guy said ""you fucked me"" but said he didn't want anything to do with him. Then I was watching a video tape of a school. There was lots of tall graffiti on the wall of the gym. Ezra, Mom and Dad were there. Mom took me to Dad's old place and I was out the back with Dad. The house was different though I didn't notice. Some stuff was still there. Nana and Poppa were there. They said to go out the front and put this poster in the bin. There was a door next to the garage doors. Dad yelled at Ezra for some reason. There was a kitten and a puppy on the poster. Nana pulled out a cord and the put it back in and it shocked her. I discovered that Dad had decided to keep the place. I was happy about it. Mittens and Tigger were back there and I pat them. Mittens was meowing [in real life, Cuddles was meowing and it woke me up] ."
"3101"	"(2009-10-10 (18)) I was outside a huge school like building. I knew I was at a school but I didn't know where I was or how I got there. I ended up at this greenhouse thing and went inside. When I went through doors inside the building it would usually teleport me back somewhere. Some people were after me and I was trying to run away but it was hard because of the teleporting and I was quite panicky and frantic. I had a notebook and I knew that I had to write the first things that came to mind on each line. I was running away from the people and I kept stopping to write things in (I had to, but I'm not sure why). Something reminded me of Denny in Grey's Anatomy, so I wrote ""Denny"", then ""Anatomy"". I ran to a room and they were just outside. There were words on the wall such as evolve, different and 'iweizy' but I didn't know what it was. I thought it was cool and a good name for the things in the story I wanted to write. I was trying to write it down so I would remember it when I woke up but then I was watching Suspiria and I was scared and I was thinking 'why am I watching this before bed'. This guy came up to the door of the room (the room I was in, was now in the movie) and the door had a window on it. He started going through it and I screamed. The people eventually got me and they took me to this classroom. There were a few other people in there. There were a few different types of good, such as cupcakes and pancakes. They all had egg in them. I was telling everyone not to eat anything with egg in it. This guy also knew about the dodgy eggs and we started throwing all the food at the wall and window. One of the people came in and asked who did it and we wouldn't tell them. They brought us into a big room that was like a main floor of an office and there were two escalators (without the steps). There were lots of people going up, but only a few going down. They sent us up. I got to the top and saw the room they were sending us to and freaked out and tried to go down the down escalator but it went up too and I was like 'this is impossible!' and some kids who were going down said they were actually still going up (it was an illusion). I gave up and let it take me back up. We were all taken into the room and given puzzles [note: I have been playing on Jigzone lately] . I did a couple but then left to talk to them. One of them looked like Tony Soprano (The Soprano's). I asked him why we had to do puzzles and he said it was to improve memory and the like and I said why not mix it up. I said we were humans and that we needed a break and variety. I could see he was starting to get annoyed at me. I said our fingers are hurting because we've been doing it for so long and that our minds weren't working at full speed. He seemed to consider what I was saying. I pleaded with him to at least tell me why. Also, at one point it showed a highschool football team outside and they couldn't find a door to get in (they also didn't know what was going on) and I told them to find the door that was different. Anyway, he decided to show me a newspaper saying stuff about overpopulation. I was like 'oh' and realized. It said that this country had ""+499"" which was a joke. He flicked through and I also saw that the date was 2004, which was the future (I think it was 1996 or so). There was a picture of them and there were only four and they were all guys. He mentioned that the laws of physics didn't apply at this place and that's why the doors teleported etc. They also had slightly longer foreheads (they were aliens). I said ""But why highschool students? Why not old people and the sick?"". He shrugged and said ""I don't want to get kung fu with a gun"" and I was like ""what?"" and he made a gun with his fingers and said ""a gun"". I said there were other ways of killing them and he said ""I could fuck them"" and I laughed. I realized it had to be done and reluctantly slowly walked back and up the escalator. I was thinking that I was the only person who knew this. I got back to the room and was upset. The other people wondered what was wrong. I ended up going back down and Tony was looking up things that I'd gotten in trouble for. I had gotten in trouble for ""being 48 seconds late to a test because of a punk calculator"". A punk calculator was a normal calculator but it had a lock, like the ones on suitcases with the numbers on the 'wheels'. They went to ""-2"". He looked perplexed about this and I realized they sent any student with a black mark. He told me to go into a room and ""turn left to the water"". I thought he was letting me go because of the stupid reason. There was an open window in the room with the flaps like on toilet/bathroom windows. It was extremely windy and I said ""it's cold... and really windy!"". I thought he would tell me to take a big breath because I had been plucked from the ocean, but he told me to unplug it and let ""the wave of Neptune"" into the place. I realized it would flood the place and as I reached for the plug, he said there wasn't enough time for any of us. I got ready for it and held my breath and pulled it out. The room quickly filled with water and I swam to the top and took a breath. My face was at the ceiling and the water was still rising and when I was fully submerged I let out my breath."
"3102"	"(2009-10-10 (18)) This guy was sleeping with a friend of his called Claire. Her boyfriend was suspicious and showed the guy a video of them having sex to see if he got jealous. She was also sleeping with a girl and there was a video of them using a dildo with two ends. The guy was telling someone about it and that he had had sex with a guy even though he thought that was disgusting. Mom was going for a drive. Ezra and I went along. We saw Lydia, Naomi (who was fat) and another fat girl walking in white shirts and black pants/shorts. I slipped and ended up on top of the car. We all went to the shop, along with Dad. There was an escalator that led to a clothes shop. Safety Dance came on and I started singing it. Ezra showed me photos of us when we were kids and he used to be called Leroy but it was pronounced 'shay shay'. There was a That's Life story about William H. Macy, who was from here. He, a guy and a girl, had dug a hole in this prison cell to get underground. There was a hole in the door and they came up but one hole got closed. The girl was a bit fat and couldn't fit. They all got out though."
"3103"	"(2009-10-11 (18)) I was watching My Bloody Valentine and the killer was actually a werewolf or something. There was a scene in a barn and it threw a shark/bear through the top floor and it got owned. The cops arrested (?) it the next day. Jensen Ackles was there alone later. He heard a noise and it chased him. Then it was Dawson's Creek. Joey and Pacey ran from it. It liked Joey. She went to hide in a shed and her foot got caught in a net. It caught up with her and she talked to it and cut the net to catch it and then they teleported away. Then it was real life. Ezra, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and I were sitting at a table at an outside bar. It was like the beach ones in movies. The girl behind the bar was friendly with me. There was a guy there who I thought liked me. He gave me a cup and I put it in a fridge in the bar and took a water bottle. Also, there was a cure for lycanthropy. I got a potion but then this guy who wanted it confronted a friend of mine to ask if this map led to the potion. I ran the other way, saying that if I was lying then I would tell you to go in the opposite direction. I ran to the cave but I accidentally touched the wrong entrance and I got teleported back a little. Ezra and Jared caught up and I said that I had to go back. They were like 'it's ok' and sat down on the grass to eat. I was puffed out from the running so I walked back and got a water bottle. I then got distracted talking to Jensen. I then walked back with a long stick. I checked my phone and my wallpaper was of Jared and I and I realized that Jensen was sitting at the table behind him in the picture. It changed to a movie of Supernatural and there was a scene with 'bad' Dean in a tree (?) and Dean said that 'this is what happens when you drink too much' to a bunch of alcoholics. There was a deleted scene that showed Dean talking to them in the background and Sam was at a table. Sam said ""you mean like a gr...gr...GRAIL?!?"" just like 'Tim' says it in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I had a drink and then laughed. He said it really well and did a hand movement too. It then showed this behind the scenes thing where they were going to do this plot with an ice cave and had them steal people's heads and they decided not to do it because it was similar to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There was a behind the scenes bit of a Monty Python thing and Michael Palin and some guy who I thought was Finnish, were holding their kids and walking down a path. I was then in the back seat of the car with Mom and Fug was in the passenger seat. The radio was on my station (the oldies one). I lost some dreams that I had in my pocket. Mom found them and I pointed out Jensen's name in one of them and then his name was somewhere else too. I was going to show her Jared's name but thought she wouldn't get it. A lame song came on but I couldn't reach over to change it. I said to Fug, jokingly, 'change the station' and she reached over and randomly changed the station. I was like 'whoa!'. I pointed to one and she pressed the button. I clapped and she looked happy. Mom said she was also staying tomorrow. Mom was going to dads to get some food. I wanted to go home but she forgot and took me to dads."
"3104"	"(2009-10-12 (18)) The last episode of FlashForward that I watched was really good. It had been tense, good action, plot etc. I went on IMDb to post about it. I also watched an episode of Fringe and Olivia got invited to the other universe by herself (from the other universe). She had a dot on her stomach. She had to go to a school gym. There were people there. She told this guy to ""ssh"" and then there was a whistle and everything paused. She then slipped into the other universe. Her other self was there and told her to straighten up but she vomited and kept falling between the two worlds (it was like static and it would fade). Later, Dad came over and I was at home, which was different. I said that it was a good episode tonight and he said it was ok and I said I meant FlashForward. He said he wasn't watching it anymore. He had just been at the shop with Ezra. They had bought old Dawson's Creek books. James van Der Beek was on the cover of one of them. Jessica Warren was the name of a character. Another one of the books was about the army. Then I was in a clothes shop. I got a permanent marker and wrote that the last episode of FlashForward was good and don't cancel it. I wrote stuff about it on the window too. Raquel was there too. She decided to write on the windows as well. She said she didn't know what to protest about and she decided on 'getting a boyfriend' or something. I was like 'your so boy oriented'. She wrote 'LD [heart] NR' referring to Dmitri, on the window. Pink was also there and asked if she could join in and I said 'yeah whatever' and she said that she always thought that I was into girly stuff and I was like 'what the hell?'. There were people outside the window (it was an inside window). There were bras next to the window. Some police came but they couldn't stop us because of some law. Then we were doing some acting thing and it was in a pub setting. This cop was trying to remember our names and put us in different positions. I was in a sitting position last time and they wanted me to stand. In Fringe, the people in one world were in black and white. Someone touched one of them and they turned into colour, then another one did etc. There was a quiz about people but there were pictures of Supernatural, mainly of Jared Padalecki and one with Jensen Ackles alone. The quiz was actually about police being at home or on the streets."
"3105"	"(2009-10-12 (18)) Mariyam talked to me on MSN. She said a friend told her about some movies ages ago but wondered about some music video. She was sometimes Tanita. A song called Brain Brain was first and it was by Madness. I went on LastFm and it did something weird to my plays. It said I had listened to a song by 'Psych'. I put Heartbreak Beat on. It said that my most listened to song this month was 'PF' and other stuff I don't listen to. Everything was named wrong."
"3106"	"(2009-10-12 (18)) I was at a train station. Someone and I had gotten a new job looking after it. Olivia and Walter (both from Fringe) were there. Some guy threw a small rock at me but it hit a post and fell. He was confused but then it turned out there was a box which he pressed a button on and then it shot off. He showed us and it landed on the train tracks. The train came and the box shot out a blow-up thing and the train stopped, but then kept going, pushing the blow-up thing along. I went to the next train station which was a short way away, to tell them, but the door wouldn't open from that side. Walter did something else and a 'cab' landed on the tracks and then bounced off. Olivia went over and written in the sand was a guess that Walter had written before that it would land there."
"3107"	"(2009-10-13 (18)) I was out the front of Dad's old place near the garage. People kept driving around the corner really fast and pulling up. Darren wanted me to get some cat door sheets. I had to hold the roller door down with the bin. I was telling someone a story of how Barack Obama used to be our pool cleaner (I was telling the truth). I said that I had dreamt he became the president before he was. Nana was watching an episode of Supernatural. Dean got possessed by a girl and Nana was like 'how embarrassing'. Sam looked like he thought it was funny. Then I got invited to this party as part of a job. My boss was in the pool. This guy and I were partners and we asked him for something. He gave us two cheap disposable phones and we were setting them up. It was night. I was then in a car. This guy came and was pulling it apart trying to get me. I had a Frisbee like thing and was hitting him with it. I got out and ran to a building. I hit him when I got in and closed the door and locked it, although he couldn't get in anyway. I was covered in blood and my face was dirty and covered with white powder. I walked down a hall and it was empty and it was a government building thing. I wasn't supposed to be there so I was being quiet. I walked around and I found out about some zombie experiments. Someone else joined me and then this mother and son attacked us and he was being held up against the wall. I hit them and tied them up in chains. With the kid, I made it so the rope went around his next. I tightened it but when the other person saw, they stopped me. They were infected. I ended up getting angry and stormed away.  This guy I hardly knew called Laszlo [note: watched The Lives of Others yesterday] was with me. We ran away through the carpark. I looked back and the oval was crawling with zombies. We were like 'they're after us!'. It was now day. We had no keys so Laszlo hijacked this purple car. We drove for a bit and ended up at this waste place. There were sections of barbed fence inside. This muscly, but small, African woman was guarding it. She was dressed in old-fashioned armour and moved slow. I said something to my friend and he turned and attacked me (he was infected) and I killed him. I was annoyed about this because I thought he was hot. I got into the waste place and tried to get the African woman to walk onto a mine and would tempt her closer by putting my hand out. She grabbed it and I got a pole and managed to get away. I found a notebook and threw it at her. She said she had a letter from a lover (a girl) and it had like a bomb in it but it hadn't gone off. Later, I was near a bookshelf and my old stuff was in it. She said that I must be glad I'm not writing down my life now and I said that I still was. I started to cry and tried not to. I didn't know what to do now."
"3108"	"(2009-10-14 (18)) I was in bed and it was dark. Mom opened my door and I was in a different house. Eugene was in bed with me (he was closest to the door). Mom talked to me quietly and Eugene woke up."
"3109"	"(2009-10-14 (18)) Ezra and I were playing a maul on Warcraft. I went as purple but got moved to red and all these people came and filled up every spot and I didn't know what maze to do and most of the creeps got past."
"3110"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) I was watching The Soprano's. Meadow was spying on Tony and the others. She was paranoid and thought that Tony and Carmela knew. Carmela was in the kitchen and told her to stay and eat. Meadow got suspicious and thought they knew and she ran, scared, to the cops and they put photos on the wall and she felt ashamed."
"3111"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) I was at a park and it was night. Jayson and Ezra were there. Jayson brought a girl and I said to get rid of them after this guy did something that I can't read. We needed to take Ezra to the doctors. I took their car and told Jayson to follow behind in my car. We got there and went inside and then it was a shop. There were traffic lights in the shop and one set was out. We were lining up then I had to go back to the car. There was a photo of Samantha and she was then in the shop with Cyndi. When I got back they weren't allowing any more people in. I called out to Ezra but he couldn't hear me. This lady said they were dead but then she realized they weren't and I was talking to Ezra but she mentioned to him that it was all on file and he wanted to leave. We threw this bit of paper around and went out the door? This lady said they really liked his introduction. This song, ""crisp old fingers"" came on and I liked it and started singing along."
"3112"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) There was a remake or something of Fantastic Four, but it was different. Zachary Quinto and Eric Bana were in it. Everyone in it were like people in Heroes. Eric Bana was like an alien and was green, slimy etc. Now Zachary's character looked like that. There was a scene where Eric Bana got on top of him and had sex with him. There was a flashback of Zachary in a car and was talking 'gay' like and said that he loved Eric Bana's character (who was outside the car and was normal). I think it says Eric was taking his farm. This girl outside was upset because she liked Zachary."
"3113"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) Dad, some random and I went to Vietnam. We were talking about something that cost $600 but years ago it was really expensive. He said he wanted to go to Bali because it cost only $3 a night and that there were lots of girls. I said ""but they're Asian"" and he said he didn't care. Then Dad, Ezra, Mom and I were walking along some train tracks/ride to go to Bali. It went across the water too. There were tracks on an angle and a train was coming and it was hard to stay balanced outside the track. They jumped off at one point and frolicked up some stairs (outside). I stayed on the tracks and it moved now. It took me into this shop and there was a door that said led to the 'cat haven' and it said it was unsafe. This 40-odd chubby-ish Asian lady said something and opened the door to some cats and dogs. She said the shop had food from all countries. I asked if they had gnocchi and it was in a fridge. She had lost a daughter. I went to a checkout and this girl at the end had blonde hair and was quite pretty. They lost something and were taking a long time to add everything up. Then the lady was like 'look who I've got! Phil Tony!'. I recognized him from some lifestyle show and he was there to help them find what they had lost."
"3114"	"(2009-10-17 (18)) I had moved into an apartment with some people for university. There was a big room with four single beds. There were two other girls and Zach Braff. Then it was some time later and we were all fairly good friends. We were going to the beach. Zach and I were the last to leave and were getting ready. He joked ""I'll draw a map so you can find your way back"". We went to the carpark first to get some Vaseline out of his car. I put it on my legs. We went down to leave and we were in this cinema like place. There were confusing stairs. We walked across to the exit which led straight to the beach. I was putting sunglasses on. We got there and Sarah Chalke and Ezra were there. Sarah and this other girl were sunbathing. Someone looked at Sarah and she was sun burnt. We covered her with a blanket and took her to the shade. Now only one side of her face was burnt? We took her back out. Some dodgy guys were hanging around. They were ok looking for beach-y people. Inara (Firefly) was facing away from them and they wanted to see what she looked like. We went back into the cinema. Some of them were buying stuff. Ezra asked if I'd seen any good new movies lately and I said ""In Bruges"" and I said that I was annoyed because Colin Farrell was in it. Evelyn was there too and some guys were going to pretend they were interested in her."
"3115"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) Some girl was in court because she left her wheelchair bound father alone. She went to see him and he realized she had left to live her own life and he was ok about it. I was then crossing a street. I was making a new Twilight movie but was thinking that Robert Pattinson was known as Edward now and no-one would accept new casting. Someone said it was like Christian Bale in The Dark Knight and I said ""except 'The Goth Knight' sucked"". I then walked into a cinema (though it was only a cinema after I entered it). I went in and then realized I had no money so I called Mom and asked her to bring some money. I called back a few minutes later to see where she was, but she had just pulled up. She gave me a peanut butter sandwich, which I ate. I said I needed money but then I looked at the list of movies out and realized there was nothing I wanted to see so I said I would go home. Then I was alone and there were zombies. There were crowds of people rushing around. Eugene was there and he pulled me into a room to save me. A lot of us ended up in there. It was a big room and there was one big rectangle shaped window facing the carpark. There were lots of shelves in the room. Every shot the window and we all had guns and started shooting the zombies as they came in. Eventually they were gone. I was about to go get my car and then this guy with a gas mask came in. We shot him. Some of us moved into another room and this guy came in and I aimed my gun at him but he hadn't seen me and he faced away and the red dot from my gun was on the wall. He saw it and I shot him in the head before he turned around. Then lots of others came in and I hid with some people including Niki (Heroes). They came in and didn't see us and we had a baby with us who was the 'antichrist'. We realized his power worked like, because the people didn't know where we were, they couldn't see us. They called out Niki and she stood up and gave herself up. I was then alone with the baby and it turned red and started to shake and I was like 'I don't know what the hell to do!'. Then it was some time later. This girl checked on Niki and she was doing some conditioning program. She said she had finished and she did it with a hot brain which was a myth that was supposed to make it stuff up and she said her knees turned yellow. This lady said she was only '285' programs through it and Niki looked worried."
"3116"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) I was in the car with Dad and Ezra. Ezra was driving. We had just come from McDonald's and I had a McChicken. We were going around a cliff and the wheel got stuck and wobbled and the car went over the side into the water. It was a convertible and I had no seatbelt on and I fell off. I got to the shore and ended up falling asleep on a bench."
"3117"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) I was at Dad's old place. There wasn't much there and the roof was hanging down for repairs. They were watching TV. I was doing some logic problems in the living room. It mentioned Supernatural so I read the introduction. I realized it was actually about Supernatural. I was going out with Jared Padalecki who was in the lounge room. I called out to Dad and he read through it and I said ""after the death of their father, John Winchester, Dean and SAM!"" He thought it was funny. I drew a love heart around Sam's name."
"3118"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) I was watching Gossip Girl. It was Jenny's birthday. She was going out with Dan and they had an argument the day before. She was sitting on a bed talking to a friend and wondered what he was wearing -- the theme was 'modern love'. She heard a scream and went out to see and Dan was there wearing dreadlocks and normal/baggy clothes. She was angry at him and told him to change. Then I was there with some others and we were just hanging on this 'balcony' up the stairs (inside). The TV was on and this old movie was playing. Her father and a guy were there and I suggested we pull a prank. One of the pranks we sometimes pulled was called the 'oh by the way I'm Elvis'."
"3119"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) I was at the old house and I had gotten two posters of Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles and one of two girls? I cut them in half and edited them together and was going to put it on my wall. The one of Jared got morphed with these girls and he was on top, the girl on the bottom and she was naked. There was a knock on the door and this guy there. He begged me to let him in so I hid. He pushed his face up to the door and mentioned my name and I was like 'what the hell?!' and thought that I didn't recognize him but I let him in. He wanted to go to the movies with me and I said 'you can go yourself' but he insisted so I went to put my shoes on. I had gotten invited via a big truck to join some group (mafia like). I joked ""the first rule about fight club is, you don't talk about fight club"". There were rules about having affairs and you had to keep them updated and if a kid was born you had to let them know. This guy and I were talking to the leader and he said something about some Sims 2 family but they passed as a 'low' tree. He wanted to sue them but couldn't find anything against them. Ralph (The Soprano's) was telling this girl (who I had been at one point) that he had had sex with a horse. She was quite pretty by the way and she reminded me of Megahn Perry. He convinced her they should have sex and they went into the back of this van in a garage. It was the meeting place for 'sexual fetishes'. I arrived there and was checking things and I saw her sleeping in there. I knocked on the window and she woke up. She had underwear on and I mouthed 'get out now' and she woke Ralph and they quickly ran out. They casually walked in from another way and Ralph kissed her on the lips and was talking to some guy. There was some movie and someone said ""what is this, Buenos Dias? Oh, Buenos Aires"". I knew of it and it was some poor African/Asian place and there were lots of people who got starved. People wanted to give them huts or something. This guy got lifted up into the air and shot. I was like 'aw I liked him'."
"3120"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) I had just finished at the university. I stayed later to play poker with Calvin and some others. The game was weird though. You got three cards and you marked off the ones you got and had to discover which ones the others have to eliminate the winner. I was next to this guy because he was doing a scam. I was then at the train station and I took the wrong train. I ended up in Oceanside. I text Mom to tell her. I had to scan my SmartRider on this Timezone like thing and got a ticket. The train back was weird and then I realized it was the wrong one again and waited for the next one. It came and it was like a net and you had to hold on. I realized it was the wrong one again and I waited on the other side this time. I got really angry and yelled that it was the worst train station. It was like 7-8pm now and I was annoyed that it was so late."
"3121"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) I was at a train station and I had to put baggage into this hole because I was a girl. Giovanni was there and he was allowed to go on as normal. It took a long time for mine to get through. I gave up. I went outside and I think Mom picked me up. There were lots of lizards and snakes and insects around. I saw something and I said ""what is that?!"" and Mom said ""a turtle?"". It had weird spiky arms. She dropped me back off later to pick up my stuff. It was near Dad's new place. I was like 'why would you want to live near the beach with all these things around?'."
"3122"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) This girl friend and I were walking down a street. She said we should hitchhike and told me to do it. I put my thumb out and then there was an explosion in front of us (it was a fair away in the city). It was sort of mushroom-y and we saw all this red stuff (presumably flames) coming towards us and we ran behind this building and then the flame went past us. We sat against the wall and there were a bunch of trees in front of us. Black smoke came from behind us and it was thick but the trees managed to shade us from it. Then there was another one but it came from this side (towards us) and we ran around to the other side. It was thick with smoke and it was hard to breathe. There was a pine forest to the right of us. We ran into it and it was foggy but with little speckles of dust floating about. She ended up getting a car but it was American and there was a dent on the left side. She drove up to me and told me to get in, so I did. There was a half eaten sandwich and I was hungry so I ate it. We went towards where the second explosion had been. We went to our house/work and there were apartments below it or something. We went to this weird house and there were some guys there and had a weird dead fish. This guy jumped down this hole in the floor to check the ""computer server"". This other guy was involved with the explosion and told him to give him his work (the guy in the hole). We could see things better and the guy shot a gun and we could see the ripple around the bullet as it moved. There was already underground stuff going on (post-apocalyptic rebels, etc). People were going crazy. We went near some buildings and we heard some people talking and I moved away. I passed a toilet and I heard a girl struggling with someone. I went into a building and it was office like. I heard the guys mention us and called out to us. There was a TV on and it said they were the guys that caused it. We ran away. This guy's head was on the floor but he was alive and it was being used as a football. I gave it to these guys nearby. The head guy was called Manny Trejo. He threw it at a guy and he bashed it in. We went to this shop and they had school bags. I gave one to the lady behind the counter and it came with a notebook. This girl asked me if I stunk and I said ""probably, I've just been running""."
"3123"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) I was at Nana's. It was March or something but it was Christmas. I was at the table next to the kitchen with Dad, Nana and Poppa. I think Dad said I did ""super duper"" in the MUPC. I said I got high distinctions and they were like 'good' but no-one said much. Dad said I got the top mark in human biology. Aunt Sally arrived and then Nana wanted to take a photo of us. We went outside and some guys took the picture and I remember seeing Nathaniel with us. I was annoyed because I wanted them to take a picture when I had lost weight."
"3124"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) I had watched Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but it was actually good. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, someone else and I had to stay in a van. We were on our way to somewhere. Jared and I were going out. There were lots of mouse pads and books in there that we had to use to sleep on. I was going through them trying to find comfortable ones. A security guard guy was with us."
"3125"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) Gizmo jumped on my bed with her tail up and was cuddly [note: her tail might have to get cut off] Mom and I took her to the vet and they had given her something to stretch her cells. She was going to be ok. I got some pens and this girl told me about a pencil that came with a sharpener."
"3126"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) I was watching Dexter and Rita was on her P plates or L's or something. She asked Dexter something and he looked worried but then he realized she just wanted to drive."
"3127"	"(2009-10-21 (18)) I was watching The Soprano's but I only remember seeing Tony. He had something to do with us. I was trying to remember their last names to see what Italian surnames were like. I said out loud, ""Carm, Dante, Adriana La Cerva"". Darren had been setting up stuff at the old house to stop people coming in while it was empty. One night I checked outside from the kitchen and I saw some movement and realized there was a guy out there. I freaked out and went to get Darren."
"3128"	"(2009-10-21 (18)) There were cops at a petrol station and we had trouble pulling up. We went to a bowser and but we kept going too far forward. We went into a shop later and Calvin was there and he said hello. When we went back to the car, Mom said something about his mother dying and I said something like, 'why would he be working/he would've said something'. I was then at the old house and Ezra's room was different. He showed me and Dad his wallpaper on the computer. It was Dean's (Supernatural) face with a 'comedic' angry expression. I said ""Fetch [no idea why] . At least he didn't say my least favourite word"". I laughed, remembering the episode the wallpaper was from. I said it was the one with this dog which was crazy and barked a lot. But it actually wasn't and it was from the most recent episode. Then I was watching the episode and the dog chased me into this office and I closed the door. Dean shouted and said he was 'in' the dog (possessing it). I opened the door and I could hear him. He half joked about finding a female dog for me. Then I was watching Torchwood or something. Every child kept saying ""where is Eugene?"" and I was like 'I wish I knew [about Eugene] '. A group of kids saw this kid and stopped and realized the kid was 'Eugene'. They chased him up a tower."
"3129"	"(2009-10-21 (18)) I was at Timezone and I think I was in Year 9. I was in the library with Calvin, Silas and Samantha. We went to bowling and it was hard to throw the ball because I got a pain on my right arm. There was a video of Elijah and others walking."
"3130"	"(2009-10-22 (18)) I went to see some horror movie at the cinema that came out like 5 years ago. I started walking with a bowl of cereal. I passed Calvin and gave him the bowl and asked him to hold onto it. He was with a guy friend and he started talking and mentioned that they were seeing Friday the 13th tomorrow. I hadn't seen it. I decided not to go the cinema now and I said that we should all go as there was a movie marathon on. The guy wasn't too happy about it and said that Calvin and I shouldn't go out and I said ""what the hell, we're seeing a movie not making children"". There was also something to do with Michael Palin and Terry Jones but I don't remember it properly now. Anyway, we all went there including Ezra. We were at the counter and I was like ""brrr!"" and kept making other noises. The lady behind the counter was like 'ok... you're weird'. I said it was natural? I joked that I scared my door. I got a medium popcorn but asked them to change it to a small. First I accidentally asked to change my chair to a small one. Someone said that I was looking fat and I said ""I've lost 2kg!"" and jokingly pretended to hit them. I can't remember what happened but we were then on a boat and Ezra and I had a fight and he jumped off the edge and started to sink. This black security guard guy jumped in and saved him. The guy friend wanted to go home but I wanted to see the movie still. Calvin wanted to go home too (they were all upset about Ezra) but I was like 'let's just go watch the movie!'. But they all left. I was talking to a lady and asked her to write down my dream for me. When I went to get it, it was on my notepad but every page was full. I looked closer and it was the script for Deep Rising. I was confused about it and it cost $200,000 that night? I went to the lady and threw the paper at her and yelled that they were my last ones. She said she just felt like having fun. I calmed down eventually and said that Deep Rising sucked. I asked why she chose it and I got an image in my head of a huge CGI eel hitting a boat. She said something about a bear with a rabbit that drove faster. The bear was in a car and was chasing the rabbit. She was sending me the images telepathically. I went to watch the movie anyway but then I called Mom to get me because I couldn't be bothered. She said she would be a while. The end of the movie was set in a shop. This guy had accidentally killed his sister and there was some mirror trick using ""E Eloise Jorn"". Anyway, this sharp thing the guy had flung off and I joked that it would go into Colin Farrell's head. Then it showed him sitting at a table and it got him just near his eye (this had happened in In Bruges). Then it 'rewound' and it was just before this happened. A FlashForward thing had happened which explained a bunch of random things that had happened."
"3131"	"(2009-10-22 (18)) Grey's Anatomy was on TV. Mom said it looked like a good show and I said I hadn't started the new season yet because George had died and he was the only character I liked. Later, Ezra was looking at The Soprano's stuff. There was a picture of Silvio and I said that I liked Silvio. He also typed in some nonsense and we joked it would come up with stuff about Paulie, but it came up with Silvio. I asked who his favourite character was. We were going to the movies and usually I was in the front. Ryan and Ezra were also in the car. I went naked and got dressed in the car for some reason (and I was in the seat behind the passenger). I decided I didn't want to go because it had actually happened before and had to led to some lame events and I turned back time and I had to do everything the same but I didn't want to have to watch all the movies I'd watched again."
"3132"	"(2009-10-23 (18)) I was at Nana's. Mom and Nana were in the spare room. I was watching TV. We went outside later to do some adventure thing. There were quite a few people there. I was recording it but decided to just take photos instead. Ezra had really big boobs. The chickens came and started flapping near me and I squealed and jumped away. There was a round thing in some water that was where the top pond should be but there was no edge and we had to walk around. I was worried I would fall in so I went another way but then just waited for the others to get around and do it. They came around and this guy, who was kind of hot but was related to us somehow, opened this bathroom cabinet on the round bit. I took a photo of him as he did it. He was confused and said it was in Russian but it looked English from where I was and I realized depending on the angle you looked at it, you saw a different thing. I went around to the top fish pond later (under the shade thing) and there were now lots of stalls and vending machines with food (chips and chocolates, etc). Nana didn't know about it but it had been there for a while. She was upset and angry about it. I said 'isn't it illegal for people to try and sell stuff on your property'. She asked someone and they said no. I went inside and Janice (The Soprano's) was on the three seater lounge down the bottom and she was related to us and was called something else. I was going to ask her about it because she knew stuff about that."
"3133"	"(2009-10-24 (18)) I was at the old house on my computer. I got a text from Eugene and I was like 'Oh my God, Eugene!'. It said some random stuff and I realized it was spam. Ezra called me to show me something then I went to some place and they had a quiz (it was online first). The online quiz was 'what vehicle driver are you'. One question had pictures of B.A, Face and Westland (all from The A-Team). I got race car driver. I was then there and thought it was real so I went in but it was like Timezone and there were games. One was a skating rink. I was then back at the old place. Ezra's room was mine. It was cloudy and rainy outside. Dad came and I wanted to go back home but I couldn't take my computer out in the weather. I had a photo on Facebook of me naked but it was from WeightView and wasn't as freakishly [something I can't read, but it looks like 'finshy', but I don't know what it's supposed to say] . Ando, Hiro (both from Heroes) and I left this place and some bad guys chased us. This guy was fast with blades. I was trying to teleport and I grabbed his phone and this paper with [something I can't read again, looks like 'addnys'] . I touched him and nothing happened and it was because the weather was dodgy. This other guy was there too and he sat down in the corner (which was outside but the corridor was also outside the building). The bad guy sat in front of me and he decided to try to kill us and he started going crazy with the blades and I protected against it with this sword/knife. I accidentally stabbed him and then did it a few more times on purpose. I think it says we both got a 'fail' percentage on the exam. He was 16. He said something about bleeding to death in 20 seconds, but he would take 2 minutes. I went into the toilet to not watch out of respect."
"3134"	"(2009-10-24 (18)) I woke up. Ezra and Roland were in my room on my computer (I had two). I said to hurry up and get off because I wanted to get on."
"3135"	"(2009-10-25 (18)) I got taken to some place after university. There were lots of people there and some groups were wearing uniforms. They were teenagers. I sat down and Calvin was there. I was like 'where the hell are you and what are we doing' and he said he didn't know. He said something I didn't hear and he stared, waiting for a reply. I went off at one point and the rooms were confusing. Farrah was there and she was trying to hide from some woman but she came in and caught her. I was then at Dad's old house but it was different. I was in my room but it was windy and it broke the back door (it was flimsy). I wondered how Dad had lived here. I got up and closed all the doors."
"3136"	"(2009-10-26 (18)) I was with a guy, Ezra and someone else. We were taking photos together. Then it was a movie. There was a girl and a guy, who was played by Jude Law. They were best friends. His name was Gale and they were looking for someone called Harold. I can't remember it properly, but they were at some place in the middle of nowhere (it was sort of like the movie, Unknown). I read that the ending was much better than the theatrical release [note: I downloaded the Paranormal Activity screener last night and I read that the ending was better] . They escaped from there. They were trying to get a car started. Someone shot himself and the guy realized that it was near a car and [something I can't read, looks like 'roband'] , which meant that it would explode if they touched but before he could say anything the guy started it up and it exploded. The guy inside drove out onto the road and it exploded again and flipped. The other car had trouble starting and they backed it out onto the road. There were three cars in the left lane and there were two right lanes. There wasn't much traffic in the right lanes but the left lane had heaps. Then a bus pulled onto some long grass and the driver said people always needed to picked up from there. Everyone from before was dead now except for me and Gale. He got up from the grass. We got on the bus and he drove and then I noticed we were at the same place again. I realized he had purposely missed the turnoff. I saw an image of the bad guy (who was now Gale) and his evil self took over. The girl character (who I had been) didn't know. Then sometimes later she was Jessica Stevenson. They kissed. Then I was at home and Mom and Darren were there. I had just finished dinner and watching a movie."
"3137"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) Ezra was driving on the highway or something and he had missed the turnoff. It was night, but sometimes it was day, and there wasn't much traffic. He kept driving but Mom told him to turn back because he wasn't ""experienced enough to drive that long"". Then Dad, Ezra and I stopped at some deli thing and it was day. I thought it was dodgy. This hot guy owned it. There was a magazine with Jensen Ackles on the back. I wrote *love* and showed Ezra as a joke."
"3138"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) I was at a school with Raquel and some other old friend. We were walking down a path and I felt fat. We went to class and there were nerds. At lunch we sat at the nerd table? Then there was a movie and this nerd guy lost his virginity while some cool guy was under the bed."
"3139"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) I was at university and people were getting their usernames changed. Selena changed hers to T.A and Bradley and Jeremiah came too. Bradley heard Ezra say 'toilet swing' and I was like 'that's mine!' so he changed it. I was playing on Facebook later and this lady who failed at math wrote fail too? She was designing a name layout."
"3140"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) I was watching The Soprano's. Tony and some others were in a pool. There was a part they couldn't see and it was swirling. One noticed and they tried to get out and they managed to. Then it showed Carmela at their house. Her character was called Edie though. Tony was away and I was thinking that I hadn't seen Meadow and the others for a while. Mom bleached Gizmo and she shrunk. The top half of her was permanently changed to white."
"3141"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I was at a shop but in the car. Calvin came and asked me to drop him off at school and so I did. It hurt my left leg and arm to drive. I called Mom to take a look. Chase (House) was sick and he had been sick before. Cameron (House) was upset and said ""I'm sick of having to tie you up"". He didn't know what she was talking about. There was a photo of him as a baby with this metal thing on his head and he screamed."
"3142"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I watched the new Twilight movie and it had left out this awesome scene from the book (in which a monster had attacked someone). I watched it with Ezra. There was something about some stuff going into the sun. I did some puzzles about celebrities and you had to find movies in a word search. Darren answered the door and it was Clayton. He said he would offer $3 to stay over. I went to look for Gizmo and she was out the front but the house looked different when you turned your head the other way. I told Mom and she wasn't bothered by it. Then they went out to do it. I saw Dad and he said 'thanks for the help' and I said  ""What? I'm having a shower?"" and he said ""Oh. Take the steam cleaner to the oval to get rid of the dog poo with Ezra and Emery"". I thought it was random."
"3143"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I went to a Robin Williams live show. He brought Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall out for a bit. Robin threw a biggish ball into the audience and I caught it."
"3144"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I was at Brookland to finish off this course to graduate. I was in uniform and I didn't know where to go. It was then a movie? This guy was being chased. He hid behind a wall and then I was there too. The wall was next to a path and behind it was this tower thing and then a field. I had a gun. This control box on the wall was screwed and I shot it so it wouldn't explode. I saw a bad guy and shot at him. Then the guy I was with and another guy were lying together almost naked. The other guy was asleep. I said to ""lick his face"". He went to (as a joke) but then he turned. When the guy woke up he kissed him and they were like 'uh... ok' and then he thought that he might like him."
"3145"	"(2009-10-29 (18)) I was at the train station. Madelyn and I were hanging out. There were two queues and one was huge and the other one was small, but you needed lots of cash. I waited for Mom in the line (there were four people in front of me). She finally came. I think Mom didn't want me hanging with Madelyn. I said that she used to hang with me and Calvin. I had lost more weight."
"3146"	"(2009-10-30 (18)) I was watching Heroes. Niki/Tracey got a glimpse into the future. There was this weird purple creature. They were on top of hair? There were lots of discussions. Someone teleported Claire up to see. Dmitri put Peter against a glass wall and said he was Sylar and then he saw Claire and Dmitri got through, not wanting Claire to see, and said ""no!"" and Peter fell and then ran out. Then I was with some friends. Some of them were gay and there were some relationships in the mix. There was a girl with big clothes on (or it was a guy in drag) and my friend was like ""You're much prettier"" (about me). They were gay and sounded gay."
"3147"	"(2009-10-30 (18)) I was watching a movie. These people kept rushing to these doors with these small keys that. It had a name but I can't remember what it was. Then I was there and we were all trying the keys in locked boxes. Then I wasn't there and it was a trap to kill them as no keys fit. Then it was different and people would wish for someone to die, but they would also die. The main guy from Zombieland was there. He was with a lady and he realized she was trying to kill him. She was a demon or something. I think he escaped but then this girl was there, and then it was me. I snuck out of the door and into a car. There were heaps of cars and it was night. I was driving out and kept hitting them but kept maneuvering around and got out. She came out to stop me but I got away. The deaths from the wishes happened within 5 minutes, I think, and they were random. I was then near where the dude lived. I found the street and went and found him. He was in a small building like a demountable but it was only room. He let me in and we were discussing the situation. Then it felt weird and we had been waiting for people to arrive. They tipped the building over and we fell on top of each other in the corner of it. They were good guys, but had thought something was up. I went on IMDb after finishing the movie and people were discussing bite marks that the people had. They thought it looked Latin. It had an 8.8/10 rating but not many votes. This guy said it was poorly edited and was lame. It was going to be turned into a TV show. Someone suggested Zachary Quinto (I assumed it was for the bad guy). They said he could say his name like ""I am Scaaarrr"". Some people suggested some people for the female parts, but they were all stupid choices (like tween stars). The person who had suggested Quinto, also suggested Hayden Panettiere. Then I was at home but it was different. My room was next to the toilet which was next to the backyard and my room was away from the other rooms. I could hear bass from some music [note: last night there was loud bass coming from somewhere] . I had been in bed for 4 hours and got up at 2am to go to the toilet. I saw people dancing outside. I got Darren and Mom up and Darren was angry but went to check. He knew this girl out there called Sarah. She turned the bass down and talked to me through the window. She was doing a PVC course? They let out tiny bits of paper to make a girls face."
"3148"	"(2009-10-30 (18)) I was watching Mork and Mindy. Mindy was with Mork. He went into a spaceship and accidentally took off. She cried and it showed him saying like 'when you show total sadness'. She fell asleep. When she woke up she was on the ship. Then it was me. It was futuristic looking and I walked down a hall. I had been separated from my boyfriend/guy I liked. I found some people and they were all girls. They said I was there 'God' and I was supposed to tell them where they came from, etc. There was an island called 'The Eye' and I had been there before in a submarine? The hall had pictures on both sides. One side had pictures from this old magazine. The comics started off 'gross' and violent and as they went on, they got cleaner and 'nicer'. The other side had another magazine which had started out clean, and had gotten more violent. Later I was telling Mom and I said that I didn't want to be stuck with girls and I was angry and upset about it."
"3149"	"(2009-10-31 (18)) I was at school. It was the first day and I had finished the MUPC but I had to finish year 12. Everyone else from year 12 was there. I went to English, but then I realized I hadn't got my timetable yet. This teacher lady was giving them out. Calvin got one, then me and she said I needed to have a chat about Ezra. They wanted me to write to somewhere about him, using my university 'status' to make them do something. It cost over $1000. Elijah was the next in line to get a timetable. As I was walking to class, Eugene passed me and I was trying not to look and be subtle about it."
"3150"	"(2009-11-01 (18)) I was with my boyfriend, who was Jensen Ackles (or at least looked like him). We went to a cinema which was in the US. We came in from the back and it was steep and there were lots of seats. The screen was small and was 'out' of the screen (it was like a TV in the middle of the room). We sat at the back as they were the only seats left. I was like 'it's so busy!'. It cleared out and when some people were left I said 'Back home, this would be busy'. We walked down and got seats in the front row. He didn't hear what I had said so I repeated it, but he didn't hear me again and I repeated it again. He put the arm rest up and I snuggled up next to him. My ex-boyfriend was then behind us and it was AJ from Dawson's Creek (well, his name was AJ and he looked like him). He started trying to talk to me and was getting angry and abusive. Eventually he left. Then Dawson's Creek was playing on the screen. Joey and Pacey were talking and she was talking about ""snakes and puppy dogs tails and I did it with you"" which referenced them growing up together. She kissed him and I was like 'gay'. There was also some stuff about Robert Pattinson and I was like 'he sucks!'. We left there. Jensen wanted me to move to the US. We also had a kid together. I had a girl with AJ too and she was also still a baby. I didn't really want to move. Then I was at the old house and we still lived there. Mom was there. I was playing with the first baby and tickled it and she was laughing and squirming and her face was red (she normally had a red face). I was saying ""You're an ugly child aren't you"" in that stupid baby voice people talk in. I went to my room and I was thinking that I didn't feel different from having a kid. I went to Mom and said that the first kid's face was red. She said she would take her to the doctor's tomorrow morning. She was worried that AJ was trying to poison her. I was watching One Tree Hill at one point and I heard a voice and I said ""is that Haley?"" and then it showed her. Then I was a guy or something and I was with Jamie-Lynn Sigler in the cinema. She was my girlfriend and was wearing jewellery and I felt grossed out by it. She took off her bracelet which was then a necklace and it was gold, but had little bits of silver. She gave it to me and I didn't want to touch it, but I held it and felt sick. She wanted me to have it and do something with it because her ex had given it to her and she didn't like him. I was wondering why I was with her if she wore jewellery."
"3151"	"(2009-11-01 (18)) Janis (FlashForward) and some black cop woman kissed. There was more but I can't remember it now."
"3152"	"(2009-11-01 (18)) I was with Ezra and someone. There was music playing and A Glass of Champagne came on but it was slow. I sang along and at the nickelodeon-y bit, I 'sang' it. I watched Moon and Sam Rockwell was on a big spaceship in the sky that was blimp like. It only made $6000 because everyone downloaded it instead of going to the cinema. I was telling Mom that it should've done well."
"3153"	"(2009-11-02 (18)) This girl was getting supplies for next year at university. Her teacher, who was a guy, told her to go a supplies place that was at the university. Then I was there too and we were both doing a science-y course. Her name was Izzy, and sometimes she was Quinn from One Tree Hill. I got a scrapbook and was waiting at the checkout. She and the teacher were having an affair I think. The teacher guy was hanging around me and she saw and looked annoyed. It happened again a while later. Then Elijah and a girl friend were there. The teacher guy organized for us all to stay there for the night. He was trying to find out if there were free beds at other universities nearby. Notre Dame was nearby and some other place. My eye was burning. As I went to cross the street to go to the carpark, I saw a bus coming and so ran across. It seemed to take ages to get across. We were all sitting around talking in the carpark. Calvin was there, along with Scarlett and some other girls and they were annoying me. There was a bed free at Notre Dame and Elijah took it (he was on the phone to them at the time). He called some girl's boyfriend that was in a race. Scarlett got on the phone and this other girl picked up the phone. The connection got cut. They discovered he had lost the race and was angry. Alek's status on Facebook had sexual, happiness (etc) ratings."
"3154"	"(2009-11-02 (18)) I was in a car on the freeway/highway. There was a flashing light up ahead and we realized there had been an accident. We were annoyed at having to wait in traffic, but when we passed it, there was a person hanging out of the car with a smashed head. Later, I was in a bed with an old woman. I got up and when I came back the wall had collapsed on her head. I took a photo and then I called 000 and said ""I need an ambulance"" and I told them what happened but they didn't seem interested. I had seen a photo of this happening before."
"3155"	"(2009-11-03 (18)) I was in a car with a guy. I can't remember properly, but I think he opened the back doors and pulled my legs out and was going to rape me, but I got him away and locked the front door to lock all the doors. I got in the drivers seat and drove off."
"3156"	"(2009-11-03 (18)) There was some weird stuff going on. I found an online room for DopeWars but it was then like real life. There were rows of tables and people were on each side and there were cards with random pictures. There was a pile of cards and post-its. I decided to play again but I couldn't remember what to do in the real life version. I was then at the old house and I found an old photo. I had a half sister called Loanne. Ezra called her and said ""it's Tommy"". She told him she thought we were dead and it had been 11 years since we last saw her. Dad and Ezra were crying. Then Ezra, some other guy and I weighed ourselves. Ezra weighed less than me. Dad said I weighed 86kg and said no-one seemed to be going down and I said ""I've lost 11kg!"". Then Nana and Poppa were meeting Loanne and some evil people out the back. She was magical? This girl said they had spells and were going to do bad stuff. Alyssa was nearby, and I said something about her fat but not being able to get through the door and she heard and got angry. I apologized and she got over it after a few minutes. The stereo was on and Pour Some Sugar on Me came on. I turned it off to call Nana and then there was a loud noise and they were here. Then Nana and Poppa were inside. The radio was now on 92.9 and the floor opened up and they fell in."
"3157"	"(2009-11-04 (18)) I was waiting for the train but I had to walk somewhere to get something and the train came. I didn't know how it worked from where I was so I walked the long way back to the normal train station."
"3158"	"(2009-11-04 (18)) I had to go back to university to finish off the course. I changed into a 6 year old boy to do one subject and the teacher said I could have the day off since I didn't know anyone. A psychologist there was annoyed because I hadn't done an assignment for that class and I said the teacher gave me an extra day. I was outside. Some girl was giving out awards and a celebrity got one and then walked off. An old lady that was from the church was there. I had invited her there and was talking to her. Then some guy was cleaning up a store and it was dark inside and night. He was washing the windows."
"3159"	"(2009-11-04 (18)) I had powder in my belly button. I lifted the skin and there was a metal like 'hole' in there and there were lots of powder clumps around it. I said ""why do we even have this?"" and I complained because it was dirty."
"3160"	"(2009-11-05 (18)) I was talking to Mom and I mentioned Sam Rockwell to her and I said his father did something and she said 'I know' and I was like 'how the hell do you know?' and she said we were related to him. She had been talking to him through email for a while and had discovered we were related (not closely). I checked my email and I had emails from him. She had sent him some, pretending to be, saying 'I had a crush on you' etc. One said 'don't worry, I'm still your friend' and something about The Pythons. I found out Mom had also been talking to the members of Monty Python."
"3161"	"(2009-11-05 (18)) This teen guy and his grandmother went missing on his birthday. Everyone was looking for him but then he returned with his sister. His grandmother had fallen and died of a heart attack. They had freaked out and hid. They brought back her head. Mom bought me this sea monkey stuff as a present. I opened up a packet of them and they were two small 'fish'. They were weird looking and people-y. I was trying to get the tank sorted out and there was a weird cylinder thing with a swirly thing. I got Mom and Ezra to help me and told them to be careful of the fish. The fish things were kind of sick, but one was a bit better than the other and I liked that one more. We put the water on for the other one and the good one went down the drain. I freaked out but I couldn't get it back. I almost gave up but I gave the sick one a drink and it got better. There was a photo on the back of the box of Darren and his family and they had been making these for years (since 1981). I had had a photo taken but they didn't use it."
"3162"	"(2009-11-06 (18)) I was on the highway with Mom and we were driving to a friend's house. They had a young son and daughter. The son said he had a girl's name (Marsha). She had brought up pizza and garlic bread like stuff. I had a little but I decided not to eat any more of it. I knew Nathan Fillion and we were good friends. There was a pool with a bunny in it. I can't read what I wrote but I can pick out the words 'trouble' and 'suburb'. Anyway, a friend of Dmitri's left a mat (it looks like it says mat) outside of his house and said to pretend that he was going and to wait for his best friend, who was the girl next door (it was apartment like). She liked him and this was all to freak her out. Later Dmitri and I were lying in bed and we joked about sex and his face was close to mine and he laughed and I was like 'ok...'. He quoted from the movie What Women Want and he was in it."
"3163"	"(2009-11-07 (18)) I was at the old house with Mom out the back. I saw cats in the pool and I saw a cat around and I asked ""is that Tigger?"". She and Mittens were both out there. Dad had given them to an old lady nearby. They had on those things they put over their heads but they were huge. They came to me and I gave them a cuddle. I cried because I missed Tigger. Mom said Darren had said he might've taken one of them but had decided not to take either of them. Then I was at home and Mom, Dad, some others and I were going to some place. We drove there and there was a lot of traffic so people were walking on the street. There were lots of people. We decided to walk too. I had to go back home. I was in the kitchen. I saw a reflection of a girl in Mom's doorway and it was my friend, Jamie. I thought she was possessed as the dog growled. I left the house with Mom and Ezra. Ezra got a call and I said if it was Jamie, to tell her that we can't get her. It was her and he made up a bad lie. We went to the train station and Dad said I'd be ok since I had a SmartRider and I said I didn't bring it. He yelled at me and I said 'why would I bring it if I didn't think I needed it?'. We went through but to get a ticket you had to climb this tower and it had this plastic plate thing. You pull it out and climb up on them. I was worried I was going to fall because it wasn't very stable. I got a score of 850 and got a $10 ticket or something. It was enough to get where we wanted to go. Then I had to go back and get my SmartRider while I was there. I had a little dog."
"3164"	"(2009-11-07 (18)) Ezra's hair was long. He brushed it and it looked gay and we laughed. He was then playing a game and always got stuck at the same point. His character went into this mirror maze thing, which had a slippery floor. He slowed down and then we were both there. It was hard to walk. We went into this room which had two doors on each side of one wall and one in the middle. I went to the one on the right and there was a scream, some footsteps and an evil laugh, which scared me. I went through the middle door. Ezra now had a double or something. I told them to try to climb this thing. I went into a hall and I went into this room with a bed and a small set of drawers. I found socks with rubber bits on the bottom. One pair was black with pink rubber bits. I put them on and I was already wearing socks. I went through the drawer but it was all useless stuff. There was an old mobile phone and I was scrolling through this text which explained how to climb. I went out and gave a pair of socks to Ezra and said I forgot about the other guy, but went back and got him a pair. I looked down the hall and it led to some kids rooms. It was dark and spooky down there and I didn't want to go down there by myself so I went to wait for Ezra."
"3165"	"(2009-11-08 (18)) Joshua Jackson was complaining about Peter (Fringe) being lame. I was going through some stuff and found a crunchy snake lolly and threw it away. Mom picked me up. There were toys on the road which I put there to sort out. To get back 'home', I had to climb up these stairs which were held together by some teenager's bubblegum. There was a pretty girl there called Izzy. The teenagers were sitting on the set of stairs I needed to pull down so I waited. Walter (Fringe) scanned something that was 1800lbs (which equaled 80kg) to work out something about me. This boy got bit by a vampire but the process was different. There was only like one vampire in the world. I bought this game and you go from town to town doing puzzles and helping the citizens, etc. Ezra and I were driving and we went through a red light. I said I wasn't going to do this again and that I needed Mom with me."
"3166"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) Crichton (Farscape) was told by some guy to meet this person somewhere. He went and had to go onto a ship. This guy attacked them. He got hurt. Later, he was lying under a laser which would fix him."
"3167"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) There was a place on the computer to plug something in but it had changed so it was harder to get to and there were fewer ports for it as well. I think it had something to do with a game. Ezra found a trick to get past it and they caught him."
"3168"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) I went for a drive. Ezra and Mom were in the front and I was in the back with Roland. When we got back later I watched a movie. Then it was 6am and Ezra came in and said we were going for another drive to see someone called Dawn and Roland came again. We went to a house and I said ""that's new"" (about a gate at the side) and Mom said it wasn't and I said 'yes it is, you used to pull up on the grass there'. She thought and remembered it was new. We talked about pickle sandwiches and Vegemite."
"3169"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) Noah (Heroes), but he was sometimes Tony (The Soprano's), had a spaceship and was selling it to some guy. They were at a restaurant thing. I was then there and we were in the corner with some guy and I was next to him. People came looking for him and he got up and left. I grabbed this bag and I went outside. It was night. Claire (Heroes) and I got into a light pink car. I locked the doors. We went to Tony's house which was weird and had pools out the front. Meadow (The Soprano's) was with us now and there was more than one of her. Claire and I were trying to keep the other ones out of sight. There was a birthday chart and Claire Fisher (Six Feet Under) was on there and she was only supposed to be twelve."
"3170"	"(2009-11-10 (18)) I had to one more trimester of the MUPC but it didn't count towards grades. I sent an email as 'Katy' to them asking about it. I got a reply from Mr Epstein saying they were looking to change it soon. I was annoyed about it. It was also October 14. The subject selection sheet had stuff like newspaper, create, bounty hunter etc. For the bounty hunter one, you had to scan barcodes on people. Calvin was there. We picked the same first choice but he put my second choice as his last."
"3171"	"(2009-11-10 (18)) Calvin and this girl were friends and we were somewhere. She was outgoing and the like. Se took us out down the street which was like in the city. There was some female singer performing a small concert around. You had to be over 18 but I didn't have my proof of age card and I told her. I went back home to get it and then walked back there alone. I walked in and there weren't many people. There were seats, but not many. Everyone seated had Pokemon cards. Calvin and the girl's seats were like 48-49 and mine was 60. Loren Dean was on the stage and I had thought about leaving, but thought I'd stay since Loren Dean was here. The female singer came on too. A girl went up to ask a question, but was nervous and asked ""what's the most, uh, what's um, the most, what-what's the most serious thing you'd like to do?"". The singer went to ask what she meant but she said she meant like 'serious music feeling'. She was annoyed at the nervous stuttering and said so and was like 'hey, you said feeling!'."
"3172"	"(2009-11-11 (18)) I was at Dad's new place. It was different and big and had two storeys, but each one was like a house. He bought the bottom one for me. It was big and there were lots of food and wrappers around the place. I was cleaning it up. There was a bar in the shape of a swordfish. It was sorted by categories such as alcoholic, non-alcoholic, wedding night etc. There were windows all around the house (it was like made of windows except for one wall). I had a lot of chicken fingers stored. I needed keys still. My boyfriend gave me a video to watch. Drew Barrymore and a guy were in it. She proposed to him then he had actually proposed and it was actually behind the scenes footage from Heroes. I was going to put it on Youtube. Then my boyfriend had actually proposed to me through the video. I said to Ezra ""lucky I watched it"". I went to the shop with Mom. Nana had been watching some show with this lady from PETA in it. The lady was hiding out in the shop and Mom needed to gain their trust before she was allowed in. The lady had killed someone too."
"3173"	"(2009-11-13 (18)) Someone was watching Farscape. Everyone looked weird and I realized they were young. I only remember seeing Aeryn and Zhaan and I think they got married. I figured it was like a prequel."
"3174"	"(2009-11-14 (18)) There was a movie called Ghost Ship. This kid kept seeing a ghost of a boy, who had his front two teeth missing, white skin and black stuff around his eyes. He eventually told him to go away and the ghost was annoyed. Then someone and I went on a boat. This doctor guy from the movie and a woman picked up something and they said it was ok and put it down. I read something later about this father who abused his son. The son was found dead in the ocean and had the same look as the ghost kid in the movie. I was telling Mom about it and said it was creepy. Ezra, Jayson and I were hanging out. Nana gave us books to learn different languages though they were Greek books. One of the words was ""2duvduv"". We watched some Greek movie on TV called Skillis and it was a comedy. We got bored quickly and started watching a 60's movie. There was weird tension between Jayson and I and I was 19."
"3175"	"(2009-11-14 (18)) I was driving down Wanneroo Road and I had turned on from Newtown Drive. Then I realized I wasn't supposed to be driving alone and pulled up on the side of the road. I got out and went across the road for some reason. I went back and a guy was in the driver's seat. I opened the passenger door and said ""Get out of my car"" and I stuck something pointy into his gut and said ""what did you take?"". He had a sign and a bunch of other stuff. I told him to put it back and get out. He said I couldn't report him to the school because I was in the wrong and I said ""suck my balls nub"". I ended up somewhere miles away and I was trying to get back. I got a big stick and was walking along the train tracks. Two guys crossed over. I called Mom and waited at a shop for her. She came. I went to the shop and we stayed there for a while. There were tents in there. There were collections of stuff. There was some Beatles stuff. I saw Michael Palin's diaries and a picture of a guy who I thought was Terry Jones at first, but it was someone else. I started jumping and floating and I said I was full of energy. Mom downloaded a crack to protect from something. Ezra wrote something somewhere about her being a noob. We went to Darren's work nd Mom gave him some wallpaper I chose. When we first got there, Mom pretended to order burgers. We were then at some house. There was a McDonald's ad on TV with Selena, Samantha and Alejandro. Dad had some woman come over. I had heard them having sex before? He said ""where did you hear that?""."
"3176"	"(2009-11-16 (18)) I was at university, which was different. Jeremiah and others I knew where there. I complained because I didn't have lunch with me. Jeremiah was like 'whatever' and I was like 'well, you have lunch'. Some lady saw a lite Mars Bar and said ""did anyone lose this?"" and I said yes and grabbed it. I didn't end up eating it though. Then I had a room there or something and it was like a family room thing. I was going to download a game on Steam and asked Ezra if it was on freezone. The game was Left 4 Dead 2, but wasn't. Eugene and I were going out. I curled up next to him on a lounge and we kissed. Later, he wanted sex but I was busy. I was then at the old house and I still had heaps of stuff there, including my bed, desk, toy box and Grey etc. Mom was annoyed about it. I went to bed early in the morning. It was starting to get light outside. I looked up and I heard Mom say ""someone coming"" and they were in bed in Ezra's first room. Mom had bought a sensor that picked up sounds. I think it says they said the rain made it hiss. I went to my room and there were moths everywhere. I was annoyed because I wanted to go to sleep. I had text Dad asking 'how much weight could I use as [something I can't read] , plus others and drinking lite green tea."
"3177"	"(2009-11-16 (18)) I got Left 4 Dead 2. We had the first one for X-Box 360 and so I set it up and got ready to play in HD. Ezra was watching me. I started and you started off in this forest. It was very bright and there was a thin path going through the forest and I was standing one the edge of a cliff thing. Zombies started running towards me. I fell off the edge and bounced off a platform and died. I tried again and this time started shooting them but I used all my bullets and died again. I asked Ezra to play with me. He sat on the lounge and I was sitting at a table and I moved the TV towards me. I had a keyboard on the table and you had to press 'E' to loot. We tried one together and he gave up. Mom had bought a small table and we got it for him to use. We managed to get past the first bit. The character was then Aeryn (Farscape), though she was called Christine. I got to the save place and there was a brown horse there. There were some weapons lying around and I got some and then left. Then it was real life or something. When we left, lots attacked at once. We got to the next place and it was a house. A zombie came in and we killed it and then a cat came in saying something about getting his gun (it was like a vision). I went to the bedroom and searched the cupboards looking for a gun. I was going through the top shelf and I found a box of condoms. There was nothing on the bottom either. Then I remembered that in movies, guns were kept in the guy's underwear drawer. I went to it and found a gun. It was little and very light. I found some bullets but they weren't actually bullets. I heard sex moans and then this guy came into the room and saw me. I explained what I was doing and he was like 'ok'. This other guy joined our group. I got everyone to gather pointy weapons and then we had to leave. We left through the back door and I stabbed a zombie in the head. I was stronger by the way. I found an axe but it was heavy and really big. There were zombies in the way. One of them was talking and I shoved the axe into his head. It was hard to get in. I got him and he fell. Our weapons got blunt etc quickly. I had a popstick and I hit one on the head a few times with it and it died. We got to the next house. A train full of people went past. The house still had electricity and stuff which I was confused about. The people there said they had no weapons. There was one outside but it was slimy and no-one wanted to clean it. There was a pool nearby. A young girl came in crying, holding a black kitten and a bunny and said one had been bitten -- it was the kitten. I took it off her and I was upset and crying (everyone was). I had to kill it and I put it in this thing, like a microwave. Aeryn was with it when it died and I think later, someone said the kid should've been with it."
"3178"	"(2009-11-17 (18)) I was at a party I think. I was sick and had one glass of alcohol and vomited. There were lots of people around and I was trying to get somewhere but was dizzy. I was hungry too. There was a cheeseburger that I hadn't eaten as part of this thing where you save something you managed to resist eating or remains of when you ate it. I kept my vomit too. I was then at the old house in the kitchen. I was reorganizing my vomit and the burger. I kept seeing the 217 lady in the bath in the bathroom. The first time, I glanced back and she was gone. This time, she was still there. She looked at me and I freaked out and started screaming. I tried to call Mom who was actually there and she came in to have a look. She couldn't see her, although I still could and I freaked out again."
"3179"	"(2009-11-17 (18)) I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Mac, Dennis and Charlie were in a big room and were naked (and there were close ups of their penises) and they were high. Dennis had the biggest one. They shook them and Mac and Dennis and had made out for ""two seconds"" once. Later, Dad took me to this underground carpark, and I had to walk to wherever I was going. The way I usually went was blocked with a gate now. I tried to climb over it but couldn't. This lady came and I started walking down to Dad's car and she told me to go somewhere and I said no. I walked through this other gate into this area. There was a path, which led into other areas (surrounded by small fences) and there was lots of grass and flowers and the like. One had lots of dogs in it, and there was a Chow Chow and a Welsh Corgi. I called Mom to get me but there was no answer. I walked through the place and was at Albany Highway train station. I had no money on me. This guy gave me a newspaper. I text Mom and Ezra. Calvin and a girl were there. I looked in my bag and I realized I had about $20. The girl he was with asked if we were ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" and I said no and got up to leave. There was a room there with a platform which took you down to this platform with the train. The one which went down to go to Centerville wasn't there, but I didn't realize at first and almost fell. I was hanging off the edge and got back up. This girl jumped on one and it started spinning around and it killed her. I had a message from Samantha and this other girl, replying to a question I had asked. It mentioned me having something in common with [someone, but I can't read the name] , such as The Beatles and other music. I asked this lady in a restaurant if the train was ready and she said yeah but to bring it back by 11 (it was like midnight). I asked why and she said ""you can't have her forever"" and she was talking about Chiana (Farscape) who had something to do with some service with aliens. I said no I want the train. I got in an elevator with 3 guys and it was squishy. I then had to take a train-like thing to the train. Stuff happened along the way and you had to say something, like fail, ownage etc. Stuff fell from the sky. There were toys scattered on the trucks. One was a big dinosaur toy in the middle of the track. I said ""fail"" and we got past. We ran to the train tracks and it was in the middle of nowhere and there was lots of sand. The train left. Another one came for Centerville and I had to run to the other side. I got in and the seats pulled down and there were about 10 seats. I was also at university at one point and I had to hand out notebooks. One was Grady's, but his name was spelt ""Gradee"" and there was also a book for Gavin."
"3180"	"(2009-11-18 (18)) I was at Toys R Us with Mom and she had cut out a picture of D'Argo (Farscape) on the computer and said he always [did something to her, I can't read it] . He was from another show too. I said he grew on me. Then the other show, he and some others were in a car and they were trying to catch a creature. Someone was like ""who's more important here. You?"" and he said no and then there was a big shadow and some guy was outside. I honked the horn to get it to leave. Mom and some others were in an alley. Bradley Cooper was there and there were some fences and he was in a 'door of fantasy' (led to another realm). We were trying to hide from something. I joined him and then we ran into this glass room. It was inside another room, and was just glass all the way around (in a circle). He said "" [someone] is nub"". We closed the door and then this guy who was like Ralph Fiennes in Harry Potter came and had to use magic to get in. Everyone went crazy and smashed the walls. There was an old guy there. I left and Ezra, some others and I were in a restaurant. A radio station was playing like 6IX. I was looking at the food (it was like a buffet) and there was rice, gnocchi and prawns. James Gandolfini was there too. I said ""Oh my God, they have gnocchi! Gnocchi is my favouritist thing in the world! Must resist the gnocchi"". There was good music playing and some guy changed the station. There was a cover of When I'm Cleaning Windows. I said it was made in ""like 1937"". Down By The River and Driver's Seat also played. Liar, Liar also came on. Then I had gone out with Ramona somewhere. We crossed the street and had a compass with us. I had a pen and I remembered back to when my 'boyfriend' had given it to me and it was like a movie and he had died years ago. He had given me the compass too, I think, and had said to ""point it towards me"". As we crossed the street I cried. We got to Subway and she wanted me to order her food and she gave me $2.25 per thing she got to use for myself. I said that I wouldn't order it. The seats we were at, were facing the wall, which had a mirror on it. I tried to call Mom to get me, but called Dad by mistake. He yelled at me and said he was trying to watch a movie and ""Tom Cruise just killed himself"" -- which was a scene in Risky Business. I waited outside behind a car. Some girl told me to move."
"3181"	"(2009-11-19 (18)) Dad, Ezra, some others and I were on a train thing, but it was like a rollercoaster. I was facing backwards. Living On a Prayer was playing. There was more around and I think we were only allowed to hit them in a certain place which would make them sick? They all stopped. Dad also lived in this caravan thing. He made me a pasta meal. This guy like The Joker was outside and I was going to say 'if they made a movie of you...' but then remembered about 'The Lame Knight'. We were playing some game and Dad and I were on a team and Ezra and two others were on the other team. We were then off the train thing and we were hitting each other with cushions. I was with D'Argo (Farscape) and others. I was then at an old school of mine. I was waiting at the toilet and there was one with stripy toilet paper. This teacher lady recognized me and asked I was now in Year 11 and I said ""no, university"" and she asked if I was doing something in media and I said ""no, science"". The toilet was blocked and there was water on the floor. It had leaked under two rooms behind it (that's what is says, no idea what it means). I left and had to teleport. D'Argo and the others got some sickness from changing realms. It made them into a demon randomly. It also was Runescape sometimes. I had no shirt on and hid in the toilet and I asked this guy to get me a shirt. Jensen Ackles was one of the people I was with by the way. He was sick and was getting something ready and he stopped breathing. I had to use defibrillator on him. It didn't work. Darren said ""so is my son"" because Quincy was dead. I tried mouth to mouth and he started breathing again. We teleported again and it was Runescape. I was at a castle, on the roof. It was dark and cloudy. The King looked like Rygel (Farscape) and needed to get down from the roof. Some people were jumping and he almost fell."
"3182"	"(2009-11-20 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I went to a restaurant on this beach area. It was night. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt and these light blue shorts with fluffballs on them. Dad was wearing the same colour. We got there 'late'. This lady said the special was chicken with a nice spice sauce. When we finally got our meal it was mixed with rice and gravy and they were like 'woops'."
"3183"	"(2009-11-20 (18)) I was at Nana's. Ezra was there too. I went outside and the fish pond was quite clear. There was a big orange fish and I was singing to it. This big silver fish was nearby. I saw something on the bottom of the pond and it was rock like, but then I realized it was a fish. I then realized it was actually a Murloc. I ran to tell Ezra. He was on the computer and was smoking. He said something about a Supernatural convention and he was up to episode 4 of season 5."
"3184"	"(2009-11-22 (18)) I was at home but it was different. I went to go have a shower but Darren was in the bathroom. The shower was in the middle of the room next to the wall (like, sticking out from where the window is and you could walk around the other side). I left to go wait. I saw steam coming out of the fishtank and realized hot water was going in. I pointed it out to Mom and she was on her computer but was like 'meh, there's nothing we can do'. The eel was smaller and there was a crab and other fish. They started to go crazy and I was like ""can't we move them or something?"" and I was freaking. Then it was like a movie. This guy went somewhere to get a wish granted. He was then Jared Padalecki. He was at this place where there were train tracks for like a coal train. Then I was there with Eugene and we ran to catch this person, but we were really fast."
"3185"	"(2009-11-23 (18)) I was at home but it was different. Jared Padalecki was my boyfriend. He wanted to move in and I cleared out some stuff and Darren got some boxes made of this cement stuff. Then we were in a train/bus/plane thing. There were beds and we were sharing one. The vehicle was also alive or something. I took it with me when I left. There was also a young boy and some others. It could only go back down if people gave it money. It let us back down."
"3186"	"(2009-11-24 (18)) I was at the train station but it was late. The next train was in ""900 minutes"". I went to the toilet and there were lots of cubicles and they were back to back. There was a toilet seat that was made out of like Play-Doh and bubblegum, so I didn't go. I told someone at the train station how to catch a train. The train came and I kept texting Mom to tell her when/where to get me. But when I got to where I normally went, something went wrong and I ended up 2 stations away. It was on the way to another one nearby though. The driver asked if we were all ok about it. It was still late and dark now. I said no because my Mom picked me up. This girl was there, whose online name on something was Nikki_08. Everyone kept saying her face looked like a foot. I was thinking that I had seen it written on IMDb. I was talking to another girl about it and she said it was for ""Madeline Zahn"", she meant Zima. She did the MUPC too. We went back to the station and waited. Jakob was there. I was repeating Communications and three other subjects. I had gotten a HD in all of them though. This policewoman offered to let the girl get a needle in her arm? But she missed and there was a bit of blood. I called Mom and she hadn't gotten any of my texts. She said she would leave now. Nikki was saying that her [something] was 20 and looked good and I was like 'ok...'. Darren had gotten a new car because of the bandwidth running out. I was watching Farscape and it was in an alternate reality so I was like ""Yay! No Chiana!"" But she was in it. I also remember seeing Aeryn and Darren."
"3187"	"(2009-11-25 (18)) Dad had knocked down the old house and there were four small units there. The pool was still there. One of the units was 'separate' and could be bought. The others had to be rented. Dad was staying in the place he bought but was changing it. He had had it for 20 months or something. The bed was 'in' the wall, on the ground because the place was tiny. I went on Runescape and Calvin was on there and was level 106. I was shocked at this. He had been playing it quite a bit lately and I checked his account and he had only signed up 5 days ago. He had lots of level 90 stats and lots of quests done. I was annoyed, but realized something was wrong and it also said he had only played for a total of 72 hours. Ezra and I were at the shop. I bought some food with my own money. I got biscuits and Nutri-Grain as it was going to run out tomorrow. Someone asked me for money and I said that I had like $3 and managed to get rid of them. When we left, Ezra ate all the food. I asked Mom to pay me back but she refused."
"3188"	"(2009-11-26 (18)) Granny was sick and stayed with us sometimes. She did some puzzles and a scratchie. Ezra and I had stopped going out to see her (she was in the games room) for no apparent reason. She told me about some scratchie and she had gotten three words with something I can't read, but lost. I checked it and she thought it was like a crossword scratchie and you only won by getting four words, but you actually got money per word. For 13 words you got $9.5 million. She had gotten all the words. I said to Ezra that I didn't know how to tell her (as she had recently had a heart attack). I said to her ""I don't know how to tell you this, but you've won over $10 mil"". She laughed with surprise. I had mail and it was something from the bank or the government. It had a number for something. It was night by the way. I checked if the scratchie had expired and it expired on December 9th. The next day, Mom, Ezra, Granny, some others and I went to the place to cash it in. We went to the counter and they said that it was ""almost $15 mil' and it was all in cash. We got the cash and went to another room. Santa was sitting at the end of a long table. We gave it to Santa, who was a young guy and was kind of hot. He checked the scratchie but he wanted us to bring it back tomorrow and clean it up a little. He said he was excited because he hadn't seen this big a win in ages. This radio show program was on and said stuff about hosters (it looks like that, but I don't remember what it's meant to say)."
"3189"	"(2009-11-26 (18)) Ezra was watching something and I realized it was It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and I went ""Charlie!"" and Mac was also in the scene. I said Charlie was my favourite but I liked Dennis more now because of his hilarious facial expressions. He asked, ""Which one's Dennis?"" and I said the tall, skinny one and pointed him out. I said that Mac annoys me."
"3190"	"(2009-11-27 (18)) I was at the old house with Mom and Ezra. I was sleeping out in the lounge for some reason. No-one would leave me alone. I turned off the TV and lights and then they left. Mom was suspicious I had taken a book of hers. She pulled out a book I had with me, but it was a different book and she apologized. I went to my room and I had been avoiding it because heaps of moths had died in there. I was then at a shop/university and Aliyah was there and said ""oh hi!"". She was doing history to get a pass for human biology. I said I was scared about university next year. This guy made us put something in the car and it was full in the back."
"3191"	"(2009-11-28 (18)) I was at university, which was different. I got a text from Dad about a sticky calculator and he was a teacher. This girl said ""I thought you were here to talk to Terrence"" and I said ""uh, why would I want to do that? I haven't seen him since I was 12"". I saw Evelyn leaving. I also saw Eugene and some others at a table. I couldn't find the proper way out, but I managed to get out. It was hard to walk out to the road. There were two buses on the other side of the road but they both left. I waited for the next ones, and a huge crowd gathered. We waited for the traffic to slow down so we could cross. I text Mom to say that I didn't have my SmartRider. This guy came with a gun and said to give him our phones. I said I didn't have mine. The girl next to me gave him a wallet instead. I pulled out a $5 note and said it was all I had. He told me to stick my hand in my other pocket and I pulled out a 20c coin. The guy now looked like Eli Roth, but was some other famous guy. I was talking to Ezra on MSN over my phone and said ""I'm being held up, go away"". He kept pressuring me to give him stuff. He told us to go, so we all went across the street and he tried to push me into the traffic. I waited at the bus stop. It finally came. I found my SmartRider in my bag. I tagged on twice accidentally. The second time interrupted this girl and she ended up getting left behind."
"3192"	"(2009-11-29 (18)) I was studying medicine. I had blue scrubs and a white coat. Ezra was on a computer and went on this website with a girl called Monica Reunion. Something looked pink. I was also skinny. I told Mom that whatever it was looked pink. I watched the first few episodes of NCIS and it had a weird storyline. This young Asian girl doctor and this guy always had to keep their uniforms on because they were always on call. The snuck off to have sex on a bunk in the on call room. Then it was me, but sometimes Thuy. I had sex with the guy, and I was on top. Then it was like before and I ran to this diet place. The lady outside said that I was perfect (to join) except for one thing and it was because my heart rate was probably high and I would have to pay. I asked her a question about something. There was a boy on a bike and she yelled angrily at him. He had a heart rate monitor on, but it actually measured words that he thought. She said he used to backchat Beethoven. Then she said I passed the test and was allowed in. There was a room with computers and her daughter, an adult, came in. Her two sons came in and they were around my age. It was squishy in the room and my last name was Daughter, but I thought it was weird I hadn't noticed. I went onto an oval nearby and there were some boys playing soccer. I kicked the ball back to them. I felt happy for some reason and I sat on this spinning chair and went across the park, spinning in slow motion. People were watching me but I didn't care. Then I saw this dude on top of a building with a gun. I got off and ran behind some trees. They tried to shoot me. Other people started shooting back. When they were all dead I ran across the street to this house. This Asian guy came down the street and he was the leader of the bad guys. I hit him with an eggplant and he threw it away. He had an avocado and I took it and hit him on the head with it. He died. Thuy came and asked what happened and I said ""killed some Asian guy"". She said he was their worst enemy. I walked down the street and the lady from before was looking for her sister. She was pregnant and I said the Asian guy was dead. These people in another room heard and were like 'yay!'. There was a little chicken and they put it on the fire to singe its feathers. It was special. The lady 'bequeathed' me the owner of it. It was cute and yellow, and had brown on the end of its feathers from where they had burnt it."
"3193"	"(2009-11-30 (18)) I went to this restaurant place but it was like a cinema. There was a small TV in front. They were watching Office Space. I saw Ron Livingston but he looked different. People from school were there and we were all on Facebook. I found a photo with Eugene and he had commented on it. Eugene, Samantha and others were hanging out to discuss university life. There was a movie on and people didn't like it so they left. I got a project and stuff for it. Before Ezra could get some movie in, there was The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and some new movie but he wanted Spiderman. Later, I went out the back with Mom. She said she invited Meyer over to hang out, ""but I'm not a lesbian"". I said ""I didn't say you were""."
"3194"	"(2009-12-01 (18)) I was at Nana's. Mom was there too but she left. Then Dad left. I decided I didn't want to stay and asked them to come back and get me."
"3195"	"(2009-12-01 (18)) I was at school and we had an assembly in this big room. This guy told us we got 'free' lunchtime now, which meant we could decide when it started and ended. Ms Solomon wouldn't tell anyone her kids last names, then someone was like 'duh, it's Faisal'. I left and called Mom. She was at a radio station outside of town trying to ""get to 100°C"". I tried to call Dad but didn't get an answer. I walked out and saw Mr Reilly. I realized I had no keys. I found some food Mom had recently eaten, which was from a place in 'Liddleton'. I tried to find it. Ezra was friends with Jensen Ackles on Facebook."
"3196"	"(2009-12-02 (18)) I was at Nana's. She went out because of an emergency, but it wasn't. I heard this thing about how Ryan Kwanten had recently purchased 3 TV shows and one had already been cancelled. Another was a reality show where the people do competitions and get eliminated. I watched a bit of it and it was good. Then I was watching The Great Dictator. It was actually funny and good, which I thought was surprising since it was Chaplin. There was a jetty and people were walking onto a boat. Chaplin was behind them and by the time he got there, the boat had left and Hitler's had arrived. Hitler got off and Chaplin got on. The crew thought he was Hitler. Then I was outside somewhere and I'm not too sure what was going on, but I was with Seth (The O.C). They were after us and we were trying to get on a boat. We went through a house and into the backyard and we were getting shot at. We went into the pool. We lifted our heads a bit later and there were more shots. I had trouble staying underwater. I managed to get somewhere with cover and we 'fell' over the fence. As we went over we saw Summer (The O.C) in another backyard. They shot and we saw bodies in the pool. There was a road next to the house she was at and there were three rows of houses. There was an alley next to us. She unlocked a gate and I was now Seth and I ran to the end of the alley. She had trouble opening the gate and then we hugged and kissed on the lips. But then I was me, but not, and I was actually going out with Seth. We left and there was this thing were people heard something and then went into groups of three (and no-one knew anyone else). We were going to pretend that was going on if we were caught. We went back onto the street and it was in America and these people were celebrating. But they were actually the bad guys. I went to go surrender to them at one point, but they started coming at me so I quickly 'flew' around this corner."
"3197"	"(2009-12-02 (18)) I asked Mom to wake me up by 11.30am. The next morning at 11, she left with Ezra without waking me, but I woke up anyway. I was getting ready later for the comedian thing. Dad came over and I still needed to do my hair. Mom said it would be done in a minute. She took too long so I did it myself. Dad had long hair and we straightened some as a joke. I finished my hair quickly and then I saw it was 7.45pm and I panicked and said we had to leave. We left and Dad went to get cigarettes on the way and there were also road works going on but he didn't seem to be worried about the time. I was watching Supernatural and I was in it. Sam, Dean and I were walking down a street and a train came. Sam was on a bed and Dean and I were pushing it. It did something weird and landed behind us. Sam's leg stretched really high and he took a step and then was back to normal. Then as a joke, Dean leapt into my arms and I carried him a fair way. Sam tried to do it, but couldn't. Then he got heavy and I put him down. Something else happened and it had something to do with spells. We got onto a bus which was actually a library or something though. They started talking to the bus driver and I said ""hang on, isn't he supposed to be the Trickster?"". I said I watched Band of Brothers recently and something else he was in. He changed into the Trickster and was like ""she's good"". I said ""not really, I saw the next episode preview and it showed the Trickster"". He had down the stuff to us earlier. There was a huge queue outside and there was an ugly guy with a mole. It started to rain and everyone started running into the rain. The Trickster wanted me to leave and opened the door. Sam leant over and shut it. I liked him and I think he liked me, by the way. Dean mentioned wanting to sit at a table with Bela. She was there and we were all acting silly. Bela kissed Sam on the cheek/neck. There was also some place called Twilight and we joked that the Trickster liked Twilight. There was also something to do with a ""Pokemon handbook""."
"3198"	"(2009-12-03 (18)) I was an alien or at least, I was friends with some aliens. We were in an outside area surrounded by fences (there were lots of areas and they were all joined together). Sometimes I was inside. We had people in one of the areas to keep them safe. One of them and I went two blocks away. He had an alien gun. I said ""don't I get one?"". He said no. People were coming. We then found a gun buried and he gave it to me. I couldn't remember how to use it. I was now definitely an alien. He showed me how to cock it and told me to aim at something to hit a mask to practice my aim, but then we heard them coming. I went behind the other guy and then they came in and we started shooting. The gun shot out a liquid which exploded but it had to recharge; so there was lots of 'bang' but then a five second pause. Then they came from the other side. There were only a few left on the first side. Jennifer Carpenter wandered in from that side. I said ""Jennifer, go through that door"" as she was friendly with us, though she looked really confused and lost. I aimed behind her and started shooting again. Then I was inside somewhere and there was a round counter in the middle (like in bars). There were a few people around, including Bill Clinton, who was the president. I shot liquid on him and he exploded. Everyone seemed shocked and I said ""is that bad?""."
"3199"	"(2009-12-05 (18)) Calvin and I went on a boat? It was a place for the MUPC. I had done the assignment before. I had to roll a dice for something (there were like 30 of them). I told them I was here for that. There was an elevator and Calvin stopped it, but it was only half way. We let it go and it was ok. We got in and everyone complained it was too small. We got there and just had to play around. Ms Edmundson got angry and annoyed with us. I found some notebooks at a shop that had been written on. I was like ""what a douche"". There was a table and we were told to sit there quietly. Then she came and said that maybe we should split up and I said ""why?"" and she said ""you have the rest of your lives to spend together"". I was like ""pfft"". I got the dice out a while later for some reason."
"3200"	"(2009-12-05 (18)) Clayton and I were running through buildings and such in a town or a school. There was a room with grass and steps inside. There was stuff on the outside and we climbed it. Then there was like an earthquake. We held on and it was kind of fun. Then there was a little kitten which was special and could breathe fire. I was watching Dawson's Creek with Mom. Joey and some guy had been trying to have sex for ages but something always went wrong. Sometimes I was Joey. She and the guy got into a car and the guy pretended to be a taxi driver and drove them around and someone was trying to kidnap them."
"3201"	"(2009-12-06 (18)) We went for a drive and it was late at night. I was with Mom and Ezra. There was a little ball of light that looked like it was floating. We were living in this place which like a caravan park, but it wasn't. It was like a small community thing. We went back a while later and there was a cloud with the light and there were sparks. It was worrying me. At some point we went to see some live concert in a small area in a tunnel. We couldn't stand and it was hard to get a seat. This young Indian guy got offered a house if he called the owner and get him to sell and do something else. We drove home and we lived near the beach. I was with some guy. Chiana (Farscape) had some food like those Turkish meat things. I signaled someone to get me some but realized she made some for me. I couldn't remember what they were called. We went to Dad's house. It was clean around the side and there was a toilet in his bedroom. We left the caravan park again. We stopped at a shop. The car was next to a window and I was on Ezra's side and he was on mine. I locked my door. Mom came back and this girl got in the passenger seat. Mom and I kicked her out. I was worried she would follow us. Then I realized it was a dream. I was scared and wanted to wake up. Then I opened my eyes and felt tired. I was now 'awake'."
"3202"	"(2009-12-07 (18)) We went through a drive thru at a takeaway place. I saw a car behind us and Jamison was in it. I joked around with Ezra and Samantha. Jamison' boyfriend was called Bill. Samantha drew a picture at university saying 'you should be with Damon' -- she meant Calvin. I was like 'ew no'. I asked this lady behind a counter when we would get our offers for university. She checked on the computer and said I had only put down Veterinary Science. I realized it was 'Jessica Holden' and I said it wasn't me. There was an online poker game at 4pm (US) which meant like 4am here. Robin Williams was in it and was doing well but then we realized he didn't actually know how to play. Nana and Granny were over. Grey's Anatomy was on. Teddy was in a hospital bed and Meredith visited her. I read that Kim Raver was moving was to my state for 'social [something] ' so she was only in 5 episodes but I figured that because of the move she was in more."
"3203"	"(2009-12-07 (18)) I was watching True Blood. Sookie died and turned into a vampire. Someone complained about it. Then it was real life. Three others and I were vampires. We could go in daylight at the moment. Someone was walking 'cool'. I watched a movie with Dad and Ezra. Nicholas Cage was in it. He had died and Dad was upset? Dad asked ""who's Angelina Jolie's husband?"" and I said ""Brad Pitt""."
"3204"	"(2009-12-08 (18)) I was in a room with Ezra and some others (there was about four of us). There were lots of beds. There were zombies. We were on the second floor or so. We had to leave and Ezra was worried and checked outside but nothing was there. We suggested other places to look. I went to the window in the toilet and looked out and I saw some. There was a light on in front of our house/building. The curtain wasn't staying up properly now. It was also like a game and you could 'loot' -- I got new shoes from looting. Then we were outside. To get to other places you had to use this complicated rope system. You had to hold onto the rope and swing onto the platforms. Someone fell. I almost fell off and lost a bunch of stuff, but didn't. I think Mel Gibson had been part of our group or something and someone said something that referred to ""the stranger that took him"". He was in some show called Macabre and that was his character's name. It was Tom Cruise's kid's birthday and he sent him to 'Cowboy Land'. He had a black maid and he was like ""What? It's cowboys!""."
"3205"	"(2009-12-08 (18)) It was my birthday. Mom was giving me money, but not yet. Darren was going to the shop to buy stuff for cheese and onion pie. Raquel gave me a bag of stuff and I said ""this is the most exciting thing I've gotten all day"". There was something about jumping off something into the ocean. When I was younger, a heap of others and I had done this, jumping from rocks. Some kid had hit the rock. There was a photo of him and he was like 30-40 now. I saw him somewhere and wanted to meet up with him. There was a queue for something. Then I was at home, which was different. I was organizing some mess. A baby had gotten kidnapped and there was an x-ray and pictures of other babies. They chased this guy. They were in a taxi and there was a fat guy. This guy got out and the fat guy punched him through the glass, which smashed."
"3206"	"(2009-12-09 (18)) I was excited because I was seeing Whose Line is it Anyway live. Mom dropped me off there late. I went down some steps and sat at the bottom of the stairs. I had a long microphone with me. There was a break now and Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles left. I got bored and felt funny about the microphone. I text Mom to get me and got a 'rap' text back and I figured it was from Ezra. I walked out to the carpark. I used the microphone as a cane because my legs were sore. She was already there and I got in. Ezra said that he got Jensen Ackles' ""signature"" and I was like 'what?!'. He said that this teacher who was obsessed with him told him that he was somewhere. He had a photo and on the back it said ""from Jensen"" and I said that he should've gotten him to write ""love, Jensen"". Jared Padalecki was also in the photo. I was annoyed and said that I wanted a photo. Mom was like ""you love Sam"" and I said ""Sam's gay""."
"3207"	"(2009-12-10 (18)) Our house had two floors. There was a hole in my floor under my desk. Water shot through. I went and woke Mom and she said she would get Darren up. He came to look. He took the carpet off. There were lots of pen size holes which he thought were caused from where something had fallen. He said I couldn't have the desk here all the time and I said that I couldn't put it anywhere else. He went off and I was trying to work out what to do. I was going to ask why but he had gone back to bed."
"3208"	"(2009-12-11 (18)) There was some event on soon. I went over to the neighbours. They were a couple and there was a cake with eggplant on it and it said ""Happy birthday"" on it. They asked if it was ok and I was like 'I suppose'. I wanted to enlarge it but it was too difficult. There was some dancing mummy dude. Then it was like the next day and the event was on. I went over to help them. They had a picture that I'd drawn and they packed it up, but I went back and they gave it to me. I walked out with it, holding it flat in front of me. Our house was a while away. I walked across the street and a car came. The wind blew and it started acting like a parachute thing and I had to let go. I chased after it and it was ok. Dad was outside with Ezra and he was like ""that better not have been your picture"". I had to go back in with Ezra to get the cake. As we left he said there was a song on before that he thought was catchy. I also had my iPod with me so I could listen to it on a drive."
"3209"	"(2009-12-11 (18)) Thea Gill, Michelle Clunie and I were friends. We were on a train. There were people throwing stuff and we moved to the end carriage. I think people weren't happy with gays. There was a cartoon and you could watch it in colour, although it was made in black and white. Some people were trying to run from some witch person and they ran into a different motel room. The witch found them. I think they went to her 'lair'. It was science fiction looking. When they walked through the front entrance, they started walking across and platforms appeared as they stepped on them. This girl came in from another side and nothing appeared and she fell. The witch or whatever, sent a ship to save her."
"3210"	"(2009-12-11 (18)) I was sharing a room with Ezra? Roland was over too. I went to bed with no pants on because it was hot. I woke up and I had to get out of bed to find my pants, but Ezra and Roland were awake. The light was off though. Roland was looking for something under the bed with a torch. I found a pair of red shorts and left to go to the toilet. As I left, Don't Ever Change started playing. The toilet was small and there was one on the side wall too. Mom had a cinema and she was in the projector room playing with the screen resolution. The popcorn was made in there too. I asked if when it was open, could I work in here and she was like 'of course'. The cinema was in a mall. We left and when we were going back we went through all these shortcuts that were full of people to get to it. Mom was angry about it. Ezra brought flowers to the cinema and they had bees in them. I got a butterfly and brought it to Mom. There was a big black one and it was the size of a cat. We got chased by a giant robot."
"3211"	"(2009-12-12 (18)) I was outside with Samantha and Calvin at school. He told her to run around this area and me to just stand there. It was an experiment that he was filming. He ran to the top of the oval and Samantha was still here and said if he did something for 10 minutes straight, he would collapse. We went up the hill and there was a crowd of people. He was mumbling nonsense and they were trying to give him water. I was holding a Sakata. Eugene came and saw my Sakata. I was trying not to look at him and it seemed as though he was waiting for me to look. I went to class. Mom pulled out old school stuff of mine. There was a game I made in year 6 and it was like a mad lib but you just filled in the last word. She tried to explain it but she didn't make sense. I told her to give up. There were Goosebumps books. I said ""Beast From the East for the win!"". There was a presentation about some computer thing."
"3212"	"(2009-12-12 (18)) I was in the car with Mom in the middle of nowhere. There was a bridge with wood slats. There was another one which also had gaps. We drove fast and then [did something I can't read] for the last one because it wasn't far. We went into a building. There was a concert with Bruce Springsteen and some guy. Springsteen's nickname was ""Boxy"". I had something and we mentioned holes and he gave me a light shovel and said we had to ""dig a hole for safety""."
"3213"	"(2009-12-12 (18)) I was watching Monsters Inc. with Ezra. It was totally different and was also a musical. The little dude was sent to a place where they were keeping these aliens. The aliens looked human. They had been there for a while. The big dude came later. The little guy would hide out in rooms, but they could see everything anyway. Then I was there in a room. I threw a letter and something else away and straight away there were replacements in the mail. I walked past some pregnant ladies and babies. They said they sent them out, but killed them. Calvin was there. We were trying to plan an escape. This young kid called out to an alien and then hid behind some people. I went over and pointed at this brown-ish kid and said ""it doesn't feel like [name] or taste like [name] "" and poked my tongue out. They laughed and the people in charge were satisfied (that I was one of them, or whatever). Then Calvin, his 'cousin' (who looked like Dewey), and heaps of others and I were on a bus. His cousin looked like a raccoon because everyone was in makeup and dressed up for a play or something. We turned the corner and he fell on me. We had trouble getting back up. I saw a poodle. Then I was somewhere else with Ezra. Dad took us to Granma's to tell them we were staying with Dad."
"3214"	"(2009-12-13 (18)) I was sitting in my car. I was at school. Some kids were playing around outside. I wound the windows up and locked the doors. This older girl came. One of them was a second cousin of mine. I had only known them for a while. The older girl was trying to get in the front window. I pushed her out and wound the window up. She could reach her fingers through the door handle from the outside. I got in the drivers seat and drove off. I was looking for somewhere to park it. Mom came and we left. A long time later, I went back and they had found it (the car). We gathered items for a quest, which was called Toad Hunter. The rest of my group wanted to do it tomorrow."
"3215"	"(2009-12-14 (18)) I was doing some course (MUPC or school or something). Raquel was also doing it and she was sitting next to me. We were told we were going to watch Das Boot. I was talking to Raquel about it. I said the ending was awesome, ""when he dies"". She looked at me blankly and she hadn't seen it. There was a scene with some guy swimming. He reached for a coin and this shark bit him. Raquel asked the teacher if she had to watch it. The teacher was Ms Solomon sometimes. She said ""you haven't seen anything like that before"". I said ""I have"" and she was like 'you think you're cool because you've seen it'. She took us to a room. She asked if we'd seen a bit of this cartoon and I said ""I don't do cartoons"". She showed us one and it was porn. I left. Later, they brought two guys in as it was ending. It changed into something else. Later I was with Mom in the car. I was supposed to be going to university or something but Mom wanted to go get something. I thought I'd just message Raquel for the notes later. There was a cupboard at the old house. There was special stuff and Das Boot ""extra [something] "". There was a slang sheet."
"3216"	"(2009-12-15 (18)) There was a movie with Jensen Ackles and one with Jared Padalecki. I watched the one with Jared Padalecki one night and I think it was good. I went outside. It was late and I can't remember what I was doing but I was trying to breathe quietly so I didn't wake the neighbours. There was something about the movie out there. Ezra was around at some point. Later I went through a drive thru with Mom. We had to put our credit card in a slot. The girl at the counter asked us what country and we told her. I did something and she laughed and said she was on something with a president."
"3217"	"(2009-12-15 (18)) I was in class at a table. I was with Ezra and others. We were playing Monopoly. I was late there and then we started. No-one wanted me as the banker. We had to roll five dice to decide who went first. Then it was a movie. This girl and a guy got caught. This teacher guy said everyone else got today and six hours to prepare for the next test, but they had to do the test now. They had six hours to do it though. Then I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We took our time because we were waiting for this guy, who was called Marlowe. We went to leave and then he turned up. We asked if he wanted to stay over and he said yeah. Mom drove off and he was close behind. Then it was the movie again. The next day, the guy from before hugged the girl from behind. They had to go to a funeral and the test was supposed to be at 4. He mother was supposed to work but she wasn't going."
"3218"	"(2009-12-15 (18)) I was at university. Ms Eckert was teaching. Evelyn was also in the class. We were given a strip of paper and scissors. She told us to cut something out. Everyone left except for Evelyn and I. I got bored so I got my ruler and sliced off the pieces instead of cutting them. She said I lost the race. She said we had to cut it and so the stuff properly to see who comes first. I went to get another one. It was a picture of a Runescape Christmas. I had gotten a distinction on one of these tests and was 100th percentile in the school. This guy I sort of liked was talking. I called Mom to say I was ready to get picked up. I walked out along with the guy and some girl. We stood at the edge of the road. A big bus came and people were standing and trying not to fall. Someone had a blue striped leg with holes and their big toe was upside down?"
"3219"	"(2009-12-16 (18)) Helo (Battlestar Galactica), Dad and I were invited into some secret thing. It had something to do with The Hulk and there was a picture of it. Mom and I burned all the evidence. Some people came for dinner and Mom slipped up. I was in the other room and pretended not to notice. Dad was also at the table. We found at later he was involved and when we found out he said we could have our account back. Then they captured Helo and tired him up and tortured him. He told them everything within a few minutes. It turned out I was the secret. They got me and I said to treat me like a human being or I'll just sit here. This guy came over and I moved away. Helo cleaned himself up. Then Ezra and I were in a shop and I think he was trying to kill some animals at a pet shop using a bowling ball. I tried to stop him and he tried to kill me. Something exploded. He threw something at a window, which smashed. We had a fight in a clothes shop. He was like 'it was supposed to explode', so I ran. Then a window exploded and started sucking everything in. We both ran through this carpark into the forest. I was then walking along with a girl and it was foggy. There were 3-4 African girls somewhere. I got to this place and I had a puppy and other animals. I let them out. This girl had a dog and it had white stuff coming out of its bum and I told everyone to be careful."
"3220"	"(2009-12-16 (18)) Some people were after me and this guy. We ran into a shop. I had recently lost my shoes and I grabbed some more but I grabbed two left ones. I kept trying to look but the people kept turning up. We ran to the back of the store and into the toilet and locked the door. I sat at the door to hold it closed. They got in anyway. We attacked and got out. We found a fancy hotel place. There was a room with a spa bath etc. My friend died. I took his shoes which were big, but they fit. When I locked the door, I hit a button which sounded the alarm. They came and I left. Later, I came back. There was a pet shop and I got a uniform. They had a Chow Chow creature and the people were after that."
"3221"	"(2009-12-18 (18)) I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dee entered a weight lifting competition and got Dennis, Mac and Charlie to help. For every level they went up, more weights were added and it got to a ridiculous amount. They edited something so much there was so resemblance. She asked for help again. I think Terry Jones was asked to lift weights and he said ""no I'm fucking not"". I said [someone] might like that, and I meant to get the guys to kiss him. Later, I was at home and Mom was on the computer. Dee came and told me something and he clapped. I said it was my idea, saying ""bromance"". Mom and Darren laughed but were confused about it. An old friend of Mom's came over and so did Meyer. Someone mentioned a movie with two guys and I said ""Jason Segel!"" (talking about I Love You, Man)."
"3222"	"(2009-12-18 (18)) Mom did something and a singer guy made a song called 'Sasha Off Cliff'. We heard gun shots or something across the road. I locked the door (we were at the old house). Mom went to have a shower and I was at the door. Then there was a tap on my shoulder and this guy was there with a gun. There was a knock on the door. I reached into the other room and grabbed a bin. There was another guy at the door and I hit him with the bin and he shot his gun. I threw the bin at him and held it down on him. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt and I got blood on it."
"3223"	"(2009-12-20 (18)) I heard about some puppies that were available. They were cute as hell. At some house the dogs were blocking the door. This guy had to speak with Mom. The pups were Akita Inu's. I told Mom that a Shiba Inu was what I had wanted originally. They were small dogs but they were cute. The males weren't very nice looking though but I was going to get one."
"3224"	"(2009-12-20 (18)) I went to a friend of Mom's with Mom and Ezra. They had Labradors but they were too old or something."
"3225"	"(2009-12-22 (18)) This guy at a petrol station was talking to Serena and Blair (both from Gossip Girl). There was something about Led Zeppelin and another band. The lead singer was someone's boyfriend so he could help them. Blair told him stuff in return. I can't read what I wrote, but he said something and Blair answered him. But they both liked him. Lillian started talking to him and flirting with him. He had tan skin. Lillian turned away and told him not to joke around. They were both breathing heavily and he reached his hand around her and they kissed on the lips and then made out. A kid walked past, unfazed. I had a dog and he was spotty and it was actually Mom who had gotten the dog. I think it was a poodle thing. I woke up at midnight but I thought it was noon. I was watching TV later and there was a movie from 1926 with Humphrey Bogart. Supernatural came on. Mom and Darren came home and started watching the episode. I was thinking they would know where the name 'Dean' came from, but I was thinking that Sam was my favourite character at the moment."
"3226"	"(2009-12-22 (18)) I was at the train station, which was different. Noelle was there and she looked the same and I was trying to get a photo of her for my Wiki. She moved and asked if I was taking a photo of her and I said no. Later, I was living/going out with her? I wondered why. I left my computer and when I came back she was on it, on the net. It was in my room. I had a photo on the floor of me and Jared Padalecki from Comic-Con, and also the one of me and Jewel Staite. I had a stupid smile on my face in the one with Jared and I was annoyed about it."
"3227"	"(2009-12-24 (18)) Mom got me into some concert. This guy said it was ""The Smiths"" and I was like ""Oh my God YAY!"". Savage Garden came on singing I Want You. They got stopped though because they weren't supposed to be on. Then The Smiths came on and it was a song called 'My Princess' which was a duet with Madonna and it went for like 10 minutes. I changed my status on Facebook to ""*Squee!* Morrissey!"" Savage Garden stood in the background and were annoyed and embarrassed. I went to a pet shop and I met this guy with a beard (it was black). There were lots of puppies and kittens. There were mice and they could get out and had leads on. There was a Timezone and it was closed but I went in and there were police outside. I waited for Mom to come get me."
"3228"	"(2009-12-25 (18)) There was a new episode of Supernatural out. It started weird. It started off with Sam and Dean but they were with a girl, who was Rachel McAdams, and were following her. It was funny. She was in a skimpy Santa outfit. These guys had made a resort full of prostitutes. She was talking and saying that she fully supported it. Then when she was out of sight of them (the guys who had made the resort) she told a heap of the girls to run. Some got caught. Then it kept reversing and kept happening over and over. The son of the leader guy liked her but he was evil too. The subtitles on the screen were funny and one was about tacos. Some nerdy girl was going to something that some guy called Terence D'Arby was doing and she was excited about it. At the end of the episode it showed a newspaper with Sam and Dean's faces in a crowd and they were on a list of names. I was like 'that's kinda gay"". There were some people with a Labrador puppy and it was acting weird. I realized that it was Sylar (Heroes). This girl in the family realized and he showed himself to her. He mentioned some cat was missing. The girl was now me. I said ""you killed my cat?!"" and he said ""I didn't say anything about killing"". There was a movie with Robert Downey Jr. and he had a weird ring on his right little finger."
"3229"	"(2009-12-26 (18)) I went to the newsagency with Mom. The guy behind the counter was kinda hot and was called Warren. He had given Mom something on World of Warcraft. She said she hadn't used it yet. There was a joke about me and someone who looked like me ""can't tell the difference"". I got the Dolly diary and it had green and blue stripes. There were two versions, one with the blue on top and green on bottom and vice versa. I went outside and Roland was there and was wearing a Spongebob shirt. There was a dog in the back of our car and he was called Roland. I thought it was weird that I hadn't noticed. Ezra said he thought he had gotten bitten by a spider. I flicked through the diary and there was a picture of Jensen Ackles in the back. Ezra was watching TV later and this show came on called 'Sullivan Bro's', which was like a spin-off from Heroes."
"3230"	"(2009-12-27 (18)) I was with Mom in the car. We passed Stormwind St and I told her that Stormwind was a city in World of Warcraft. We went to a pet shop and there were mice and puppies. There was a shih-tzu and a weird Labrador. It had long fur and looked silver on the tips and was silky. There were kittens too. Ezra and I were waiting outside. There was a plant. We heard someone talking and Mom too. They mentioned us and I tried to hide behind a huge red capsicum. They caught us and accused us of snooping and I denied it and said we came to look at the plant. I had a little puppy and he got put in the microwave with Amelia's milk. He got too hot and I quickly got him out. Granma joked about Amelia being cute and me being ugly."
"3231"	"(2009-12-28 (18)) Rover was playing with Amelia, gently. She was laughing etc. I wanted to take him away from her but they kept playing. Mom was there."
"3232"	"(2009-12-28 (18)) Ezra and I were playing World of Warcraft and were killing stuff. Then I was in bed with Jared Padalecki and we were having sex. I was on top and it was dark and it was fast. We stopped because we realized that Aunt Sally, Ezra and others were out there. Then we were all going for a walk. Darren had this big orange sock and a thick white one because he didn't like wearing short socks and shorts."
"3233"	"(2009-12-29 (18)) This girl got kidnapped by two guys and I think she sort of knew one of them. What had happened was he had asked her to lock up as he was going out for cigarettes. When she got to the door, she heard another voice. She tried to lock the door but it wasn't working. The other guy was Ted Bundy, although it didn't look like him. There was a recording of him killing her and him talking about stuff. The other guy was called Thomas, I think. Then I was at Nana's. I was reading about it on the net but icons weren't showing and Ezra thought something was wrong, but then it worked. Nana and some lady kept saying to me stuff like 'it's ok', thinking that I was scared by it. I got sick of it and went out and I said ""Ted Bundy's my favourite serial killer"" and said I've read everything about him etc. Nana had this look on her face but I didn't know what it meant."
"3234"	"(2009-12-30 (18)) I was watching Friday the 13th, but it was different and I was in it, or something. I was at some place near a forest and there was a party. I got away. I went to Cat Haven. This guy was there. The whole place was inside and there were only like 10 cages and they didn't put them down. I said I wanted to say a quick hello. Tigger and Gizmo were there. He asked for my name. The next day I got there early and no-one was there. Also, one of the rules was 'don't refuse anyone'. This lady came and took Tigger (like bought or adopted her). I told Mom and Ezra in the car later and I cried. Then it was just me and Mom. She saw some cops and went down this alley, but it was a walkway. We got to the top of it and this taxi drove past. They signaled the cops. We got out of the car and I took my shoes off and we went down some steps into this apartment like area and it was inside and underground. We walked through and out into a park thing. The cops and another cop car were on the street. This black guy climbed the fence and went into formation to say ""Police!"". He arrested Mom and gave me her car keys. I went to the top and my shoes were gone. I thought they must've been stolen but I couldn't remember if I had even brought them. I went to a shop and when I left I realized I didn't have my phone on me. I saw a girl kick it away and I went and got it and found my shoes. She had stolen them and we got into a fight. I gave her a deep paper cut and I had a strange pattern on my wrist. Later I went back to the Cat Haven and she came and we had another fight."
"3235"	"(2009-12-31 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was on a farm. There were three sets of mobs that I had to kill. I had to change each one to a different setting as I went around killing them. There were two flight masters right next to each other. Ezra was with me later. Then I was watching One Tree Hill and I paused the episode on Haley and Nathan. Ezra was like 'Yes I know she's in the movie' -- we were going to the cinema later. I said 'oh yeah, I forgot'. Jensen Ackles was also in the movie. There was an episode of Supernatural and Sam's fake name was 'RPlecki' and I thought it was funny. I also watched The OC and Summer was in a hospital bed and was like asleep. She was angry at Seth. He came and was watching her through the window. They then had sex in the bed and were messed up in the blanket and her father came in. But he had just imagined it all and was still standing out there wondering what to do."
"3236"	"(2010-01-01 (18)) We had those little puppies we looked at. They were ""under 34 days"" old, so we put them near a cat. They sucked on it but nothing came out and then we realized it was a cat. Mom, Ezra and I went somewhere that was like a Timezone and it had games outside (inside the shop, but outside the Timezone). It was night. There were heaps of people were at the games outside but inside it was really quiet. They were setting up a ride. It had a long seat. People got on, including a guy with a dog. It had no railing, and it went up and then he was like 'oh maybe I should've put the dog down', then it fell off his lap onto the mat, but it was ok. We went on and it weighed us, using a thing which put two bags on top of each other. My first one was full and a tiny bit of the second, Mom's first one wasn't full and Ezra's was less than mine. I covered up mine. We were at a shop later with Mom and Darren. He had this red and black umbrella/raincoat thing and it was spiffy."
"3237"	"(2010-01-02 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I came across a Blood Elf Warlock and threw some snowflakes on him. A short time later I came across an Undead Rogue and threw snowflakes on him and got the achievement."
"3238"	"(2010-01-02 (18)) We were watching some show of Ashton Kutcher's. Mom and I went to a house with others. Their TV was stingy quality. Mom saw a set of books about insects in the bookshelf and was like 'I love these!' and chatted to the people. We went to leave and Darren was asking about the TV. Mom and I drove somewhere. It was night. We went to a petrol station to get those fruit biscuits with chocolate on them. As we left, this black guy came out into the street with a knife. We drove off and went around. We came back around and another guy was there (a white guy). I got out of the car and ran. I heard a noise and I saw the car drive off. I ran back and Mom was on the ground. We saw him trying to scam some guy and we warned him. There was a Labrador puppy and we told him to warn someone else. He was actually a bad guy but he helped us. This guy shot some people and there were a few left. I said we had to help each other now. I walked past this pyramid which I had to search for a quest on World of Warcraft. Ezra wanted to go to some artifact thing."
"3239"	"(2010-01-04 (18)) I was watching a local movie called Razor [Something] . Dad had recommended it to me. I had seen previews for it. It was actually American though. Katie Cassidy was in it. Some people were divided into three groups and were all given a needle thing that had different effects. One made the group jealous. A flying insect came. Then it was sort of like real life. Dad left. The other people either died or left too. When they came we had to do something. I was annoyed because Comic-Con was on. I ended up going anyway and I saw Jared Padalecki there. Then Jensen Ackles was somewhere else. There was a nervous guy with a guy called Justin Comics. I saw Ms Eckert in the car park. I was with Dad and Ezra. She came to talk. Daryl came past. There was a movie thing and these things were coming to life randomly and there was no control over them."
"3240"	"(2010-01-04 (18)) These girls were bullying this girl. I helped the girl and I think I tore something of theirs. I yelled at them. Then it was a show. This guy said his first thought was to burn the place. I had to get somewhere and I called Stephen Rea for help but he was drunk. Mom wouldn't take me. Darren was there too."
"3241"	"(2010-01-06 (18)) I was at dads and it was different. Rover was there. Dad made dinner for Ezra and himself, but left me some. I went to bed and told them to make sure the balcony was locked, so Rover didn't fall off. This girl created this product called Depeche Mode and sold it twice. I was on LastFm, looking at the top of 2009 and there were lots of Depeche Mode songs. I went to France and this nice girl and guy showed me around. First I was with Mom and Ezra in a car. We drove past a waterslide which went straight into the ocean. These kids threw some powder and it got in Ezra's hair. There was a river thing going through a cliff. There was a shop with lots of toys."
"3242"	"(2010-01-07 (18)) My notes are messy and hard to read. We saw the people we got Rover from. There was a park nearby and we took him there. I was on World of Warcraft later. Two people came to talk to me with their kids. Something was a peach colour. A boy in real life came to me and I explained something. I was then at school and it was graduation. I was at a table with Autumn and others. We got called inside. I saw Eugene and he looked hot and was older. Dad and I were supposed to be seeing a Morrissey concert. He called me to tell me the tickets were fake."
"3243"	"(2010-01-08 (18)) It was night and I was in the car. I was waiting. There was a guy washing a billboard thing nearby. He was naked and was actually kind of hot. We got closer and I took a photo, but you could see his balls. Then I was with others and we were far away at a place called Sunrise or something. We were at a petrol station and there was a list of places and I realized the train to downtown came here so we waited for it."
"3244"	"(2010-01-09 (18)) Our house was different and was attached to others. Sammy was renting the one next to us. One night he was going to a party and he came into my room to ask for something. He took some black thing when he left. I told Mom later. Darren had let Rover out and I was out there with him and he chased the cats over the fence. Sammy was going to the party with Vanessa (Gossip Girl). I was playing World of Warcraft. I was with a girl and we went into a level 17 instance and I died before I even entered it, which confused me. I was watching Gossip Girl. Chuck was friends with some guy. They kissed once and then started dating. Chuck was bothered by his homosexuality at first, but now he was fine with it. He and the guy were naked in bed (but were covered). His boyfriend said ""I love you"" and he kissed him. Later, Chuck was talking to Nate and said ""I love him"". I was talking to Ezra about it later but he hadn't seen it. I went to the university orientation. This guy was a TV show producer. I was talking to Ezra, saying I preferred movies and he said he preferred TV shows because of the way ""characters bloom"". Then, he, his friend (who was Nate) and I all said ""Chuck"" at the same time. Ezra thought it was funny. I had a letter from the university, confirming my acceptance and it had been sent on the 10 January."
"3245"	"(2010-01-10 (18)) There were two hotel like rooms. Dad and Ezra were in one with for beds in one room. I always felt uncomfortable in there and I saw a ""ghostly face"". I went to Mom's. She had two beds and I asked if I could stay. She was asleep, but said yeah."
"3246"	"(2010-01-10 (18)) I woke up and Sammy was in the lounge room. Mom made a comment about it being ""a week"" and was angry. I was playing World of Warcraft and I ran into a camp by mistake and they were level 57's. I tried to run out but couldn't find a way out. I saw a portal for Dalaran and to 'Galaran'. There was some cart thing. Selena and others were there. We had to pull ourselves up and slide along to a path. We let go and someone fell off too early."
"3247"	"(2010-01-11 (18)) I was at the hospital. Granny was still in there but they moved her somewhere else. Nana got a call saying they were changing Poppers's medication. Dad called and Granny had died. Nana and others we there and she cried. I had mail and there were lots of like little bits from fragile packages and notepads. Mom was there too. Then I was at a school place. This teacher guy was saying we would be ok if we ate pumpkin pie, do well at Monopoly and something else. Me and the guy next to me said at the same time, ""I hate pumpkin!"". Then I was actually reading a story in a magazine. This other guy pulled his hat off and said 'I'll show you how to eat pumpkin pie"". He put some on his fork and pretended to put it in his mouth, but put it into his shoe. He did that for a bit and then said ""Because it's punishable by death, you've got to put it on the guy next to you"". The story said the class cracked up for 715 minutes. I was at a house later looking at photos that I hadn't seen before. There were some of me and Aunt Sally."
"3248"	"(2010-01-11 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I were in some water. I tried to keep my phone above the water. We got a call that Granny was ok, so we gathered. We were still living at the old house. I was outside for a while and then I remembered I'd left some private stuff on the desk and I ran back inside. Ezra followed me and I tried to get rid of him, but he came in anyway. Austin was in my chair and he sounded like he was drunk. Everything in my room was a little messed up. He ended up showing it to Ezra and I had a whole box full of stuff. I tried to get Mom to make Austin leave. There was a fair thing. This kid and I went on a slide and we had to hold tight and it was fast. The police were chucking stuff into the middle of it. We got out of there. Then me, this young girl, Nate (Gossip Girl) and I lady all got into the back of the car. A guy was in the front and we drove off and saw a guy with two dogs and they were doing tricks. One of the dogs did a handstand. I was then at a bridge. Simba and Spaceman threw a mouse into the water. Rover ate something and vomited."
"3249"	"(2010-01-12 (18)) All cinemas got closed down. There had been a warning about it and it was up to Mozilla to do whatever with it. I was angry and upset about it. I ended up at a cinema. Seamus was there and he was eating sugar and ice. If my sodium level got over '40', I would pass out. Then it wasn't me and she passed out and they said to wheel her to the doctors. I went to the doctors and she was in a dark room and I said the doctor was a pedo. He was with someone else and we attacked him and left. I was with three people and their hair had turned green and got crusty stuff on their eyes. Someone said the Vanessa/Chuck (Gossip Girl) storyline was timed well because they had good chemistry. I said 'no they don't'. In real life, Ed Westwick and Jessica Szohr were getting married. There was a scene where Chuck was talking to a guy and Vanessa snuck up behind him and wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. Blair came and was angry and upset around it and ran off to a room. Chuck and Serena followed her. Chuck locked the door. Then I was Blair. I tried to open the door and I said we were trapped. I took my shirt off for some reason that I can't remember. I was hiding myself. There were clothes in the room but they were all female clothes and small. They tried to find something. As time went on, I got less annoyed at Chuck and started laughing and joining in with their conversation."
"3250"	"(2010-01-14 (18)) I went to the shop and I was only wearing a bra and shorts. I was looking at the men's clothes but there wasn't much there. I asked Mom to get something to call with. Ezra was there too. We got to the checkout and I went to the female section. A girl suggested this boy hair style packet and it took 37 minutes but I couldn't find it. Someone she knew kept singing this 'old' song. I saw Dad at one point and he lifted me up."
"3251"	"(2010-01-15 (18)) Ezra and Roland were hanging in my room. I went on Ezra's computer and played World of Warcraft. It was dark and I was near some water with a house next to it. I completed a quest and got chased by a guy and animal into the water. I went back to my room and they were asleep on the floor. I told them to get out. They didn't want to move. I told Mom. They also were saving money for something but couldn't get it, so Ezra was going give Dad $176 for a buoy."
"3252"	"(2010-01-16 (18)) I was at 'home'. Rover was chewing on stuff. We were now outside and I was with Mom, Ezra and Darren. Darren was annoyed at Rover. I got quests on World of Warcraft and I had to go to Outland. I was only level 51 though. One quest was like level 41 and could be done in Eastern Kingdoms, in Stranglethorn."
"3253"	"(2010-01-16 (18)) We had a new house. The bedroom was too small, so Ezra and I split the living room. My side had a door going outside and it was like in a block of units. There was a long pool. I went to sleep in the back of my car, which was undercover. Mom showed me something out the window. I had a box of private stuff and it had been moved. Ezra had chucked a hissy fit and moved me out of my room. Darren said they would put a wall up for me soon. Calvin came over but I didn't know why. I also had a letter from the university but it was weird and was like a math exam."
"3254"	"(2010-01-17 (18)) Mom showed me this loop/edited video of a tornado. It showed a house with a girl outside and it got blown away to another house and she was still there. Happy Hunting Ground came on and I was like 'I love this song!' and started singing ""it's fair, fair game inside"" and the last line. Mom was like ""I'm glad a song you like came on"". I was on IMDb later. Someone was asking who sang Killer Klowns From Outer Space and someone replied that it was The Dickies and the original poster said it wasn't. I replied that it was, although the post was from 2007. I was then with some guy and it was dark. The clowns from Killer Klowns From Outer Space were around. This guy got bitten and his girlfriend tried to go to him and he turned into one of them. She tried to help him but he bit her. We ran. It was hard to see and I had to keep waiting for my eyes to adjust. I ran from one and at one point, it stopped and ran back (like in World of Warcraft, when you get too far from their starting point). I mentioned it to the guy. We got to a soccer oval and hid behind the goal posts (there were four). Then a clown saw me and it started coming towards me. I threw bits of a tissue at it and other stuff to distract it (it had worked with some of them)."
"3255"	"(2010-01-17 (18)) I went to dads. He had a girlfriend. The house was on a street with fancy houses. I went to one and this lady gave me expensive clothes to wear to some place. She ended up getting annoyed at me so I left them there. Mom had a pool. We had blow-up toys -- a crocodile and an alligator/hippo. Farrah got on the crocodile and tried to jump in, but you had to go in at 40km/h. People were coming and we had to wait too long. Mom said ""60!"" and we jumped and held our breath. Furio (The Soprano's) was in some film/TV show, but it was actually someone else. I couldn't remember his name."
"3256"	"(2010-01-18 (18)) One of us was like a spy. As a test we had to set a house on fire to see how quickly you had to leave. I got my computer and left, but then went back for my diary etc."
"3257"	"(2010-01-18 (18)) I went to a party. The house was like across the road from our house (which was connected to it by a hall). I don't think I knew anyone there, but I had a drink. There were ""77"" of us, according to someone. We all tried to lie in a circle and I fell asleep. At 3am, I woke up and went home. Mom greeted me. I went to see Ezra and he was on the computer playing a game, which changed every 10 seconds. He said it was Final Fantasy."
"3258"	"(2010-01-19 (18)) I went to this jail thing. I think I was in another country. People were sent to death and had their heads dipped in lava/hot stuff to kill them. Their heads melted off except for some bits and I thought it was a weird way to kill them. I think I saved someone and then they came looking for me so I ran. This young kid was helping me. We ran through people's yards, etc. One had long thin grass. He ran back and said they were coming and we hid in the grass. The guy after us was Christoph Waltz and the kid pushed him into a pond. He heard the kid giggling so was looking for us. We got over some more fences but I think he had seen us. I managed to get something which looked like a sheep. This girl was there and I was sort of friends with her. She gave someone $8200 to get a ticket for me. I got on a train and saw Christoph and ran from him. He was looking for me. The train was moving but I jumped off and he didn't see. Someone told him I was in a field in London, but he knew it wasn't true. Mom was telling me that people who had been brought back to life couldn't use certain areas or ""smoke in private"". There was a new window at the old house and it made everything outside look pixelated. It was raining."
"3259"	"(2010-01-19 (18)) I was running away from people. I had to get some trapped soldiers out of a building. I took out the guards. They were German by the way. I went in and some others thought I was dodgy and I spoke German to them, to ease their suspicions, and then I shot them. I got chased by some others and I jumped some fences. I was then playing World of Warcraft or something and there were level 51 creatures. I found a teleport thing just as a 'bad' woman got there."
"3260"	"(2010-01-21 (18)) I was watching Gossip Girl. Blair and Serena went missing. Serena had gone missing first and her parents asked me if I knew where she went and I said I didn't know. When Blair went missing, her parents asked me as well. They asked Blair and she said she didn't know, but then she left and went missing. Dorota helped me look. Someone asked me something at one point and I pointed to the parents. Then I was at school somewhere and this guy was doing a talk. He marked my name and then I had to go to the next class. He told me to wait. I was annoyed because I wanted to get a good seat. Eugene went in and I sat on a seat up the back. He had shaved his hair. He had hairy feet and I took a photo. The talk was about some disease from some hot thing on walls."
"3261"	"(2010-01-22 (18)) Granny was still at the hospital which was different. Someone asked me where Virginia was and I said ""I don't even know where we are now! Woodside?"". I was right. I left with Mom and we got stuck on the road and then left there. I saw smoke behind us and there was a thing in the sky hanging off a crane or something. T here was a fire and this guy was in the crane thing with a hose. He fell off into a bush. Later I was at the hospital again and these gangster drug dealing brothers came and they were like Hispanic. They all ended up shooting each other, except for one, who left in a car with the money. I asked this lady for a lift and she looked scared and said no. I was with Ezra and Roland by the way. Then Mom came and we all got in."
"3262"	"(2010-01-23 (18)) I was at McDonald's with Mom and Ezra. They said they liked theirs ""out of a cup"" or something. They mentioned something about a large cup. There was a huge metal letter 'A'. This guy used to go to Brookland."
"3263"	"(2010-01-23 (18)) I was at Nana's. Rover was there. We stayed the night and they had a cat door. I was worried Rover would fall into some little pools. I went to one. Simba and Cuddles went in and there was a metal face on top of it? I was tired and I watched an episode of Big Brother. One woman stood in the bathroom for 15 minutes. They hadn't plugged the heater in and they found a cave. They saw a girl ghost and she was buried there and the place was covered in oil, so if we lit a match, it would explode. Mom was watching the same episode. Ezra came out of his room. In the next 1-2 episodes, someone was going to wear a wedding dress?"
"3264"	"(2010-01-24 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I went to a cinema. There was a huge queue for the candy bar because all the workers (teenage girls) were on break. Dad and I were discussing movies. He said that all the Batman movies were good and I said no, Batman Begins was good, The Lame Knight sucked and the third one (which we'd just seen) was ok. I was then at home and I went to the toilet. There was a lot of poo in it and it was from Ezra. I went close to it for some reason and almost threw up."
"3265"	"(2010-01-25 (19)) I was out the front. Sammy showed up and he was out of it. It was night. Mom and I were supposed to be taking rubbish to the dump but because it was late (1.55am), we couldn't."
"3266"	"(2010-01-26 (19)) I went to McDonald's with Mom (drive thru). I mentioned that everyone from Brookland was [something that stars with an 'e'] and Mom was like 'ooh big word'. Selena served us. Then Mom was in there and she organized food and stuff. She was saying ""you look pretty in a dress"" and I was like ""you're an idiot"". Calvin was saying I was a tomboy and mentioned this time in accounting where we either had to dress up or play some game where you draw pictures and Jemma yelled out ""Everyone choose that!"". Eventually we left there and we pulled up in a waiting bay. I was driving. There was a car behind me and they were being annoying. There was also something about Spaceman and a kitten."
"3267"	"(2010-01-28 (19)) I got two little green worms as pets. We kept calling them slugs though. They were really tiny. I had had one for a bit longer. The new one was called Alexander. I went to Mom to ask her what I should feed it, but it complained so I asked her to do it. I went back and almost fell on the floor and there were more slugs. They were trying to eat Rover. Mom and Ezra left to go somewhere and I was like 'what about the slugs?' but they were like 'meh'. Then we were parked on the side of the road with the door open. These guys drove past and Ezra said some 4chan thing and they threw a dark green slushy out the window and went on the car. This teacher told me to clean it with this other person. I had to a project for 'school' and I had to collect materials but I couldn't go. Finn and Rachel (both from Glee) asked to do it and Rachel offered to get the materials but she was organizing to clean the car. She had only joined to spend time with Finn. He had a girlfriend who wasn't happy about it. I was on a train at some point and I was singing Should've Known Better."
"3268"	"(2010-01-29 (19)) I was at a place like a prisoner of war camp thing. I was in a room with beds. My 'bed' was a group of people. Elijah was one of them. The people in the block next to us always yelled at them complaining about sheets. I realized one of ours had never been washed. Later the leader died. Elijah, someone else and I were talking and Elijah came to the conclusion that the replacement was going to be evil. They were standing in line and were all young females. One was really tall and Elijah was staring at her. One had a big mole. We were messing around and she tried to kick something and then realized it was hers. Elijah was annoyed because the tall girl was taller than him. Gizmo was in a cage with a lizard. I let her out. Mom let the lizard out and it bit me and I squealed. I ran and screamed and it chased me. This teacher lady gave a quiz to Fatima. I wanted to do it and she said it was mainly for guys. At the top it said to text this number to get your name. I was on IMDb and there was a 'Top 10 quotes' thing. I said ""I watch 8/10 of these shows"", although there were repeats. One from Grey's Anatomy was there and a Supernatural quote was number 3. The Supernatural quote had something to do with liking a sandwich and it was a Dean quote. Later I was at a table/desk and Milo Ventimiglia was next to me and I think we knew each other. There was a movie about a war with Susan Sarandon? She left to go to James Spader, then it was from his point of view but it was 'me'. He (as me) walked into a house and she was on a lounge reading. I went up to her and hugged her. There were people there watching."
"3269"	"(2010-01-30 (19)) I was at Nana's. Granny was still alive but she was in water? Nana took me home and some young guy was in the passenger seat. This older guy was driving and I was in my usual seat, behind the driver. Gold by Spandau Ballet came on and I was tapping to it. I got home and it was different. Some guy with a bag of ice shards was at the door and I walked past him."
"3270"	"(2010-01-31 (19)) I was at a petrol station with Mom. It was night. I drove there and Mom went in. I decided to drive off and I drove to the exit, then I turned around. Mom came back, looking angry. She said she would drive and we drove off and she said that everyone saw, including the police but she didn't tell me that. Later they stopped us and gave us a fine. I said that I accidentally put my foot on the accelerator."
"3271"	"(2010-01-31 (19)) I was at school. I ended up with some older guys and I was helping them with something. Calvin didn't like them. We were in a computer room and I was next to Calvin and this guy I liked was on the other side. He looked like Cory Monteith. We had an in-joke we kept giggling about. There was a 'Top 6 upgrades' and number one was Charizard and then ""Ninetails, Vulpix, something I don't remember, Pokemon, Runescape"". Later some friend and I went to this caravan to visit another friend, who was Doug from Dawson's Creek. The caravan looked like it had been broken into and he was acting weird. I saw him wipe blood off his hands and I walked down the hall and saw the bath/shower curtain had been pulled to. I opened it and there was a dead guy in the bath. This girl saw it too. I asked my guy friend in and we thought we saw the dead guy breathing. It turned out that Doug actually didn't like this guy and he had come over, but didn't actually break in. I was later driving with Mom and I said something, but I can't read what I wrote -- ""that's my [something something] ""."
"3272"	"(2010-02-01 (19)) I was at the university orientation. There were only a few people none with the purple or green lanyard. I put mine on. I went into a room with lots of desks and sat at one. The girl next to me was a first year vet student and asked me a question. I can't remember properly, but we ended up having to run from something."
"3273"	"(2010-02-01 (19)) I was walking back home (which was different) and I was in a public hall. I had a measuring tape on me. This oldish (30-40 year old) guy stopped me and asked to buy it from me. I said no and he offered a higher price and I said ""I don't care if it's $17 million, it's not for sale"". He got angry and tried to get it off me. I called out to Mom and she yelled back telling me to be quiet and that she was busy. I yelled out again and she was like 'I'm not listening to your stories'. I ran in and closed the door and locked it with a chain. Mom came and still didn't believe me (until a while later). We were then younger and Ezra was like 5. I stabbed the guy in the finger with a butter knife and then stabbed another finger. He left and went out the back of our house. We were all in the kitchen and we hid behind the counters. Mom said she had to see Slater and I said 'you can't leave me alone'. Our back door, which was fly wire, didn't lock so we locked the back wood door. We went out the front door and I first looked in the kitchen drawer for a knife but there was nothing sharp in there or nearby and I grabbed some fluffy thing. I said 'I don't think this will work' and then I heard the guy say 'it doesn't matter' and he was in the house. He came out to us and I threw cardboard pieces at him and tried to stab him. I don't know what happened then."
"3274"	"(2010-02-01 (19)) I was driving out of Midvale shop car park by myself. It was different. I realized I still had my L plates and I freaked."
"3275"	"(2010-02-02 (19)) I was watching Burn Notice and it was a weird episode. I said that I hated Fiona. Mom and Ezra were watching and Mom said that she probably wouldn't mind the show. I can't remember it properly, but Eugene and Sam were on a job. Then they were in an office building. Adelle DeWitt (Dollhouse) was there. This group of guys blew up this bit outside and then went inside. Jack Bauer (24) was also around and quietly went in through the sliding front door. He hid a gun in a plant pot and joined the rest of the people. Then it was Eugene again. He was speaking in code to this person. I was inside too and I was trying to get this metal 'lid' off this thing on the floor. I didn't have enough time. Then it was House. I went upstairs to find Taub. I asked ""where's everyone gone?"" and he said ""I replaced all of them"". It was Christmas. He asked if I was still on. Some guy had only joined because he liked Cuddy. She found out and was like 'why didn't you just tell me' and they had also had a one night stand years ago. Taub was actually called Ezra."
"3276"	"(2010-02-03 (19)) I was at Dad's new house. The doors had mesh and were very weak and weren't attached properly. I went in with Rover and found his penguin toy. Three worker guys were at the front door. I went 'blblbl' loudly and scared them. We laughed. Then I was at this place which had quests. I got one where I had to make some pot. I asked Mom what to do and Darren did it for me -- it was created on a nail file thing. It burned quick. I was almost at the place to hand it in, but I failed as I was on a time limit. The next quest I got I had to get a stylish outfit and got to some restaurant. I got a white men's shirt. Mr Stevenson was outside. My shirt had buttons on the side and he said that for the buttons on the front, I was allowed to have the bottom button undone. I saw Samantha around. There was a 'baby' Bart Simpson (The Simpsons) and everyone was like ""Oh my God, he's so cute!""."
"3277"	"(2010-02-04 (19)) I was at university. I had found something on the net about the results of something to get in to it and I was 10/58. I was in a computer room and Alejandro was next to me. Jakob came in and asked me something and left. Someone else I knew came in and asked me about the stuff at the computer and I said it was Jakob's. They were with people. I mocked someone and I went to do something and hit a gun. It hurt and I started to bleed. My mouth got really bloody. I tried to take a photo of it but it was too hard. Mom said she had made spaghetti and it was ready but then she said she had to ""burn a special biscuit"" to make it taste the same. I was like 'why do you tease me?'. Darren got a 12 month job with the government which had something to do with traffic signals on a busy road."
"3278"	"(2010-02-04 (19)) I found a new TV show to watch. I can't remember what it was about but it was a teenage type of thing. This girl needed a transplant and her boyfriend agreed to do it. She wasn't sure about it though. His sister came and she tried to make it sound like she was cheating with her, then she admitted the truth. There was an interview with her and she was saying that because she was short, she had to be better looking and they had to shorten everyone's name by 3/4. Someone said ""perfect 24.3"" but I can't remember what it was about. Two months later, he went to a friend on an oval. He collapsed and the girl came. There were drugs. People climbed over the fence."
"3279"	"(2010-02-04 (19)) I was at a school. A guy who looked like Cory Monteith was flirty and nice to me. The day after I met him, I found this thing on a locker that said that guys got points for how far they got with girls. He also got a wheelchair and was using that (for sympathy?). I went through the locker. After school there was like a party. Cory was in the wheelchair and I wheeled him down a hall. I stood on the back wheels which was fun. The doors were all locked. We went back and he got up and walked in. He gave something to some girls. Two girls kissed."
"3280"	"(2010-02-05 (19)) I was on a playground thing on an oval. I was with Elijah and Ezra. There was some stuff up high and we were trying to get over it. Ezra carried me over some bit. I got stuck and held onto a wall crack. We were also on a time limit. Elijah was working his way over to help. A brick started falling near me and I was like 'Oh my God I'm going to die!'. Where I was, was about the height of a house. I left where I was and held onto another bit. Elijah was saying that I was light -- when Ezra had carried me earlier, so had Elijah at one point. He said ""I don't know why it's so hard to get over you"", which had something to do with the carrying. I said ""... coz I'm awesome?"". I got down and was singing I Don't Want to Get Over You in my head. I went under this thing to find something. I went under to this other bit, and I can't read the next bit but it had something to do with Elijah and I thought it was funny and I laughed. I saw Mom and I ran to her and it was raining."
"3281"	"(2010-02-05 (19)) I was at a beach with Mom and Rover. There were huge waves. This lady was doing some thing where no dogs were allowed. I had my period so didn't do it today. Then I was running from Mom and Darren and I kept jumping a fence and hiding then when they found me I would run again. Then I was at a school. We were cleaning up stuff. Something I did had something to do with Farrah and I and others at an amusement park. This lady said I did something wrong and I admitted it was me. I helped some people do a project. Five at a time had to cook? This guy tried to leave and he got punched in the balls. Tiana and Ramona were in the year below me and they were young."
"3282"	"(2010-02-06 (19)) I was at a shop with Mom and she was going to try on some jeans and I walked off. Calvin was there with a girl and we chatted for a bit."
"3283"	"(2010-02-06 (19)) I was out with Ed O'Neill. I was going out with his son. He took us to a movie, but first took me to the place to buy food and stuff. We got alcohol, snacks etc. This lady asked ""who's this?"" and he said ""my date"". She asked me ""how old are you? 27?"" and I said ""19"" and she said ""and he's 50?!"". I laughed and said ""I'm with his son"". We didn't make the movie on time."
"3284"	"(2010-02-06 (19)) I was at a clothes shop trying clothes on. I thought someone was next to me but realized they weren't making any sound. I realized it was a mannequin. I heard someone looking in all the cubicles and it was creepy. I was trying to try on a shirt but someone reached over and I left. I was then in a carpark trying to park but there was always stuff in the way. There were some kids, but I can't read what it says. Their mother came and she yelled at me. I tried to explain but she ignored me. Ezra was there. I went over to her again and she was like 'you don't want kids having fun' and I said 'yes I do. I mean, I'm still a kid. I have a year to go before I'm out of my teens' and she was like 'oh I love those times, do you like dancing?' and I said ""Nooo."". Our next door neighbour looked like Marisa Tomei."
"3285"	"(2010-02-07 (19)) I was with two guys and they could turn into dogs. This guy was following us. I held onto them as they ran (as dogs). We were on a dark oval. We hid behind a tree. He caught us. Then we were in a house. The two guys had been hung up by their hands and the people were getting ready to tie me up. I can't remember what happened but later I asked for a drink. They gave me some cold water but it was gross and I spat it out saying it tastes like pee and he said it was pee. There was a pool behind the house, but it was down a hill. There were lots of people. We managed to escape but he found us. Ezra wanted to watch The Little Mermaid."
"3286"	"(2010-02-07 (19)) Grady was a good drawer and was drawing pictures of people, which he drew really fast too. I wanted one but then someone got chosen and he said that was the last one he was going to do."
"3287"	"(2010-02-07 (19)) I was on the computer. Someone came in and they were a transvestite. She asked me about my computer. Later she was trying to work out who was the 'best'. I said I was level 56 on World of Warcraft and Ezra was level 21. So I won."
"3288"	"(2010-02-08 (19)) I was at university. There was an online activity and most options were full and it had a bar to show how full they were. There was one on Tuesday from 8.30-5.30. Then I was there. We all sat in the first row of the class. Charlene was there. There was a picture of a bulldog puppy. There was a female teacher. The next class had more people. I got Mom to get me after and I was in the car but then realized I had one more class and then another class which was somewhere else."
"3289"	"(2010-02-10 (19)) I was at home which was different. Mom was saying she got stuff from Dad's old place. She and Darren had been staying there. I asked why they didn't tell me and they were like 'meh'. They said 'wouldn't you like to have the house by yourself' and I said no. Ezra also said no. We argued. Dad was nearby and ignored it. I said ""I've wanted that house since I was like 3!"". I was then at a shop and it was quiet. There were no aircons on or the freezers for the frozen stuff. I grabbed some snacks."
"3290"	"(2010-02-12 (19)) Cory Monteith and I got married. We were at the old house but it was new. People were sleeping. It was night. We took this lounge bed out the front and we had sex. We lay on it outside. Then it was cold and I asked if we could bring it inside and we took it into the games room. As we passed the kitchen I saw that the oven light was on. I went to my room and checked my phone. I had over 30 messages and they were all from Mom and Dad. I had forgotten to take them to the wedding? I went back out to go to bed."
"3291"	"(2010-02-12 (19)) I was at a friend's house, or a friend of Mom's. Mom was there too. He was hot. He had been writing a book, but had gotten in trouble lately and I heard someone say that he had gotten raped. There was a kitten with weird curly fur. There was a mouse and someone put a toy on it."
"3292"	"(2010-02-12 (19)) I was at university getting my photo ID. I got my proof of age card out to show them. The girl in front of me got turned away. I saw Eugene approaching and he was with someone else."
"3293"	"(2010-02-13 (19)) I was at school. I sat at a bench and I was near Darius, Eugene and others. Eugene was closed to me and moved closer to make room for someone. Calvin was nearby watching. The others left and Calvin and I were talking. Eugene was standing around and I saw in the corner of my eye, that he laughed a few times at our conversation. We were talking about something and I said ""and I was jizzing in my pants"". Then I was playing World of Warcraft. A heap of others and I were on a ledge outside with a girl. When we were walking to a lower ledge, I said ""abortion for the win"". We sent the girl across some water. We all went across. There were PVP Horde around. It was a big deal when we got back."
"3294"	"(2010-02-13 (19)) I was picking up something from Calvin on the side of the road. I was driving with Mom. We were waiting for this bus and we went to stop but then the bus came so we had to go. There were people on the road including Bradley. I said that people from school were always in the way. Later there was something that looked like it had a plane going through the wall and I joked with Ezra about it."
"3295"	"(2010-02-14 (19)) I blew my nose and this big clear slug came out and I showed Mom."
"3296"	"(2010-02-14 (19)) It was the first day of university. I realized I had forgotten to go. It was like 2pm or something. I got Mom to take me, but I forgot my lab coat. I had time to spare so I went to the bookshop, which was different. I asked if I could borrow a lab coat and it cost $5. They only had large and 4XL, so I took the large. Elijah was there doing a similar course. We had the math tutorial at the same time but in a different room. His lab was on Wednesday. This girl asked for help with math and she had an equal sign with three lines. She had asked some 'smart' people for help but so far had had no luck. This lady had to interview me and she said I was a survivor since I was a ""little bit fat"". I was like ""uh... what?"". I said that it had never bothered me. I mentioned that I had lost 12kg in the last year. I passed the interview. I had to wear the coat for the lab even though we were just watching some football. Eugene was there with Bradley. I was filming and Bradley and the others were being silly. There was a movie thing and this bad guy died, but then crawled out of a lake as a different person. We threw some slug things?"
"3297"	"(2010-02-15 (19)) I was driving out of a carpark at the shop. I needed to turn right but something was going on. I had to go on an escalator to get out. There were people behind me running around. I finally got out. It was stressful and there were lots of people around. I was then driving down Princess Rd and there was a lot of glass. I pulled into a shop. I was walking with just socks on. Mom was with me and then Darren came too. I left and had to go the other way but I didn't know how to so I just kept going the wrong way and I was asking what to do but they wouldn't tell me. Then I found out where to go. There was a weird way to get home. We had to go through this shop and then climb out of a fireplace (like, we came in from behind it). There was a lounge in the way. It was a new house and it was lame. I went to 'college', then I came back. Then I was there with Dad, his girlfriend and Farrah and Ezra. I said that the baby better not be in my room. Then there was a movie and there was a mushroom cloud. I explained it to Granny, who was also watching it. It showed the survivors and there were a lot of people outside."
"3298"	"(2010-02-17 (19)) I was driving with Mom. There was a cop on the road and he pulled this yellow gun out. We stopped and he wanted the car. I said I didn't have shoes on and he settled for us driving him somewhere. We went to a shop for clothes. Also, Roland liked Samantha and she 'tried to be bad'. She had been pretending to date this guy and he found out and was upset."
"3299"	"(2010-02-17 (19)) Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were brothers in real life and Jeffrey Dean Morgan was their father. There was a video of them and some funny stuff they did as kids. They said that one video had the 'best timing', when Jensen played a joke on Jared and he sulked and looked around. I watched it with Mom and Ezra."
"3300"	"(2010-02-18 (19)) I was at a shop and someone was filming. I was in the background of the video. It sped up and so we had to do something. I was then sitting with someone in a car. This angry guy got in and took off. It was like an expensive, fast car and he had put his foot right down. I was like ""I hope you're a good driver!"" and then he crashed into a lake. It wasn't actually a lake, and it had like paths surrounding it. The car was yellow by the way. I held my arm up out of the water holding my phone. I took a photo with it. I swam to the other side with one arm. Poppa was there and helped me up. I had text Dad saying ""it had [something] . Do you know guys with ebay?"" and something else that I can't read. The guy got out and was shaken up. Mom and Ezra came. Ezra said something about the picture, I think but I can't read what I've written. There was a mention of a drive in the past week when Mom and I had crashed into the same river/thing. Later, I went for a drive with Mom to this place in a really dodgy neighbourhood with gangs and stuff. I saw some gangster girls and I said I wanted to leave so we did. Then I was doing a quest and I had to break into some girl's house. I got in and pressed a button on a remote and then I had to find photos. I was searching through the wallet. Someone was coming and we left. Then I was some guy and the son of a famous guy was in a field. I can't read the other bit it says. I had to change. There was something about The Matrix?"
"3301"	"(2010-02-19 (19)) I got an email from the university about driving. I told Mom that Ezra needed to change his phone number and he was angry about it. I was then at university and Ms Burton was there. I had math and we had to round to 30.10, but someone said it was 30.11 but then that was wrong because we were dealing with money. Anyway, I can't remember properly but I found out that Dean had been bitten by a werewolf. We were at a beach and some others got back to the house (which was at the beach). It was very busy and there were long queues. I asked Mom if she knew about Rover and she said ""that Rover's a werewolf? Yeah."". He was outside and she put food out for him. Then it was night but I was with him outside. I was trying to get around the back. It wasn't a full moon though. I got there and then he started to change. I ran in and he tried to come in. I started to cry and was upset. Then some celebrity woman and her husband were doing something. She was in a dressing gown and her boobs started to hang out. Lots of similar mishaps happened with the cast of Glee -- they touched her boob. Hayden Christensen said he was gay but it was unknown whether it was a joke or not. Marisa Tomei said she was against gays and Santa Claus."
"3302"	"(2010-02-20 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I went to this place to get food. We were eating in the car. It was nice but obviously fattening. Later, I found out it was snake penis, balls and something else. Ezra said something like ""It would be cool to see David Lynch to [something I can't read] "". I opened the car door and vomited. He recorded it. Later he gave some of the food to Mom and she liked it. Then I was watching a behind the scenes of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Kaitlin Olson was making up some dance. Rob McElhenney was singing a song badly. Later, Ezra and Kim did this thing where they would randomly run. I followed them and they went through houses and yards. They jumped over fences, went through cat doors and jumped on stuff. I fell behind and lost them. I walked along a path and didn't know how to get back. This Italian guy tried to help me. Rover was around at some point. It got to 5.30pm and my driving instructor hadn't come."
"3303"	"(2010-02-20 (19)) I can't remember it properly, but there was a zombie infection thing. You could get rid of the infection. Some people I knew got infected and I killed the 'main zombie'. Someone said ""Charlie"". The infected person was wearing yellow and had holes in them and they were blind. But then it was just a suit and they took it off and they were normal. We went into this room. This guy had had a heart transplant and the heart was from a pig? He turned into a zombie later and I stabbed him in the chest hard. I was then in bed, sharing with Ezra. He poked me from behind and I turned around and he was a zombie and I stabbed through the blanket. I chopped this zombie guy's head off and his mouth and throat were full of rice. Mom came and saw it and left. She came back and said ""Why did you do this?"" and everyone was back to normal and I was confused. We left and I was in my car and I had my P's. As I drove further away (I was coming from Mom's old house), there was lots of smoke and light posts down, house alarms going off, people crying etc."
"3304"	"(2010-02-20 (19)) I had a driving lesson. Then there was this thing going on and everyone else was young. We went in groups of three. We had to pick a sport and you had to get all to leave? I can't read the next bit I wrote."
"3305"	"(2010-02-21 (19)) I was at university in a lab. It was a big class and we were separated into two groups. I ended up with eight people. We followed someone and two others and I were at the back. Then we were on a train and we had to run and jump to get on. We got to where we were going but then I realized I had forgotten my bag, but I hadn't. Then we had to do a dissection of a monkey, but it was still alive, which made me upset. Dad was watching and I cried and sobbed and he was like 'what the hell are you crying for?' and I said 'it's whimpering'. I forgot to draw it in my lab book, but I got a photo of something else. There was an online quiz and if you 'passed' you got to be lead photographer. Dad came to help me with it."
"3306"	"(2010-02-21 (19)) I was watching Kenny vs Spenny. Kenny put stuff in his hair and Spenny did something to him and he died. They resurrected him though the next morning. Then it showed what had happened in between. Spenny's 'sister' came in and had lied down with Kenny and gave him a handjob. I was like 'what the hell?!' and confused. Then Spenny dressed up as a hippy like woman, but Kenny had introduced himself to a policeman, who had called out to Spenny and Kenny realized it was him. Then I was at home, but it was different and apartment like. Luisa came over and was wearing a black dress. She wanted to take me out and I refused. I called Mom to tell her to come home."
"3307"	"(2010-02-22 (19)) I was driving with Mom. We were going to the beach but we missed the turn off at first. We turned around and not in the car and Mom rolled a skateboard on the ground and this car ran over it but didn't hit it. Then we were back in the car and they reversed into us. Mom drove forward and pushed them into the car in front of them. We ran off and left her car behind. Later we went back. There were some Asian girls there. These two guys that had been in the car were now blind. We got on a train and it was weird and the seats all faced the middle. I used my SmartRider but it picked up on Mom's address. Darren was there too. The Asian girls gave me some money. Mark (Ugly Betty) was excited that the guy's were blind. I called Mom to tell her and she screamed with excitement and I was like 'ok...'. I went to leave and Mark said ""Do you know you want to be with her?"", which meant 'do you like your current crush'. I laughed and said ""Why did you say her?"". He just stared at me and I figured it had something to do with him being gay. Then this kid had this electronic book with information about people from school. You could find your compatibility. I got 30% with someone. I got 100% with Eugene and Dmitri. Tears Run Rings played on the train."
"3308"	"(2010-02-23 (19)) I was at the old house, trying to find something to wear, but none of my new clothes were clean. Mom and Darren complained about everything I chose to wear. It got late (it was 10.18, but I had to leave by 10.30 to get to university on time) and I still hadn't eaten breakfast or straightened my hair. I went to my new math tutorial. It was in a small computer room, but there were lots of people, including Autumn and Elijah. The teacher said that the class was bigger than last time and that there were five extra people. I said I changed because I can't do the early one. They said it was too bad and that this one was full, but asked if anyone wanted to change. Heaps of people did because they wanted to change to some boating thing. Ezra got accepted to the Technical College but was going to drop out. It was some sort of cooking course with this old rich Asian guy."
"3309"	"(2010-02-23 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft, but it was for X-BOX 360. I said to some guy, ""I've been addicted to games since I was 5"" and he was annoying me. Ezra and others were in another room. I lied on the couch and he came to watch. I went to Dalaran and I had to jump into this hole. Dalaran was tiny and had like three quests."
"3310"	"(2010-02-24 (19)) Mom bought Ezra and I a present. His said ""To Tom, from Izzy"", with ""Comment: Sam"". I was confused about it but it turned out she had bought him a Supernatural bedspread and for both of us, three pillows. I took the one with Sam, because I figured Ezra would want Rover. The third pillow had Sam pointing."
"3311"	"(2010-02-24 (19)) I, but it wasn't me, was young (like 5 or so) and knew I was going to die. Dad and I went to a restaurant and had tuna. Then I was poisoned. I tried to tell Mom and she was like 'meh' and rolled over to go back to sleep. Someone told someone else to stand on a log in water and said it would roll around on the spot. I said it wouldn't and that it would go down the waterfall. They eventually believed me. I found blood on my sheets, but the blood was from the future. We thought it was from a cut I had gotten from a bush. A friend tried to make me go into this dark place with a sword, but then I saw my real friend. They looked the same. I pretended that I hadn't seen anything, but then I turned the sword on the fake one."
"3312"	"(2010-02-26 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft but it was different. I went to Northrend through a mirror. There were lots of level 70+ mobs with over 10k health. I was trying to avoid them but they kept chasing me anyway."
"3313"	"(2010-02-26 (19)) I was at university and it was different. I went to some class and then left. I was with Evelyn in an elevator. She was really short. My feet were cold and I realized I had no shoes on and I went back to class to find them. I asked the lady there and she said she had seen them and got them for me. She got rashes from my socks. I went to class and it was full of people. I put my shoes on. I had another class but it was later. I was on MSN with Ezra and he told me to accept the webcam invitation. He and Emery danced around. Ezra had dyed his hair black and Emery was wearing a tutu."
"3314"	"(2010-02-27 (19)) I think I was someone else. I was with a friend outside and I realized there were zombies. I took a car and drove off. My friend realized and she caught up with me. I had a boyfriend in another city. I drove to the beach and there was a guy with a boat. I went on and got across.  Then I was driving on the road in the other city. An ambulance kept trying to knock us off the road and after passing us, turned back around to get us. The streets were full of cars and it was night. I pushed past some cars and drove to this building and ran inside and we split up. It was a place for poor people and there were lots of people inside. The next day, police came looking for us. My friend was now Ben (Lost). There was a close up of his face and he looked creepy and fat. The zombies were smart and ended up taking over."
"3315"	"(2010-02-27 (19)) I was doing a crossword scratchie. I was getting heaps of words and I realized that it was a 'big' one and you had to get at least 13 words to get the minimum prize, but it seemed like I was getting all of them. Mom commented on it."
"3316"	"(2010-02-28 (19)) I was watching House. Wilson died at the beginning of the episode. At the end, House started crying very openly and loudly. I cried too. I was thinking to let Mom know there was a new episode out. We went to a shop. There was a guy and others behind a counter. This guy dragged me around the floor and I laughed and said it tickled my bum and everyone laughed. The guy behind the counter liked me. He said he called a video shop at Morley and had guaranteed me a job there. I drove out of the parking spot by myself and as I drove out, a bus was following me."
"3317"	"(2010-03-01 (19)) I was at some place where celebrities and the like were walking through to somewhere. I bumped into Nathan Fillion in a dark hall. I stopped him and asked for a photo and he agreed reluctantly. He looked impatient and said he had 10 seconds. I got the camera ready on my phone and turned flash off and took the photo and he left. Later I went to check the photo and it was gone. I remembered we were in a different time zone as we were on the other side of the country, so I changed the time zone and then the photo was there. It looked weird and was a blurry. I showed Mom and she was like 'nice picture, he's cute'. I said ""Yay Firefly, second best show of all time"". I looked again later and the photo was different. He was in a different outfit and there were ski's in the background. I remembered that he had come back later and I had gotten more photos. There was a roller coaster thing there too. I can't remember properly but I had trouble getting in somewhere or something and Mom and Darren complained about it. I also saw Peter MacNicol at the place."
"3318"	"(2010-03-02 (19)) I was at the old house alone. Something weird was going on. I saw a police car with two young guys cheering and going like ""Woo!"" and they pulled up at the house across the road. I closed and locked the door. I went to my room and heard a noise. They were at the front door trying to get in. One had only light blue jeans on. One looked like Ron Mael and the other looked like Russell Mael. The one that looked like Russell went to the back and tried to get in through the back door. I sent him back out. Later he was back out the back and said ""I hope you know what happens at the end"". I locked everything up. Then Ron came out of the toilet. I put my arms between his legs and carried him out on my back. I text Mom to say that people were trying to break in and I needed help. Then Russell was Kenny Hotz. His mother was young and really Jewish/Bronx-y sounding. He said he was on an 'island' and she misinterpreted as an actual island and said ""I don't care if you fly, jump from a plane or swim"". I can't remember properly but some bad guys captured me and some others. We were now actually on an island [possibly from having watched Shutter Island yesterday] . We escaped and were trying to get off the island. We were in the water and had a cannon. They tried to aim for the bomb, but missed. Then I was Rick from The Walking Dead comic and his wife was still around. She was floating? It turned out this alcohol was actually poison and everyone had drank some, but she died. Kat had moved a toilet so it would fall outside and did something to a door and this was how, presumably, they had poisoned the drink. Chuck (Gossip Girl) and his girlfriend and a guy were having a threesome. The guy kissed Chuck, and I thought it was hot."
"3319"	"(2010-03-02 (19)) I was outside at night. Someone said 'help me'. A teenage girl was trying to get out of a shed and she pointed to her parents. I saw this pointy thing with a handle. This guy was being dodgy and I poked him with it. He came and tried to attack me. He took it from me. Then it was like a Donkey Kong game and I said to Dad ""remember how you had all those sheets of paper with cheats"" and he was like ""... no""."
"3320"	"(2010-03-04 (19)) I went to the toilet and I saw Simba with a half eaten mouse. I distracted him and it looked like it was still barely alive, which upset me. I accidentally pushed Simba into a hole. I freaked out but he was ok. Gizmo was around too. I went to some shop thing with Dad, Ezra and something that I can't read which were all tall and big. Then it was a show. David Anders and his brother (?) were scientists, but different kinds. Both invented a similar thing. Then David Anders spent ten years building a tall building thing. Then I went to a simultaneous world? One of the brothers was $1000 away from $50,000."
"3321"	"(2010-03-04 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft and it was different. I was with someone else. I went to an area that was a higher level than me. We crossed an oval and it was 'night' and all mobs were asleep. We got to a temple and they were all asleep over the stairs and ground etc. We ran through the temple. I went up the stairs and found nothing and went down and through a door. They woke up and people started to shoot. I ran through and everyone was dead. I got to the end of the building and someone jumped into this little blimp like thing. Then the good guys came and they were in SWAT uniforms. Kim Raver was the leader."
"3322"	"(2010-03-05 (19)) I was at a house. Ezra was there but I was in my room and we were talking on MSN. Dad was finishing work soon and was probably taking us to the movies. The movie had Jensen Ackles in it and Ezra and I joked about it. Mom picked me up from somewhere and was taking me back. She said she had to take the train back and I asked why and she said it was because of the L-plates. I was confused and questioned it and then she realized what she'd said. I called Dad to ask if we were still going. He said he just finished work and said he'd let us know soon. It was already 9.20pm though."
"3323"	"(2010-03-05 (19)) I was at the old house. I was in my room on the computer looking at stuff about the Top 250. This retard guy wanted to see how many he had seen and me and some others said no. He liked me. I left to get away from him and he followed and hugged me from behind. Then it was like 10pm. Mom and I went to a cinema to see a movie. There was some UFC thing on TV and Mom asked me a question about another movie. We got to the cinema one hour early and she left. I had no shoes on. I went outside and walked down this forest path and I think it was to get away from the retard. There was glass everywhere. Lots of people were driving past and I slowly started walking back and I had to pick glass out of my foot. A bus went into the cinema area and I ran to get it but I missed it. I went to the other entrance and asked a security guard where the bus 'ended', but then I saw it and people started getting off. I got there just in time. The driver was black and I asked how much it cost because I didn't have my SmartRider on me. He said it was $5.44 and I said 'whoa! I'm going to Midvale' (I was in Northtown). He said it would be $25, so I asked if I could use my SmartRider when I got back and he said I could transfer the money. Other people needed to as well so he wrote down contact details on a piece of paper. He gave me a photo of a pet shop/garden shop/school with instruments, which was on a piece of paper on the wall. It was good quality and you could zoom in. I was then there and I had to go on the internet. I did what I needed to do and I went to leave. I walked in and out of empty classrooms. Then the retard guy lived out in a swampy forest. There was a black guy parked in a car just staring out. The retard got scared and started hitting him with a hammer over and over laughing crazily. After that everyone wanted him dead so he killed himself by jumping into a grinder thing. I was annoyed that he killed the person because I knew people would tease me about it There was a weird dog that had things wrong with it and it's back was like a squiggle. It was creepy looking."
"3324"	"(2010-03-06 (19)) I was outside. Ryan Kwanten came running past (it was possibly on a video) and he was naked and ran and jumped into the water. Everyone was like 'he's hot'. Selena said something along the lines of 'at least I've seen his butt now'. I was like 'ew, who wants to see butts' and she looked at me confused and I said ""he poops out of that. You've seen his poophole"" and she was like 'ew'. Then I was at Nana's. Her birds were acting weird, I think they were dying. Ezra and Emery were there with some others. They told him to touch this hot pipe and he did and he burnt his finger and then tried to kill me. Ezra tried to stop him and burnt his fingers too. I had to shoot Emery in the head, it left a small hole but then I didn't have to, so we were being careful."
"3325"	"(2010-03-06 (19)) I was at a shop and this guy was wearing a black Alliance shirt. I was holding my blue one. I left with Mom. I was driving. I was still in the carpark and there was lots of stuff in the way to the exit. I had to drive in an exact position but I kept missing it. Mom complained but I got out finally. I was driving at 60km/h. The lights were green but they turned to red suddenly and I went through and I noticed there was a camera there. There were police with guns and there were people all over the road. I can't read the rest."
"3326"	"(2010-03-07 (19)) I was at the old house which was different. It was haunted or something. I was playing a game on my computer. I was in an elevator and I had to collect stuff to drink or I would lose health. The lighting wasn't very good in my room so it was hard to see. This ghost would come and at times it would just sort of [do something that I can't read] and then it would start making things bleed etc. He got an award at level 15 which meant that he had killed 15 people. My highest was four and I was determined to get it to 15 tonight. He smashed some stuff that I left behind. Then Ezra, this guy and I ran along train tracks to beat the train. There was also a photo of Cuddles and Gizmo."
"3327"	"(2010-03-08 (19)) We were having a joint get-together for me and Mom's birthday. I was naked with a towel around me and I sat next to Gizmo. I saw Eugene near me. He was putting his bag down and I saw him writing in a card. I imaged him started to write 'I love you' and then changing it to 'have a good day'. Then I was at Nana's. Dad and Ezra were in the lounge room watching a horror movie. This guy was in a plane and there was a special button to allow for decoys. There were some more but I can't read it. The movie was called IC Eric or something. Another movie that was on was called CCVII and there was another one which was getting heaps of good reviews and Dad said he had heard enough of it. There were two towers of buildings. I can't remember what was happening but the one I wanted to go to was closed."
"3328"	"(2010-03-08 (19)) I was watching Network. The first 40 minutes were lame and then it was really good, but it was different. I was in a building and ended up on the roof. I was talking to this guy who was the boss of the company, which had something to do with technology. He said that if I ever wanted a job there to let him know. He ended up dying because he was an alcoholic and someone did something to him using his alcoholic status. Mom and I went there and Mom went to the roof and asked this guy if I could have a job there because the other guy said that I could. I was waiting on the street and Mom yelled down to me ""do you have any hours spare?"" And I said I could do it Wednesday right after Native Animal Rescue. There was a guy on the street and he saw a toddler walk into the middle of the road and he decided to keep it. Then he was on the roof talking to this guy. There were twins and someone half jumped onto the train tracks in a subway. The toddler jumped off the roof and the guy was upset and angry. Then the building was on fire and we were waiting for the firemen. Then he ran down and it had been mostly put out and was smoky on the second and third level, but then he was at the top again. I took a shortcut and there were cats and dogs on the platform I had to organise them."
"3329"	"(2010-03-09 (19)) I was given some vibrators to look after. I put them in the glove box of my car. Later I was with Dad and Ezra. Dad was driving and Ezra was in the back in my seat. I hid another one in the glove box and it wouldn't close. Then I was at home. I went to get them out of the car but they were gone and I remembered that I had text Mom while I was at University to say that I had forgotten my lab coat and to check my bag and other places in my room. Then I was thinking that she didn't find them and they were there. Then I was going out with some guy called Eugene. We and some others went to a house/school place. I had been there when I was younger at least twice before. It was creepy. I remembered that I had found Zelda (Pet Semetary) and it had scared the hell out of me twice. I think that we were in trouble for something. We were in a building and we saw police outside and we all hid under the windows etc. I was in front of a door of a room that Eugene was in. He didn't know what was going on so I made a ssh sign and he went along with it. Then some guy got up and greeted one of the cops and said that we'd been here for a while and that we were okay and the cop left. I told Eugene about Zelda and he got goosebumps. She was actually related to someone and he said that she had freaked him out too. I saw a staircase leading up high and I figured it led up to her. I went to Eugene and grabbed his hand and we went up together. She was sitting at a sewing machine with her back to us. We went up close and then she turned around and it wasn't scary as it had been before. She said ""it's coming for you"" and I asked what and she talked normally and said ""evil"". When Eugene left she said it was him. He was like Jekyll & Hyde. I wasn't sure if he knew though."
"3330"	"(2010-03-10 (19)) I was sometimes Lexie (Grey's Anatomy). She was sleeping with Karev (Grey's Anatomy). He discovered that he loved her and they were in a hospital and he kissed her and she pushed him away. Then later they were talking again and she had her back against the wall and he put his hands on the wall and pressed up against her and kissed her and she pulled away in disgust. She said it was because they worked together. Then I was dating Callie (Grey's Anatomy). I went out with Nana in the middle of the night to check on some small people. They were about ant size. We had to cross this huge oval. Then she was Callie and I said that we should get our own bed. This was because we were sharing with two friends. I'm not sure if we were sharing a bed but we were definitely sharing the same room. When we got back, she said to them that we wanted our own room and they were actually friends of hers and I felt awkward. One of them looked like Leighton Meester. Callie said she wanted to move tonight and said that 'we've been sharing for [however long] , you can't expect us to stay here again'. Leighton looked upset but was then like 'until you meet hot twin guys' and then she said that they would keep the noise down. We then tried to work out the standard deviation of noise during sex. We laughed. Then they left and we saw two twin guys at the door and they were like 'whoa everyone's hot'."
"3331"	"(2010-03-11 (19)) There was a math thing. I was with a teacher and Ezra. I can't remember properly but he said we could join an online discussion with him. I was then at a shop thing. The teacher guy was there, although I didn't acknowledge him. There were some guys there that looked dodgy so Ezra and I ran. We opened a door and went in and shut it. It had no handle but I could hear the guy's just outside so I was trying to lock it but it could still be pushed in. Then it wasn't a room and there was a counter next to the door, so they just kept threatening us over the counter. There was also a gap between the counter and the shelf at the back. I'm not sure why they were keeping as there. The leader guy pulled the door out and on an angle, put it in neatly then I kicked it out. He picked on me and seemed to flirt with me. We were trying to find ways to escape. The guy kept annoying me and I went out through the shop and chased him outside. There was a road and the cars were going really fast and I pushed him out like five times but each time the cars missed him. Another one of his guys was watching. I was confused and laughed in shock. After that I voluntarily sat with them. He was sitting outside. Someone mentioned that he was spending a lot of time on me and he said that he never spent so much time trying to get with someone and that he had a crush on me. I was like 'ok...'. He was okay looking but wasn't my car (he was about 30-40 and tradesman like). I was using a fake name by the way. His name was Medd Menthril. I ended up kind of liking him. We also talked about getting married, which I agreed to. Eventually we were saved and he was set free. I was then at home which was different. Mom said she was going to start making dinner. I left and there was a big water thing around the shops and you could get a jet ski or something. I took out this fast boat but there was a speed limit and I was annoyed. I got to the end and this guy in a small boat was there to help people get off the boats. He turned around and it was Medd. We pretended we didn't know each other and this other guy said ""let's hear it for Gretchen (me)"" and I was thinking 'now he knows my real name'. I got home and I had a text from him asking me to put aside a list of movies for him and he also asked 'how old are you?'. I wrote down the movies on my finger and Mom asked what I was doing and I said that he had asked me to get movies for him. She accused me of having sex with him and I said I didn't (although I didn't know if I had). I was also thinking that maybe I had gotten Stockholm Syndrome."
"3332"	"(2010-03-13 (19)) It was post apocalyptic-y. We were all separated into groups. We were living on an oval with buildings that we built ourselves. We had 'houses', farms, markets etc. We called ourselves 'San Diego' [I watched Anchorman last night] . We had gotten new people in recently. Two girls and I went into a house looking for a friend. We peaked into the bedroom and there was a random guy in bed with a cigarette. We ran to leave but he caught me. I sent that we thought you were a friend of ours. His girlfriend complained too and I said we must have got the houses is mixed up and asked him to let me go. I suspected one of the new girls of being crazy. There had been other crazies but they had been dealt with. We had this paddock behind a shop which had sheep, cows and some other new creature. Some had died recently and I thought they had been killed but no one listened to me so I didn't say anything. I had found a bit of a hoof a while ago on a path but I had ignored it. Today I was walking near the paddock and I jumped into it. I saw this orange thing on the ground which was like a screwdriver handle and a paint scraper shoved into a hoof. I grabbed it and got out of there. I went to Rick (The Walking Dead comic) and asked him something and he asked why the lambs were out. They had been sprayed with something and we couldn't touch them or it would kill them. I said that I was just near the paddock and they had been in there. He fixed it up. There was a makeshift house for the leader which was two storeys but the first just consisted of a set of stairs and there were no walls. I saw the leader up there but I realised I didn't trust him. I went to Rick and I said ""can I talk to you for a second"" and he said sure and I said away from everyone else will stop he finished what he was doing and we walked away. I said ""I'm not sure if it's from a live one or a dead one"" and pulled out the half hoof and said ""but I found this the other day and then today I found this one"" and then handed him the other one. He fit together and we went to check the hooves of those still in there. I said that I had remembered seeing some hooves missing on a live one. I said that I suspected someone was killing them. There was a nerdy girl nearby reading a book series, the name of which was two words which both started with a P. I asked her something. Someone mentioned me going crazy when I saw two new guys throwing mangoes etc around (which was because we had limited food)."
"3333"	"(2010-03-14 (19)) There was a new season of Lost. Jack Davenport was in it and I was thinking that he was hot. I was in the dining room of the old house. Mom came out and was angry because I was in front of the fridge."
"3334"	"(2010-03-15 (19)) I went to this place to see Poppers and Nana. I was with Mom and Ezra. We had chocolate but had only four left. There was a white chocolate bunny which only had 6g of fat so I ate it. I think someone was chasing us and we were driving fast down a snowy road which had lots of things in the way to stop you from driving wildly. Then we started running and I was jumping over traps. I was then at University and I went on and MAIS. I had new grades released for an assessment for ANS102, but the assessment was actually just saying that the site was going to be down later. I had grades for the self quizzes on which I'd got 81% and 82% and a valence thing on which I had gotten 80%. Somehow my average grade was 88%. I couldn't read the notes on the valence thing (it wasn't really valences). I went outside to wait for Mom. I called her and she said she was just leaving. I sat at a bench and then this girl came up and said 'I want to sit at this table, we're going to [something I can't read] "" and I said okay. Two of them were black and then they weren't. The girl in front of me said 'look at this' and she had drawn a random squiggle on a piece of paper and then she said that I had screwed it up. She turned around and it was a drawing of her face but it was really good and had colour but the other drawing she tried didn't work. This guy there wanted to try it by drawing a love heart. The bench started spinning wildly around barely missing the trees. I was screaming and laughing. It finally stopped and he had basically drawn nothing but there was a small love heart drawn in pencil. Mom called to say that she was here. Ezra was then there and I took a photo of them all."
"3335"	"(2010-03-16 (19)) Nana's house was a zoo. There was a baby elephant inside and the mother was outside ready to give birth. I was with the baby elephant. There were a lot of media people outside. The mother elephant climbed over a fence"
"3336"	"(2010-03-16 (19)) I went for a drive with Ezra. I was driving and I went into a carpark and I saw someone who looked like a cop and then I remembered that I shouldn't be driving alone. I went to park and there was another person there and I parked in a pram bay and then drove through to a normal spot. Then I was on a red moped thing. I was then at a petrol station and Rover was there. I said ""anguish"" and he looked at me with a weird look. I knocked on the window of the station to tell Ezra. This skinny girl walked up to me and said ""do you have a Porsche?"" And I said no, laughing. She said okay and walked off but then she called out ""do you have any passions?"" And I said ""yes, one"" and Ezra was laughing. Then I was filling up the car with disco music and petrol. The girl distracted me and I put too much petrol in (I think it went over by one dollar). She squirted me with a hose and tried to get me with petrol. This guy showed me this cord thing to wrap around the moped wheels to keep stuff in place. Then there was this movie which was the third in a trilogy and it was called Satan's Grave. The first one was set in Western times, the second was more recent and the third one was set in the present. The first one was made in the 80's and Clint Eastwood was in it. It involved time travel. I was then in a huge library. This guy said it was during school hours and I said that I was in University and he was like 'pfft' and said he didn't care. I said ""I'm 19!"" And I showed him a Proof of Age card but he said it was different. It also said that my birthday was in 1994. They refused to let me stay there. Then it was the movie again. This new guy had just finished writing his last 'note' and he found one from SVP (Clint Eastwood's character) which had been written in 2082 (which was now) saying that 'whoever else wrote in here we know who you are' etc."
"3337"	"(2010-03-17 (19)) I was at Toys ""R"" Us. It was a tiny new shop but I liked it because it was neat. I was there to get something unrelated. There were two Asians at the counter. There was an ad for Warcraft. Mom and Ezra went outside. I had gotten some lollies and I did something and then I went outside. One of the Asians said 'you're Alliance, I'm Horde and strong and [something about backing off] ' and he didn't call me a bitch. Then the other Asian said 'I think she is confused'. He came out and had an American accent and said he was level 1 and I said that I was level 68 but I had only started a few months ago. He said he was in a high-level guild and that he would go with them on raids etc. They would all end up dying and he would be the only one left. Mom was up a hill in an ugly green car which she ended up buying. Later I was driving and approached these lights which were red but were flickering green. But then they stayed red but Mom told me to go left. We ended up lost and walking. Then we found a shop that had nice rolls. We went up a path and we found 'guard horses'. There were four. They told Mom about this diet/workout thing that I had seen before. This was on a collection of short films and was the last one. We had gone to the beach before. I also got a low mark on my math assignment."
"3338"	"(2010-03-17 (19)) I took Ezra to McDonald's because he was working. We were late because we went somewhere and I had said that we had to leave but they were like 'there's plenty of time' (he started at 6pm). I said it was 6:30pm (it was 6.27). We quickly went there. I hung around for a bit and I actually worked there too. I was just about to leave and this Indian guy wanted a muffin, saying that he wanted ""a small one"" and I asked ""a small what?"" and I eventually figured out he meant muffin. Music was playing on a television and Good Man in a Bad Time came on and I was like ""I love this song""."
"3339"	"(2010-03-18 (19)) I went to some event thing with Dad. We left in his car although we had gone there in mine. I asked 'what about my car?' and I text Mom to ask if we could pick it up tonight. I was annoyed because I had almost finished my logbook. We got back home which was a bit different. This creepy guy came to the door and told me to come with him. I did and jokingly asked ""I don't have to get in the back seat of your car do I?"". There was a car across the road that was normal looking it was red on the side and black everywhere else. He told me to look inside and I saw my car keys (although I had them on me too) and other stuff of mine. He said that it was for me. It turned out that it was because Bret Michaels was related to us. His son, Eugene, looked like him but was uglier and they had only recently found out that they were related, which led them to finding out about me. Then he wasn't Bret but was some other rich guy/explorer. We were in a room with some others and he gave a speech and said that most of us would get money from him, but some wouldn't. He said that the first $500,000 was over there and he pointed to my car. There was a party game, where you did an 'evil' stare at people and if your eyes glinted, the person you looked at 'died'. You had to be drunk from a certain drink though and I wasn't drunk, but I played anyway. When I went out later some of the red paint came off. Poppa was around as well and I felt kind of bad because of my old car. I was driving the new car and there was no lag when taking off and it was really comfy etc. There were bad guys after the famous guy and he grabbed his daughter (who was me at this point and was a toddler). He ran up a lot of stairs which were gate like. He got to the top and then his son Eugene who was still the same age, was puffed out. There was a trolley and someone asked ""why isn't this running?"" and then jumped down."
"3340"	"(2010-03-19 (19)) I was friends with Obama. Years ago some lady had done something to his wife, who was different. She had had a son who was this weird midget and then it showed them years later and they were in space and they still wanted to find her. The midget still looked the same and had grey hair and was retarded. They were making their way to Earth. Anyway, Obama got me to find out about them. This happened a while ago. I went to see him and he was in a room with this table with a curtain around it. He said ""hard day?"" And I said why and he said 'I could tell'. He then said that his wife knew about us. I said ""we haven't done anything"" and I was confused. He looked at me and then he said the thing about the lady. I said that I had seen a look in her eye when she was near the midget. His wife really didn't like me and was suspicious of me. I had some pens I had to give to him secretly but she was watching so I left. Mom gave this black coat to Ezra to use as a distraction. I went with Ezra and we went to 'school'. We were late. I realised I'd forgotten to straighten my hair too. I was then outside a classroom and was running and joking around with some people. I went to the toilet which had joint urinals and had open seats which I thought was lame so I didn't go. There were guys on the computers outside and they were trying to get 10,000 people to join something and they were about 10 people way and I pressed ctrl + alt + F4 and ran. They were angry and Obama was up ahead (he was working out of the school). I got to him and he was with someone else. I said there was a weird vibration in my leg. They told me to talk to Mr Willingham, who was called Hupping, and he told me to go to the nurse. I asked for Anna and they asked 'who's Anna?' and I said ""Anna Kendrick"". I told her and I said I had been recommended to come here by Mr Hupping and they let me in. I told the nurse what was happening and she pressed a little round muscle on the back of my knee and said ""this fat little bugger!"" I said I had been on a 'diet' but I was having trouble now due to my legs. She gave me a list of good foods to eat which were mostly gross. Also at some point I was carrying around some of my dreams and they got wet which I got upset about."
"3341"	"(2010-03-19 (19)) This guy took me and some others in a car. I knew was bad but he didn't know that I knew. It was night time. We got to this snowy place and we stopped and I got out of the car and I ran. I ran up this hill which was covered in fake snow which was like a carpet and I used it to pull me up. There were a lot of houses and they all had these LED signs with temperatures written on them (all the temperatures were different though). I went into a house which was dark and empty. I heard a noise coming from the front of the house so I lay down and started to pull myself into the house, but this guy came in and had a look. He said 'I think that's Izzy' but he was looking for someone else first. I watched his shadow to make sure that he left and then I went out the front way. They turned off all the street lights. I went into this other house and there was a kitchen with steps leading down to a kid's room with two beds. There were a heap of blankets and whatnot at the end of the first bed and I hid under the blankets just as some people came into the house. This young boy found me and said 'I see people... in my head'. He tried to help me. His other sibling was getting smacked. I said that I should leave and ended up staying the night. In the morning I heard the mother saying that she filled in the blanks - he had written some stuff on the window which mentioned my name. She wasn't in the room so I quickly opened the window and climbed out. It was now day. I had asked the boy where the good hiding places were. I ended up at a pet shop. I wondered if everyone in the town was evil. Seth Green worked in there. I saw this official guy in there as I opened the door so I hid my face and pretended to open the door for him."
"3342"	"(2010-03-20 (19)) I was going on a boat ride with Mom although we mostly swam. It took us five days to get where we were going. Rover was with us. Then there was like a road in the water - there were two sets of buoys on the far ends and two smaller sets of buoys in the middle to make it into two lanes. The weather was bad and stormy. Then we had to hold onto the big buoys and stay within the lane. I got sent underwater for ""15 seconds"" although it had been 20 and one more second and I would have died. Mom gave me a coat hanger and told me to bang this pipe to see if anything was stuck in it. I grabbed it out of the water and whacked it but nothing happened. Then this guy was with us and he was Mom's boyfriend or something. He was actually a swimmer. Mom was yelling at him and they broke up just before we reached a 'rest' save point. Then we were on the boat. Rover and Gizmo were cuddled up together. There was a German shepherd and some puppies and I picked one up. I held it like a baby and it was adorable. They sent them out but they kept coming back in. Some time later the guy from before had lost weight and now had a six-pack. At first I was just on a computer and saw some pictures but then it was real life. He hit on Mom and then on me and I said I wasn't interested. Some time before, I was on the internet and years ago I had this online game, called 'Hotie'? I had made it and it was for ages 12-14? I hadn't been on it for years and I had applicants from 2002-2009. I think the point was to choose yourself and some others and then you pick a sentence and then I give a list of 'muffins' and they would choose one and I would put the word at the end of a sentence. The 'muffins' were like round balls and were made of fudge, ice-cream, mint and then white and brown chocolate mixed together etc."
"3343"	"(2010-03-20 (19)) Dad, Ezra, Roland and I were in a car going down a country like road. There were two lanes on each side of the road. A white van was coming down the right name on our side. There were dead animals on a playground on the side of the road, I saw dogs and sheep. We got to our destination which was like a holiday home. We decided that we couldn't be bothered going there and so we turned to go back. There had been more animals killed. Dad said that he heard on the news something about killer with a white Ute and then one flew past us. We decide to go back to the holiday home and saw more dead animals going all the way up to the house. We decided that the killer must still be around and so we turned back again. We then had a flying vehicle thing which was made up of four balloons and we all held onto them. The killer ran out of the gates at the front of the house and shot an arrow and hit a balloon. The others fell off. I blew into the balloon to keep it up high. They were running down the road and I was flying above them. The guy shot another balloon out. We ended up in a shop and we were trying to get to the exit when he shot down a third balloon. As he was shooting them down I was getting closer to the ground. I was almost at the door when he shot the last one down. We went outside and it was dark but it seemed that the unlit areas were like 'nothing'. We got into a car and drove over the unlit areas to get to the road which went through the shop area. Then we got out of the car and we had to hitch a ride. This guy stopped and he had his son in the back seat. He was going in the opposite direction so I asked him if he could take me to the bus stop. I got to one which was weird and wasn't TransMetro. I saw a station up ahead. One was going to Centerville and was leaving in five minutes. I asked the guy for a dollar and I said that I'd give it back over the net or another way. He gave me $10 in coins. I got his details and his name was Stanley Reeithis or something. There was two minutes before the train left and I ran down the steps to get to the platform but I had no idea where to buy a ticket. This lady was saying something about Ezra and Roland and I said ""Oh, are you Roland's mother?"" And she said yes and said that they had gotten tattoos. The next train wasn't for 41 minutes. Then I was back at the top of the station standing outside. There was lots of traffic. This guy on a bike crashed and his head was bleeding on the ground. I took a photo of it but then I realized my phone wasn't on silent. Police came. I called Mom to say that I would be a while."
"3344"	"(2010-03-21 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop. Ezra was eating ice cream. I had one and then three pieces of Vegemite toast. Then Mom made a huge chicken dinner."
"3345"	"(2010-03-22 (19)) I was at Dad's house. There was a little train there."
"3346"	"(2010-03-22 (19)) I was watching South Park with Mom. Kyle and Stan had grown up. Stan and others were making fun of Kyle and then they left and Kyle was upset and they told him later they were just joking. I was with Ezra and a friend of Ezra's. We went to this creepy neighbourhood which I'd dreamt about before. It was like World of Warcraft. I had to go into this cave and get something but there were mobs around and they were hard to kill, so I was trying to avoid them. They attacked us and we ran. I went home and it was different. Mom went out and was going to be a while. It was night, about 9pm. We went to this ice cream shop. Later they wanted to go out again and I said that I wanted to come. I grabbed my keys and was going to follow them but they got in this other car and took off. I did a two finger salute at them. I noticed that there was mail in the mailbox. The postman came walking up. He was sort of hot but was like an average build. He gave me some more mail and left. But as I took it all out, he came back and I realized he was dodgy and whacked him with the mail, which included some chocolate. I ran to the door and he tried to open it but it was locked. I said that my brother has the key. I stabbed him with my car key. He started to bleed and I unlocked the door and went in. He blocked the lock, but let it go for a second and I locked it. I locked the back door too and he said ""forget something?"" and he had come through the other back door. We ended up in a bedroom with two beds. I was half hanging off one and he was on top of the bed, raping me, except he was somewhat gentle and I liked it. He told me to hold the bottom of the bed. At some point before I had managed to get on MSN and told Ezra that a guy had broken in."
"3347"	"(2010-03-23 (19)) I was at a post office to hand in my passport application. A lady served me. It was in a cinema and Clash of the Titans was playing on the screen. She was like 'we can do this now and then watch the movie or we can go behind the counter'. I went with the latter option. I was like 'I hope I can get it this time'. One of the questions was about the average life expectancy of students at Westland University. I was telling Mom about this lady on the Internet who was a dobber - she would get people who failed to reference properly. I said that David Duchovny had played a joke on her. She was a taxi driver and he had her come out to this spooky forest. Then he did it again another time. There was a virus which turned off all computers. A fire started from the carpet at home. I ran to my room and it was everywhere. There was also some quest and I got sent a letter to eat a muffin to give me extra strength etc."
"3348"	"(2010-03-24 (19)) I was going to two schools and doing certain units at one. I was outside with Ezra and Rover. It was night but it was easy to see. There was a fence and I could see through it a little from this side. There were two guys from my class who were both kind of hot. One was really quiet and the other wasn't. I had a weird feeling about one of them (he was the hoter one, and had a very flat nose but it looked good). Both of them had dark hair and eyes. There was a little dog that I had got and a thing where the dog slides onto you. Some boys were watching and were like 'whoa a girl can do it'. This Indian woman was on their side and they got up and started talking to her saying stuff like 'Hello madam' etc. I reached my hand around the back and pulled out a water bottle and took a sip. I think he was going to kill her, so me and Ezra got up and ran away. We wiped our footprints from the sand and we had some trouble with a lock, which was like a USB and kept sliding out. I left the school. I tried heaps of others such as Creekside, which I was supposed to start in an hour but I didn't want to go. I reluctantly went back to the old school which was called Midvale but people from Brookland High School were there - well, I saw some photos of the Year 12's with six different ones. I was going to look for Eugene's but later I saw a video of them waiting. Evelyn was there and was just going for photos. I was then in class and there was a guy who looked like Shen next to me listening to You and Me except it was more techno. I tapped my finger along to it. The more talkative guy from before was there and he was going around the other side of the desk talking to people. I was wondering if he would recognize me (he had liked me before). Someone asked ""who made Gone With the Wind? Was it Scarlett O'Hara?"" and I was like 'what the hell?'. The guy sat at my desk."
"3349"	"(2010-03-26 (19)) I was at university in the carpark. I pulled up next to a car to wait for Dad. Eugene's car was next to me. We were then all standing around together and he was really tall and older looking. We then became friends. Then it was like the comic Crossed. I was with some others including Rover. We were at a shop. The Crossed attacked us and we ran. The cross looked like swastika from the side. We were then outside a little building. One of us got Crossed and attacked another one. Rover also got Crossed so I killed him. This guy grabbed a girl and fell to the ground. He was Crossed but he grabbed a pole and stabbed himself and then he was okay. We realised that we could change back and I was upset about Rover. To change back they had to do a good deed."
"3350"	"(2010-03-26 (19)) I had two ANS102 assignments. They both involved me doing a prac somewhere. Mom and I went to one and it was at the old house. The games room door was on the other side and I ran out and Ms Burton was there with some others at a table. I asked it was too late and she said that it was. I mentioned that I used to live here but my aunt did now. Rover and some other people were in the pool. Then I was at Nana's. Aunt Sally and her kids came over. One of them were given $25 in coins and chucked it in the bin and left. I took it out and put in my money box. I had a small shelf to keep stuff on. I was reorganizing it. I was then outside a shop. Stuff started chasing me and acting weird. I went into a building and Wilhemina (Ugly Betty) was in a room. I went past and I heard a snort. I was near Marc (Ugly Betty) and I called out ""Willy?"" and she replied ""yeah"" and I asked ""are you alive?"" and then she said ""yes"". She also took something from me and Dad and herself? There was something do with clothes. Then I was in a shop and stuff was chasing me down the aisles etc. At the end of it, people thought I was crazy because they hadn't seen any of it. Then I was this guy and he was singing a song in a strait jacket. The walls behind him had weird creatures on them and they were filming him. I could get reputation with some creatures (like in World of Warcraft)."
"3351"	"(2010-03-27 (19)) I was watching The X-Files. Mulder and Scully were at a house. I was with Scully. There was a dressing table and some glasses on top. I put them on and then I could see the mother, grandma and daughter who lived there and were dead. I freaked out and Scully didn't believe me. Then the grandma was going to kill herself to save the girl and the mother was crazy. I cried a lot. There were some cheap houses in Seaside and I said that I wouldn't live in Seaside. Then we were in groups and there were beds in one room with no room to walk. I was with Ezra and we were using a picture to map the beds."
"3352"	"(2010-03-28 (19)) Some others and I had to get into a building. We got to the top and we had to run out down some stairs. It was night. Then it was like a game. There was a fortune teller in the shop and she said that someone, who was good, would end up with Seber who was the leader of the bad guys. She did say ""Destinies can be changed"". I was going down the aisle and there was a Stanley Kubrick section but there was only The Simpsons stuff. This guy came and grabbed me and I realised it was Seber, and he put his hand over my mouth and took me away. He had me locked up at the back of the shop. My boyfriend came and was allowed to stay with me. There was a blanket on the floor and we cuddled under it. Seber was just nearby. My boyfriend said we should go naked and he took his clothes off and I took my shirt off. I didn't know if he had taken his pants off but then I felt his bits touching me. He asked if I still had my pants on and I said yes, but then I took them off. I hadn't originally, because I didn't want to. I fell asleep and I woke up later and Mom was there and had taken my clothes away. I got up and found my clothes and went to the bathroom and got changed. I had my period and there was a blood stain on the mattress. Then I was at an outside concert thing. There were competition things. One girl was singing some rock song and audience that was there left and another five people left. There was a guy at another section singing Doctor for My Heart and there weren't many people there either. I was inside a shop and I was looking for the toilet. I worked there as well. It was then night but it was still open. I ended up in this quiet area and I thought to go check on my car because I didn't know if I had locked it. This black guy was nearby and he grabbed me and wanted my keys. I screamed for help in this girl saw me and attacked him and then we ran. The police came to deal with him. I went out to my car and put my wallet was in there and grabbed my phone. I text Mom saying that 'I got attacked'. I pressed the lock and held it down and then I left. I looked back and I saw two old ladies in the car. They were taking money out of my wallet and they were saying that it was her daughter's car. I pulled out my licence etc and she realised the mistake and gave me the money back. I got them out, took her key and then locked it and left. As I went to go back in I saw the black guy coming out and he saw me and then I recognised him. He smiled and came after me again. Daniel (Ugly Betty) saw and grabbed the black guy. The police came again. My boss was like 'how can this happen in the dark' and he'd just come from Washington DC and nothing like that happened there. Daniel was then talking to my boss on the phone and I told him to ssh."
"3353"	"(2010-03-29 (19)) It was Sims 2 like. There was a lady called Julie that moved into town. I think she was in the army. There was a fire at someone's house this lady's teenage son died. There was a thing where you got a clone one in The Island. Later I was at cinema with some friends and a guy who liked me. Then I was in the movie or something and I was hearing voices in Spanish. Then there was a new season of the UK version of Queer as Folk but it was set in the past, like in gladiator times. This guy liked this girl who was married to this leader guy. They had been friends. The guy got sick of the leader one day and pushed him into a deep hole. He hit the ground and this creature was supposed to eat him but he was okay. The guy who pushed him in was like 'oops'. The opening of the show showed Aidan Gillen and some dude kissing. I was also on LastFM at some point and I deleted this guy's play history and then he did it to me and I was like 'flip, I lose my stats'."
"3354"	"(2010-03-31 (19)) I was studying for exams. I went out and Mom and Darren said I had to do something. On TV some guy had been asked to play a part in some thing that I think was fake but he didn't know it. Darren said I had to go see him at some place which was to prove my 'trust' because I was suspected of killing a friend of theirs. It was 1:30 AM. They said it was to see if I was the 'person I used to be' and I said ""I haven't changed since I was six"". As I stormed out the door with Mom, he said something about 'sucks on lollipop'. Mom's car was undercover and mine was out the front of the house. I went out to my car and I said 'Oh, I can't drive because of the night time restrictions'. I started walking back to the house and I saw this guy come running quickly from one house over. I saw him stick a gun up at Mom and I ran to the front door, scared."
"3355"	"(2010-04-01 (19)) I was at a petrol station filling up my car. It leaked a bit and I said to someone nearby ""I've only been driving alone for a while"". Elijah was behind me and he said that he had just got his P plates. My car had a retractable roof. I got in and got onto Newtown Drive. Later I was doing sport at University. Ezra was there and I noticed that his hair was short. Eugene was there too. This Asian guy was with Mom and they threw a rock and the Asian broke his hand. Everyone left. I let him in and tried to work out a way to take him to the hospital."
"3356"	"(2010-04-02 (19)) Eugene and I were going out. We went to Nana's. There was a huge meal set out like when we go up there for holidays. She hadn't met him before and she was like ""oh, who are you?"" and I said ""a retard"" and he laughed and said ""I'm Izzy's... boyfriend?"". I felt uncomfortable about it. I got a plate with food with a big ball of lettuce and an egg which was half white. I cut the white out and there was a black yolk which tasted funny. I said it tasted weird and Eugene said his did too. Nana said it was Vegemite and garlic and I was like 'ew'. We also both stretched at one point the same way and Nana pointed it out. I could time travel. Then I was at a place and I had to go on this playground which had slats of wood with different years on them. I can't remember why but I went to the past for a bit. I had to sing in a choir to pass it. I went further back to when Ezra was a toddler. Mom and Dad were there. We were outside and I was in the car. Mom had told me a story before of a time when she had to feed Ezra but a huge storm had interrupted her. The sky was dark and cloudy and there was lightning and it looked like bad CGI, but otherwise it looked awesome so I took out my phone to take pictures. I locked myself in the car and they left. This guy came to the window of the car and I said ""you are going to get struck by lightning now"". The storm started but ended quick. I drove off to find them and they were on the side of the road. I turned around and came back and they were like 'oh my God did you hit the curb?' And I said ""no because I'm not a frickin' idiot"""
"3357"	"(2010-04-03 (19)) The world was getting attacked by terrorists everywhere. This girl friend that this guy liked got taken. He saved her and others. Then he came running into this building yelling something to the girl. Everyone there was ok and he realised it had all been a dream. He and the girl ended up together though."
"3358"	"(2010-04-03 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was outside and this guy gave me this jumper which let me fly. I had to jump into the air and flap my arms. A group of us were doing it. Then I drove to some house and there was a lady there. I was with some friends and I think someone was sick. She gave us food etc. We went to leave and there was a maze outside and I couldn't maneuver out."
"3359"	"(2010-04-04 (19)) Mom woke me up. I got ready for school and then she took me there. It was dark and there were like three people there. I checked the time and it was 4 AM. She had woken me up at 2:40 AM. She then text me that she had realised the time. I told her to pick me up. This teacher guy came out and told me to be quiet on the phone, but I had already gotten off and I complained back saying that I was being quiet. Mom took me home and her and Ezra played a card game. I waited for a while and I was going to drive to University but it was peak hour. Note: in RL I had to get up early this morning to pick Ezra and Dad up and when I woke up just now my phone was off. I also watched some Modern Family and there was a character called Izzy Jade who interacted with Sofia Vergara's character."
"3360"	"(2010-04-04 (19)) This was sort of continued on from the last dream. We went to the old house because I had to get some stuff. Ezra was with me and he asked if I could drop him off at a roundabout to make it easier. I started at 11:30 AM and it was 10:10 AM. I started to panic so Mom came to get him. My hair wasn't straightened. I got my lab coat and there was heaps of stuff already in my bag. I left at about 10:20 AM. I was on the freeway which was different. It rained heavily and I have my wipers on. Cars were breaking a lot and it was peak hour etc. Up ahead I could see cops shining a light in all the cars. One stopped me and said to keep my radio on. I kept going and they said that a guy in a white Corvette was dangerous. The right lane was free and I saw him coming up. He sped passed and the cops followed. Everyone else sped up and followed too. He ended up getting out of his car and running. We all got out and some people chased him excitedly. A news crew were there and I watched them. I walked past and someone's shirt said 'Little Nemo'. I went to this shop and this guy was there next to me and he said his ""Poppa"" and I said 'oh, are you Greek?' and he said yeah. I said that I call mine Poppa too. He waved me off like 'what ever, I don't care'. He kept saying stuff like that he was better than me etc and I said 'yeah right'. I text Mom to ask if she heard anything about the guy from before. This cord got stuck under the guy in the shop and when I went to move it he got all spazzy and I yelled at him and said ""I'll do it slowly if you don't trust me!"". I went through some clothes at the shop. Eventually I got to University and I was early."
"3361"	"(2010-04-05 (19)) There was a class on for writing. Eugene was there. I pretended not to see him. I had to go across the hall to another room for a bit and Geneva was there. This lady talked to us and then we left. Mom wasn't there to pick me up so I called her. Eugene got on a bicycle and left and it had a licence plate. I left with Mom but before we did Eugene's father Abraham was talking to us and flirting with me. We ended up back at their house which was different. Then his father and some others were being weird. We went to the elevator to leave. This priest guy was there and we waited for him to leave and then we got on. They Eugene came with this big blowup like thing. They caught him so we opened the doors and let him in. We got down and ran to the car and then left. We were in my car and I didn't have much petrol. We ended up falling off a cliff but we were okay. We went back to Eugene's building. Then I was at this hole in the wall where I had put stuff when I was younger - stuff that was worth money such as drugs, rocks, a big fat fish and 'dog' fish (which were cute)."
"3362"	"(2010-04-06 (19)) I got an iPad demo which was like $500. It was really big and wide. There was a Maxis like game. Then it had different areas with different characters and things to do. There was a path which went into a forest. I had to go to ""Broadway"" and listen to a song by a guy. There were little houses and people would give you stuff. There was a little path with a car at the end and this guy would play music for you. He played Can't Take My Eyes off of You for me. I went to this computer section where I had to download this thing. This zombie girl was there, so I picked up some weapons. Then Ezra was there too. We both went off to show him stuff. Then it felt weird and I saw this dog running. I realised the zombies were coming and yelled 'run'. We ran and we held hands to slow me down. These gates were locked so we had to go the long way around. We ended up at this apartment. We saw people that we didn't know there. There was blood all over the steps. The zombies were rabid and the people and us hid and they eventually left. They said that everyone else was dead and that they had been attacked earlier. We found a survivor - a young black kid. They carried him out. We all walked out to leave when we found a heap of other survivors. It looks like it says they shouted for skin? They took us back to their area. I said that other zombies were slow. This girl said that there were different types. Later that day I was with someone around the back and they were acting weird. Then they bit someone and their voice became raspy and they came after me. I started walking backwards away from them and as they walked they became more rabid. Eventually they turned completely and started screeching and flapping their arms. I started running backwards calling out ""Spearow!"" which was a code to the girl. Eventually I got around and I think someone killed them. We were now preparing because more would come. We had nowhere to hide but we went inside anyway. We turned the perimeter lights off. The zombies pulled a submarine apart from and were now hanging around. When it all calmed down we went out and pretended to be one of them. There were these two metal bars parallel to each other like rails and we did push-ups over them. The girl from before and I were walking through them. They mostly had black eyes but it didn't matter. We had 'evil' grins at our faces because that helped. We had gone 'undercover' before. No one liked me. I was called Hildy [I watched His Girl Friday last night] . We went to this bench where some zombies were sitting. Me and the girl had a fake argument and we stormed off. This other normal girl was involved too. Then we were in a shop and someone called out ""intruder!"" and then pointed to us and said that we knew she was an intruder; they were pointing to the other girl. I gently pushed her along and said that 'yes, she's the only one'. She was shocked that we'd given her up. I pushed her into the aisle and they all ate her in like two seconds. We all licked our lips and the girl and I slowly left the shop. We went out to the carpark which was full of cars. We now had a guy with us. We all got into a car and went to leave but then this girl came that looked like Milla Jovovich. They let her in despite my objections. I was driving and there were people on the road. I was watching out the cops."
"3363"	"(2010-04-07 (19)) I was watching Kenny vs Spenny [I watched it last night] . Spenny was chatting to some school girl with big boobs. He invited her to something and then I realised that she was only 13. Then he was drunk somewhere and had facial hair and was singing and then said ""Heil!"" at the end (like that little bit at the end of The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill) and I was trying remember what song it was from and I was thinking that it was Wishing (If I Had A Photograph Of You). I had to get Spenny approved by some insurance thing so that he could go into some shops. One was a kid's shop. Then Kenny and I were in a shop. I hadn't told him about Spenny and he had asked me not to. They had some lollies like those bracelets things. The 13 year old from before had a geometry test, but wanted to go out instead. I went to the park with Mom and Rover. There was a magazine with a diet plan where you could lose 2 kg in two weeks. Running was part of the exercise. I decided to use the mowed part of the oval to run on but Mom complained so I decided to stick to the abnormal route."
"3364"	"(2010-04-07 (19)) I lived at this weird place like a hut but there were lots of doors and people etc. I shared a bed with some guy. His fingers were touching me and I pushed him away, but then he did it again. I asked him if he had a pen. The people below us did and I reached down and took one. The guy kept putting his arm around me etc. Then, he had told me he liked me. We were friends, but I didn't know how I felt about him. Some girl friends and I had to go to this Science Museum place. It was huge and there were a lot of elevators and halls to places far away. They were trying to get me to talk to the guy and I didn't want to so I ran away. This one girl in particular chased me. I went behind this curtain and she followed. It was very dark and I jumped over this thing into another section. The other girls gave my hiding place up. Eventually I gave in. We went to this elevator and we had to stand on a seat and step into this TV (it was a perception thing). We were then outside a building and there was a vending machine with lite Mars Bars but then I realized they were Kinda Bueno's. There were lots of people around. There was a question on an assignment and this guy was asking if anyone understood it -- it was about measuring the 'safeness' of these two parties. There was another elevator which took us into this dark hall. This lady came out of a room and we asked where the exit was. She pointed to it and said it was 4am and asked 'why are you on my phone?' [I think, that's what it looks like it says] ."
"3365"	"(2010-04-08 (19)) I had also signed up for the RSPCA. I hadn't gone to either of them yet. It was now time for RSPCA. It was from 10 AM to 1 AM but when I got there I realised that I'd forgotten the forms and it was now 10:30 AM. I went to go home but there was a hailstorm. People from school were there. A Ute got smashed. When I got home I remembered we got to choose your hours. I was watching Ugly Betty. Betty had a baby and Daniel was possibly the father. Some fancy school said they wouldn't take him and people accused Daniel of doing it. Mom and Ezra had mail. They were 'Valentines' from a volunteering place. I had done them. Ezra's said ""To Tommy"" and ""from Lana Lang (Smallville)"". I asked ""who's mine from?"" and it said Oliver Queen (Smallville). I giggled, thinking I must've done it because he was the hotest, but then it was Zod (Smallville). There were also a few from Clark. Then I had a bar? When people from it, they got a green symbol above their head. This new guy was with this guy in armour who had light skill (like in Smallville yesterday) -- I don't remember what I was talking about here. I went in and some people had red symbols. I said to my friends to not drink because it was bad and I gave them mine. I tripped some person over so they would spill their drink and I gave them my drinks ""on the house"". A guy friend of mine was worried about his red symbol. Then the guy with the light wanted to kill me. A bunch of us told him to leave. We discovered he was blind. Zod stayed behind. I went back quietly and whispered to him and then hid under a desk. The light guy came looking for me. Zod attracted him somewhere else. I was copying his movements on this metal framework thing; hold and jump etc. But then he made a bit disappear and Zod fell to the ground. He got out and later ran across the restaurant and hid under a table, while the light shot at us. People at the bar were angry at me for not letting them drink. They read out from an old diary of mine. It mentioned some crush from when I was younger called ""Peter Bishop"" (Fringe). I took it off them, upset, and they realized it was wrong and were nice again."
"3366"	"(2010-04-08 (19)) I was at university after hours (i.e., it was late). There were ladies checking for people. I said to one that I had to stay to check out a building. There was some experiment with these mice -- there were two of them and I had to hold onto this handle and shock them in the head? This lady marked all the tests and I got 51% and I was like 'lame'. This mouse was getting tired and the lady let them off. They collapsed and there were heaps of them running around. I called the mouse 'Gizmo', because it was like Gizmo."
"3367"	"(2010-04-09 (19)) Wilhelmina (Ugly Betty) cloned herself or something. The other her was evil and took over. Actually, the evil her could've also been from an alternate universe. She killed the clone thing. Silvio and Paulie (both from The Soprano's) were guards. She led someone to this place, asking ""it's south of Canada, right?"" and they said they were north. Silvio and Paulie ended up getting killed and I was annoyed because they were my favourite characters. Ezra left his phone with me and I took photos of myself. Also, at some point this guy weighed Wilhelmina, Ezra and I and Ezra was the 'ideal' weight. It said I weighed 190lbs. Wilhelmina was also overweight. Then everything was over. Casey (Chuck) was tied up in a chair. He looked like Jayne (Firefly) though [I started rewatching Firefly last night] . I had this belt and looking serious, I went over and did a whip movement and he was like ""hey!"" and I laughed -- he had thought I was bad for a second. I showed Mom and she fumbled with the belt. I couldn't stop laughing."
"3368"	"(2010-04-10 (19)) I went on MAIS. Ms Burton said that there was an 'expulsion' of results and that some results had been lost and those people would have to do extra credit. It also said that a red car had been affected. I was now at home and I went to my car. It was in an underground car park. The car was facing the wall and it was next to this tiny blue 'cab' part of a Ute. There was another car parked nearby and it had heaps of oil under it and around it, almost flooding it. People were sweeping water. I was then in a library and Natalie Warbuton was there and she grabbed a pile of my dreams, thinking they were for her to read out and I said 'they're mine, they're not relevant' etc. She couldn't read them anyway. Dad text me saying that he and a friend wanted me to help them with some chemistry stuff. Ezra got a job at a shop, sweeping. We turned the music up in the shop, because the shop next door's music was louder. This guy said Ezra could get Poppa anytime to go to Midvale deli (I think the shop was at Midvale) and get food. The deli closed at 8pm."
"3369"	"(2010-04-10 (19)) Some of us had 'powers'. We came to this place to practice them. Raquel had good balance and something else. Dad was there. There was a tunnel in the wall and someone chased me. He said to go home and don't stop. I went out some hole and ran away and he was confused about it. Then we were in groups, but I think the other group was bad. We had these cards to put up in the middle of the room and they all did different things. We had to make them stand up for them to work though. One guy on the other side had these big hoops that he threw and they would go around people. We built the wall to completely separate us but the guy still got me."
"3370"	"(2010-04-11 (19)) Sean Maher (it wasn't him, but it 'was') and I had become friends and were secretly dating. I kept sneaking off to make out with him. He was lying in this thing and I lay on top of him and we kissed. I told Nana he was going to make us food, but then it was something weird, so she made it. There was a 'chicken' with a big lump (like a loaf) of brown stuff, which was caused from it swelling up from the air, which happened sometimes. I left and went to this room and Sean put his arms around me and I put my hands on his back and we kissed (the 'holding' was quite vivid). I came back to my room later and the bed was messy and there were clothes on it as well as other stuff. I started to clean it up. Then Sean was Cory Monteith. He had to go back to America or whatever soon, but he wanted to stay. We were trying to work out how it would work and we eventually decided that he could to go some music thing at the start of semester 3. We celebrated. Mom had finished cleaning my bed. There was a list of hot guys and I remember seeing Aidan Gillen's name and there were love hearts on the i's."
"3371"	"(2010-04-11 (19)) I went to school. I was in class and we had this seat thing which floated around the room. Jeremiah came in with other people, including Ms Solomon. Mr Stevenson came into the room and his name was Jumphed or something -- they all had changed a few letters in their names. Then I was driving at night. I knocked on the door of a house and it was little and in random spot, but it was Ms Solomon's. She let me in and there were locks on the windows and stuff. She was on the phone and got off and I said I was here looking for something. We heard a noise and I told her to get down and don't look at it ""pretend you're asleep"". I shut my eyes and she was like 'it's so long' and I realized she had looked and I was like 'damn it!'. It broke in and I ran to my car. Calvin was there now too and he had also looked. I said it looks into your eyes and sees your 'soul' -- knows what you eat and then eats you. I got in this weird buggy car and wound the windows up and rove away. I didn't know where I was though."
"3372"	"(2010-04-12 (19)) It was Easter. Someone came from the future and said we needed to drill into the Earth to stop it from exploding in the future. I think I came from the past to say it was a lie. There were 18 layers of Earth. Ezra and I were tying to explain them to Dad. The guy could be listening to we couldn't tell Dad that he was probably lying. The first few layers were like grass and 'poop'. Further down there were hidden pirate treasure chests. The one before the core was important and had DNA in it. I brought an example to Dad and it had like a stick and a ball where mitosis was happening. It just had two pairs of chromosomes in it. I said 'this is where we came from'. The guy who wanted to drill into the Earth drilled out a worm that grew really big. The worm would actually make the Earth explode and we'd be ok because the future was ""far far away"" -- when he said that, I thought he was going to start singing. Also this thing had happened to bring people back to life. I was at home, which was different, but sometimes it was a shop. It was raining outside. It was starting to flood. I was with Ezra. We were trying to close it up. I think I got hurt. I can't remember properly, but the people who came back to life after this kept any injuries they had, eg if they died with their leg half cut off it stayed like that. Most of the people who had come back didn't seem happy about it. I went to this hotel. I was in a room with some people from Firefly. We all paired up -- Mal went with Inara (and I was annoyed at first because I wanted to go with Mal), Zoe went with someone and then Jayne and I went together. I joked, ""why am I always with Jayne?"". Wash was looking frantically around for someone to pair up with, although he was left with Kaylee. There was also another pair, but I don't know who. We had costumes. Mine was dark blue and looked like the hospital uniform in the Firefly episode, Ariel. Zoe's was brown and looked like a mechanic's outfit. She said she had picked that choice (it was some role playing game?) because she liked the clothes and I said that I did too. Jayne started to ask a question about something then said ""oh no, that's us"". We went to this room, which was a kid's room. Granma had died at some point and had come back to life and was in a nearby room with some kids. We heard her yelling and the kids started crying. I ducked behind something and this woman came in and said that I had to leave. I was annoyed because I wanted to spend time with Jayne. I went back to the room with the costumes, which was another kid's room and took it off and put my clothes back on. As I walked out, I noticed that the hotel lobby was really fancy and gold. I went out to the carpark and to my car and Mom came. Dad and Ezra were already at the car. Mom said she got Easter eggs and I realized I had left mine in the room. I ran back and Mom said there wasn't much time (she had also died). I went back and got them. There was an episode of Fringe and I was with Walter (except, it was the actor). I said ""I almost called you Walter"". There was a photo from a prom and this girl had gone out with Simon (Firefly) and I was sort of jealous until I saw the photo and he had earrings and I thought 'eh, he's not that hot anyway'."
"3373"	"(2010-04-13 (19)) I was with Jayne (Firefly) and others. He would sneak away a lot. This girl went up to the attic and saw him sitting at a table with dolls on the chairs, having a tea party. He saw her and was like 'it's not what it looks like'. There was a wrestling figurines and a video tape? They had one lying down on his back and the other had his hand on the other one's crotch area. I told someone to get Ezra to show him."
"3374"	"(2010-04-13 (19)) I was at university. I had a math test tomorrow and an ANS102 test soon but I didn't know when. I tried to juggle the studying. Then it was the morning and I had to leave in 30 minutes. My hair wasn't straightened so I got Mom to do it and I hadn't written a page of notes for the math test yet."
"3375"	"(2010-04-14 (19)) I woke up in a car. This girl got in the driver's seat (it was a US car) and she had weird eyeliner and she said something and hit me with a gun. Then the car was normal again (ie, not US). I said 'you don't have to keep the gun on me all the time. Even if I had a gun, I wouldn't shoot you'. The car was fancy and we drove out of a carpark. Every now and then there was a burnt out car. She said 'I see why you chose this one'. She mentioned not liking innocent people getting killed. I said once I had been with my Dad and airplanes were lined up and one had left the others (which had actually been one of her people taking control of it) and slid on some oil and crashed into the one next to it, then into a McDonald's and we could hear the screams. I'm not sure where she took me but I ended up with Jayne (Firefly). We had been together before. We were in a building with others; it was like an office shop. I thought I saw a shadow of someone coming and I pushed two people down. We all ran to hide. I ran to a nearby wall, but I couldn't hide behind it, so I went to go behind a better one, but this guy came in. There were others in an aisle and they lined up behind each one and made a noise and laughed, etc. This guy found them and saw my ""golden curls"" and caught me too. I got up and joined them. He took us back where we came from. Then Jack Bauer (24) had been part of our group but had stayed out of all this. He came and shot them all and saved us. Then Jayne and I went into a house and we killed some people and he said to stay prepared and that the 'main' killing part was easier than the part after, because you've already calmed down. He said he liked to able to walk into a room and know where all the exits are. We went into one bathroom and this Asian guy was in the shower and I said 'oh, is that all?' and then heaps of others came out behind him. I went back into the hallway and one ran out. Jayne put his arm around his throat and he fell. He fought the other one. I ended up going in and helping. We then ran out. Outside it looked like home. I saw Mom's car and got in the passenger seat, but Jayne ran past. He then noticed it and got in the drivers seat. Heaps of Asians came out shooting at us and the car. We had trouble starting it. We managed to leave and I saw the Ute out the front and I said 'I don't know why I chose Mom's car; I panicked'. He said it didn't matter. We drove away and stopped at a corner with a Christmas tree. It was actually Easter, but it was called Butterfinger here and there was some tradition. It was outside though and we slept there. At some point, Dad had posted on Ezra's Facebook that his friends had all maintained their weight over the holidays. We went out to lunch and we had chicken, but it was still in the shape of a chicken (not a real one, but it was weird looking). Ezra's job was actually right near something that did math? Something was explained about alcohol and Dad said ""What? Those prices are horrible,""."
"3376"	"(2010-04-14 (19)) I was at school. Calvin was there. Some guys were asking about IT and we said we didn't know anything about it. We had been warned about spam? A movie was being made and was set in ancient times. Samantha and I walked across the oval on the way home. I said I was sick of this place and seeing the same people."
"3377"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) I woke up in the morning and it was really cold and there was supposed to be bad weather today (although, it was only cloudy). Mom was awake and I wasn't sure if I wanted to drive in the weather. Dinner from the night before was beaked beans on toast and I ate some for breakfast."
"3378"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) I was at university. I was in a building that looked like a shop. I had gone there earlier to put three water bottles in a fridge but I couldn't find a place to put them. This girl told me to put them 'behind the shop' and I had to lift something. When I went back, I didn't know which ones were mine. There was something on at 2.30pm the next Wednesday -- something to do with Kiefer Sutherland coming to help you when it's 'hot'. I was thinking that I wanted to go. You had to order tickets. Adam Baldwin was also going to be there and he was interviewing people for plays and he was a playwright. I was also home at one point and I was watching TV with Mom. Supernatural was on, but I only remember seeing Rover and I saw Serenity (as in, the actual ship) and I got excited."
"3379"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) To get my license, I had to do some weird test online. The first question had something about two workers at a cash register and they served some customers. Then I was asked what the name of the one on the right was, but it was hard to read the name tag and I ended up getting it wrong. There was a second picture and question, but I can't read what I've written. It was a joke though for Johnny Knoxville to get money for a party? The guy behind the counter pulled out a gun and he was like 'whoa' and I took his bag and went outside and was messing around with him in a playground area?"
"3380"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) There were two sets of brother and sister. I think their parents were married. One of them was Adam Baldwin (and he looked like he does in Chuck). Then they rebelled against their parents. So the parents called the opposite set of children and came up with a plan. What was supposed to happen was someone would 'kidnap' the kids, but then the mother changed it so the father would be kidnapped too. There was sloppy food to fee them with and some others and I had to shove it in their mouths. The father wouldn't open his mouth. I kept shoving the spoon into his mouth and he eventually opened and chewed and spat it out. Then I was at a house, which I think was home. Mom had called this babysitter lady. We had mattresses on the floor and everyone was sleeping (all the kidnapped people). Rover was on the lounge. I saw the babysitters car pull up and Mom answered the door and said we didn't need her and she asked ""oh, you found the puppies?"" and she said ""yes"". But she came in anyway and had a baby with her. We were trying to get rid of her. I also saw a cop car drive by."
"3381"	"(2010-04-16 (19)) Mom and Darren got the old house. They wanted to pretty it up and then sell it. I was confused because they had rented it. Then they were actually fixing up some random house and we were staying at the old house while they did that. I was annoyed and said I wanted to go home. A friend of Mom's and her daughter (my age and black) were staying there. Gizmo was in my bed. We shared a bunk. I couldn't sleep. I got up and it was early morning. I asked Mom for the keys to the old house and Darren tried giving me coins. The pickup was out the front. Ezra was with me. My 'car' was this cylindrical container thing on like a trolley. I got in and Ezra pushed it. We were then at a shop and this psychic lady kept giving me readings. This girl walked towards me and realized I was at the booth and I went to the floor and said 'I'm bored. I sleep now'. She said she wanted to play Scrabble and I said 'ok, Scrabble, Monopoly...' and then said Monopoly was too long. As I was trying to get back, there was a little cooking place. This girl couldn't touch anything because it was hot and she kept almost falling over. I accidentally turned a tap off while the girl was trying to wash her hands and she got angry. I was playing a Mario game. You could morph and it was different. Luigi snuck up behind Mario and he screamed and ran and said ""Mario!""."
"3382"	"(2010-04-17 (19)) Mom and I went for a drive to see Acquaintance-F-06 and some lady. Mom got me to go by myself. She gave me $400 in $50 notes and I also had a $20 and a $10 for petrol. I went and there were heaps of people. They tried to take my money and said I was weak. This guy was next to this other guy who was smoking. I said ""yeah, but you don't know how far I'd go"". He had a gun. I took the guys smoke and put it into his face. I got my money back and left. They followed me. I got to Mom and we left but we still had to do the deal. We went to an abandoned ice-cream shop? We went to the top floor and there was a little door/window leading out. They came and Mom told them I would do the deal. They came to me and I said I'd still do it. They agreed and we ending up laughing and hanging out."
"3383"	"(2010-04-17 (19)) Ezra got a baby. We went to the shop and left it in the car. We also had a rat which was dark brown/black at the front and 3/4 down its back was a different colour. At the shop, we got some chocolate for Easter. We found baby clothing, but it was at a food shop so there wasn't much. We asked Mom if she checked on the baby. They had Firefly clothes for babies. There was a quest on World of Warcraft in the Noblegarden area. I had to find eggs. There was also a shooting star which I had to find."
"3384"	"(2010-04-18 (19)) I went back in time? Cory Monteith had been in something that had gotten popular, but not at the moment. I was walking down the street and I called out to him and told him about stuff in the future to help him and also to try and get close to him. At some point a group of guys I went to knew about him and they started to fight, so I got out. Other people tried to take Cory. Later, I went to a concert and it was of someone I didn't like. This guy and a kid pushed in front and they didn't have tickets on them. My ticket counted for three people. They were getting in trouble and I said 'hang on' and I called Mom and asked if ""Ezra and Ari bought tickets"" and she said Ezra did and I said it was either Ari or Dad that was going. There was also some Kylie Minogue play there too."
"3385"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was at home which was different. Something was weird and I discovered that someone had broken in. My externals were gone but my computer was still there. I was really upset. I had a new one which I kept on me at all times. An account of mine had been hacked and I told Mom."
"3386"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was watching Chuck. Casey went to a poker game after an argument with Chuck. Chuck came to lend his poker skills, as he was really good and Casey wasn't. Casey was using his eyes to signal to Chuck what to do (pushing up, pulling up etc). Some caught them out and he admitted to it and apologized. He started singing to Chuck by opening his mouth a little and the sound was almost like 'baa!'. Chuck laughed."
"3387"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was watching Glee. Lea Michele said she didn't get along with the guy who would be playing her love interest. I was at home. At the front door, outside, was Seth Rogen but he was sometimes Jorge Garcia and had lost weight. Drew Barrymore was there too and had slept with him before he'd lost weight? Then I was inside with Mom and Ezra. They had vibrators and they had electrons which could disrupt other electron fields. We were hitting them together. Mom was like 'you're wasting good battery' and I said 'who cares, I don't use them' and she said ""I do"" and I was like 'ew' and put it down. She said to me, 'I think you like having more than the back of your head visible'."
"3388"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was half asleep and wanted to have a lucid dream about 'Jayne Cobb [Firefly] '. So I kept thinking about him. But then I just got an image of him and it disappeared. I went inside somewhere and there were fish ponds with dog poo in them and I had to get it out. On Twitter, some girl had been talking to Ron Glass and said ""I'm Inara [Firefly] "". Another girl replied to her saying ""I love Inara!""."
"3389"	"(2010-04-20 (19)) There was an online activity up on the University site. I had to put an 'option' subject but they were all lame. I went to University. I parked in an underground carpark which was creepy and there was an elevator like the elevators in Super Mario. This teacher guy read out the new subjects. The ones on at good times were mostly taken. There used to be a Beatles one. Most of them were physical. Dexter's (Dexter) boss or something was called Principal Banshee (and was the principal from Glee). Dexter was in a carpark and he turned and saw something and screamed like a girl. Debra (Dexter) and someone saw and he pretended he was going crazy. I was thinking that I didn't pick up on the 'banshee' reference before. I went to class and realized that I hadn't re-straightened my hair. Then I had a boyfriend and we had a room there. We were in bed making out, he was on top, and then we had sex. Then I was at Nana's. I was trying to find my way to the carpark. I went around the back and there was a big hole and I felt like I was going to fall. They were putting a deep pond in. Poppa and others were working on it. Nana helped me around. I went around to the front of the house. Fido was there with a big snake. It snipped at us and Nana told it off. There were more snakes and she was trying to get rid of them and I went to go back and Darren and Ezra were there and in the way. Then I was watching Dollhouse, which was different. I remember Boyd. There was a face on a logo with something in the mouth -- ""a bird"" and she had big blue eyes. There was a dead bird which didn't have a disease in its leg, whereas most did. Then I was back at Nana's. I watched Firefly bloopers. Zoe and someone were on a webcam and a 'trial version' came up. Wash was on the other end. The internet was slow where they were supposed to be -- ""frozen in space"". Zoe touched the screen, but she pressed too hard."
"3390"	"(2010-04-22 (19)) I was at the old house. I went out to the lounge room and Ezra was watching Ordinary People although it was made in 1986 and was about the cast of Firefly. Rover was lying on the floor next to the recliner. Adam Baldwin segment in the movie was played by a guy didn't look like him and was a bad actor. I complained about it and Ezra said 'well, I haven't seen the show so it doesn't matter' and I said 'yeah but you're getting a fake story'. From some angles he did look like him and I said ""he looked like Jayne for a sec"". Then I was driving a car and I had a tattoo on my hand. There was a snake cane thing then it was Alan Tudyk's segment."
"3391"	"(2010-04-22 (19)) I got a kitten and Mom spent some time with it. A few days later I called it Vera. I had to catch a train but I kept missing it. There was a weird elevator somewhere. I went to sit down. Adam Baldwin had his legs up on a desk. I sat in front and played the theme song from Firefly. Mom had gotten rid of a pool that he had had and I was amazed about it. I watched a Firefly special feature where Inara and Mal had a fake wedding. Then I was watching Castle and Beckett asked if Castle would give her sperm. Then ages later she cried out ""what you did is rape!"" And she also had had a baby. A DVD cover mentioned Firefly."
"3392"	"(2010-04-23 (19)) I was at the old house. Ezra and I had to share my room and my bed for a while. I had a double bed coming out from the window. Nana also shared it sometimes. His computer was in there too. I complained about it one day. I locked the door and was getting dressed and then he opened the door. I was like ""what are you doing?"" and covered up. There was a joke to do with a boat and The Princess Diaries and it was a quest on RuneScape."
"3393"	"(2010-04-23 (19)) I could take people into my dreams. Mom, Ezra, Darren and I were there. I chose a past dream that had been vivid and long. There was something in the water and I tried to save them and it was slippery because of soap. There were a bunch of Asians at a log and they gave us some to take. We did some other stuff and there was a bit from ""my favourite episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?,"" I got in the car to leave and then said ""I forgot my water bottle and my shoes, can I have the keys?"" Mom was like 'whatever' but wouldn't give me the keys. Eventually she gave them to me. Then I was at home which was a new house. I locked up and left. It was dark. I went to the end of the driveway and people were driving over the sidewalk because the road was busy. Two guys went down to the house and there was a thing outside with money. He tried to take it and was like ""we live here"" and ignored us. One had a baseball bat, so I took it and hit him with it. Ezra got one too and we both kept hitting them, though our swings were slow. We got medals for stuff. We got a bronze (or third place) for 'raping' [as in, beating people up] 10 times; but it was actually getting 'raped' 10 times. I was like 'awww'. Then I was somewhere with Nana and she asked ""How much weight have you gained?"" and I said ""I've lost .7kg"" and she congratulated me."
"3394"	"(2010-04-24 (19)) I was watching Firefly. They were competing against another group for something and Jayne was like ""Yes! Yes!"" And he was a vet and it was actually because he was getting qualified for something. The other team was like 'it's 45 to 44, it's only one point' and they thought that he cheated. Mal was looking on. Then I was with a huge group of people from different movies and shows and we were at prison and we were trying to do something (like break someone out or something). I was in a toilet with Jayne. I opened all the cubicles looking for this bad girl but she wasn't in there. I walked out and then there was a small room just before you got outside. She was in the corner and we fought. There were locks on the door and I tried to lift one up again and unlock it so that Jayne could get through. She set off an alarm and we dealt with her and then I got Jayne out of the toilet. There was a window and all the others that are climbing out the window. I thought everyone was getting away and I looked up and every window had police helicopters near them (there were heaps of people; around 50 odd). Eddie Jemison was there. At some point, Jayne and I were in bed. He kissed me for a long time with is hand under my chin and moving his hand up my leg. Then he turned and said ""goodnight"" and we laughed."
"3395"	"(2010-04-24 (19)) Mom, Ezra, Emery, someone and I were in a car. We parked in front of this building that looked a bit like a sports centre. Mom went to a shop nearby. We were messing around and they accidentally shot a gun and put a hole in this roof bit hanging over the entrance. We went a while away and it ended up catching on fire. I took photos and then we all ran to hide. Ezra and I went together behind this wall near a fence. It was dark. We heard Mom speaking to one of his friends and we ran back to the car. We got in and then this lady ran up and said we couldn't leave and said a guy had died in the fire. One of the friends asked who and she said something like ""Ernest Trumbull"", the guy went quiet and then said ""that's my father"". His name was Ethan, I think. Then it was Dad with us, not Mom. They decided to go into the building and there were no firemen there yet and it was also raining. I went too and Dad said it was dangerous. We went in and couldn't see any fire. Dad and someone went into an elevator, but when I went over to it, it started going down, so I said I'd take the stairs. The floor above was visible and there was no entrance for an elevator. It was like a trick 'house'. There were two sets of stairs outside. Also, some time before, I found a notebook of mine half burnt and I realized it was because I was going to die. Anyway, this guy who was a friend of the family was nearby and I think he had tried to rape me once? We went up the stairs and this guy at the far end went into another room which was dark. He saw me and aimed a gun at me and I threw stuff at him. His assistant came and looked like Jason Flemyng. He shot at me and I threw stuff at him and then dropped down, out of the window. But then he pulled me up and threw the gun away and kissed me. I had also found a pocket knife thing and I swung the blade out and stabbed him with it. Then I was with Dad and I had killed the guy, though Dad said no-one was there. Then later, I had gotten some footage of ghosts and stuff. A forum said ""Evan Peters and I had an affair. I miss you man"" -- he had been one of the people there. Then it was like 2 years later. I was a guy and was trying to tell people about the events. A car drove past and stopped. Ari (Entourage) got out and said he had been trying to find us for a while."
"3396"	"(2010-04-25 (19)) I went to university and was going to a different tutorial today. It was 9.22 and it started at 9.30. I found a parking spot and went in. I didn't know where the class was, so I picked one. It was night. The teacher lady gave me my assignment back and I got 19/45, although sometimes it said 49/90. Alejandro was sitting in front of me and he saw me, but didn't say anything. Then Mom, Rover and I were at a shop, I think. Some paint fell and made a mess. I tried to clean it up. Pink paint came out, but blue didn't. Then I was in a car with Ezra and some guy. We turned around and I said this reminds me ""gay cowboys eating pudding"". I explained that down this road was a cabin in snow where Dad and James Marsden used to hang out and supposedly they had secretly been together. We went there and there coins scattered everywhere. I took some. I asked Ezra if he knew if they had had sex and he said that he didn't think so, because they weren't gay now. I said that Brokeback Mountain was about love, not gayness. Then it was a movie. Some guy came along and pretended he was in real estate, but was actually scamming people. There was an Asian couple and the girl wanted to see the products and then her ex was there and it was a scam too."
"3397"	"(2010-04-26 (19)) Mom and Darren were in the lounge room watching a weird movie. I asked what it was and they said it was Love Story. I said ""oh yeah, I was going to watch it this month and watched Barry Lyndon instead"". Ryan O'Neal looked different. I watched a bit and it looked interesting so I decided to watch it. A voice sounded familiar (with an Irish accent) and it was Nathan Fillion. I was like 'He's so young!'. It was set in like, the stone ages? Then I was there and there was a guy with a puma. We jumped into this house and it came in. It attacked me and we got it out. It hurt its paw and it was bleeding. I cried and then the dude and I tried to fix it. At the end of the movie, the girl he loved got offered a job far away and took it. They said goodbye. Ezra had to walk 4 hours to somewhere. He wanted to go to the shop later."
"3398"	"(2010-04-26 (19)) I got my own house which was small, but had a big yard -- it was just a big square area fenced in. There wasn't much grass, but lots of dark sand. We went to this shop with traffic lights. You had to get one item at a time, so I went through and people were moving so slowly and I rang a guy to complain and got a pack of something. I went home and went back later and it was heaps faster. Mom came over and she was like 'the yard would be good for Rover'. Ezra drove a tractor thing. The sand was poison and I wasn't able to get rid of it."
"3399"	"(2010-04-27 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I went for a drive at night. As we were coming back, there was stuff on the road which looked like huge balls of ice. I said ""that can't be hail!"". We were near home and there was a carpark with not that much ice there. Home was fine. Then there was more. I had university and had to leave soon. Mom and Ezra were at a tax place and I said ""Ok, I'm leaving now"". I got into my car and locked the door. This guy was hanging around the passenger door and he had red eyes. I tapped on the window to scare him and he made a Murloc sound. I reversed out too fast and accidentally hit a car as I drove out. I stopped as this woman, who I think was Spanish, got out and yelled at me. I was like ""I didn't do it on purpose!"". Then the guy jumped on her and started eating her and I realized he was a zombie and I got back in my car and drove off. There were more around. I was with a girl at one point and she was talking and I saw a red dot appear in one of her eyes (which were brown). I said 'you're turning' and she was like 'ok' and I stabbed her in the head. Then I killed someone in this big empty room which had windows all around it. Jacob (Lost) was not happy and I could hear him speaking, but I couldn't see him. I had a pair of scissors and was holding the pointy bit towards myself, and I turned it around. Jacob kept bringing the guy back to life. He kept calling Jacob 'Mark Pellegrino'. Jacob appeared and his face was close to mine and I thought 'actually, he's kind of hot'. When I sliced the guy's neck, he 'evaporated'. Then I was with some people at a shop. Adam Baldwin was there. We were staying there. We had this wood pole like a broom which we used to kill the zombies. I also had a toothpick. There was a walkway thing with layers which we used to catch zombies (there were two near there). I was at the top and there were fish ponds and stuff where we stayed. I heard a door open and a bell noise. It was just people, but they attracted the zombies. They also had a thing to test for zombies and we asked for some. We had a scientist with us who had done some type of physics. I was looking for a weapon and couldn't find anything. I said to Adam ""I like 'em sharp and pointy"". I found a rotting wood handle, but it was useless. The zombies came and three women with leather jackets and machine guns. We waited until they were close enough and got one each. My weapon didn't go all the way through, and Adam finished her off and we took the guns. I asked ""Anyone know how to use these?"" and someone said ""No, we'll just work it out"". All these people drove out and I said 'we need a car'. Also, there was a photo of Zachary Levi when he was young and he looked weird."
"3400"	"(2010-04-29 (19)) Ezra and I were at an arena. There was a sports announcer guy. It was a movie though? The visiting team looked like they were going to win and I had bet $80 on the home team and I said to Ezra ""I know home's going to win, the movie has to have a happy ending"". The announcer ended up dying before finding out and everyone called it a tragedy. I was sick somewhere. Mom picked me up. I kind of didn't want to leave. She got me and said ""I know you're not pretending"". There was also a TV show and Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin and Alan Tudyk, who I referred to as just Alan."
"3401"	"(2010-04-29 (19)) Ezra wanted to buy tickets for something. He thought it was a movie, but he got them for a reenactment. I agreed to go and got tickets. I thought it was going to use real actors. There was a huge queue but we had like the 9th and 10th tickets to we got in first. It was a small room. There was bedroom stuff to the side and a big TV which was going to play the original movie. I said to Ezra 'I can't be bothered, I'm leaving. See ya!' and ran out, yelling ""Ma!"" and told her to wait. It was night and we walked back to the car. I said ""I can't believe I bought a ticket. I wasted $10"". We got to the car and started to drive off. We saw a girl only wearing a tight black vest with her boobs showing a little. It was gross. Life is a Highway came on the radio. I complained saying that I'd rather be [somewhere I can't read] than see this movie. A girl in the queue nearby said ""I don't want to listen to this bullshit"". I wondered if she meant me or the music."
"3402"	"(2010-04-30 (19)) I was at Dad's, which was different. I was going to watch Firefly or something. Then I was at home, which was also different, with Ezra. The X-Files was on TV. Adam Baldwin was in it, though he was young and it was only season 2. I think he was a bad guy. There was also something about Beckman (Chuck) and a crazy dog."
"3403"	"(2010-04-30 (19)) Ezra and someone who I think was Madelyn, were doing a cooking job. Mom took them there and I made sure they got in. They said they finished at 8.30-9.30. I left. There were no cars. I had some 'fake' lights and I was walking along the road and they weren't very bright. A car came up behind me, but got on the other side of the road instead. Another guy did it too, but then it was Madelyn and she said they both left early because of ""one with ADH and one with TDD"" which were illnesses with different reactions to the sun. I called Mom and said we were just past ""Brookland, the school"". She thought I meant somewhere else but finally understood. Then I was hiding out in a building with Adam Baldwin and others. I wandered outside and a guy was like ""I'm on fire!"" and someone tried to help and I pulled them back. There were flames behind him, like a mob. He was then ok and ran. Then he stopped and went back. I ran out to get this guy and a flame had followed him. I hid behind a tree and it killed him. Then it showed from the flames point of view and it could sense body heat and it started coming after me and then saw 'Jayne Cobb, cunning' and it went after him instead. Eventually it went away. We also tried to escape from a building and we had to break down doors. This guy was hiding somewhere and we risked it and went in, but he came at me and we attacked him. There was a photo of Adam Baldwin when he was young and it said ""Chariate Chassiel"" and he had some instrument. He was holding this square thing and had a ring on his middle finger. I asked him who the hell Chassiel was. There was a picture of a girl and she was 'Senator' (she was a celebrity now). I turned the photo around and Dad was there. I said, about the picture of Adam Baldwin, ""I'd rather see him peeing in a bowl, naked"". There was a fat naked guy and a young toddler. Adam said ""that's my father, Moby Dick""."
"3404"	"(2010-04-30 (19)) I was on a mountain. The sea was below. I went down a bit to look for rocks as there were some grey rocks which had something useful in them, which was why we were there. They were loose and I couldn't get back up. Someone grabbed my hand and helped me up. Adam Baldwin was also down there with me (he was new) and I grabbed his hand and pulled him up, which was easy because he helped too. Someone said ""shark"" and I looked at the sea, but saw nothing. But they meant dragon and we got rid of it. There was a little 'cave' which two purple dragons. I had to get their attention and put a blanket over this fire and I had to do this for ""77 minutes""."
"3405"	"(2010-05-01 (19)) I was driving and I went to Morley shops. I parked in the underground carpark and went to a computer room. There was a computer free next to Eugene. He was playing Warcraft. I tried to load up World of Warcraft, but after 15 minutes it still hadn't loaded. I went to leave. I couldn't remember how to get back to the carpark. There was a mini emergency room. A guy was then with me and we were trying to find this other carpark."
"3406"	"(2010-05-01 (19)) I upset the Visitors (V) somehow. For a 'fair' fight, we were each allowed a number of people to send underwater and they had to kill as many others as they could in 10 seconds. They had 130 and we had 110. Anna (V) was like 'It starts now'. I quickly went under. There was random stuff in the water too, like tuna tins and stuff. We paired up and I had just got a new fish and I fed it. I hit 'Iron Man' and I said ""I didn't mean to kill Iron Man!"". Mario and Luigi were down there too."
"3407"	"(2010-05-01 (19)) I was at Midvale shops. A big pet shop had opened up where the bakery is (it went out to where the bottle shop is). It hadn't opened yet. There were lots of shelves and exhibit things with some puppies in them. There was a lady there and I was going to ask about a job but then she was talking to a group of kids saying that once a week, she got kids in to feed and care for the animals. She also did this weird thing where she would dance at the front of the store and kids had to march stuff up to her. It was really lame. I started to walk home, but then I was walking down a path next to a forest (but it was up higher, so I couldn't see it). I heard people talking and there was a guy with a little machine. Little bits of rock came up in the air. I screamed and covered myself. Then I kept going. There was a big obstacle area. There was door which had barbs all over it and I climbed around it and beat some guards up. Then a guy was with me, helping. He said ""They reckon $40 a week for this?"" -- it had continued on from the last dream and they had kept some V's for studying. We broke into the place they were keeping them. We let them out and there were some we knew. There was a small box with a metal thing in it, which was a 'brain' of this girl we were friends with. I got upset when I saw it. There was a copy of her outside, but without her memory, or something was wrong with her, so we couldn't put her brain back. One of the people we let out was a black guy, who was human, and thought the V's were good guys."
"3408"	"(2010-05-02 (19)) Ezra was watching TV. They were doing weird match ups. The match-up at the moment was The Doors and The Strawbs and Part of the Union was playing. They also did The Beatles and The Smiths. There was an interview with the cast of Arrested Development. Will Arnett had a whistle (the chipped tooth had happened in real life)."
"3409"	"(2010-05-03 (19)) I was undercover. I was a cop, and I was pretending to be an undercover prostitute to try and get a job with some bad guys. One of them was actually good and he was Tobias (Arrested Development). I told him to act like he thought I was a cop. Then I was in a hotel room and I was sharing with a girl. She put on some nail polish and I said it was gross. It was a dark, but bright, pink. I was telling her about my job as a prostitute. Then it showed the bad guys talking and Tobias was telling them I was a cop. They discovered I was a prostitute and they offered me a job in their operation. Then I was watching Arrested Development and Lindsay looked like she was covering up because she was naked but Tobias had called for help because they were both naked. She moved and covered herself on the floor? She said ""one fell"" and Tobias said ""I told you to tell me if I fell"". Her boob was hanging out and was blurred. I walked to a big building which was huge and empty and like a school gym. People were there and we were told to gather. As I was walking in, someone said ""Did anyone have sex with Duran Duran before they split up?"". We all sat down and there was a video of all of us saying funny quotes. A girl was in a toilet and her friend said 'We're going to be late and Chris Potter is cute' and she was shocked at this? Some guys, one of them was Samm Levine, went into a toilet. There were some chemicals -- some worm things? They were on me and made me itch, so I was flicking them off and it was annoying. My quote clip was from outtakes of Castle. Kate was at a pub or something with a black woman. She said her line muddled and Kate teased like ""Who I be phone?"" and laughed, no-one in the room made a sound. I was thinking that I didn't even say that often. There was a new movie and it started with this teenage guy in a car. It was wet and the car was covered in bits of ear and blood. The guy had blood on him too. He woke up and was trying to remember what happened. There was a flashback -- it was 'underwater' and this girl asked ""what's your name"", and I said ""Izzy"". She said ""there's a shark to your 'shaft'"". We turned and I swam and the shark ate her and kept going. Then there were octopuses that had been after him. They were saying that because of the flashbacks, it was more likely to believe the situation because we knew he had survived."
"3410"	"(2010-05-03 (19)) I was at a house. I had to get to a little octopus to inject it to stop it transforming. I got it outside and hid it behind a mattress. I got someone to get someone to help. They came back with a needle and I injected it. Then the octopus was a girl and she started having a fit and was turning into something dangerous, so Ezra and I ran inside and locked ourselves in a bedroom. I saw a cat under the door. It left, then Ezra called it back. I was annoyed at him for doing this, but it left again. The girl cried that the cat jumped off the fence and said it was ok explaining that cats had 'help'; she demonstrated on hands and knees saying it was like that, but on a pillow and she was ok. Later we had dinner and everyone had a good sized meal, but mine had a few thin slices of carrot and yellowish meat. The lady said it was ""grilled banana"" and I said 'what the hell, I'm not eating this'. I said ""I'll go myself"", then went for a drive with Mom and Ezra. She was driving fast and there was a bend around a cliff without a rail. Then it was a race. I can't read much of this, but at the end we were on a mountain and had to go through these rings? Ezra got no armour? People were staring at a church thing. Willem Defoe was a lawyer and some girl liked him."
"3411"	"(2010-05-04 (19)) I was at a place at university. I was doing math work, but for a part of it you had to smoke marijuana stuff. It was actually incenses burning in the middle of this round table thing and you had to inhale the smoke. We talked about random stuff and dreams. I typed 'hot guys' in somewhere but I accidentally hit all the wrong keys, so it was all the letters next to them, except it started with 'O'. Someone was possessed? Someone said to me 'I know you want kids' and I replied 'No I don't'. There was some movie where Jim Carrey was in this girl's head."
"3412"	"(2010-05-04 (19)) I was watching something. Will Arnett and Adam Sandler were in it. Will put a banana and other stuff on his windscreen so Adam did it back and they laughed. There was a joke about him and someone in a coffee shop. Taub (House) was there and asked ""you have a coffee shop in Portugal?"". I was in a queue at 'school' to get tickets to this prom thing. Calvin was in front of me and I had promised to tell him who I liked and I said ""It's Eugene!"" and he was like 'oh my god!'. Eugene was further along in the line. There was a video of funny stuff. There was this thing, where we had spent ages putting soap all over a windscreen. Soap sprayed from the roof. Then water came and rinsed it off. I was thinking 'Now Mom will have to straighten my hair again. Sucks to be her'. Before that they had been saying certain people liked each other. They said this girl called Natalie wanted to kiss Dmitri, who was in front of Calvin in the line. He ducked behind the guy in front of him. Someone asked if he was 'not having any trouble in that department' and the guy in front said he liked some girl who [something I didn't catch] and went to Westland University, and it turned out to be me. They had said it insultingly and I gave him a 2 finger salute to his back. Eugene told his friends who he liked and I think it was me. I went in to the shop finally and got some pyjamas etc. I said ""I might not be allowed in because I'm wearing shorts"". Ramona was there and she put this Hawaiian costume on. I got a big Hawaiian shirt that went past my shorts. Then I was in a room and I saw some people on a computer taking photos off it and I grabbed the USB and thought to come back later. There was a line to get school work/marks. People all came out crying. I went in and Elijah and someone were all crying and told me why, but I can't read what I wrote. I hurt my nose and it made me cry too. The average mark was 88% for this year. I went to find a room. There was one computer. Outside there were lots of buildings. I went into a few but they had nothing. One small one had this gruff dude and a dog and it was a car servicing place. He shooed me away. I ran off and changed the setting and everything was underwater."
"3413"	"(2010-05-04 (19)) Some guy threatened to steal some lady's baby. They got the police over to the house and Zoe (Firefly) came for support. Her bedroom was dark and had a taser in the shape of a bottle which they used for light. Zoe came in and started to kiss her and they went onto the bed and rubbed against each other -- it was a distraction because the guy was under the bed."
"3414"	"(2010-05-05 (19)) Ezra and I were going to watch a movie on Foxtel. Michael Emerson was tied up in chains and Terry O'Quinn was standing behind him. Something was possessing them. I found it amusing that Ben and Locke from Lost were both in it. The picture was going weird because the cord was falling out. Then I, except I was now Dana Walsh (24) and it was from my past, was on a computer. I was inside it first and Cole (24) came and he needed some pictures. I had stuff that would give away the fact I was a bad guy, but I had to transfer them. I blew into the machine to clean it. There were a bunch of short films. One was about a plant guy. They said I had to describe it without using certain parts of him, basically all of him. I showed it to Mom and she didn't know how to do it either. A while later someone said 'maze' and I realized it was a maze."
"3415"	"(2010-05-05 (19)) I went to Ikea by myself. It closed at 5pm and I had left at around 4pm or sometime after. It took me ages to find parking, and I was looking over the bays and I didn't like them? It was 4.54pm and I ran to get there but the lady said it was closed. I was like 'damn it' and I text Mom saying 'closed damn it'. I got back to my car. The people parked next to me were close and I had to squeeze in. They came too. I reversed and they reversed too and I had to stop. Then no-one did anything and so I just went. A car was coming and I managed to get out of the way. Then Nana was walking with me to show me how to get out. Then I was at the other side of the carpark. I was talking with Mom too and it was night. There was a concrete block on the road and there was a bit to walk through. There were a bunch of cars and one backed up and faced towards us. I moved behind Mom and he drove past. She yelled at me for not going behind the concrete and I yelled at her and slapped her hand on the back. I walked through the back way and it was covered in hard 'wire'. Mom said someone was Jewish and I said ""is that a dance move?"". I was then back in the car and the police were next to my window. Mom drove out. I had two trays to drop off."
"3416"	"(2010-05-06 (19)) I went to the cinema to see Iron Man 2, but I didn't go. I was in some army training thing. A guy was out of breath and this guy came up to him and said that his brother did and he pushed himself too hard and he wasn't going to. The guy was a former boxer. He took him through the place, explaining all the obstacles (it was like a huge indoor obstacle course thing). For one of them, you climbed down a ladder and attack the enemy. He failed the first time, tried again later and failed again, but was finally able to do it. A few other people passed through and were put into the same group. The guy overseeing it was the principal guy from The Inbetweeners. Some guy and I got into a fight with someone. Another One Bites the Dust was playing over the loudspeakers. Then I left and Mom and Ezra were in the car. I said I didn't see the movie because I'd already seen it and I didn't want to waste time rewatching movies. I said I had a fight influenced by a song called Iron Man 2. There was a scene where Tony Stark was in a boxing ring with someone and stabbed them and yelled about his father. He also said ""it's me"" (admitting he was Iron Man). People complained about it and said it was Justin Theroux's fault. Then I had a lecture and it was as Youtube video about a principal guy and a leprechaun but it didn't work. He was well-known and he had been found out to have down leprechaun porn."
"3417"	"(2010-05-06 (19)) I was staying at a friend's house with some others (all guys). We went to this place where waterslides were being built; which were a long way down. The slide was in the middle of lots of water. We were dared to go on. The water was green and this guy got in the water. Then we all ended up in the water. We got out and walked back. I ran, being careful not to slip. Went to a toilet which was small and dried myself and went out. They were getting told off and his mother was cooking stirfry. I joked she was out of something and the broccoli was still frozen. She said I had to have a ham, cheese and tomato toasted sandwich."
"3418"	"(2010-05-07 (19)) I was working at this place and Ben (I'm Alan Partridge) was there. We were using a notebook to write down all the people that were here using the Dream Research coding. He put me down as 'e-' and the - meant he didn't like me. Someone also mentioned Darth Vader so we put him down. I asked if I could click through and he reluctantly gave it to me so I said I wanted to break it and said ""oops"" although I was joking. It started off neat and then got messy. I was at a desk with him helping. I went to the toilet but there was only one toilet. I went back and Ben and I were talking and laughing. There was a tutorial and the tutor was Alan Partridge (I'm Alan Partridge). He didn't finish all the questions. I was playing Hotel City on Facebook and all the photos were blurred. I had Jewel Staite on there, but her name was Jasmine, and I also had Morena Baccarin. There was a really small photo of me as a kid and I showed Ezra. There was another photo where one person wasn't looking at the camera, another person chucking a sad, then another person looking away etc. Then I had a house. Out the back a bit, there was another house. It was windy and it started snowing and raining. Ezra lived there too. Mom was over. I went to close the windows in Ezra's room. I went into another room and Michael Cera was sitting on the floor reading and I screamed in shock. Mom said 'that was weird'. I said ""what are you doing here?"" and he said ""what are you doing here?"" and I said ""I live here"" and started cracking a smile. I asked why he wasn't at school etc and he said that he hated it. He was then 18 and actually my son, or adopted or something. I said ""You're 18, if you don't like it-,"" and he said that they (job people) don't really like those wanting to act. I said that 'all you have to do is say you were in Arrested Development'. Someone else was there. He joked around for a bit and was wrestling on the bed, someone said ""and not stroking my back"". Then, Eugene was coming over to join us at this other house (a house better suited for the weather). Michael Cera said that I had a ""highschool crush on Eugene"" to Mom. Then Eugene arrived. He got out of car and I tried to avoid him. He was speaking to some weird people. Tobias (Arrested Development) was out the front too. Also, the character of George-Michael in Arrested Development was also in another show, in a similar role and was also called Michael. Then it was a movie and an old lady was like ""he insisted that we sleep in separate beds""."
"3419"	"(2010-05-07 (19)) I got two packages in the mail. One was a Brownshirt shirt except it had a picture on the front of some character in cartoon form. It said XL, but had 4XL underneath. It fit like an XL though. There was a tiny Jayne (Firefly) face in the background, and Mal was at the front. Was going to complain about it and show it to Mom."
"3420"	"(2010-05-08 (19)) There were some lost kittens. One came back, but people were trashing the owner's house looking for something. I was a spy, but in a similar position to Chuck (Chuck). I was with Chuck, Sarah and Casey in a shop. There were milk bottles in the freezer. They were all 5-6 years old. There were also water bottles. We load them onto this 'plate' on wheels, which was slow. This foreign guy who worked there yelled at us. I went to push the thing to the back of the store and I passed an aisle where the bad guy was. I went back and told Sarah. The bad guy came and they fought, but then they realized he was actually 'good' and the milk cartons had people in them? We all climbed up into the aircon vents. Sarah was like 'I didn't know they were still here'. The next season of Chuck was going to have him based at one place in another country. Then Casey and I were in a room (still at the shop) and we'd been attacked by the bad guys. I saw that Sarah was there too and we were all lying on the floor. I had been drugged and could barely move. My head was under a table, squished against the floor, but then I could move and was just faking. Casey was going along with them. Then he pushed a piece of paper towards my mouth. I slowly reached for it. Then he secretly handed me another one saying 'I'd like to help'. I gave him a thumbs up and he handed me another. The last one had detailed instructions. It said that when he came over again, run out and go to 'Stage 2'. Then when he arrived there, go to Stage 3, etc. He got some of the other people to leave and came over and I mouthed 'now?' and he motioned for me to go and I ran. He told the others to not worry about me. I snuck around the shop and couldn't find stairs, so I went through a door. It led to the toilets and there was an emergency window up high. I went out and ran past the room I was just in. Casey was still in there and saw me through the window. He mouthed 'what?' and looked sort of angry. I asked where stage 2 was and he pointed to a building outside. I went through the door behind me and ran over. The inside was like a cinema, with seats and rows of people. A lady was checking IDs which were actually some thing from fish and chip shops with red lights. One was on the floor, so I took it. Someone saw me though and mentioned it to the lady, so I quickly walked out instead of going upstairs and waiting. She followed, so I ran out to the bushes far away and they were purple. She went back in and I ran back, but into the third building. The lady saw me and yelled out to me. I ran down. She accused me of lying and I asked her what her brother did -- assuming he did something that made her choose this line of work. She scanned the ID thing and it went red, meaning rejection. I did it again and it was positive. She didn't know what to do. Casey came and he had a thick silver metal ring on the middle finger of his left hand and one on the ring finger of his right hand. He came over and we walked out. There was a busy road nearby which had three lanes going each way and a roundabout. A bunch of young kids (around 12 years old) were there. One was running across the road. The cars almost crashed and one almost came straight at me. I flinched, but it stopped in time. We tried to cross again and walked to a car. I saw Eugene's car and Eugene's father Abraham was in it and was driving over to the other side. I was thinking it was weird that he was there. I got into our car and got ready to drive off with Casey. An ostrich with 4 legs right at the back of it and it was on wheels and could bend weirdly."
"3421"	"(2010-05-09 (19)) I playfully kicked Dad in the butt and he said ow and grabbed it. Then he said that he thought something went up there and I was like 'what the hell could've gone up there?'. He put his hands down his pants to check and it had been his balls. There was a female doctor and she said that a hair straightener nearby was for ""bum hairs"". There was a girl with a boyfriend called Chris but he liked the doctor. The boyfriend was lying on a lounge and she laid on top of him and said ""I love you"" and the doctor was in the room too and said ""Who? Oh, you're talking to your boyfriend"". Later, Seamus posted some fail pic on Facebook and someone said ""dat comment""."
"3422"	"(2010-05-09 (19)) I was at home on my computer. I was trying to access results of some test. I couldn't remember the password. Calvin came over. I was in the dining room and I saw him go into my room with some other guy. I went down there and my desk was a mess. He was sitting on my bed and the other guy was standing next to my bedside table. My desktop was different -- all new icons and the resolution was like 640x480. I went to change it, but the guy started opening my drawer and I quickly slammed it shut and said it was my underwear drawer, but I had a bright pink vibrator on top of my undies. He didn't say anything but was hinting at it. He said ""take a picture of my bum"" and I said ""take a picture of your... balls"" [in a 'yo mama' type of way] . I was thinking that I needed to stop saying balls so often. I finally got to the results and I had gotten 5.5/10. I was confused and disappointed about it. Some stupid girl had gotten a higher result. I was watching an Arrested Development video, but I only remember seeing Buster."
"3423"	"(2010-05-10 (19)) I was in the army? We were at a shop. We all had to hand in DNA samples because they were going to randomize it and make babies. One person was black and another was Michael C. Hall. I was watching some show with Morena Baccarin. In season one, she had dark, golden skin and had a baby at the end. The baby was like 8 years old in season 2."
"3424"	"(2010-05-10 (19)) I downloaded some program for university which could download information into your brain. I picked something for ANS about geese and Afrikaans -- I saw images and subtitles. Mom didn't believe me when I told her about it. Then I was at university, which was different. I went to the toilet and passed Samantha on the way. There were two open cubicles. I went into one of them and it said you could only be in there for a maximum of 2 minutes. There was a girl in another one. I finished before her and then she came out and asked if there was anyone outside. She said her mother or grandma had died and everyone was bothering her about it. There was a big TV somewhere and people were playing a game. There was a computer room nearby which had a TV for people to play Guitar Hero."
"3425"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) I time travelled or something (it involved alternate realities and stuff). Ted Bundy was famous in a good way, although he had still killed. I was watching an interview with Will Arnett -- who was sometimes someone else -- and he had a young girlfriend once and there was a quote ""I want to fuck her so bad"". There was another video and Amy Poehler showed up at some event of his and he joked ""not you"". She was wearing a ballerina/fairy outfit with wings and had a wand (it was a reference to something). She went out in front of an audience and danced. Ted Bundy also had a girlfriend that he was going to marry. They were walking back to their house and something weird was happening. She ran into the house and he ran in after her. Then there was a gun shot and Jack (Lost) and I ran in. She got shot and Jack was angry and cried at Ted, ""You did this!"" and Ted was upset and said ""No, I didn't. I love her,"" etc. I believed him. I think she died and they argued and then Jack and Ted left. I sat with her and it was pitch black. Then I heard someone move and say ""don't look"". I shut my eyes and I saw shadows as they left. I was really scared. I was trying to explain to people later that it wasn't Ted and that I'd seen the guy who'd done it but they wouldn't listen. Then I woke up [within the dream] and I was still scared and my heart was beating fast. I went out and Mom was on her computer and Darren was at the TV. I went to Mom and said I'd had a nightmare. Then Darren said he'd gone on my computer to print something out and that he'd found interesting dreams on there and had printed out copies. Ezra came out and they teased me about some dream, but I didn't know what dream it was. I went back to my room and I heard Ezra reading it out -- it mentioned Locke (Lost). I didn't recognize the dream. Cuddles was rolling around."
"3426"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) I was watching Castle. Castle and Beckett were in a sports car. Beckett was like ""nice brand"" (?) and Castle asked ""what?"" and she said ""this"" and started the car (it was a US car and she was in the passenger seat). He smiled and then she drove off and he was standing outside."
"3427"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) There was an alien girl, possibly two. One was in a lesbian relationship with a human and she took her back to her planet. I was annoyed they never took me."
"3428"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) I was at Mom's, which was different and further away. Dad picked me and Ezra up to go back to his place. He still lived at the old house. Ezra and I ended up walking down Princess Road at night. There were some people far behind us and we started running/walking fast. Then Roland was with us too. We stopped at Midvale shops and there were two new stores. One had huge muffins and pies. We were then with Dad again and he had bought scratchies and a small amount of food. We were walking down the road and the people came up behind us. A girl stepped out and we stopped. It was Tonya. She was really skimpy looking and started talking about some sex site and then said 'thank you' and walked around to another street. I said I used to be friends with her. We caught up to her and Dad gave her something he'd gotten at the shop. She thanked him and kissed him. We continued walking and accidentally walked through the gates to some fancy estate. We decided to walk through. A lady asked us what our names were. Dad said ""er.. Conell,"" and she said ""Oh, can you go over there?"" We went over, but it was creepy and they started singing, so we left with keys. There was a steep hill and we had to pull ourselves up. I took my phone out to take a photo. There was a campfire with a wolf. Roland, Ezra and some kid were screaming and had a fight with sticks. I picked up a stick to use as a walking stick and the kid said 'no, that's mine', so I picked up another one and he claimed that one too. He suggested I take this huge one with branches and I asked how I was supposed to walk with that. He started arguing, so I hit him with my stick. I grabbed him and pushed him to the ground. I had this star-shaped cutting thing and I cut the log and tried to get him. I got up and said that I was going and that ""You can't claim the environment, so gtfo!"" I kept walking and looked back and he said ""her butt's so fat, I can still see it"" and I yelled back ""your face is so ugly, I'm still bleeding"". He didn't hear. There was a lake and I had to jump over. There was a 'fat' kid nearby. He said something and I joked back. He was saying that Silas was what girl's wanted and I said no. He said he was a bad jumper and I said that I was too. Somehow I made it over, but he landed in the water and said he was scared of the ducks. I said I was going to go watch movies and he asked to come too and I said no."
"3429"	"(2010-05-12 (19)) I was well-known? I wrote on some forum saying ""Jeffrey Dean Morgan is hot"". Some replied, agreeing. I had an assignment due for university. Buster (Arrested Development) was in a van. At the back of the van, something said ""if you take me to prom, I'll marry you"" and it was from 1991. He had this frog with him and he had made him twitchy, so he was always flapping his arms around and stuff. Someone said that George (Arrested Development) was ""probably your father"" and I thought it was weird because he used to be Jeffrey Dean Morgan (not really sure what this meant). I convinced Buster that a visit to the top of this mountain could help the frog. I also had to go there for some project I was doing with Elijah, as well as some Korean restaurant. Dad was coming too and he was driving on his own, and I was driving myself, but I ended up in front of him and I didn't know the way there. I found it and had to stop at the red light, but I couldn't stop in time and gently touched the 4WD in front of me. I parked and was trying to remember the way to get there. I was then with Mom, Gizmo, Cuddles and Amelia. Amelia smiled at me and I felt like threatening it or throwing it over the edge. It was now night. I put Cuddles and Gizmo in a bag and they went to sleep. I told Mom to look after them. Dad text about the mountain saying ""Elijah is pulling $40,""."
"3430"	"(2010-05-12 (19)) Mom and I were walking outside. I had a lot of money in my pocket as well as my debit card. There was a group of guys and they stopped us and told us to give them our money. I jumped over a wall and ran. There was a big building, like an empty shed that looked like a classroom inside. I had a fake subscription. I turned into a bird and I had to touch the tip of my tongue to my top lip to help keep the transformation. I thought it was similar to trying to get lucid."
"3431"	"(2010-05-12 (19)) I was in France or something. Some people I knew were staying at a place across the street from some hotel where Hugh Laurie lived. There were flashes (?) they didn't like and I went over to tell him. I knocked on the door and explained the issue and he said he'd fix it. Sometime later, I went back and his door was unlocked. I went in. The kitchen was at the far end and the TV was next to the door. He had two video players and one DVD player. There were lots of movies, mostly on VHS, and quite a bit of 80s/90s horror. I remember seeing Children of the Corn and Basketcase. I looked at his CDs too. He had two doors to his bedroom and the blankets on his bed were messy. I quickly went back to the front door to leave. He came in from the hall and I said I had just come over to remind you and he said he hadn't forgotten. There were lots of other celebrities in there too. Something happened and caused them all to cheat. He called me there and I went up and when I got into the room, he pressed me up against the door, locked it, and kissed me. Then it showed others bringing people in. Then I was in bed alone and I took a photo of the room and then left. There were tables outside and we all sat around. There was a video that looked real of me on this buggy thing. Jared Padalecki was on the seat behind me and Jensen Ackles was next to me. I was filming and joking around. Mom said Ezra wanted to move out. Dad was collecting something about people for something (pictures maybe, I can't remember). He had Wash (Firefly) and he said ""I liked Firefly and Serenity"". He also had Dominic Monaghan (although Dominic was spelt differently) and he said ""I like Lost and Lost"" and there were others. I laughed and only one had the actual name of the actor spelt correctly."
"3432"	"(2010-05-13 (19)) There was a new called Serenity (spin-off/sequel to Firefly). I downloaded the pilot and only Mal, Zoe and Kaylee were in it. There was a computer person called 'Woman'. It started off with them in a prison (or something) which they had bought. They were standing under it and it ended up collapsing. I was then there too. There was some animal chasing me. I jumped over a fence and it ran around it. Someone yelled at me to give it the fence. I did, but it tried to bite me still. I wondered what was going to happen to Castle since Nathan Fillion was in this new show and I hoped that Adam Baldwin would make an appearance. It was written and created by someone called Jelly Bean. I said aloud ""the guy who does Dexter... oh, girl."""
"3433"	"(2010-05-13 (19)) I was at a party. Inside there was a big section of water and a few square blocks floating around to rest on. There were fish in the water. I accidentally went underwater and saw what looked like a hammerhead shark and I told some people near me about it and we moved to the edge. A crocodile ate someone. Everyone started rushing to get out. There were no doors. Supposedly there was a portal thing -- a guy ate someone's head to open it, but nothing happened. The crocodile came and got him. I tried smashing a window but it didn't break. We managed to open it and then I ripped off the hinges and the flywire and we crawled out. There were cars in the driveway (and the house looked really old). There were two motorbikes and a fancy black car. Jewel Staite was then with me and she grabbed some keys from inside and gave me the one for the car. The crocodile poked its head out the door. I remembered that my phone and keys were inside and wanted to get them. It started coming toward me and the passenger door wasn't closed, so I quickly closed it. I couldn't get the key in, but the car still came on. I drove off, but it was really slow. I tried to hit the crocodile but it kept dodging it. I waited at the top of a road and a car came and then I kept going. A guy was trying to get out of his driveway and honked. I yelled out ""I didn't see you, sorry!"". There was a woman in front of me driving slowly, so I overtook her. Then it was a movie/show. A kid drove to an oval and there were triplets, two of which were called Claude and Clyde. One of them was stupid. The kid told them to get in the car. The crocodile was circling them. A pedophile guy smiled at it."
"3434"	"(2010-05-14 (19)) I was watching Lost. I overheard Locke being told to kill everyone, except for himself and River (Firefly), though sometimes she was Kate. Later, Jack had to go talk to some people in this cabin thing. Charlie, Kate and I were outside. They asked Jack if anyone was with him and he said yes and that it was a guy. They asked him to describe the guy and he realized he shouldn't say where everyone was and he said ""big"" -- he was talking about Locke. I realized what he was doing and I got Kate and Charlie to go around the other side. There was a mirror and I saw them peek out. Charlie wondered what was going on and I whispered that Locke was told to kill everyone but himself and Kate and Charlie was upset and confused because he was close with Locke. Then Charlie and I were outside a building and there was a school nearby. An Asian lady came over and was speaking in an Asian language, then English and gave us a workbook. She took us to the teachers lounge or something. There was a TV and some spoof movie was playing. The food there looked very greasy and fattening. Someone asked who Jason Bateman's ""twin"" was and I said 'Justine', but that I didn't think they were twins and that she was older. I looked it up and he was born in 1963 and she was born in 1964 and I said 'yep, she's older', then I realized my mistake, but I didn't correct it."
"3435"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) I was watching Supernatural. Sam was possessed by Satan. I had been friends with him and Dean in the past. Then I was at university and Ezra, Sam and I went there to do some course. Sometimes Ezra was Calvin. There was a test that had to be done in pairs. Ezra said you could put 'llama' down and then he said ""but I'm going with Sam"". I asked 'isn't Sam failing? How is he doing? I haven't seen him in 3 years."" He was actually getting 90.3%. There was a computer assignment and the teacher asked where some guy was. I told her. Everyone thought I was a dobber and were annoyed at me. I told the teacher later that I had a tomato patch in my room ""at my Mom's. It used to be my old house"". She wanted to discuss how to grow them and I said I hadn't done it for 4 years. Mom gave Rover to this lady for some reason. We were letting her meet him. She seemed to like him, but if he did something naughty, she would look angry. We were outside in her yard and the grass was soft. Rover ran behind the shed and she went and got him. I went with Mom somewhere and got a text. One was from Jeffrey Donovan, saying ""not again"". I checked my sent messages and I'd accidentally sent him and Sam a blank text. It cost $10.30 altogether. I said I had to get a new phone. Then there was a court trial and a young kid was possessed so they could use him as a witness against his family. Buster (Arrested Development) had been 'blown up' and we had to deflate him before he could get in. They took off his wrist monitor and then he ran off. Jewel Staite was getting photos with people. She kissed some guy and they played a 'game' with him like 'guess the celeb'."
"3436"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) Ezra was cleaning my room. Mom and Darren were in there too. They were emptying bags to use as rubbish bags and I told them to stop. Ezra was making them neat though. Ezra was like 'we can do what we want with this stuff'."
"3437"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) I was friends with Sam and Dean (Supernatural). We went to this community to check it out. There was weird stuff happening to people. There was only like one girl there, but she got trapped. I was interested in Sam, but I wanted to like Dean and be with him. The girl there flirted with him. He disappeared. Then I couldn't find Sam. I called out ""Sam!"" and he replied and I found him in a building. I went in and it looked like a lounge room and was heavily decorated. The guy wasn't Sam and was actually the bad guy and said to me 'You're not going anywhere'. Then Sam came in through the door to help me, but then the door shut and locked. There was a thing with some water - you pulled it up to get the water, but something weird was in it so I left it. I was thirsty. Then it started getting hot and it was bright outside. I said to Sam that I thought it was all our worst nightmares. Two girls, young adults, were outside with beach outfits on. I asked them to open the door, but they couldn't. Then we managed to open it and we walked out. Then it was night. I freaked out and said 'now it's gonna be zombies!'. I saw some people up away from us, then heard a noise behind us and we ran. Zombies began chasing us. Sam had a small baseball bat and hit one. We ran to the group of people and were near a carpark. Molotov cocktails were lying on the ground, ready to go. Someone grabbed one and threw it; it exploded once and then finished off. Someone else went to throw one but it broke. Another exploded near a car. I was trying to get to a car. Then Dad was watching Burn Notice. Eugene was on a beach and called out and ran. He wasn't wearing pants, and we saw his butt. He then wrapped a towel around himself. There was a Russian guy there and he went up to him and said ""Boris?"". His bird was called Boris."
"3438"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) It was like Civilisation IV. I decided to build a city, except it was more like a cottage next to a road. Then Ezra and I were in a car there at night. I plugged a cord into a power point on a pole. We parked under the street light. I put the seat down and tried to sleep. Ezra heard a noise. There was a dark house behind us and there were bushes rustling. I turned the car on (it was a US car) and drove around and chased some guy. Then we were walking and Rover was with us. A lady from the house was near our car and let us in. Rover wandered out and I couldn't find Ezra. I went in and realized they were dodgy and ran. I picked up some thin sticks. We were together again and went back, but nothing was there. Eventually we realized we were trapped there. My tooth was wobbly and I pulled it out. There was a young cheerleader girl. A guy who looked like Michael Cera was also in the first season of Arrested Development and he wanted to lose his virginity. An older lady said she'd do it. Then a guy at some place took this girl into his room and told her to do something and she was allowed to wish for something. He had sex with two women and at the end cried out ""Oh shit! Fuck!"". The girl said she wished to see a movie tonight with something that I can't remember. She got us our car back? The cheerleader went back to school. They were from the olden days or something."
"3439"	"(2010-05-16 (19)) I was at a hospital. Simon and River (Firefly) were there. There was a black girl in a coma, there was a spike on the machine which was caused by a strong feeling - in this case, love. We realised it was because of her brother and we told her ""don't touch your brother or your father"". Simon was in another room and made up this thing for River to drink and it was twice the normal dose. He gave it to me and I went to find River. Then I was with this girl who could teleport. We went to a hotel lobby. I asked this lady if Boyd was staying there and someone said ""what about Lynn?"" and someone had a message. I told them that they were about to go out because the bad guys were coming. We saw them and teleported away. Then there were cops (or FBI) in an alley but they were dodgy. Then I was on an excursion somewhere far away. People started getting weird after a few days. The guy in charge said he didn't know the way to get back. A guy kept trying to attack me. I called Mom and asked her to pick us up -- there were 511 people. She asked how much it was going to cost. It had also cost $80 for the excursion. She said she would do it and I was thinking that I'd just take my friends and leave the rest of the people here."
"3440"	"(2010-05-17 (19)) I had 'created' a guy and he wanted to get married. Mom was teasing me about sex. He was a doctor?"
"3441"	"(2010-05-17 (19)) I was at an ice-cream shop with Mom and Ezra. I couldn't decide on what I wanted and I asked the lady if I could test this blue one. It was ok, but I decided to get cookies and cream. But Mom got it with this weird sauce and popcorn and I got angry and started to yell at her. Screech (Saved by the Bell) was around and someone mentioned Saved by the Bell and I said they probably haven't seen it. When I repeated it, I got an answer to something and Mom said ""are you going to tell Dustin?"". There was also an amusement park with this Miley Cyrus ride -- it was like those ones that have a seat that goes up and around and then down really fast. There was a ride near me with a duck in the far corner next to a fence. I was watching some behind the scenes Arrested Development stuff. Some guest star was excited about being in it. There was a blonde guy that looked like Beavis (Beavis & Butthead). There was a show and a teenage guy and day after day was different. Something about who you were in a movie? Hiro Nakamura (Heroes) chased a bad guy up these chairs. There was some other thing where David Duchovny had dated Gillian Anderson and had cheated on her with Tea Leoni. There was a re-enactment with all of them. Someone ran through a bush."
"3442"	"(2010-05-18 (19)) Mom had an email from some job thing at a call center. There were photos of people who worked there and it was nearby so I was looking at school photos to see if I could find Eugene. I found one with Rebekah, and Rodney was in it, so I took it. Ezra got a job at the Science Museum as security or something. I decided to apply for a job there too. Then it was morning and I was getting ready for university, but I was late. Dad and Ezra were there. I was eating breakfast and then put on a caterpillar costume and Ezra and I went with Nana and Rover to the Science Museum. While we were queuing up, Ezra pushed me. A guy said he would interview tomorrow and then I suddenly remembered I had to get to university."
"3443"	"(2010-05-20 (19)) I sent in a job application to this 'bank' which was actually an insurance company or something. I'd gotten the right 'score', but was rejected. I was driving and the light to turn was red, but I didn't stop in time and went out and then turned around and went back the other way. I was watching Fringe and it was focused on some guy and Olivia was in a sewer, hallucinating. I was at Nana's. I was going to stay the night and I had a lab on at university (it was 'today'). I hadn't asked if I could stay yet though. Mom was in the room with others and Rover. Rover had ripped apart my old Minnie Mouse cushion and there was fluff everywhere. I asked how it happened and she said she'd gotten it out for Amelia and I got angry and yelled that the stuff is mine and I don't want Fug using it and told her to gtfo. I started to cry and Mom was just like 'whatever' and said 'I'm going to bed now'. I heard Nana asking what happened. Mom asked if anyone else was staying and there was. Nana was worried that my alarm would wake him up. Tinkerbell and Tigger were in there and I gave them a pat. I unpacked my stuff and then changed my mind. I called out to Mom to tell her I wanted to leave. There was a poker game on the TV with Will Arnett, David Cross, Matthew Fox, Morena Baccarin and I thought a guy was Chris Potter, but then I said ""oh no, that's [someone else] "". Mom was ready to leave though and then I was annoyed I'd miss the game. Outside there was a shop carpark. I realized I'd forgotten my bag and I saw George (Arrested Development) and said that I'd left my bag inside. He was with a girl. I went in and then was like 'hang on' and saw a guy with a black afro wig on and it was actually Oscar Bluth. George hid. He was actually my granddad? Nana was in the kitchen gossiping with a girl. There was some chicken in the sink to soak in some juice? I left again and there was a Pizza Hut outside. Asians liked to sit at the tables. I said I didn't want pizza and that I wanted Chicken Treat (which was nearby). I also had no pants on."
"3444"	"(2010-05-20 (19)) I was at a shop and said that Firefly was awesome. Some guy agreed. I said there were no words to describe how awesome it is. There was something else that Alan Tudyk was in too."
"3445"	"(2010-05-21 (19)) I was doing some chemistry online. People were discussing flashcards and some were doing it on the computer and others doing it 'the long way'. I was then with Jared Padalecki and we, and some others, had to go on a flight because I had to deliver something for Nathan Fillion. The flight would take all day and we had to go to two different US states, but it was different and they were like different countries, but all together. On the way there, Jared and I were talking to someone foreign and there were subtitles. I got someone's subtitles confused with his and he got hit by a car. I apologized and his eyes went black and I realized he was a demon. I got away and grabbed Jared and said ""he's a demon"". I also clearly remember calling out ""Jared!"" at some point. Then we were near an outdoor eating place. Demons came and we hid in the bushes and Jared fought them. One came up from behind and stabbed me. Jared got angry and upset and killed them all in a rage. Then, I was watching Lost. Some others and I broke into a school. We hid in a room to hide from demons. Heaps of us were sitting around the wall. Then a few guys and girls and I broke into another place to escape. Sawyer (Lost) was there too to escape the island. There were some people there and I think we killed them. There was a big guy and one of us went to him and the big guy shot him. They took us to a room. A lady said that certain people had to go somewhere and she said she'd seen something and that ""There was a blade"". I had been hiding and I stood up and she was above this girl with sores on her feet. She was wearing open shoes (toes were covered, but that other bit was showing). Then she called me out to go with Jacob (Lost). I was annoyed by it. He was sitting with others on a high table. I went to climb up and they put a pineapple in the way and I was like 'how am I supposed to get up?' and then he was the actor and said sorry. Jacob was actually evil as well."
"3446"	"(2010-05-21 (19)) I was in a car with Dad. Someone chased us. Then we went to this place for the finale of Lost. We had to go underwater and there was a cave thing with steps and a big screen. I sat down but realized I'd forgotten my bag. I went out and got it as Ezra came in. It went for 2.5 hours. Jack (Lost) was speaking to a webcam and making faces."
"3447"	"(2010-05-22 (19)) I was watching Lost. Jacob was actually a bad guy and then it was like a game. I had to drop people off a ship to move it (like World of Warcraft) and get to a part of the island."
"3448"	"(2010-05-22 (19)) Mom, Rover and I were out the front. She wanted another dog and she asked me what breed I thought would be a good second dog."
"3449"	"(2010-05-24 (19)) It was the first day of semester 2. I had two labs. Mom drove me there and I realized I'd forgotten my lab coat and glasses. I asked Mom for some money and $20 for this math answer book thing. I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Yang had 'showed emotion' when George died. Izzy had long hair and then said she was grateful for it. Someone wanted Bailey to announce something. There were new credits which showed the person's name and then their role (eg, director, producer). Ron Glass as 'Book' was listed."
"3450"	"(2010-05-24 (19)) I was at Nana's. I was going to watch some TV. There were two guys outside who I hadn't seen before and I told Ezra about them. Nana said they were cool. Some time later we realized there were some dodgy people out there. I locked the doors and hid inside, but we weren't fully closed off (blinds were open etc). I hid in the spare room. I ended up having to leave later and went to Nana's room. Two guys attacked me and it looked like they had yellow eyes (sorta zombie like), but it was disguised. I realized one was in the bathroom. There was something involving the door handle. He had something fake and it went and told his master? I was then in a room with some machine with poles. I held on and it went to a different universe. There was a guy there in some water and I told him to stay."
"3451"	"(2010-05-25 (19)) I was watching Lost. I was with someone out the back of an old house. Ben was an alien or something and someone said he was hot. Someone could do a weird thing with their eyes. Sam (Supernatural) was with Daryl. She was angry at him and he wouldn't go with us because he wanted to wait. Jack said someone was coming. We were in a shed and someone used an ability to 'hide' us. A girl came in and said she couldn't see anyone. Jack said we couldn't go yet. We needed to find a way to time travel and choose a different option so nothing on the island ever happened. Then it turned into Supernatural. Sam and Dean needed to try and get close to Driveshaft during a performance and play the guitar. Neither of them knew how to play, but had memories that could activate it. Dean said 'for me to concentrate, you can't be looking at me like that and can you put some pants on'. Then Sam was working in a car in a garage."
"3452"	"(2010-05-25 (19)) I was at home. I was going to go over to dads and he picked me up. I heard him and Ezra talking outside and he asked him something to which he replied 'yeah', but he was lying. I went out and said I wanted to come."
"3453"	"(2010-05-25 (19)) I went to some guy's place and I went to play Terms of Endearment, but it wasn't actually the film. Jack Nicholson was in it though. Mom watched it too and said it was lame. Then I was in a place and a well-known guy had had a heart attack or something. His family turned up. Then there was a party. They got me to guard the door. Later, there were some big flashlights. I told a lady to get rid of all the non-family guests. I wrote a news report on his death. I heard from a friend that they fired me and they wanted details for the story and I said I couldn't do it. Later, Mom, Ezra and I went to a petrol station. We locked our doors. Mom came back and opened her door and said 'this is a very dangerous neighbourhood', then a dude with a gun ran around to Ezra's side and showed it to Mom. We closed the door and put the car into reverse and I was terrified. Then I woke up and I was still scared."
"3454"	"(2010-05-29 (19)) I took an elevator down. Freaks and Geeks was on a TV. Jason Segel was standing next to me. We joked about my favourite character being Nick. Then I was at some place at night. I was with Neil Patrick Harris and Mom. I saw three guys with what looked like guns. I told Neil and said to run. We ran around some bushes and some of the guys came to cut us off. I heard Mom yell out from there."
"3455"	"(2010-05-31 (19)) I was friends with the characters in How I Met Your Mother. For a long time, Marshall and I would end up making out but stopping before it got too far because of Lily. We were making out in bed and it was very passionate and tongue-y. Then we stopped. There was a mention at some point about a possible threesome. I was then in a car with Mom and others. An ambulance went by with flashing lights and a siren and it did a big turnaround. We turned down a street and there were some guys on the side of the road. There were lists of top 5 games for each game company. GTA IV was on one and another was some 'maternal paternal' game. I was trying to find it online to see what it was about."
"3456"	"(2010-05-31 (19)) I was at a pet shop with Mom. There were kittens and there was an orange one (a girl) who looked like Spaceman in a basket with others and it rubbed its chin against the edge of the basket. I was thinking we could breed them, but they were both fixed. The girl at the counter said something to put us down (like, that they were easy to breed), and that she had cows. We were at a beach later and there was a guy in the water with a big cow. A lady was there with her creepy son. I think he may have been retarded as well. As I got out of the car I said ""I just don't think dead people care what we wear to a funeral"". We got a new house, which was almost the same as the old one but slightly different. Darren and Mom were there. I had no pants on. I asked Darren where the toilet was and he didn't know. A lady made a peanut butter sandwich and then threw it in the bin as I made one. Then she cooked muffins on the stove. Later, I was with Jason Segel, though I think he was Nick (Freaks and Geeks) and he was at a school. We were walking outside and walked around the back of a building and he kissed me against the wall and I fainted? I was thinking that this had happened to Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks) in an episode once."
"3457"	"(2010-06-01 (19)) I was studying somewhere. My chemistry exam was in a few hours, and my math exam afterwards. I was talking to Mom and she was going up that way and could take me there and then back home, but then the exam was now. She finally came with Ezra. Dad came too. Mom decided to let Dad do whatever it was she was down there to do. There was a bridge over some water and there was some traffic backed up. It started to rain and it was dark from the clouds. She drove slowly and I was worried I was going to be late. I started up making up some notes for the math exam in the car."
"3458"	"(2010-06-01 (19)) I was at Nana's in the kitchen. I was going to play Monopoly with Ezra, Nana, Dad and Poppa. Dad explained the rules to Poppa. We had a giant sized board and the dice was made of cardboard and was the size of my hand. Poppa decided the game was stupid and didn't want to play. Poppers came into the room and I went into the dining room. I went out the back and there were some kittens in the birdcages being naughty. Fido was out there too."
"3459"	"(2010-06-01 (19)) I was at Ted's (How I Met Your Mother) with Robin and Marshall. The other day, Marshall had made some hash cookies/muffins and tonight we were going to eat them. We were sitting around and Ted gave us all a cookie. It was nice and chocolate-y, but there was no 'hash'. I thought maybe it was in the muffins instead, so I went into the kitchen and on the table were a square container and a round container. One had muffins and the other had cookies. I took a small muffin (it was the shape and size of a squashed mushroom) and took a bite. It had choc chips and was really nice. We ended up all laughing and messing around. I said something like 'Didn't you make them, Marshall? They're really good, but what the hell?' and he laughed like he was stoned (we all were). We acted like we were high for hours. Robin pretended to be reporting. Ted's boss came and Ted was actually supposed to be working. He said he had a video of one of the nights here. The video had him saying 'Do you know about this door?' and he seemed crazy. He had a girlfriend who was very modern and fashionable."
"3460"	"(2010-06-02 (19)) I was watching Dollhouse, which was different. I remember seeing Dominic though. Raquel had some exam map as her status on Facebook. I found something that led to me discovering some secret weapon thing which I apparently had. Somehow I confirmed this. I realized people were after it, so I called Mom to let her know and she was away for the weekend. I called her and she said these people had just asked and were asking her questions. I panicked and packed my bag with clothes and books for studying. I was going to go to dads and I had an exam tomorrow. I put my shoes in there too. Then I heard a car door shut and I realized the people were here. I heard someone talking from outside the laundry door. He said that he would give me $100k for it and they'd leave without a fight. I noticed the guy was Keamy from Lost. I said they'd have to wait for my Mom to get back. I watched him off his reflection in a mirror. I pointed a gun at him and said I had a good 'ratio'. I went down the hall and quickly got to the front door -- the door was different as well as the front yard. I locked the door as he got to me through another entrance. We fought and I ended up slashing his throat and he fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, he looked like Ted (How I Met Your Mother) and I thought he was actually hot. His mate came and I ran outside. I had a package and ran to my car and drove off. I ended up going back later and they were gone. I tried to brake, but it wasn't working. I got to where Mom was and Ezra was with her. I didn't know if the key was in properly. Then the car was shrinking because of fear of a lake? Mom asked if anything 'traumatic' had happened today and I said that 'terrorists came after me for a biological weapon' and she was shocked. There was a guy with some chocolates and she flirted with him."
"3461"	"(2010-06-03 (19)) This creepy anorexic girl and guy were talking nearby. Mom and I were there and she said something like 'everyone sees an ugly girl talking' and everyone stared and I said 'that's coz they are'. I told Ezra about it later. I was playing World of Warcraft. The Queen of Stormwind looked like Mom, except fatter and she had red hair. I was with lots of others waiting at two elevators. One opened and it was pretty full and I thought someone dodgy was in there who wanted to 'steal' the Queen (she was with us and was like a blow-up doll). We went over to the other one, but thought that was dodgy too, so went with the first one. The door closed, but then immediately opened. Eric (True Blood) was there. We sat on the floor and heaps of coins spilled out of my pocket. The guy behind me was staring and I made fun of him. A person with me helped me pick them up. Then we stopped because we were supposed to let Eric and others do something. I had boxes at the old house and I carried them into my room. I was then watching How I Met Your Mother. There were flashbacks about how Marshall's mother hated Lily. One time Lily went outside, she came back to find the door locked. Then when she went back again, the door had never been used and was covered in spiderwebs and a red-back spider. The steps were falling apart and I thought she was going to fall through them. Marshall would go 'pfft' when he was doing something important or when he was nervous. I can't remember the first one they showed, but the next was when he proposed and there was a banner saying 'is this the type of host you wanted?'. Someone was on a road pretending to wait for something. A girl Ted liked was coming his way and he ran in the opposite direction."
"3462"	"(2010-06-04 (19)) I went to a place which I think was university and they had this building where important stuff happened. I was with Dad and Ezra. On the way out, my phone beeped because some machine had screwed it up. They took it. I snuck back in to get it. It still turned on, but it was really slow. I wanted to get the photos off it, but it would take 30 seconds."
"3463"	"(2010-06-04 (19)) For some reason, I had to find pictures of Hilarie Burton, as she was very anorexic, to show Dad. I also found some old ones of Mischa Barton. I was looking at the questions for the math exam. There was a different one about finding the probability of certain people dying naturally as opposed to being killed by this crazy girl."
"3464"	"(2010-06-05 (19)) I was watching Supernatural. Two people were in an office who liked each other and then one got possessed and killed everyone. I was thinking they were chosen because the actors were married in real life and they had chemistry. Then I went into a bathroom and when I came out, the possessed person was nearby and was a demon. Then I was Sam, but it was from my POV. Dean thought I went to get my gun and came into the bathroom to stop me, but I was in a bath, hiding behind the curtain. The door was locked, but he got in anyway. I explained something to him and then the creature tried to get in. It managed to get in and we said some spell and got rid of it. Ruby 'melted' into water into the bath. I wondered why Sam had married Ruby in real life. Dad watched a home reopening."
"3465"	"(2010-06-05 (19)) I was outside at night with Mom and Rover. Rover barked and then lay down on the front porch to sleep. Mom said he barked to let her know what his bark sounded like. There was some game with a guide dog and a torch, and you had to move from area to area and I think you had to do something too. If you were caught by the torch, you lost. I had a cute little terrier thing. It kept running away though and went to sleep under Rover. I had to walk through a tunnel with train tracks. Someone had set a path, which I followed. When I got out, I saw a torch flashing outside I started down a nearby path. I went into a room and then didn't know what to do. The torch was coming closer and got me and it was Alexis Denisof and he seemed happy to get someone. His accent kept changing from English to American. I asked where I was supposed to go and he wasn't sure. My dog ran towards me and I fell backwards and almost toppled off a ledge, and it barked."
"3466"	"(2010-06-05 (19)) I was at home and Mom was out. I was watching TV and they played I Predict. I sang along to when he sang 'I predict' because I didn't know the rest of the words. Then it wasn't home, with people from school. There were guys outside with some teachers playing sport. I also watched something from Freaks and Geeks with Nick playing sport. Someone came in, who was sometimes Eugene, and he suggested we take off. I got someone to distract the teachers and we snuck out the front door. Then it was like I had gone back in time, so I could drive but I didn't have my licence. I took my car anyway. I kept speeding and having a bit of trouble. We went to the beach, although it had changed. There was a path and there was stuff going on everywhere. I realized I had no pants on. We went to the waterslides, but there were better ones somewhere else. Then I was by myself. The Royal Show was there and I went inside and there were some booths. It was dark. I saw Jason Segel and was like ""goo"" and pretended to stretch himself. I left and I had a quest to hand in. I had to ask a girl to sing. Across from her, another girl started singing The Breakup Song. I had to go to a tower to hand in another quest. It had winding steps and there were lots of people. I had to vote for the best band on this list, except we weren't allowed to vote for The Beatles or Michael Jackson. I was thinking 'who even likes Michael Jackson?'. There were rows of seats for the 'Superbowl'. I sat in a seat, hoping that the guy I liked would sit next to me, but a girl came and I moved. Cory Monteith and the guy I liked, who was sometimes a young Chris Barrie, were a few rows over and I saw Cory look over at me."
"3467"	"(2010-06-06 (19)) I went to Big W with Mom, which was at Midvale. It was Sunday and it was totally empty. There was one person working at the counter, who was an Asian lady. Mom walked off, but I went in. They had only red pens? The lady asked me to read these letter numbers. There were three; red, green and another colour and the numbers were 13, 14, 15. I was going to ask if they were hiring, but then couldn't be bothered. Then Rover was with us and ended up lying in chip packets. We left and I saw Evelyn and gave her a short wave. She worked at the Big W and she couldn't get promoted because she was already at the highest level. Mom said a group of girls were whispering. They asked me a question and I said that I couldn't hear them and they were like 'why is that girl talking to her?'."
"3468"	"(2010-06-07 (19)) Rachel and Puck (both from Glee) were in detention, colouring in pictures of fruits and vegetables. All of his were green. She said she hadn't been to the doctors since ""I saw you"". On Chuck, there was a kid with magic powers. A girl related to Casey was staying with him. He brought her a plate with snacks in bed and she said that she thought she was only leaving her badger and some other animal for a couple of days and she couldn't stay anymore. He said Sarah would call her and leave her on speakerphone until she had had a certain conversation -- they were trying to get her to join their group and were leaving hints. The magic kid put glasses on weirdly and pretended to ride a broomstick, which made everything disappear but then it came back again. Raquel and I made a movie together. I had written the plot and she had written the dialogue. Mom was there."
"3469"	"(2010-06-07 (19)) I was doing quests and one was in a tree. Then I was at a building and I had to get in this secret area that I wasn't allowed in. The name on door was Jesus and the last name also had 'esus' in it. I was going to take a photo. Then I, and someone I was with, got some ice-cream and lollies. I couldn't find my phone when we left, so I got her to call it. I asked ""is Henry VIII playing?"" and she said ""no"". I had a different ring tone, but I found it. It was 3pm, but it was pitch black outside. The car was further away then I remembered. We got into it and locked the doors. Some people were driving up and down the road and then suddenly started going fast. I waited and then reversed and tried to leave but they were blocking the street and I had to drive up the curb and get on the freeway. There were 4 lanes and the people in the car followed me very closely. I went over the speed limit a bit and I was worried. I saw a police car with its lights and siren on and I didn't know who it was after because it was a few lanes over. Darren was watching The Hangover and I caught a bit of it. Ed Helms was in it, but everyone else was different. Marshall (How I Met Your Mother) was a character in it, and another character (but not a real one) was as well, played by George Clooney. Neil Patrick Harris was also in it as himself. Marshall, Lily, George Clooney and a girl were making out on a bed. Kristen Stewart was in a car and she was saying things like 'hey, there's Nikki Reed, shouldn't she turn into a dog or something', 'hey, there's Nikki Reed in a tree'. They hugged. I was thinking the movie was really lame."
"3470"	"(2010-06-08 (19)) Mom, Ezra, someone else and I went to this carnival thing which was all organized into different sections. We were looking for some people. Rover was there too. Darren and Rover were acting as spies? Rover and another dog had a conversation to confirm that he had a box of porn. The one on top had a cover like Not Another Teen Movie, except they were all fat. The cheerleaders were all black. I went to meet with others and then we were at a porno party which Dad was hosting. I was looking for my friends, one of whom was Neil Patrick Harris. Neal (Freaks and Geeks) was with another guy and I grabbed him jokingly and said ""what are you doing here?!"". A lady was talking to Ezra and then he was like 'oh, you're from Modern Family' and they hugged and I was thinking that I didn't remember her. Ezra said she was the one who ""sleeps with Alan (from Freaks and Geeks)"". To get an 'achievement', you had to get her to say a special nickname to you. Her name was Leannie Bird. Jason Segel was then there too and we were friends. I think he liked me. He ignored all the other people and kept trying to hang out with me, but I was looking for something and didn't notice. I complained to Dad that I forgot my phone and couldn't take any photos and he gave me a camera."
"3471"	"(2010-06-08 (19)) Mom, tranny Acquaintance-F-07 and I were walking through a school to get to another building. Police were at the school looking in empty fishtanks. We got to our building and I was looking at the answers to my chemistry exam that I got wrong. Acquaintance-F-07 had some drugs in a fishtank, so she took them out and was going to leave. As I was leaving, I saw cops coming. We all walked away, but this guy asked us something and thought Mom and Acquaintance-F-07 were acting dodgy, so asked us to get strapped in this chair and it would spin around fast. He got in and did it and then we followed. Ezra was there too. Mom went on after Acquaintance-F-07. Someone else went and then it was my turn. I had to be blindfolded and I asked the guy if I would get extra points and he said no. I got off feeling dizzy and sick, but it was fun. I waited outside and tried to get a photo of the guy. Then I had to go on this bus, which was driven by the guy. I took a photo of the guy through the window. Eugene was sitting by himself nearby. I went to the other side where my bag was. When I got off, I ended up in a building with this Asian girl. We walked fast and I tidied my bag as we walked. Then we started running while singing along to a song. There were markers to pick up along the way. There were achievements written on a board and I got one for 'highest pitch'. We had to run up stairs and there were trick pathways etc. At the last part, we went up a set of stairs and I won. She got every other achievement though. One was to collect hats and I went down later to check out all the hats. I grabbed them and it counted towards my score automatically. There was a faded Jayne hat. There was a clown with purple hair who was cracking up. Jeremiah said he was rooting for the Asian girl and I thought 'figures'. I was at a shop at some point and How I Met Your Mother was playing on a TV. There was swearing (like 'fuck') and it wasn't bleeped and I thought it was weird. Marshall said 'shit'. Someone was wearing a shirt with a Barney quote and I was thinking I wanted one that said 'suit up!'."
"3472"	"(2010-06-09 (19)) A girl was with a guy in a gorilla suit. She was like 'what the hell' and he took the head off and it was Barney (How I Met Your Mother) and they kissed. Then some others came out and laughed and it was some joke they played on him."
"3473"	"(2010-06-09 (19)) Ezra, Roland and I were at this school place. There were five levels for each grade. They were in Year 9, in the easiest one to escape. Year 11 and 12 had too many bars. People were leaning out of holes? Outside somewhere, Ezra swapped something with another person for long guns. Mom and I gave him a permanent marker. I had to leave for some academic summit [I finished rewatching Freaks and Geeks yesterday] . Ezra and Roland wanted to leave, so I helped them escape and then a lady chased and caught us. I said I had to leave for the summit. She suggested that I call Mom so I did, but she didn't answer, and then I discovered she'd left her phone here. The lady was then Anastasia. Mom lived across the street, so I went over to give the phone to her and she came out and got it. I was watching the end of Freaks and Geeks and Lindsay dyed her hair blonde, which looked nice, but she was mean. I then decided to ditch the academic summit and follow a band."
"3474"	"(2010-06-10 (19)) There was a new season of Arrested Development, and it wasn't funny at all and was completely random. Someone complained about something. Will Arnett was apparently 21. Then I was watching a pilot of a new show. It was a bit random. There were ships with 'aliens' and they were killing fleets to get a 'set'. I went to bed and woke up some time later and it was 9.30pm, and I wondered why it was so early. Ezra had some mates over. Mom invited me to come for a drive. She was going to an insect shop. I said I'd go, but then I was in uniform at a shop. I worked at a fish and chip shop. My boss was mean and bossed us around. I text Mom to say I wasn't going to go for the drive. There was a report that we didn't compliment or smile enough. An example complaint was about Family Guy. A guy in the show said he got things confused like ""when I said Whedon, I meant idiot"" and then went on to talk about Joss Whedon. I had a boyfriend who was a quadriplegic. Someone had swapped stuff around on his desk to confuse him and I was annoyed because it was my desk."
"3475"	"(2010-06-10 (19)) Three friends and I moved in together. I actually owned the house and wanted $280 a week rent. I asked one of them for $210 and he agreed. There were two girls, one had to pay $235 and the other was his girlfriend."
"3476"	"(2010-06-11 (19)) I was sitting on the step in the back room, talking to Mom and Ezra. Mom was on her computer and Ezra was standing near the table. I was thinking about How I Met Your Mother and how awesome Barney was and I was going to ask Ezra who his favourite character was, but then remembered he didn't watch it. There was a video of Jason Segel (it looked like it was from around season 1/2) laughing a little and looking at the camera. There was a TV show called Triers. Dad said on Facebook that he cried. It was about a hospital thing in the forest. Sharlto Copley was in it. A lady was pregnant. Mom and I were then at the hospital thing. Spaceman was there too. I said 'woo!' and she mentioned Spaceman and I was like 'how did you know I was woo-ing at Spaceman?' and she said 'what else?' and I said ""the guy from District 9"" and she said she didn't remember it. Then it was like World of Warcraft and there were lots of different mobs in one area. I kept getting attacked by these giant worms and I squealed. I had also been at college years ago and Ted (How I Met Your Mother) said that I just stayed in bed and had sex all day. In Freaks and Geeks, someone had made a video of the 'losers' to show them what they were."
"3477"	"(2010-06-13 (19)) I was doing my week of work experience, though it was doing cheerleading. I went down there on Saturday wearing my school jumper over my Woodstock shirt and pants. I got to the court and there were guys in jock outfits and cheerleaders in bright orange shirts. I asked if wearing pants was ok and she said shorts were preferable. I was thinking I'd text Mom and asked her to drop off some shorts, but it was only for an hour, so it seemed like a pointless trip. Someone called out that it was 9.30am and got back to the train station at 1.30pm. Ezra and Mom were there."
"3478"	"(2010-06-15 (19)) It was my first day of work experience. Mom didn't make dinner until 3.30am, so I didn't go the second day. At 8.01am, I got a text from 'Anna Frost' asking where I was, so I replied saying I was sick. Ezra was doing an internship on this forum when people had learned too much? He was kicked off and he was now doing something on Sims 2, and had a low percentage. Mine was like 99%. I downloaded a movie from 1987 with Jason Segel in it, but he was a teen/young adult."
"3479"	"(2010-06-16 (19)) I drove somewhere and then ran back on the train tracks. I asked Mom to take me back later to get my car. I was at a shop and a TV show was playing and James Callis was in it, but had an American accent. It had something to do with kids."
"3480"	"(2010-06-16 (19)) There was some reunion on that I was supposed to go, but I sent Mom instead. She texted me saying that Kaleb had mentioned to her to tell me about something, which was an inside joke from a few years ago. I laughed and then tried to remember when I had been friends with him. I text back 'how formal is it?' and then I went there. I was wearing a suit and said it was 'so I can say suit up' and someone high fived me. Everyone was like 'Barney's awesome'. Then Ezra was there too. We had a drink and I started thinking about my proposed drinking game for The Marine. I was then at a hotel and I had a list of people who I had gone to school with. I'd written 'Jayne <3', who was actually a girl but I was just pretending it was Jayne from Firefly. There was a lady, who was around 50 years old, who I had dreamt about, added something. Then, I was her, and what she/I had written were qualities of her husband 'bald, but had hair'. At some point I was watching music TV with Poppa. He said someone on TV had threatened to sic a crocodile on him."
"3481"	"(2010-06-17 (19)) I was with some friends. We went to some house and some people attacked us. We got in our car and drove away. It was then night and raining and it was hard to drive."
"3482"	"(2010-06-17 (19)) I was signing up to be a volunteer at Comic-Con. I was looking for Summer Glau on the list, but then I remembered it was Morena Baccarin coming. It started at 4.50pm. I chose the time slots for volunteering and some were already taken, but I picked ones around Morena's appearances so I would get to leave right after with a few little breaks."
"3483"	"(2010-06-17 (19)) I went into some place with Dad, Poppa and others. Michael Palin and an old guy were there. There was a new Monty Python movie and I said that it was weird they'd made a new movie without Graham Chapman. We went to see it and there was footage from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. A girl there, who was my age, was going out with the afore-mentioned old guy. I wasn't sure how they were connected. We ended up at some nightclub and everyone was dancing. I was then at some college and it was very busy inside. I was on a staircase and there were people everywhere. I was then outside. Some friends and I were having races. Pam and Jim from The Office were there. Pam was called 'Nick' though. Pam, this other guy and I raced for fun. She was fast and won and I was second. The last part of the race was down some stairs and then back up. Then there was a pool with those green plants, but you had to swim across it. Only people with 'nice butts' were allowed. Pam used to be allowed, but wasn't anymore. She was writing in a diary. I went to do something and walked along the walkway on the 'butt' pool. I went up to Pam and tapped her on the shoulder and said that I was just in the butt pool and she said ""this is the best thing ever!"" and started writing again. The lady in charge came and I hid and she said that Jim was never allowed in and that she didn't notice me because she 'forgot she was here'. James Lafferty was also there and he was allowed in the pool."
"3484"	"(2010-06-18 (19)) Sarah Polley was sleeping in a bed. She had a crossword under her and one of the answers was 'Polley'. She woke up and saw it and found it odd. She wrote it in the spot for Linda Cardellini. Another answer was to do with a movie from 2008 about a nurse."
"3485"	"(2010-06-18 (19)) I was doing this massive real life RPG thing. We pretended we were on a ship and we were all given roles. We were the bad guys. Ezra and Roland were on there. They shot a heap of people and were laughing, but I didn't see them again for the rest of the game. I liked this guy, who was given a role like Jack Dawson in Titanic and he had to put a necklace on me, which I let him do so we could make out, although it was a small kiss and then he left. I took it off the first chance I got. It was heavy and small and made it hard to breathe. There were two Nicole Richie's -- one was anorexic and the other was healthy. Both of them had a lot of makeup on, although they had slightly different eye makeup. Her boyfriend came out with the other one and she was angry and I said ""you look exactly the same!"". Three guys were playing bums and they put on an accent and said 'mate' a lot. Then someone was looking for some people who turned out to be Ezra and Roland. They were in a room (it was at a house that was a bit like the old house, at the end of the hallway just next to my room). I went to my room and my bed was close to the door and I couldn't open the door, so I sat at the door."
"3486"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was watching the second last episode of Lost. There were two Jack's. Charlie dragged a guy 200m through empty space. He was still dead on Earth, but everything was black, except for people. They were in a forest. The real Jack had died and someone said that 'dead Jack's right there' (not in front of the other one) and Kate was upset."
"3487"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was watching the first episode of season 5 of The Office. It showed the end of the last episode again with Toby in his neck brace, but it was actually his twin. The real Toby was coming back to Dunder Mifflin. I was in a car with Phyllis, Pam and others. One of them was a guy Pam used to date and he had lots of rings on and was kind of stupid. The camera crew had requested an interview with Toby's family, but they denied it. We stopped at a trashed bus stop."
"3488"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) Ezra and Roland were doing a quest. They had to kill some mobs in this village. I was there too and for part of my quest, I had to kiss Ezra. It was just on the lips, but I was grossed out anyway, especially because of his tongue ring. Mom got in a car and changed the station. They were playing Round and Round. I was sitting in the back. At some point, I had my first kiss with Jason Segel; he had one arm around me and another touching my face. I kissed back because it was hard to resist."
"3489"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was at a house with Mom, Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and others. Uncle Wilbur got angry and yelled at the others about something on a cupboard from them. They were fat and they made him compete in something that he was pro at. He stormed out and Mom was like 'heh, look how slow he is'. He came back in and took his key."
"3490"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) Neil Patrick Harris and I had been going out for a while. Someone we knew was pregnant. Someone came up to me and said congrats and it was because I was pregnant too. I didn't know how they knew. They started telling me stuff like it was better to sleep with my hair up and to not curl your leg under you and I said that I wasn't keeping it, because I wasn't going to waste my life etc. There was a church thing nearby where couples were getting married. We decided to get married too. It cost nothing and I said I didn't want any fancy stuff. The person doing it said that he could tell we were in love etc because of the way we looked at each other."
"3491"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was at a nightclub place, but it was more like a computer lab/classroom. The lighting was nightclub like though. You could choose 'buffs'; one of them was choosing a hair colour that would be attracted to you -- options of black and purple, black, red, blue, brown and others. I stroked my friends' hair to find soft hair. There was one girl with short/medium black hair. She turned and I said she had nice hair. We kind of flirted? I went through everyone else's hair, but hers was the best. I was supposed to find someone. I sat down at a computer and Joel McHale was next to me and was actually very Jeff like. We started chatting and laughing. I didn't know his name, but I found it out and searched for it. Pictures of him shirtless came up and we joked about it. Everyone got up to go outside and he put his hand out and I didn't know what to do. He said something about it and then we held hands and there was this weird 'connection'. Then it was awkward. I was at a computer later reading trivia about How I Met Your Mother. Alyson Hannigan was pregnant."
"3492"	"(2010-06-20 (19)) I was watching The Office. Eugene quit for a bit, but then came back. Toby had his job."
"3493"	"(2010-06-21 (19)) I was at a beach thing with people from The Office. Angela and I had had a fight a while ago -- the last few days she had started to like me. Then, she told me something in private (not important) and I had angrily told Lily (How I Met Your Mother), who had told everyone else. She eventually told me it was fine and I said that I shouldn't have said anything. We went down to the pool. The beach had a 'house' on an island in the middle. Angela was wearing a bikini, but the top was like a top instead of a bra. She had brought us there. The house was on fire and I got my phone out to record it. The writers of the show had made Andy roofie someone and have sex with them. They decided they didn't like a 'nice guy' doing that, so they made him evil and I was like 'aw, but I like Andy'."
"3494"	"(2010-06-21 (19)) I was in New York with Dad at a place with chickens in cages. He asked me what one's height was. I accidentally sent him three photos of myself and I explained they were from when I was writing my dreams on the side of the road? There was a hill. Someone turned off all the power in New York. Then all these people turned 'bad' -- mostly Asians. It was night. I was hiding out in a building with lots of others. The Asians were shooting at us through the roof (which had a window that was open) and some of them were in the building too. I was hiding behind a cabinet with a few other girls. Eventually I realized it was just me and another girl left. We got up and went around the corner and saw lots of bad Asians. We went back and they came around the other way. I hid behind a wall, then the other girl turned on me. Something happened to some of them and they turned zombie like. I went into another room which I thought had stairs, but it didn't. I went back out and the girls from before were there with one gun. One of them turned and I took the gun and shot her. Oscar (The Office) was there wearing a red, silky suit thing. I thought he was a good guy, so ignored him and aimed the gun at someone else, but then he pulled out a gun and I said 'no, Oscar!'. I ran into another room which was a big bathroom with a toilet. Then there was another room with a bath in the middle of it. A crazy girl was in there. She asked if I wanted to 'watch' -- she had a bomb she had made. She went out and I peeked out and then I went into the bath to protect myself, but I got up to check and there was water two foot high in there and everyone was drowning themselves instead of getting blown up. I opened the door and swam underneath to get out. I floated up though and a girl said I was going to die anyway. I ran out the door and got outside. It was day now. I ran past lots of buildings and gassed areas (they were all together, like part of a university or something). I saw a guy on a motorbike and I said the building was going to blow up, you might want to get off the bike. We ran together. We got a carpark and could see smoke coming out of the building. I asked ""should we get in a car?"" and he said ""I want to go in the post office"". We ran around and he ducked under the building. I couldn't work out how to get under, so I just put my face there and took a breath. He had a black arch thing as an earring, but was otherwise ok looking. We talked for a bit and were kind of flirting. I said I read that a guy on the news did this. Then some guys in a car came and asked if we wanted to go with them. Someone mentioned Pam (The Office) and I said that I liked Pam. They were talking about which character from the show they were and I said that I got Stanley in a quiz I did. They said a friend of theirs got Andy. I went to a pavilion place and met some celebrity there. There were quite a few people there."
"3495"	"(2010-06-22 (19)) Something happened and heaps of people got powers. Some people got kidnapped. One guy's legs weren't working, presumably because he was getting used to his power. His girlfriend was Japanese and she was on a ship. I was one of the kidnapped people. We escaped. She returned and had a power. Then she and the guy were at a Laundromat together. A guy, who was Death, was in court because he was going to die? Rainn Wilson got into an argument with him and it was in all newspapers. Death was with us and was sleeping on the couch. Gizmo and Cuddles were sleeping near him. I grabbed a newspaper and read a story next to him. He woke up and wanted the paper and I threw it at him. He asked if the guy [Rainn Wilson] was ""Dwight Schrute from The Office"" and I confirmed it was. I was reading something that said Alexander Skarsgard was only 19 and I didn't believe it. Someone asked what my power was and I said 'I guess you could call it women's intuition' -- I could 'feel' others' feelings. Mom and I had bought/rented a shop in a shopping centre."
"3496"	"(2010-06-22 (19)) A girl and I, and others, were taken by this guy for a game. We were on a small platform and we were surrounded by nothing -- it was just floating in 'nothing'. There was this 'door' which was special. If it turned on, we would float standing up in the frame, which is how we slept. It never worked properly for us though and we would always float around. On 8 October, the guy came back and we complained. He was different though and he said he didn't care. He said something and we realized he was actually a bad guy and had been taken over or something. We said the game was pointless and stupid. He made us get in a car and took us away. We went to Midvale shops and the deli was bigger. I thought about asking for a job there. Someone in the car wrapped string around our wrists. The guy talked and he revealed he was 'evil' and I sarcastically said 'no-one saw that coming'. He misunderstood it as 'no you're not'. He started to explain how and why, but I stopped him and explained what I meant angrily. The girl with me was now Farrah. He started driving the car crazily and almost hit another car, then slammed into the back of one at a petrol station. While we were stopped, we got out and ran. I ended up on a fence and she was on the ground running. We caught up and he was in a backyard with Farrah and told me to come down. We decided on her coming up and me going down? She came up and we got ready to run and I said I was coming down now. Then we ran. I took off the string. There was a small caravan park and we ran in there, but it was silent. We walked quietly and she suggested we hide somewhere in there, but I said it was too obvious. I went to a fence and saw the beach and suggested we go there. We ran along the wet sand to get to the main part of the beach. There were lots of people and we joined in the crowd. I was thinking I could go to dads. We started having fun and stopped worrying about the guy."
"3497"	"(2010-06-24 (19)) Michael (The Office) was dating people in the office and when they would break up, he would mark them as 'having bad relations' and could make them do something so he could go up a level, which gave him a lot of benefits. Jim and Dwight were outside and Jim played a joke on him, sending him around with 'threats'. There was a playground. Creed was standing around and Dwight warned Jim about something he was getting worried about."
"3498"	"(2010-06-24 (19)) Matthew Morrison was on the cover of a magazine promoting Glee. It was in black and white. I was watching an episode of it, but only remember seeing Finn."
"3499"	"(2010-06-25 (19)) Leonardo DiCaprio was a character who was a 'bad' guy and visited a guy. Leo was pretending to be him and had the same accent as he did in Shutter Island. The guy suddenly yelled ""when was the last time you woke up listening to 8 Mile! That whole movie and one little song"" and he responded with ""I know, right!"". The guy realized it was a test. He got a job to pick up this 19 year old girl. He went to a carpark to get here and she was actually a transvestite who looked like Anthony Perkins. She got in the car and the driver was now a female and put music on, which sounded very sexual. Anthony Perkins got upset and got out of the car. The Academy Awards were on and Antonio Banderas had said he wanted some weird looking guy to win and was like ""this is what I want"" and everyone else was like 'who the hell is he to say that?'. A lot of the winners were very odd choices, but Christoph Waltz won. There was a bit for TV shows and Rainn Wilson was in the newspaper."
"3500"	"(2010-06-25 (19)) I was with some people looking for ghosts. Apparently there was treasure in a certain spot and we found an old radio and one of things with balls and loops."
"3501"	"(2010-06-25 (19)) I drove to the vet for work experience and then remembered I wasn't going anymore and drove back home. It was raining heavily. The cars in front of me were driving slowly. Then I was doing volunteer work until 7pm and it was almost 5. I was sweaty. There was an area with famous people. There were lots of paths and flowers. Then I was at a shop. Harry, Hermione and Ron (Harry Potter) were there. A guy was doing something with them and Hermione was giggling whenever Ron was mentioned and I was annoyed because I liked him too. Ron's brothers and the three of them did something 'naughty', so a guy had emptied their bank accounts and punished them, but because Ron didn't talk back he was let off, then his brothers threatened the guy and they were allowed to go too. The guy was now Timothy Spall. Harry was in the lolly section and got some alcohol and got drunk. Something happened and this creature was released (size of the monster in Gwoemul). It burst through and we all ran. I got in the car with Mom, who had been waiting, and it put its foot on the bonnet and breathed onto the windscreen. I said ""don't move"" and it smashed the window, but then left. I ended up back inside with it and we were trapped in. I was hiding around and it was being mean to others, but it was not bad to me. Seamus was with me. All of a sudden, it started singing Ask the Lonely loudly, but with modified lyrics, eg ""close the windows and toilets"". We laughed."
"3502"	"(2010-06-26 (19)) Mom and Ezra were watching Freaks and Geeks on her computer. There was a fake episode where Lindsay was in class and the class joked that her drug of choice was coke and you could put anything in a shoebox these days. Mom was doing something else at the same time and wasn't watching it properly."
"3503"	"(2010-06-27 (19)) I was pregnant or had a baby. I was practicing 'motherhood' with a mouse in bed and it peed on me. There was a person with us. I didn't know who the father was. I was reading something about Jim and Pam from The Office."
"3504"	"(2010-06-27 (19)) I was at 'work'. I had a desk with a computer and post-it notes with TV shows written on them. There was a list of movies I'd watched while also doing something important. A girl looked at something and I'd written 'I <3 Jeffrey Dean Morgan' and two others. I had a daughter called Kaylee and a granddaughter called Jessica. Eugene was the father. Someone kidnapped Kaylee and left notes, then they kidnapped Jessica as well. I went to Darren and Mom. I was in the car with Mom and it was raining. We pulled up on the side of the road and opened the door and a big dog came running up and managed to close the door, but the window was down and it stuck its head in. Then we were at a shop. Julia Gillard was there and I'd overheard her talking about gays and it sounded pro-gay. A girl asked her for advice and she helped her."
"3505"	"(2010-06-28 (19)) I went to Comic-Con. I was watching people on stage, but I only remember seeing Eliza Dushku. I was trying to get to the break room before them, but it took me ages to get out. When I left the main room, there was a hall next to it and someone snuck out of it and it was Nathan Fillion. I got excited and I averted my eyes, but he noticed and he said he was in a hurry and called me 'Izzy'. I asked how he knew my name and it was because of my badge. He went through these doors and he said he had to be at a place in San Francisco and I said 'ok, have a good a time' and he left and I was annoyed. I met with Ezra on the way to the car, but it took us a while to find it. Spaceman was in the back of a Ute in a box. There was a bad drawing of a house I'd done on Facebook and people were liking it. Nana had a gift but there was no reward?"
"3506"	"(2010-06-28 (19)) I was at an award show thing, which was quite small. They said 'The Office' and I clapped once excitedly and Dad wondered why. Everyone started chanting 'Rainn'. Steve Carell was nominated as well as Rainn Wilson, but Rainn Wilson won."
"3507"	"(2010-06-28 (19)) I was in a building, like a house, but I'm not sure what it was. There was a room with 'Murlocs', but they weren't really. They were found underwater, but I thought they were aliens. I closed the door and left. Later, I walked past an open door and there was a folder on the ground keeping it open. I pushed it away and let it close. I went back to another room and told Ezra. Dean Pelton (Community) and two guys were in the air vent dealing drugs -- it was some alien drug. Someone did this thing to make all guys there extremely horny and they were raping people. This hot guy that I was friends with was in a room with me when it happened. He kissed me violently and pushed me to the ground. I tried to get him off, but I couldn't. Whatever the thing was was turned off a few seconds later. Later, I was walking with him and another guy and he said that he didn't remember anything. I had taken my pants off and was giving them to someone in a trade. Then I was watching Red Dwarf, but it wasn't. Mom had been in a few episodes as a girl from the past who travelled forwards in time. There was a character who everyone thought was going to be a love interest, and it was Dad, but it was 400 years in the future. We had some banana cake but it was black. I felt sick. I was playing World of Warcraft at some point and was doing Auchindoun with others. We hung our bags up and I went to kill the main boss."
"3508"	"(2010-06-29 (19)) I was watching some comedy show. Eliza Dushku and a blonde girl were hiding under a blanket and a box on a bench. People came and lifted them up and the girl was like 'Micah!' and Eliza was like 'it's Meccah'. Someone asked me if I was nervous when getting her autograph and I said 'no, I'm not really a fan'. I said she was uglier in real life and I was more nervous when getting Summer Glau's autograph."
"3509"	"(2010-06-29 (19)) Mom and I were at a place and something had been pulled out which meant it had just been robbed. It was night. There were some black guys and one was at a platform at a train station. Another started coming toward us."
"3510"	"(2010-06-30 (19)) I was 'in' Queer as Folk. I went out with some guys. Later, there was a bunch of us and they were having a competition and asking how 'big' everyone was. Stuart was sitting on a toilet, naked, with his butt sticking outwards. Then I was watching Community, and Jeff was expected to like this 'hot' girl. Abed picked up on Jeff's emotions and convinced him to tell Britta how he felt. He chased her down and she was on the phone and he said ""I have a crush on you"" and she looked shocked and repeated it and he laughed happily and left."
"3511"	"(2010-06-30 (19)) Rover got his claw stuck and had warm vomit on his head. Mom was around."
"3512"	"(2010-07-02 (19)) I was on World of Warcraft. There was a long quest line, and each quest had an hour timer on it, but they were short. The quest reward window was different -- there were four different choices all which four different items, all of which had no value. For the second part of the quest, I had to speak to an 'Alpha Male' wolf in a cave. There were lots of them and some were yellow (non-agro) and some were red (agro). I finished with him and got an exp reward and I turned to run from an agro but he attacked me. I flew out to get to the next place. Mom was going to take me to university to drop off my chemistry assignment. It was worth 15% of my grade. She said that we would be going to a barbecue picnic afterwards and were going to bring along stuff for a steak sandwich for me. I said that I'd just go and get my assignment. The house was different. Before my room, there was a big toilet (it was probably about the size of my room in RL). It had a sliding door. My room also had a small toilet to the side. I did a pee in the big toilet and Mom came and was like 'what are you doing?' and I said I was peeing and she was like 'what?' and went to open the door and I held it shut and I repeated what I said. She was like ok and left. I had a red shirt on. I grabbed my grey jacket which was on my bed, my chemistry stuff and my water bottle. I was still logged on to World of Warcraft and it said that I had tried to trade with heaps of people. I then realized I only had 4.9k gold and it said that 600k had been traded to someone called 'thinking [something I don't remember] baby' and I told him to give me my money back and he ran off and I used an angry emote. I asked Ezra why he took money from me and he said it wasn't him."
"3513"	"(2010-07-03 (19)) I was at this place like a shop but then it was like a house. There were lots of people over and we were having a party. First I was in a car with Dad and we pulled into this place. This guy came to my window (the car was US style, so I was on the right) and said hello and flirted with me. We started to drive off, but felt compelled to stay and Dad turned around. Everyone got drunk. Ezra was there too. He had a job in 'engineering'. We yelled at someone to leave and then called him to come back? Anyway, it was fun. A few guys there were friendly to me and I knew them, sort of. I was then driving with Mom and she was driving crazy and ended up hitting cars. Then we had 'ducks' that had the last name 'Sparrow' which was like ours. But I was saying to people that they had changed them to something else, but some were still Sparrow and I eventually said 'no last names'. One was called Andrew and someone was like 'that's a girl's name' and I said 'How is Andrew a girl's name?' and they said it was because of the 'Drew' and I said ""That's like saying Rik's a girl's name because of the 'i',"". Everyone thought it was hilarious and they were all laughing. This guy and I got close to having sex at one point, but we didn't."
"3514"	"(2010-07-03 (19)) I was at a shop. Yvonne Strahovski had some product there. It was pink and I dipped my fingers into a bottle to taste it."
"3515"	"(2010-07-04 (19)) I was watching a 'behind-the-scenes' thing for Queer as Folk. Denise Black, Scott Lowell and Craig Kelly were in it. Denise Black was like 'don't even let me better than this man' and pointed to Craig Kelly (I think that's what it says, it's hard to read). She was going through this list which had them all ranked in attractiveness. Scott laughed that she was last."
"3516"	"(2010-07-04 (19)) I was at a shop with Dad. He went to buy condoms and I left to go to the toilet. I walked to a cubicle as the one next to it flushed and a guy walked out. I thought it was weird but I went in anyway. He washed his hands and walked towards the door but didn't leave. I then saw the feet of the girl in the cubicle next to me hanging and it sounded like she was choking and then it stopped. I text Dad saying 'guy in here, dodgy, come here'. I waited for a bit and then I got up and walked out towards the door. Then Dad opened the door and I left with him. Then a heap of others and I were on this little train and then the tracks ended and were replaced with some weird thing then we were walking over it. As we were going back the train started coming and we got off. Then Sylar (Heroes) was gay and had killed his boyfriend by putting him through a mulcher like machine. I met him at one point and liked him so helped him but he ended up turning himself in because he missed his boyfriend. Then I was Sarah (Chuck) and he was being held in this weird room with a guard. I went in and I told him to go but he refused. There was a cat in there too. The guy came back and saw the cat and he was like 'come on sweetie; let's get you out of here'. Sarah could turn invisible and I was thinking 'I thought she had a different power'. I had asked Sylar at one point what he did with his boyfriend and it had something to do with a lathe. I was starting to like him a bit and then he stopped to do something and this thing blew up killing him. I was upset and angry at this. I left and there were police digging up bodies in this forest area. There was also this funny message that he had left on my phone and I kept listening to it, crying and laughing."
"3517"	"(2010-07-05 (19)) Ezra and I were playing this game on the computer. It looked like World of Warcraft. We were randomly assigned roles. The first two games that we played I got the same thing and it was the easiest role. The setting was like outside a castle and this big door/gate would open and all these flying things like gargoyles would come in. We were at desks. The third time I got a different role where I had to fly and I also had to choose the appearance of our flag and my character's appearance. I picked this guy with a black handlebar moustache and black hair etc. I got this thing that was like a stake and had to stab these blog things on the left side. Some guy complained when I did it. Then we had a teacher who was Jack Black and he started singing a song about R2-D2 and someone said that he was made of aluminium."
"3518"	"(2010-07-06 (19)) I was doing a quest on World of Warcraft. When I logged on I was underwater and this big thing started fighting me. I got down to 2000hp quickly but then I killed it. I had some other quests underwater and it spawned quickly and started coming over so I left the area. This guy who was an alien or something, came over to where I was. He shook my hand and I fell to the floor with an orgasm which lasted for a minute. I couldn't move. There was a Sporcle quiz on all the types of characters in Joss Whedon shows including demons, names of demons etc."
"3519"	"(2010-07-06 (19)) I was out with this guy and a couple. We are at a shop. There was like a party on and one section was all lit up but the rest of the shop was dark. This other guy was following me. I went off to the stationery section which was dark. He was talking to me and seemed nervous and friendly. I think he was a security guard. He walked away, but then he ran over and grabbed my arms. He was strong and pushed me to the ground to rape me and I screamed loudly and high pitched and he let me go. I had gotten changed a while back and was looking for my old clothes. Eventually the shop closed and it was just me and my friends there. It was now totally dark. The party was illegal/not allowed and there was one security guard outside who we had to avoid. We ran out to the car and the alarm went off. Their car wouldn't unlock so we got into mine and I drove off. Later, I was playing Frontierville and the 'Gold Rush' had opened. I started clearing stuff and there were some crops already planted. Jeremiah had helped out and I was like 'oh, that's why he hasn't been leveling up' (because there was a separate leveling system on 'Gold Rush' and he had been playing there instead)."
"3520"	"(2010-07-06 (19)) Mom opened up a pet shop thing. There was a small circular ramp leading inside and you had to crouch. There were mice and snakes etc. Ezra was there. A snake climbed inside a mouse. I ran up and asked Mom what to do but she wasn't listening. I asked why I hadn't been given a job there. There was a new band called 'New Brothers' and it was made up of 'the three remaining Beatles' and another guy. The only dead Beatle was George. Someone mentioned that one was no longer with us and everyone was silent and got upset."
"3521"	"(2010-07-07 (19)) There was a picture of Dan Aykroyd in Ghostbusters and he was really young, but it wasn't actually him. I had a different car. I was driving and had a bad accident. I got out of my car and was dizzy etc. Mom called this person to get help and they asked what kind of car I had and Mom made a joke while explaining to them, that I had gotten the car that was more like a 'work car' model which was less safe, but didn't look as lame. They started joking and chatting with her. I was trying to take photos of the accident."
"3522"	"(2010-07-07 (19)) I was on the beach. Quentin Tarantino had a stand with a back room for watching movies. Dad knew him. Mom and I went down there and she recognized him and was like 'what's his name?' and I said ""Quentin Tarantino!"" and she asked ""Are you a fan of [babble] ?"" and Dad was then there and said I was a fan and Quentin said I could come by one day and watch some movies."
"3523"	"(2010-07-09 (19)) I was at home which was different. We all stayed up late. Darren went to bed first because he had to get up early for work. Mom was watching TV. I watched some Queer as Folk (UK), but it was different. It was just Stuart and I was like 'where's Vince?'. The lesbians were played by different people. Ezra watched a bit and thought it was lame. There was no sex in the episode. There was a bit with Stuart and Vince on a road trip or something and they were making out in the back seat. Ezra went to bed next I think. We had mice. Their box could be changed around by clicking and dragging as if it were on a computer. They all escaped as I was changing it around. Then they were kittens. Rover was in my room and I tried to close the door so he couldn't get at them and I could round them up, but some went in there and Rover chased them. The toilet was next to the kitchen (well, the toilet was in the room next to the kitchen). I went to the toilet and Darren came into the kitchen and I pulled the door closed a bit. I used the last bit of toilet paper. There were lots of tissue boxes. I went to my computer and my wallpaper was of Firefly, but you could add extra people. I had Dan Aykroyd's character from The Blues Brothers on there and some other guys."
"3524"	"(2010-07-10 (19)) This girl was watching a movie. The movie was made by Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin was in it. It was also similar to Time Bandits, even though I haven't seen it yet. She blew bubbles and in one of the bubbles was this explorer gnome guy and his pets. They came out of the bubble. She became friends with them and kept them on a top shelf. Then it was years later. Now had actually been this guy who was a friend of mine and who I liked. We were down in his 'basement' cleaning. The small people were helping us because they had extra strength or something. We were all moving furniture like shelves and tables etc. We finished with the heavy stuff and put the little people on the top shelf. I left to go up to this building and I had to walk up this walkway up high. I looked through the window of the basement at him and he looked too. I went into the building which was like a shop. I saw this lady in there watching me. The shop was closed by the way. I got in the elevator and hit '5'. She started walking up the stairs so I hit stop and then '1' and started going back down. I ran to the front door and she chased me. She caught me and carried me to the window and pushed me against it so everyone could see. Then she took me over to the edge of the walkway, but I pushed my feet against the railing to stop from getting too close. She claimed she was his ex-girlfriend and they had had sex etc and I was like 'I don't care!'. She was lying though. I don't know happened then but Mom, Fug and I went to a supermarket. Fug was in a pram and I was in another pram with a blanket. I had been cold and my legs were sore and that was why I was in a pram. We went down an aisle a teenage guy followed us calling Fug an ugly baby (to Mom). I got sick of the pram and got out. The guy left and I asked Mom what happened and she said he had asked what kind of baby I was and tried to make it sound like he had called me ugly. We got potato chips. There were lots of open bags. We went to the checkout and all the things we had gotten were the same colour and Mom said ""it's so yellow"" and I said ""and red"". I told Mom to tell the guy about the open bags and he said that he was having a party and we could come. We realized it was a bribe so we wouldn't say anything about this razor we had also found before. I was watching Penn & Teller sometime later. It was an episode about not speaking. Teller was miming to someone talking and was swearing at Penn."
"3525"	"(2010-07-11 (19)) Ezra woke up at 3 AM to go to work. I had two puppies, a brown one and a yellowish one. I was going to call them Stuart and Vince after the characters from Queer as Folk (UK) but I realised the brown one was a girl. Ezra had been looking after her. The names I was considering now were Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks), Kaylee (Firefly) or River (Firefly). I decided to go with Ezra for a bit. He was driving. He stopped at a house and they took him the rest of the way. I ended up at a friend of Mom's. I called her to get me. The clock said 12 PM but that was wrong. I heard the opening theme song of Queer as Folk (UK) and I turned around to see it playing on the TV and it was a scene with Stuart. I watched a bit of it."
"3526"	"(2010-07-11 (19)) I was at University which was different. I got Dad to bring me his laptop as he was nearby. The carpark was undercover. We went to the car. There was something about a 'crush' and it had something to do with Chris Barrie photos on my computer. A guy and a girl were near me and they had bright blue eyes and were pale. They said they were vampires and they showed their fangs. I told Dad and he was like 'whatever' but eventually he looked at them and realised. We went to leave. I wondered why no-one had known of vampires before then. We drove off and saw all these people running down the street followed by heaps of creatures. There were giant dogs, ogres (like in World of Warcraft), clouds etc. Some then decided to come our way. Then we were on foot and we ran. There were creatures everywhere. We were with some others. There was a ladder on a wall which was hard to climb and this female creature was following us easily. We got to the ground and ran. There was a big meeting on the oval for the creatures. We got past them and then suddenly there were no creatures. There were some little rooms so we went in one. We shut the doors but the windows had no glass. We got talking and realized that none of us had had sex before. One of the girl's was a 'popular' girl. We wondered why that would matter. One of us asked ""why is sex always a bad thing?"". Then we realized all the creatures were staring in at us. We ran. Later, it was shown that a moth had flown into the room, which supposedly made us visible because it had mated before. We got caught. They impregnated us with random guys. Tara from True Blood got impregnated by Eggs (True Blood). Sookie (True Blood) was impregnated with Sam (True Blood). This other girl liked Eggs and complained. There was this thing about Sam Trammell, which was Wikipedia like. The photos of him made him look gay. It said he was gay and also used to be a teacher. I don't know if it was true though."
"3527"	"(2010-07-12 (19)) I had a job interview at McDonald's. It was done by two girls. People in the shop were being loud and people were coming in and one of the girls yelled that the job interview was taking place. I was embarrassed and I wasn't sure how it was going. The meaner one left. The chocolate in the sundae machine was spilling and mixing with the ice cream and I warned her. I was only allowed to work for a maximum of 20 hours a week and I was thinking that I needed to change it so I could work longer. Some cop/forensic guy did something and someone called him a ""douche""? He marked this thing from 100 down to 71 thinking that no-one would notice and it got people in trouble originally, until they realized it measured itself automatically, so they double checked the machine's records with his. Then I was doing a dungeon with Ezra. Eugene and others were in a 'pub' nearby and when we were in the dungeon we could hear them talking. They were fans of the Harry Potter movies [note: last night there was a FilmForum video which used Harry Potter movies as an example] . There was this new thing with floating rooms. Couples usually rented them. It was unknown to them, but the walls were glass so they could see through and all the rooms would float together in this big 'room' (it was kind of like The Matrix). From the top, you could see everything. It showed some couples cuddling, kissing, some having sex and one guy was masturbating alone. Then Jason Segel and I were in a room. He was my boyfriend. We were having sex, on our side and he was behind me. I was watching Smallville and Clark said ""fuck"" twice and I thought that was weird. It was a weird, complicated episode. Then I was watching Queer as Folk. Hazel (from the UK one) was in it, and Michael (the US one) was her son. Then Mom and I were in the car and we went to one of her friends. They were trying to impress me and I was yawning."
"3528"	"(2010-07-13 (19)) This guy who looked like Christian Kane (although he was sometimes hot) and I were out at this club thing which was in the shape of a ship. When I showed the bouncer my ID he put his face right up to the card. It was night by the way. I don't know what happened but we were then outside in the carpark. I saw a Camry and got an idea to blow up all Camry's. We got to this car and I signalled him and then he came. I pretended to be drunk. This lady came over to it, and she was the owner of the car. He put a plastic bag over her head and killed her. We looked to the car for stuff, leaving personal belongings. Then we went to the next car which was a red, sports like, two-door car. He broke into it. Some others came and he killed them. Then a group of people came over and asked if we had seen anyone dodgy around. They opened the boot of a car nearby and saw two dead people sitting in the front seats and they freaked out. I pretended to be shocked as well. Then the Christian Kane guy started walking with a plastic bag and was then get them before he realised that there were more people around. He said we had to go and we took the sports car. I asked ""is this really the most inconspicuous car?"". There were p-plates on and I took them off. The car drove fast and smooth. People were everywhere in the carpark. Later a sketch of some guy was going around the news and I was trying to find out what it looked like to make sure that it wasn't him, but it didn't look like him."
"3529"	"(2010-07-13 (19)) I watched the sunrise. There were red flames and you could watch without hurting your eyes. I asked Mom if she had seen it and she said she hadn't. I had taken a photo. Darren was there. The house was like the old house. I was in the bathroom and Mom came in and she had extra rings on. They were silver diamond-y ones (like gangster's wear)."
"3530"	"(2010-07-14 (19)) University was different and was where North Midvale Primary School is. I was walking down and I was wearing shorts and a jacket. I had forgotten my water bottle. I heard Calvin talking. Some other people and I sat with Elijah and some other people I knew. My phone was a touch screen and I accidentally called this girl nearby. I slid the bar on the phone across to hang up. The principal lady asked ""how would you introduce yourself to someone in America?"", someone said ""Hey, what's up?"" but she had meant someone important, ie to use ""yes, please, Sir"" etc. Eugene had an account on some dating site and I went on it and saved all his photos. I made a fake account and added him as a friend. There was a new quiz thing and I went on to see his results but he hadn't done it. My real account had photos of me and some guy. It was then some guy and girl who were together. They had a small apartment in New York. I ate lots of lollies 30 minutes ""before the start of this dream [I can't remember what word I used] "". Then I was at the old house and Dad still lived there. Ezra and I went over for a bit. Dad asked who it was he normally talked about from work and I said ""that young guy"" and was thinking of Jim from The Office. We got our stuff together to leave. The garage door was open a bit and Dad closed it. As we drove off, the front door flew open. The radio was playing Mambo Sun. I was then with Mom and Ezra and we called Dad to tell him, but we said that it had flown off."
"3531"	"(2010-07-14 (19)) For some reason, I was watching Hot Tub Time Machine [note: I haven't seen it, nor am I interested in seeing it] . Then it was real. Everyone was running from someone into a building with different rooms behind these curtains. I was there too and ran into a room with mirrored walls and I could see everyone else. I then woke up in bed in a house with the shutters on the window opening. I was married to Harrison Ford (who was one of the people who were running before). We wondered why we were partnered up and I was annoyed I hadn't been paired up with Eugene. There was dog poo on the floor. We had a little dog, who was old, and had liver problems."
"3532"	"(2010-07-14 (19)) I was at 'school'. Calvin and others were sitting on these steps. Then I was younger and Ramona and I were given our reports. Mine said 'obesity' and had drawings of exercises to do. I yelled back at the teacher and then decided to wag. I got to King Road from across the reserve, and was near Wellington Street or whatever it is. Ramona had come with me and she went off to her house. Then I was in a class and I was about four, but had gone back in time. There was a thing on the wall which had birthday cards for the teacher. I realized he was gay. I laughed and read out the card which had long, weird words, one of which was ""totalitarian"". He was amazed that I was reading the words so fluently and got me to read out more. As this was happening, some kid fell out of the window. Then I was driving and I followed this car into this mechanic place. It was a police car and I parked next to them. I said it was a magic trick. There was a piece of meat and I pretended to be a character from From Dusk Till Dawn and made a slurpy noise. I laughed. I was still four by the way. We were near a beach. I went to this food hall place. There was a guy who looked like Jason Segel."
"3533"	"(2010-07-17 (19)) I was at home. Emery and other people were outside and Ezra was talking to them. I went back to school and Ms Bigwood was chatting to me and said ""oh, you haven't changed yet"" and I replied ""I'm not going to"". There was a lake thing with crocodile heads. I left my car at Midvale petrol station for some reason (it was different). Some time ago I had hacked two games by typing this word in some 'code' and then it gave it a virus? One day, in Japan there was something that was sold to ""topless [it looks like it says venlon?] "". Later when I went back to my car there was stuff missing from my bonnet. Something in the shape of a symbol had been taken off. Then Dad was there and I showed him and said that my car had been there all day. He asked them if they knew anyone around you like to steal ""hubcaps"". Two guys got into separate arguments and seemed violent so I got into my car and locked the doors. Dad got in the car and we decided to leave. As soon as I got on to Princess Rd it started pouring (like in The Passing stage of Left for Dead 2 which I played yesterday). I kept driving and we ended up at Nana's. It was no longer raining. We went in and usually the first room was the kitchen but it had changed. I was confused about it. Poppa was in the room watching TV. To the left was the kitchen and dining room and the room straight ahead had another TV in it and led outside to a pool. I said that I didn't like it and Dad was like 'don't be rude'. Nana hadn't liked the kitchen and had gotten rid of the long cupboards and the long benches. It was annoying because everybody seemed like they were in the same room. Granny was there and she had very grey/silver hair. I was thinking she was supposed to be dead, but wasn't sure. There were kids in the pool. We watched some Gossip Girl. Chuck and Blair danced at a dance thing. Jenny was dancing to some hip hop music."
"3534"	"(2010-07-18 (19)) I was out the front and Josephine was there. She had a bag from Bunnings and she said ""oh I have a job there"" and I said I might and she was like 'I don't care'. I said I needed money and she was like 'that's why you're doing it? My parents give me all the money I need'. I said 'so do mine, but I want my own'. She said that her family had a maid."
"3535"	"(2010-07-18 (19)) I was at a park with Dad. There were horses around. It was in the UK. Then Ezra was there too. We were on holidays. Ezra was staying there for study. He dropped us off at school. It looked cold but it was hot. I went back to the hotel and I went inside where the staircase was. There was some event on next to it. There was a queue to get in. There was a table for food and I grabbed a lamington and a brownie. Dad went up the stairs while I was doing that but then the guy wouldn't let me through and I said that my Dad had just gone through and he asked if I had proof and I said no. He asked 'what about your Mom?' and she came and they let me go through. I was like 'I'm 19!'."
"3536"	"(2010-07-19 (19)) I was outside somewhere. There were clouds and they were very vivid and very dark grey. There was a storm coming and I had to get inside. I found cover and then started pouring down. Then it was The Soprano's and I was at their house which was different. I went to the toilet and there were two doors to it. I opened one door and someone pushed back and I realised Meadow was in there. Later I went out and then it was a movie and this girl and guy were separated from each other. They were both under separate cover from the rain but to get to each other they had to walk a fair way outside. I was seeing from the girl's point of view and she went up the stairs and around to him. They kissed and hugged and then went to go find better cover. Then Farrah had been seen this guy but Justin Bieber was staying in the same area and she liked him. She snuck out one night and I saw her. She ran into a room but I heard someone coming and I hid behind a pillar. They went away and I ran into the same room. She was hiding under the bed and I joined her. Someone came in but as they were leaving they caught us. Her mother was angry and yelling at both of us and I yelled at her while I was alone with her saying 'big deal'."
"3537"	"(2010-07-20 (19)) I was coming back on a plane with Ezra. As we were landing we were going towards stuff that was on the runway and the pilot turned and we spun around and went into the water. We got out easily. I went to the toilet and I wrote this letter and donated this book etc and then put it in the bin. I changed my mind and took them back. I went through a scanner thing and it beeped so I emptied all my stuff. This lady said ""I miss Michael (she was reading from my letter)... Have you got a boyfriend?"" and I said ""No"". There was a wig with my stuff and I said ""oh, that's not mine"". Mom was there too. Also, she would send Rover on flights all the time because he liked them."
"3538"	"(2010-07-21 (19)) I was at home. A few days ago I found out that Ezra had been having the exact same dream that I had last year. He had written one down that sounded familiar and I was pretty shocked by it. Mom was around and we were all discussing it and I realized it was exactly the same. I was thinking 'how the hell am I supposed to talk about this' and I thought of sending something off to DreamResearch."
"3539"	"(2010-07-21 (19)) I was watching the first episode of Big Brother UK. Some of the contestants went into a backyard and were kidnapped. They were let out when they stood up to the kidnappers. Lea Michele was one of them and introduced herself as Rachel Berry and shook the kidnapper's hands. Then Mom and I were at a newsagency. They used calculators. A song called 1756 was playing. The guy accidentally gave us a $100 note which had been meant for the people behind us. It was yellow. We left without realizing though. We were walking away and we realized they were following us. We went through the Northtown McDonald's carpark (different) and down the road and this path up ahead was forest-like. We walked through the park and there were these big black plastic forks and I grabbed one. We ended up also walking through a school. We got to an office and David Bowie was behind the desk and he had calculator like mine. Ezra tasted it and it was actually cream. We gave the money back to the Natives (the people following us) and it was now just a guy and a boy."
"3540"	"(2010-07-22 (19)) I was at home at the end of the driveway near the wall. I had a rope to go across which was tight and in a triangular shape for me to walk across. Granma visited and commented on it. I was a spy or something. I can't remember what I did, but people left my stuff in a plastic bag in the middle of a busy shop. I found it and it had my phone, chocolate and keys in it. I went out to go to my car and this dodgy guy was outside. This other girl was out there and he asked her where some car was and she pointed and he went over. I went to my car and he came over and I unlocked it and he ran to the passenger side and I locked it. He ran over and I scratched and stabbed him with the key. I ran back into the shop and he stayed outside. Every time I went out, he was out there waiting. I asked some girls to distract him or sleep with him. They said no, and I said ""but it's Adam Baldwin! Who doesn't want to hang out with Jayne?"". Eventually I went out to confront him. Then it was a short time later and we were dating. He told me had actually liked me more every time I had gone out. I was like 'zomg *sigh*'. Also, I watched this episode of Misfits, but I only remember seeing Robert Sheehan and I was like ""I can feel it in my balls!""."
"3541"	"(2010-07-22 (19)) It was night and raining and I was driving Ezra somewhere but I was letting him drive. I told him to pull down the next street so we could swap because it was illegal. We did and I turned around and stopped behind some cars at the lights. I got out to take the L-plates off. There was a car behind me and I took off slowly and turned left. I was trying to find my way around. We ended up in a hospital and I couldn't work out how to get out. This lady said she would help but we had to sign up for this course etc. We ran away and she got angry. We ended up in a street and one side was decorated 'spooky' because it was some area that did something like the Royal Show. There were cartoon-ish cars. Then we were with Mom and Roland and I asked what he was doing and he said ""drunk"" and offered me apple pie. I said I'd have half of it. I asked if anyone had found this photo album/magazine which had photos of celebrities and I remembered it from this night ages ago where I had been on that creepy street. James Spader had been there and people had said they liked him and he said ""it was my brother that you liked"" etc -- his brother had died. There was also a professional photo of Milo Ventimiglia. They were mostly all candid though. There was also a photo of Jason Segel and one of Neil Patrick Harris meditating and he was really skinny."
"3542"	"(2010-07-23 (19)) I was at home but it was a bit different. There was a dog door on the front door. Rover kept running out. Ezra and Fug were there. This other Labrador ran over to the house and I let Rover in and then shut the door. This lady from across the road came and got the dog and asked ""which one's your dog?"" and I said ""Rover, a Lab"". Spaceman was near the other dog. She asked how big Rover was.  There was a movie called Silimidia, but I got confused and thought it was Suspiria. When I pressed two fingers on my arm, hard, they would 'merge' and turn into a tongue and one started coming out of my arm. I said ""Do you know how hard it is to lick yourself?"" Then I laughed and shook my head [at the double meaning] . Fug put her hand on Ezra's arm and everyone was like 'aw'. Later I went to university. There were lots of others in the class. It was a class with labs and we all had different numbers. The teacher guy was calling out names and said ""Izzy"" and I said ""yes"" and then he said ""Izzy Conell"" and I said ""oh... yes"". The other Izzy was 'Connor'. Elijah was there and was sitting next to me. The teacher called me outside. I had to draw/colour something. This teacher/guy came in and the teacher said he was in the wrong place and he left and everyone laughed."
"3543"	"(2010-07-24 (19)) I was at home, but it was on Barlow Way and was different. I was at the end of the driveway and Mom had just left to walk Rover. I followed her up the street to the end of the neighbours and then started to walk back. There was a baby on the road and it grabbed my finger and I couldn't run and it kept doing it and I got angry and yelled. Oskar (our real next door neighbour, the creepy one) came out saying like 'you smacked my baby!' and I said that I didn't. He threw this rock which bounced over the wall out the front of the house across the street and hit the wall of the house (only a small whack). He sat down on this chair at the front of the wall in front of his house and said 'you left my baby on the road' and I was like ""What the hell? You did, it's your baby, not mine"". He just sat there calmly and not listening to me. I spoke calmly and said ""she wrapped her finger around my thumb and it was like, if you were working and someone was knocking on your wall every few seconds it would drive you crazy"". Suddenly, he was enlightened and apologized. I told Mom about it alter. We had basically become 'friends' now (ie, they wouldn't dob us in etc). It started raining and we hid out in my car. There was fog and I took a photo with my phone."
"3544"	"(2010-07-25 (19)) I had changed my Facebook status a while ago. I had released a book and I had said that I got an e-mail about it and I had been like 'what the hell, oh that'. Seamus said he had gotten it too and had forgotten who I was. Another status of mine said I had woken up with $55 in my bank account and it said I had spent the rest on sex -- one night stands two days in a row. One of the guys had been black? I think I was pregnant."
"3545"	"(2010-07-25 (19)) Dad, Ezra and I were in a 'new' area. It was night. We heard someone cry for help and Dad went to go check it out. I heard growling ""like a dog"" so I went the other way. It started chasing us. Dad told us to hide and we all went with him. It attacked us and we went behind a fence. We heard water and it started to flood up to the trees. It was a thing for University students to get money. I had another week of work experience at a vet. There were lots of people there. I was in a room with my bag on a chair. They told me to leave it and this guy made me a new sandwich. There was a meeting for everyone which was about 15 people. Some of them were called ""the Down's syndrome's"". Some sat on chairs and some had to sit on the floor; I sat on the floor. There was a chair stacked with sandwiches. I got mine and it was gross, it had cucumber and lettuce. They discussed Dr Horrible, saying that Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion could sing but Felicia Day could not. Someone said she ""started off good then Izzy'd"". I asked what they meant and the receptionist was called Izzy. Later I went to tell them that my shift was over while they were operating. It was a male vet and they had a dog under anaesthesia on the table. The top layer of his skin was off. On Facebook someone said they were going ""to meet Bella"". I think it was Aliyah. Some kid was angry about a Dolly magazine."
"3546"	"(2010-07-25 (19)) I was at dads, which was different. He was watching some show and it showed this guy 'killing' a pig and he was covered in lots of blood and I thought he looked a bit like Michael Palin. Later, it showed him again and I realized it was him and I clapped excitedly and said ""Michael Palin, my favourite person in the world"". I was reading about Jabberwocky and it had been made in 1928 and Michael Palin was actually born in 1914. I was confused about this and was thinking 'I'm sure he was born in 1943'. Terry Jones' real last name was Chalice and he was born in 1914 too. John Cleese was born in 1911. I couldn't remember Graham Chapman's name, but then I did. Dad cut my hair and then gave me this red and orange wig to wear. He was wearing one too and was like, in drag. I left and my car was American. Obama was around outside and I asked if anyone ever didn't recognize him. He said one time he had said hello to this black Christian lady but he had sung some religious song and she had said that he was a good singer and that he should join their choir. We laughed and he said it was embarrassing. I left and was having trouble driving, though I had driven the car fine in the US. The road was full of boxes and I drove over them. I saw one with Tom Conell on it, from January. I pulled over and took another car. I got home and I asked Mom to take me back to get the car. She said no because she was babysitting. Darren had the baby and it was called Kaylee and he said he would take me in a minute."
"3547"	"(2010-07-26 (19)) We didn't own our house. It was different too. They were designing a new house? Mom, Darren and I went out the front. It was night. There were two of these long things together (I think it says pole) and we took photos outside with it."
"3548"	"(2010-07-26 (19)) Mom and I were watching The Terminator on Blu-Ray, but it was different. I said it looked good and Mom said she preferred it ""old school"" and I said I was going to say that. She said it felt ""more candid"" and I said 'yeah, Blu-Ray is too stylized' and then ""What do you call it when they make people pose?"". Also I was with Dad and Ezra and I wanted ice-cream but they forgot me and told me to go out and get it myself. Some others and I were on the run. We didn't know each other before this. They kept getting killed. I liked a few of them. There was a guy called Dave and he was interested in this girl. He was nice and I was thinking that I'd like to get to know him after this. Then it was night. We were outside and we took the train home. All the lights were off and we quietly moved around the carpark. We saw someone and someone said to try and get into a car. Someone picked up a log and smashed it into the window. This girl ended up getting a bit in the corner and it broke. We opened the doors and got in. Dave was on the driver's side and the person got him and he died and fell out. We locked the doors and the girl got in the driver's seat and we left. We got to some building and I said ""I keep thinking I'd like to get to people and then they die!"" She went to go to the toilet and there were lots of mirrors. I thought something was up. She was getting attacked by River (Firefly). I got a knife and she threw these spinning spiky things. I had this thing which looked like a pen but it had a soft bit at the end which vibrated and I used it to disable the thing she had thrown. She left the girl to attack me. I pushed her into an elevator and called to the girl and she disabled it and closed the door and I sent it down."
"3549"	"(2010-07-27 (19)) I was watching a movie/TV show. Aidan Gillen was outside and there was some song he danced to. I said that it should've been Santa Maria. Mom was watching too and I said ""that's the main guy in Queer as Folk UK. Gale Harold plays his character in the US version""."
"3550"	"(2010-07-27 (19)) There were zombies. I was in a shop with others and we were living there (it was just a food store). There was this cereal with blue cockroaches in it. Then I time traveled and Mom and Dad were there and they were young. I had to make them meet each other. Then I was back with the zombies and we had to leave. This guy and ran toward this forest. There wasn't much space between the trees when you got down far in the forest. The zombies were fast, but if you touched them they would pretty much crumble. We ran into the forest and hit them with branches. It started getting harder running between the spaces. There were heaps of zombies in there and we killed them all. Some wandered over to us and let us try to kill them but I couldn't stab through them. We eventually got them though. We had gamer-tags (like on X-Box 360) and one guy was called Erik-Sto (Erik Stolhanske) and he would get dares. Someone dared him to go back to this original tag and he said he was actually Michael Jackson. Then I found this community and I was staying with them. Jared Padalecki and Genevieve Cortese were getting married and everyone was outside the 'borders' and they spoke quickly, kissed and then everyone went back in. He broke down and cried and said ""it's not happening"" and she asked ""us?"" and cried and she said ""no"" and she cried out ""forever?!"" and he said he was dying and probably had about 6 months to live. One day it was really hot and the curtain was open and bright light was shining in."
"3551"	"(2010-07-28 (19)) Ezra and I became door-to-door salesman for fences. A guy bought some from me. Some lady's husband had gotten leprosy from a friend who went crazy. He didn't recognize anything and was basically a vegetable. I had gotten famous for some reason. I had Twitter, and a tweet of mine was rated the 5th most popular tweet. I had lots of others in the list too. Dad had some too. There was this group of guys that would get people pregnant and then you would bring the baby's and they would rebirth it? I went to one place and Eric (True Blood) and two other vampires were there. They were holding someone, I think. The person they were holding was trying to convince them to let them turn him. I told them not to do it. Eric got angry and went close to me. He liked me though, I think, and he punched me in the face. Then I was Sookie (True Blood) and there was a close-up of her nose. Pam was there too and she said ""it only takes a bit of blood"" (to excite them). Sookie said ""well, it's coming"" (as in, her nose was going to bleed)."
"3552"	"(2010-07-30 (19)) I was at an ice-cream shop. Mom and I went there to get this drink like an ice chocolate, then we got another. Then we went back for another one, but I changed my mind. Later I was at this place involved with animals (maybe a pet shop). There was a snake in a container and I asked someone what to do with it and this lady said I couldn't do anything with it because I didn't have a snake license. Later I was at university in a lecture theater. There was a big storm outside so heaps of us were sleeping there. This lady said the whole world was going to flood. Two of the teachers slept in another room. I saw water starting to come in through gaps in the wall. I went to the other room and the carpet was slightly wet and I told her what was happening. She came to look and it stopped raining. We ended up leaving at some point. There were crazy people with long hair we had to watch out for (I think everyone with long hair was crazy). We were trying to work out where to go, etc. I can't remember the journey, but this girl ended up with a backpack and was leading us, which I was annoyed about. We ended up in this shop and we went into the elevator. These two crazy, long-haired Asian girls came and started singing some pop song and we kept hitting the close button. Eventually someone came and distracted them and we went up. They came up the stairs and we went down a level. Some others were already down in this place. I followed, crawling along on my stomach. These people went up the stairs to a little section (not another floor, but like a balcony), but they saw us. The girl who had been leading us was called Izzy too. This girl with the other people asked for ""Izzy the Leader"" and asked who I was, ""Greek?"" and I said ""no"" and she said ""Izzy the Not-Greek"". She got a box for the other Izzy and I guessed ""dead rabbit"" and it was actually a rabbit toy, but it was screwed up. The brought a box of mine and I said ""oh no, not Grey"", but Grey was still intact. Calvin was there. We joked around and he asked if I knew ""two lesbians""."
"3553"	"(2010-07-31 (19)) I went to Chicken Treat for a work trial. There were no ""shifts"" (which actually meant places to work). The lady in charge didn't seem to care. She suggested putting me in charge of the ""Harry Potter section"". I said no and that I had other stuff to do anyway. I got in my car (in an underground like carpark) and was directed out. I ended up in this other bit of the shop, now on foot. There were 'forums', which were these little rooms to the side. There was one for Das Boot, Harry Potter and down the stairs was a new Joss Whedon one. Everyone was excited about the Harry Potter one. There was nothing of Joss Whedon's in his one yet. I called Mom to say I was trapped in the shop. I squatted over a bin and peed. I apologized to the others and put a towel in it. This guy opened a door which let us out. Mom was waiting and she had caught a taxi. I went off to the car and she came along saying that some guy needed the taxi so she let him take it. There was a big cruise ship parked next to the shop too (in water)."
"3554"	"(2010-08-02 (19)) I was at a party, which I think was at my place. My boyfriend was Josh Radnor and we kept sneaking off to have sex. He kept slipping into a dream and I told him to do a reality check if something was weird. In one of his dreams, he was in a room with me and I took orange juice out of the fridge and started drinking it. I disappeared and he couldn't read the words on the juice box, so he did a reality check. When he woke up he asked me about lucid dreaming. Someone warned him that he could get addicted. They used me as an example and I said I did it as a hobby and I wasn't even good at it. Someone said about Christopher Nolan, ""spending 3 years to make a movie"". There was a tape of me when I was 2-4 with a psychologist. I hadn't seen it before."
"3555"	"(2010-08-02 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop. Ezra saw this spiffy Snorlax figurine and wanted it. I went to the back of the store with Rover and Mom and crawled through this maze of chains. I went back and Roland was there talking with the Indian guy who worked there about something. I had forgotten my socks so went back to get them. I went to the old house for a pizza delivery. There was a half dead magpie lying flat out on a branch on a tree near the garage. I said we had to take it to the vet, but it started flapping and squawking and scared us away. There was blood on it. We left and later Ezra was on MSN at the old house with Roland and others. They were making fun of me."
"3556"	"(2010-08-02 (19)) I was in the US on an exchange. I was walking down the street and saw Raquel and she asked if I wanted to come to the lake tonight. I said no. I went through a park with a lake and it had fish in it. I dipped my shoe in. I started back and it was around peak hour, but it was called something else like 'drinking time'. Everyone was rushing back. The school I was staying at had a 'hotel' lobby. There were four elevators. Others were waiting. One came and it was like leathery and wobbly. A woman said 'do any of you bother to help it before pressing the button? No? You die'. Someone joked about it going down and setting on fire. I slowly worked my way down. Each level was open. I got onto one level and a dark skinned adult guy was in this office. He led me to the woman's section on the third floor. A lady accused me of having stolen goods? I said I only just got the key for this level."
"3557"	"(2010-08-03 (19)) Dad and I had gone to this place a bit far away and a guy had given me a good haircut. He had asked us to take off our shoes. Then Mom and I went and he said 'no pants, shoes or shirts'. Mom started taking off her clothes and we saw some customers with clothes and I questioned it. He pushed us into some water and Mom pulled him in too. I was under a bit long and took a breath and choked. We got out. I had a boyfriend who looked like Bill (True Blood), but had a different name. I was thinking that a guy had attacked him. Now I was at 'home' and he passed out covered in blood. I called out to this guy to call an ambulance and when I looked back in the room, his face was completely bloody and he was dead. I went to the phone and dialed 911, then realised I was doing it wrong and got my mobile. I said I needed an ambulance and that my boyfriend had [whatever happened] and another guy had been involved. A girl there asked for me and she said her name was 'Rob's daughter' and told me Quincy was dead. Then she was there and in the room with me, as were Darren and another woman. She asked if she could tell her and I said yes and she told her and Darren at the same time. I went back to my boyfriend and waited for the ambulance. This family came. I said I had to go to the toilet, but it was open and the seat and wobbly and I couldn't go. I went back to Bill. I checked his pulse and temperature and noticed he was still alive. The girl from before came and she started saying all these weird things, then Bill woke up and was like 'you're fired' to me and the girl smiled. Then he pushed her out of the room and grabbed me and kissed me. He pushed me to the floor and we made out. Then I mentioned he was still covered in blood."
"3558"	"(2010-08-03 (19)) I was in a car with three girls. Then I was in media and Mr Billings said 'you should be in math'. We were watching some movie on DVD, but there were lots of video tapes there too."
"3559"	"(2010-08-03 (19)) I was with two guy friends and I liked one of them and thought he liked me too. We took a photo together. They took my clothes and left me with this formal dress, which I put on. Mom asked why I was wearing a dress and I explained. I chased after them. There was a mannequin wearing clothes and I took a plaid jacket. The other guy was joking about it, but being mean, then he said he wanted to have sex. Then it was a movie. Beckett (Castle) was me and he shot her and she ran off. She walked through this door and said to the police ""I'm shot"" twice. Then someone walked up and it was the beginning of the movie and they asked these people about it. At some point, Rover was eating pumpkin soup. There was a place with a bathroom with something soapy."
"3560"	"(2010-08-04 (19)) It was the future and it was very dystopic. I was with a girl friend and we were staying in a house. While we were out, we came across two other girls. They said they were 'good guys', but we realised they were lying and had this green rubbery thing to put over our hands. They got out while we went looking, but we got them back. We slept and kept our hands on them. Sometime after, they left during the night. It was my birthday and when I woke up, I saw they had left a note. I let one back in. One of them lived at this house. We said she could leave. We went to the front door and there was no back door. There was another opening. We threw something out and there was smoke. It was thick and started filling up everywhere outside. The backyard had wired fencing around it. We tried to breathe and choked. I ran in and grabbed scissors and cut the wire and it started to go. My friend went to the roof to fix the air filter thing. I saw other people on another roof."
"3561"	"(2010-08-05 (19)) I was on an exchange in the UK or US. I was hanging out with some people, including Calvin and Tiana. A bunch of us went to this place to vote for stuff. We got poster for what we voted for and waited outside. A plane was going to fly above saying what got accepted. All the things we voted for were accepted. Calvin, Tiana and I went to this cafe place. He ordered a vanilla and chocolate thickshake. My water bottle was almost empty. I sat with Tiana who was upset and he brought the drinks. I was then at home, but it was the old house. I was watching Entourage and Vince had a Swedish girlfriend called ""Kiri"" and he was lying in bed and she was going down on him. She was going fast and it was very graphic. He told her to stop and she said ""it looks so real"". I thought she meant his genitals, but then she said 'who is it?' and I think she was referring to an affair he was having. Dad commented on it later. Eric had a tumour or something and Sloane was upset/angry with him. He was driving and helped some family get to and from hospital. He pulled out on a busy road and a car nipped him. He continued driving and a huge pile-up started happening. There were flashes as he drove towards it. Then it showed him in hospital and his face and ears were messed up. I wondered if that was the end of the show."
"3562"	"(2010-08-06 (19)) It was night and it was spooky. I went to this Chicken Treat somewhere a while away. It was more like a booth than a store and there were two girls working there. I was walking and ordered at the speaker in the drive-thru. I was given this 'key' which was like a bullet. I ordered a chicken dinner, ""with nice peas and chips"". The girl serving said she didn't recognize me and I said I wasn't from around here. I kept looking around nervously. Then I heard a noise and it was coming from the top of a hill some way away. I realised it was zombies. It ended up getting close and was making gurgling noises. I went into the booth and one girl complained because it was cheating. I asked how it was cheating and she said that it knows where we are now and ran out. It chased her. The zombie looked like it had bad effects. When it attacked, it had this '80s' glow around it. I ran the other way. More zombies came. I kept running and ran into a house. I held the handle of the door up, and there were two doors, but only one had a lock. Then it was ages later and it was now a movie. The leader was a girl called Pinhead. There was a tough guy called Rook. At first I called them 'Sook and Mal'. We had been living there for a while. We were waiting for a zombie to die, but it didn't seem to be happening. I watched Zombi 2 and complained about Lucio Fulci and Michael Bay to Ezra. I joked that I was going to watch a Michael Bay film and he asked which one and I said I was joking."
"3563"	"(2010-08-07 (19)) I was with some others, including Ezra and a friend of his. It was night. I saw something weird happen, like a government cover-up. We were in a room with a laptop and the webcam was somewhere else and saw something else. People turned up and we shut the laptop off and quickly left. We hid under a ledge when someone was nearby. Some other people were going to hide out in some Native place, but we refused to go. There was a girl called Erin Poor who was about 6 years old and she had killed a girl with a syringe or something. She was there. I was then at the shop with Mom. I said to look for a ""little Chinese man"". Daryl and a guy were outside too."
"3564"	"(2010-08-08 (19)) Ezra and I went for a very long drive somewhere. Then I was at a school. Then it was a movie and a guy went there late one night to drop off an assignment. There was some security and they pointed to a teacher's window. He knocked and handed it in. Then it was day. A girl there that he kind of liked was going out with a mean guy who didn't like him. They told him they filled his car up with toilet paper, but he ordered them to take it out. Then I was at a shop. A guy said to me ""do you like games?"" and I waved him away. It was Michael Caine. He followed me to my car and a friend joined me. It was a red Mazda. There was stuff in it and I said it was probably planted and we drove off. The roads were weird. At one point, the other lane had big chips all over it. A billboard shot out onto a two lane road, but then it was only one lane. Noddy was on it. When I got home, I told Mom that she owed me a lot, ""about $100"" and she paid me $1 every time I said a certain word."
"3565"	"(2010-08-10 (19)) I got a job at Chicken Treat. I went out the back to the girl's toilet and there was only one and a girl was in there. I waited for her to leave and went in. I couldn't close the door and these other girls came in. I found out that the store was a cover and it was some weird sex place. The pay was good. There was a room with food; there were biscuits, kiwi fruit and other fruit. Some girl had been attacked by another girl at a party and had lost her boyfriend. She had a problem because of it. Ezra tried to work out what my job was, but only Mom knew."
"3566"	"(2010-08-11 (19)) It was around 2.30am. I was watching an episode of Six Feet Under. I remember Claire and Nate, and Claire was a bit chubby. I was on my bed, reading a book in the dark. I had an ensuite and saw a creepy shadow. I went to Ezra's room and asked to sit on his bed and read. His door opened a bit later, but made no noise. Then a girl walked by and I tried to scream, but it was barely a squeak. I shut the door and locked it. She tried to open it (she was a ghost). Another one came and the door flung open. She had the shape of a cross on her face in blood. She was a 'star'. They said the star was 22 degrees and there was no nuclear thing, so couldn't develop water on them. I took her to the shop and I waited in the car. She got back and we had to wait at a set of lights to leave the carpark. I said she was worse than Dad to drive with, then said 'no, he's worse'. I was watching Spiderman or something. A guy found this ring to time travel with and James Franco found it and was using it."
"3567"	"(2010-08-12 (19)) Dad decided to leave for our holiday tomorrow. I was packing and was washing some clothes (we were at the old house). Mom said I couldn't pack wet clothes especially yellow ones because they would fade. I realised I had no books on my iPhone, but Dad said he had some. We got to the plane and Dad had the tickets, but the pilot said we needed proof that we had bought them. Luckily Dad had some. We stopped somewhere and Dad said it was 'Nottinghamshire or Ireland' and I said that I think it's Singapore."
"3568"	"(2010-08-12 (19)) Ezra, Roland and I were waiting for Mom. Ezra got bored, so he started driving. He went up towards Woodside, but all the roads were different and long. We parked at a dentist. He walked through and came back out. Then we were at home, but it was different. I saw a guy at the door in the mirror. I hid, but then he was inside. He had a letter. It said I had to sleep with Roland or the ""world would die"" and I said ""screw the world"" and said I wouldn't do it. I asked if he was human and he said he used to be. Then I was somewhere, sitting behind a waterfall. Roland came and was talking to me. Ezra and some douchey friends of his came and they all ended up naked in the water. I got out. A friend of mine was seeing Kevin Bacon and he was ""36 months"" older than her. She had rejected him when she was younger and said she had gone back when she was 3 ""to kiss you"". She leaned over to kiss him and I closed the door and left. Something was happening like in The Stuff. Some others and I weren't affected. Your eyes went blue when you weren't eating it. Ezra's friends asked if I wanted some and I said I did, but then ran off. I walked to a booth and took a cylinder of cookies and cream. A guy asked why I wasn't eating the Stuff and I said I liked to eat 'not so great' stuff rather than eat 'delicious' Stuff. He was hyper and crazy. Another girl there had gotten over the Stuff. People would get mad if you weren't eating it. There was a truck going down the street in the shape of a pig. This guy ran across the roof saying ""I love you, let's never part"" or something. He was an old family friend, but looked old and different now -- I assumed it was from drugs. I went inside and told a friend and said 'you look like a duck'. He was then Gio (Ugly Betty) said 'you told me that before'. He was short and we seemed flirty. Nana was there."
"3569"	"(2010-08-14 (19)) Something had infected people like an Invasion of the Body Snatchers kind of scenario, but I'm not sure if they were taking over the body or replicating the body. I was at Nana's, but it was sometimes school. There were lots of rooms with ensuites. My room didn't have one. Ezra had one, so I went to it as I needed to pee. I was pretending that I didn't know some of them were like that and followed them. They lead me into the middle of this place surrounded by fences. They let lions in there and there was a wooden bit on the door. I smashed it and climbed through. I ran into a closed alley. Nana looked out through a window and I told her to come and help. I discovered that they were killed easily; one was in the alley, so I threw plant pots at them and sprayed something in their eyes. I had a gun and pointed it towards them and pulled the trigger, but there were no bullets. I cracked a plant pot over their head and they shattered. Nana came down and as a test, I hit her on the arm, but nothing happened. We got in a car and locked the doors. I told her to just keep on driving."
"3570"	"(2010-08-15 (19)) I was at university. There was a big lecture in a small room. There was a canteen outside with hot dogs with weird curly cheese. I asked ""how much are they?"" and they said ""$2.50 and 25c"". I found a door that lead to the carpark and there were a few cars, but mine wasn't there. There were three carparks. I ran to another one on the other side of the university and it was book and ocean themed? My car wasn't there either. I went to the last one and found it, but there was no licence plate on the back. It was near a cemetery. I called Mom, but she said she couldn't find the plate."
"3571"	"(2010-08-15 (19)) Dad still lived at the old house. I had stayed there and for some reason I was going to run out when he wasn't looking. I ran to my car and unlocked it, but accidentally locked it and then did it again. I climbed through the passenger side. He came out like 'what are you doing, I made you sandwiches' and I said 'oh, can I have them?'. He brought them out. He posted a thing later saying ""absolutely a big deal"" about when Jayne (Firefly) had thrown a game. There was a card for Mal, someone else and one of me and Simon? Mom drove to this place and parked on the side of the road. They sold silk, though it was actually squares of some other material. We picked up some kids? The eel was in the boot (it was like a hatchback) and floating around. We dropped the kids off and went home, but it was different. It had no doors and we had to slide these wooden things around. We had heaps of old people over. We went to dads and closed off the doors of car and let the eel out and ran inside. I asked Mom if he was inside yet, then we saw him float in. I was in the dining room. I ran down the hallway into my room. I remembered my computer wasn't there and ran into Dad's room instead. The eel came down the hallway, chasing me, and I closed the door."
"3572"	"(2010-08-16 (19)) I was in the car with Mom at a set of lights. I saw some flickers and it freaked me out. When I got to the lights, they turned red, but I went through anyway. The next ones were green. Then I was on foot, alone at night, and ran. I went down a street where people were throwing stuff. I had to go through a house to get back to the street. I went up some steps and couldn't find the house. I couldn't remember where I was and I was thinking it was a dream and saying ""this is a nightmare""."
"3573"	"(2010-08-16 (19)) I was at Nana's and watching TV with Ezra. It was different. A girl and a guy started playing Guitar Hero, the girl was really good and the guy sucked. Ezra didn't speak, but wanted the TV back. We left the room. Dad, Poppa and others were outside looking at something. Poppa did a pee. There were bees around. Nathaniel liked nurses and his shirt said 'Princess Nathaniel'. Later I was at home and I had an email from Myer for an interview and it said it was for 'Asia Pacific' and was just up the road. I had to fill out a form with weird questions like 'why do you like disabled people?' and I put 'strong mental power' and you had to write about things you loved. I told Mom and I said I didn't know whether to accept and she said I should because she would get discounts. I was colouring in a picture of Mario and Luigi. Aunt Sally asked me to drop her and a kid off at a cemetery down the road and I said ""I'm going to be late for university"". There was a TV show with Paul McCartney and he was the love interest of two young girls. David Lynch got some present for me, but Darren had lied to him about something and the present was something lame. He was upset."
"3574"	"(2010-08-17 (19)) I was sitting at a table outside with people from Entourage. I only remember seeing Eric and Ari though. Omar Epps and some others were there too. Eric was a lot shorter than me, so I was pretending he was a kid. I sat next to him and joked that he was lame and moved next to Omar. I accidentally splashed him. Then I was at Nana's and Ezra said they were taking the Cocky home. They were saying ""eat the poo poo"" and I recorded it. I showed Dad later. I was on Facebook and I had a photo of Ezra and Jensen Ackles. Scarlett commented on it and said Jensen had nice eyes. Jared Padalecki was on a photo too. I was watching TV with Mom and Jeremy Piven was on it talking and then it was some show with kids wearing lots of makeup."
"3575"	"(2010-08-18 (19)) I was at Nana's with Dad and Ezra. We were watching TV and something came on saying ""Malcolm, the bad cop(?)"". The presenter changed and something was 600px wide. We were eating food and there weren't many chips and this guy and I ate them all."
"3576"	"(2010-08-18 (19)) I was friends with Ted and Marshall (How I Met Your Mother). Neither of them were dating or married. We were at a house and I was lying on a bed with Ted chatting and Marshall was in another room. Ted was flirting with me. They both liked me, but I was supposed to end up with Marshall. There was a lot of stuff on the bed and I saw something eating some maggots and I jumped up screaming 'ew'. Ted grabbed them and put them in his mouth, joking. I was grossed out and screamed and ran to the room where Marshall was. Ted had followed and Marshall asked what was wrong and Ted opened his mouth. I ran out and then Marshall said I had a bloody nose and I grabbed a tissue and held it to my nose. He said to Ted ""help her"" and I said it would go away quickly. Then my friend, who was a dog but not, went somewhere. I was driving on my own through a school zone and there were lots of lollipop men and kept sliding into the other lane. There was a Russian lady and she said she was going to learn the rest of English today and mentioned something about movies. There was something about the French and one of her lovers being somewhere. Then I was with Ted and Marshall again. They were throwing sprinkles at a board which revealed something. The Klowns from Killer Klowns From Outer Space were around. Someone was poisoned and I got to level 3 of 5 for something. I went into a room with a boy and saw the Klowns coming out of hiding. I was going to run, but decided to help the boy. I attacked the Klowns and ended up in a mirror. My dog friend, who looked like a person, came in and I banged on the mirror and told him to get out. He ducked out the window and I was then on a train? The dog had to tell them where I was and they found out eventually and came back for me. Then I was watching the real How I Met Your Mother and it showed Robin and Barney years later. She looked old and not like her. They had a one night stand."
"3577"	"(2010-08-19 (19)) I rewatched The Dark Knight and it was actually good, but completely different. There was a scene where some rocks flew to the ground (it looked like a meteor shower) and it was then real life, and there was a long patch of grass where I was and Mom didn't get it as nice. A building flooded and we had to get out and managed to. But then something was happening everywhere and this guy, who I think was my boyfriend, and I went to dads, which was different, to find stuff to use. We had been told to keep towels and pillows on us and they were hard to carry. I found these pink/red net stockings and put them on. Extra clothes also helped. We couldn't lock the balcony door, but figured it didn't matter and left. It was night. The people next door were having sex. Then it was years later and we were both teaching at the same school. We had two sons and I said ""ok, don't listen to us"" during an argument. I was annoyed that we had 'normal' kids."
"3578"	"(2010-08-21 (19)) I was at the video shop in Parkville, but it was different and organized differently. The foreign movies were separate from genres. I was in an English aisle and found Yojimbo and Oldboy there. I grabbed them and then remembered that I'd seen them and put them back. I was looking for Paris, Texas. I found a section which had all season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and said ""I wonder if there's a Joss- [Whedon section] "" and then saw there was. There were two other girls and they wanted 'Keeping Julian' and there was an exchange which I can't read, but has something to do with Firefly, and then we stared at something in amazement and discussed how awesome Joss Whedon was. Then a guy called out to one of the girls and they asked his name and he said ""Big Tuna and I laughed, as well as the others. Ezra and Dad were then there and I was thinking that I should explain about Jim and Andy's tuna joke from The Office. I got my phone out to record them and they were just saying jokes from the show. Then Will Arnett and Amy Poehler were there and got up to talk. There were two guys and they did a competition and the one that lost said the other guy cheated, but went along with it anyway."
"3579"	"(2010-08-22 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I went to Aunt Sally's, but they weren't home. Mom and I went out the back and I threw a towel in the pool and then remembered this wasn't our place. We snuck out as they got home. Bryson saw us and asked what we were doing and Aunt Sally said 'mind telling me why there's a towel in the pool?' and I said it was like that when we got there. Then we lived there. Dad just got home and Ezra forgot to put the dishwasher on (so Dad could make dinner). We walked out the front and my car was in the middle of the road. This cop looking car drove 'over' it and pulled up across the road. I angrily shouted and the guy got out and just smirked at me. I went over and kicked his car. The other neighbours just went in and told Dad, so he came up to the car and yelled out and then went out. He said he was trying to fix it and it was totally screwed. I started crying and said I was a university student and wouldn't be able to attend now. I asked when I could get a new car. There was a musical called 'Uberletzen'."
"3580"	"(2010-08-22 (19)) This alien girl had a container full of white powder. She had killed some people. There was a red pie with strawberries and the alien loved strawberries. The red bit was blood from some people including her mother. I told Mom about it and she was like 'meh, if this was your Mom's blood and you were eating it, it wouldn't bother you?' And I said ""not really"". The powder stuff was a portal to her planet? You had to put something else in it. It was all white, though some had red, but it hadn't mixed. The alien's skin came off and was scaley and hard and took the rest of it off. She went to her planet. It had those rock formations like in Enemy Mine. Then the portal was in a ship. I went there with the girl, who I think was Leilani (from chemistry) and Eugene, who was my boyfriend. They wanted alcohol but no-one had ID. I called Mom to bring some and tried to explain where the place was. There was ice-cream and one was like a giant pizza and then some single ones -- one was on a stick with chocolate 'balls'. There was a step going down and if you had the stick you would fall into another planet/world? The shop was called Greacy Bacon and the spelling annoyed me."
"3581"	"(2010-08-23 (19)) I replied to an ad for a job at Bunnings and was hoping there wouldn't be a group interview for it. Then I had to do some assignment. There was something about Nintendo and someone asked this other girl and she said that she'd been playing Nintendo 64 since she was young. Then they asked me and I said ""60% N64 and 40% PC"". They were like 'wow, N64 wasn't even the highest'. This guy was called Mike Spencer and he sat on a couch. Mom was nearby and I felt uncomfortable with her listening. I had to go down a level and had to do an interview with Mr Billings for some hospital thing."
"3582"	"(2010-08-25 (19)) I was at a school. A guy and I hid in a closet in a bedroom. There was a monster and it opened the door and sniffed -- its sense of smell wasn't great, but it had good hearing. It left and it went into a classroom and killed everyone within seconds. I hid behind a bench but it saw me. It was right in front of me, but killed this other girl and then left. When I left the room everyone else was alive. It was then the end of the 'movie' and supposedly only virgins could see it and it left them alone. It was black and scary looking [possibly influenced by Ten O'Clock People] ."
"3583"	"(2010-08-26 (19)) Ezra was still in school -- at Koondoola, but it was different and like a boarding school. Mom and I went there and there was an underground carpark. There was a guy putting white square stickers on cars, like parking tickets. We went in and the rooms were all scattered. Ezra's was in a room with around 6 other beds -- 2 of them were bunks and he was in one of the lower ones. They had lots of chocolate and stuff. They were rocky road with nuts and they tasted cheap. I had to get permission to leave. There was a walkway outside and each side had a bench. Some people were playing 'soccer' and you had to throw the ball under the bench. People kept trying to catch them. I was playing as well and a guy on our team could stop time so we were doing well. Then it was the olden days and there was a 'race'. They wouldn't let Ezra in for some reason but he could come in at 11 if he got permission. There were timers with big numbers on them. I asked ""This is the 20s right?"" and said they looked the same. There was a big Jesus statue underneath the city of Bangkok. Then I went to a school and my room had photos from Comic-Con there. I paused the TV and it was a scene with Mal (Firefly). There was a guy with makeup on his face and someone said he looked ""paler than normal"". Everyone looked tired. It made me think of SG (?)."
"3584"	"(2010-08-27 (19)) I was pregnant and on my honeymoon. I was about 5 months pregnant and had five kids. I had sex with the guy at some point. There was a bed somewhere in an open area. Danny Devito was there and I took a toothbrush out of the bedside table and put it in my pocket and then I left. He went to look in there when I came back. Then I was with my kids and we had a live-in nanny. Then, in an unrelated part of the dream, I was walking home late at night. It was really dark and there were others walking along the median strip. A little black kid ran past me with a gun, then turned back around and I rolled onto the ground. He shot at me and when there was no traffic, I rolled away. It was pitch black over there and I kept walking. I ended up at the train station and the next train was in 5 minutes. I got my phone out to call Mom to ask if she wanted me to get off at Centerville and she'd pick me up from there. A kid -- possibly the one from before -- gave me a ruler. I said ""what's this?"" and he said ""a ruler is a ruler"" and I replied ""yeah, but why are you giving it to me?"". He also told me that Kinski (Klaus) was in the bathroom and was going 'oh, oh I love you!'. It turned out he actually meant Stellan Skarsgard. I knocked on the door and we went in. He was alone. When he saw me I tried not to laugh -- we knew each other somehow. I heard a noise and went out and the whole place was covered in bubbles. It was flooded up high too? There was a guy with a dog and I took a photo. The dog was now Rover and I went up to him and took more photos. A blue van with bubbles pulled in. Mom was there now."
"3585"	"(2010-08-27 (19)) I went driving after midnight, going 90km/h on a 50km/h road. I slowed down because I was out so late as well as speeding. I got to a house which was like an apartment. I parked my car and could hear sirens and I called out ""Ryan!"" and Ryan Kwanten and Rutina Wesley were on the balcony and he called back to me. I said we had to go -- the cops were coming for him. He came down but the police got there and I tried to drive off, but couldn't. They asked where Ryan was and I said I didn't know where he lived and they eventually let me go."
"3586"	"(2010-08-28 (19)) I was planning the order of countries to visit on our trip to Europe. I was talking with some girls who said it was hard to take different airlines because of weight limits. I went outside and I had money on a brick wall. A girl walked past and told me to be careful with my money and then took some. I chased her and took some back. Some of my stuff was also on the wall -- a shirt and a pair of pants were folded with a gun on top. A guy next to it had a gun too. I walked past and looked back and he was pointing the gun in the other direction and would randomly shoot. Then he turned my way and I dodged a bullet and ran. I ran into a building which didn't have many people in it and went to the back room. There were some kids in there and I locked the door. I went to this office out the back locked myself in there, but somehow saw him smash into the other rooms. I broke a wall which lead to the entrance and ran out with him following me. Then Meg Ryan wagged a wallet in his face and he took it and left me alone. I thanked her and she said 'no problem, my father blah blah blah' -- she was a rich girl. There were cars burnt under the sand. I tried to take a photo of Simba but my phone froze and I complained, saying I needed to get an iPhone 4. I ended up with Jessica (True Blood) and her toes turned purple and this big muscly guy said ""toe toe"". I told her she had to get somewhere. There were people around that were like Sims and had wishes that you could complete. Jessica's one wouldn't complete and her new mission was to have sex with Tara (True Blood) and 7/10 fantasies. I dragged her into this place and said 'she will' and I heard a 'buh buh' sound."
"3587"	"(2010-08-29 (19)) I was watching Entourage. Vince was offered a part in a porno. Turtle didn't want him to do it. They went to this drug dealer (who I think was the director of the porno) and pretended to want drugs. One of them said he liked liquid. The guy said he could do that and took his belt off, tied it around his neck and vomited (off-screen). Ari was on the phone to Lloyd and said ""your dream came true of me being blown by space monkeys"" and Lloyd responded ""Space monkeys?!"" and it had something to do with a porno with monkeys. Vince did a screen test and then walked away and Eric was relieved. In real life, there was this 'robot' and you could choose its personality etc and then it would just look like a person. The trial version had limited opinions and didn't last long. Teen robots couldn't have romances with adults and some guy did an advert about that. A robot was chosen with 'good, easy romance' personality traits and it looked like Rhys Coiro. It lay in bed and disappeared after a few minutes."
"3588"	"(2010-08-29 (19)) I was at Nana's, in the dining room (with the bookshelves). She said Dad and Poppa were going to buy a car for me and I saw it drive up. It was small, but white old and only had one seat. It cost $12,000. I said I didn't like it or want it. There was a giant easter egg, in the shape of a bunny. Bryson and Aunt Sally came in. Then there was this 'good' monster, like a giant lizard robot. There was a bad robot too. It shot lasers out of its eyes and we shot at them. I hid in a level 1 room with some others. I ran out and looked around for the robot, but couldn't see it. I said we had to leave now as I ran back in. We went through this other door and we were now up high. We had to walk down and and we were wobbly and had to keep our balance. We eventually got back down. I saw the lizard and a guy went over to attack."
"3589"	"(2010-08-29 (19)) Ezra worked at this place next to a shop with clothes, so Mom often went there. I was somewhere at night and walked home. I was on Wanneroo Road next to Fieldgate shops and there was a speed camera and a booze bus after the turn off. The street was dark and I started to run. I was at a park and I could hear music coming from home -- my kind of music. A trailer was in the way. Mom yelled out asking if there was a guy out there and I said 'no, I'm trapped'. Eventually I got in. She was on some site which had old music playing and they were playing Mr Lee by The Bobbettes."
"3590"	"(2010-08-30 (19)) I was on Facebook liking various pages for Eric (True Blood). One of them involved people answering phones and pulling pranks saying ""we like Eric"". Darren put a cigarette into something [I can't read it, but apparently it shocked me] . Mom went to see Matthieu and he text her asking if the kids were coming because 'she still hadn't shaken off a bad feeling' so I opted not to go, though she dropped me off somewhere first. I was watching Inception and Tom Hardy sacrificed himself and fell through a window. It was in slow motion and it fell onto the road and splattered. Everyone died at the end. There was a bit with Michelle Forbes and some others on a lounge. She had a little coffee with sprinkles etc. She eavesdropped on a phone conversation on a recorder. I asked for a coffee but then saw Coke so asked for that instead because I don't like coffee. Rover was there."
"3591"	"(2010-08-30 (19)) I was driving fast and my car was driving well. Mom was with me and I commented on this to her. There were special lights on a shop to signal the green light, but I couldn't see it and when Mom realized she was like 'oh, you can go' and there were cars coming from the side but I made it in time. We went to a Bunnings like shop. There was a secret bit which had 'heads' and 'DNA' strips of paper. We had been there before and mine was there. I also saw Eugene's. I got some others including someone I knew called Brendan, but it was spelt as 'Brandan'. A fat girl came and stared at us and was possibly security. Then she left. We went upstairs and there was a colourful and quirky shop. There were lots of people and they were all talking to each other. There were books for family trees, but it was like interactive and I put in my name and it came up with The Young Ones. It had silver edges. It cost $1230. I thought I should've gotten the DNA strips instead. I ased why Sarah Michelle Gellar wasn't in there and they said they forgot. I was at Nana's watching The Simpson's. Ezra wanted to watch. Lisa was down in the sewer. I had seen it before but they'd changed it. I had a look to see what movies were on and Life is Beautiful was and I said ""Oh, I love that movie"". Blow Out was on in 30 minutes (at 2.45) so I decided to watch a bit of Life is Beautiful then that. Dad was there too. Poppa said something about the windows and curtains."
"3592"	"(2010-08-31 (19)) I was out the back of the old house with Mom, Ezra and some others. I think Eric (True Blood) was there too. I went to the patio and felt weird and I said to the others I was feeling weird. They came over and someone at the back door was lifted up in the air by an invisible creature. It picked me up too and covered my mouth and nose. Somehow I got inside and locked the door. I was talking to the others and when I went back one of the doors was unlocked. I locked it again. The creature could attach itself to stuff and kept going onto the key and getting side and poking me on the head. I threw the key outside. Mom asked where Cuddles and Gizmo were and they were near the pool. It morphed into a cat and became visible. I went out and threw something at it and it started to disappear, so I grabbed it and put it in the pool. I ran to Cuddles and Gizmo and threw them inside. The creature got on the key again and I got rid of it. Then it was a movie and they brought the key to this house and summoned it and burnt it. They had to choose something and shot at it twice. Someone said not to touch something or you'd get stuck with it again and become 'homeless'. I was then there and accidentally touched it and it showed up again and burnt the house down. A guy stole some secret thing and Anna Torv was undercover laying bricks inside a house. The guy got off to talk on the phone and she stole it. We ran. She unlocked the car for me and I pointed to the guy when she got in. We drove off. There was a Russian lady and she tried to get in the car but I locked it. We drove slowly because we couldn't get the car running properly. Then the lady was actually a good guy and was with a kid, but the kid had died and she was actually a ghost."
"3593"	"(2010-09-01 (19)) I was outside in the street with people from university and some others, including Ezra and Dad. I was driving a high car but had pulled over to the side of the road. I had to cross 4 lanes of traffic and then I missed my turn. I went to turn around and a big truck (with multiple carriages) drove through. I waited for it to pass, but then I was on foot. I looked away for a second and I heard everyone gasp and when I looked around a black car was upside down and completely smashed in the middle of the road. I asked what happened and it had clipped a car. A guy had flown out of the windscreen. Someone said it wasn't that bad and Dad was like 'He was decapitated and lost his hands and feet. How much worse can you get?'. A few of us were a step below and couldn't see as well. I took a peek and no-one was there. It was dark and completely silent. I saw a cop asleep on the side of the road. I used my phone to see and he woke up confused. We asked why they left us and why no-one else was around. We were trying to figure out what had happened when we saw this little blue buzzing thing (it was like round in the middle with two 'wings') hovering just above the ground. We were then in a bathroom and there were two of them. Wherever we were was similar to Dad's house, but different though it might've been his place. Then there was a spark of light and Dad touched it. It sparked again but it was 'nice' and pretty. Then I walked out and saw some monster outside. I ducked and waved at the others saying ""Oh my god, it's Cloverfield!  It's Cloverfield!"". I went into Ezra's room and said 'it's Cloverfield! Don't go past the windows, it can see you'. This other guy was asleep in the lounge room (I think it was the cop). I went into my room and heard someone in the bathroom. I went and told him to be careful. He freaked out and was goin on about Godzilla and I sent him to Ezra, but saw the monster standing at the door and I said to Ezra 'don't talk, it's at the door'. Then I was with different people and at the door was a girl who was part of a cover up. She left us alone in exchange for a 'peg' sometime. She left and I said we had to leave. She found us later though and Eugene and Darius had joined us. At some point I bought a DVD of The Room and started watching it, but it was different. I was laughing at the sex scene with Lisa and Johnny. The flower shop scene was different and there was randomly added dialogue. There was a closeup of the flower shop lady (who was different). I messaged Dad on Facebook saying it was different and ""now it is teh suckz"". There was another new scene with two girls, possibly prostitutes. One went into a shop and the other was annoyed."
"3594"	"(2010-09-01 (19)) I was at Seabird, staying at a hotel. A lady came to clean it. There were two babies. I had met the lady before. I packed up my stuff and there was lots of it. I was on a computer and Dad and Ezra were there."
"3595"	"(2010-09-01 (19)) I'm not sure where I was, but there were lots of people. There was a balcony with a cover. Someone got itchy and there were these bugs which was an 'infection'. We were outside and tried to close the doors to keep it from spreading. There were three doors and one was open from inside (so we couldn't keep it closed by sitting in front of it). Mulder and Scully from The X-Files were there. They tried to get people to sit in front of the doors, but no-one would. They got a girl to go lock the lock of the inside door, but this big dude tried to burn the lock off before she could. I called Mulder to help (Scully was in front of a door). Another guy had a gun and shot at me. Then they were at the other door and I came back. I grabbed a fork and stabbed the big guy in the hand. I ended up with the gun and shot at them. I killed one guy. Then I was in an office with Mr Billings who was writing a report on it. I left and the building was like a university and it was big and confusing. There was an elevator like a vending machine that was always next to toilets. There was a cat. I went to get my bag but remembered I hadn't been at university. I tried to call Mom five times. Then I tried Ezra, Darren and Dad and still no answer. I went on Facebook chat and sent Mom a message to pick me up. She kept saying no and sending me stupid pictures. I had no money and I think she eventually agreed."
"3596"	"(2010-09-02 (19)) Ryan Kwanten was in two shows on TV. He was not the main character in either show, though one was True Blood."
"3597"	"(2010-09-02 (19)) Ezra was supposed to be spending the night outside with some mates and came home early. They had some drinks. There was a girl who had this extra thing on her foot and was a bit retarded. Mom was also there.There was a video of an Asian girl in some water with flowers, but they were actually like beads that she was wearing. An Asian guy took her hand and they walked out. Then I was with them. We went into a building and there were steps to the top floor which was an empty room with two chairs. One had water on it, so I sat on the floor. The guy paid me to dance with him. I went out for a second and this lady came and she was like some government lady and she asked what was going on. I said 'some weird stuff' and ran down. She asked me where I'd been on the 4 June. I said I didn't know. She said someone had told her something and that I was there at some funeral and then went back to my place."
"3598"	"(2010-09-02 (19)) I was making a sandwich. I toasted the bread and was having chicken. Mom went into the kitchen and made three toasted sandwiches with baked beans and ham for im, her and someone else and I asked for one and she said no and I got annoyed."
"3599"	"(2010-09-03 (19)) Dad emailed a photo of him and his friend and mentioned me in the email. Some people were playing Sims 1 and Sims 3. I said my Sims games didn't work and a girl went to put a disc in my computer. She tried to force open the drive and I pressed the button instead. The fans were clear, but were pink/purple colour. Someone said they didn't want Sookie and Eric (True Blood) together and I thought 'neither do I, but I wouldn't mind me with Eric'. Someone on Restaurant City had a restaurant called Fangtasia."
"3600"	"(2010-09-04 (19)) I was in India or something. The father of some girl I befriended was in this hut and gave wishes. There was a queue, and she was before me. She asked for marijuana and he put his head down and didn't answer. I requested 'gay marriage and legalization of marijuana'. Mom was watching something at the old house on TV -- Rico (Six Feet Under) was talking to a black woman at a bench near the ocean. Ezra wanted to know what we were watching ""Six Feet Under"" and he said ""oh, you watched Psycho"". There were waves in the show and a voice said ""Florida"". Laer I went to a job interview at 9.30am. I was stopped at the traffic lights and a car hit me from behind. Someone got out and apologized but it only left a small dent and I said 'don't worry about it'. I got to the place I was going and went in and all the doors led to this classroom lab type of thing. I asked a guy how to get out and there was a floor 'wedge'. They climbed up this thing on the wall and then walked out the door. It led onto a balcony with stairs. There were some magazines from 1999 with Angelina Jolie on the cover."
"3601"	"(2010-09-05 (19)) There were zombies. I was doing an obstacle course thing. I saw zombies come running through the bush. I ran inside to go to ""the sun room"" which was a classroom in the shape of a sun. I let some people in and closed the door. It had no locks but the zombies couldn't get in. One of the windows showed a classroom with 5 year olds and Peter Krause was there. The zombies came and got them. Then it wasn't a classroom and it was this weird place with lots of people. The doors kept opening and I went around closing them and then noticed that people were missing. A guy there was sending people out to die. Then I was with Mom and someone else living in this small room. I was driving in a Ute with Mom and Darren. It was a Nissan. We drove down this path for a bit which had small trees planted across it. We were marking things down on a map so we knew where exits were. Then we were on foot and there were bushes to one side. Zombies came and we ran. They went back and I was confused, then realized they came from near our room. I didn't have a gun, just some melee weapon. I closed the door and tried to think of what to do."
"3602"	"(2010-09-06 (19)) There was an update on FilmForum to fix a bug that had been around for 6 months. Alessandro had a presentation of some features using movies he had watched as he went and I forgot what I had watched. There was a scene of a movie with Leonardo Dicaprio and Martin Scorsese at a table. Leonardo had to break in, but was welcomed. Scorsese was swearing and talking. The angle changed and someone's head got blown off from ""poison"" and you could see inside like a rubber mask and I thought it was awesome. Later I was with Dad and Ezra to get dinner. It was night. We parked and Dad and I crossed the road. A car was coming and I told Dad to stop but he said he was going to go. I was going to show him the scene after we got food. There was a little path with a fence and a guy asked if we could come with him but he seemed dodgy and Dad said no and he started to follow us and I was like ""Dad?!"" There was a door so we went over there and there was an empty room with no roof. The guy reached over the wall and I grabbed his arm and twisted it -- I was really strong. There was a place called '92'. Food appeared in the corner. I was talking about the scene and a young guy said ""he's gay"" and I asked what he meant and he said Scorsese's character was gay. I said I didn't get that at all and he said he was ""too emotional and human-y"". Mom was waiting there too. There was something about The Virgin Spring and Goodfellas. At the end of Inception, Iko Iko was playing but it was weird with sounds and laughter in the background."
"3603"	"(2010-09-07 (19)) I had a job interview [in real life I had one this day] . It was almost time and I went to get changed and Mom hadn't taken my clothes out of the washing machine -- I had a pair of dress pants and a collared button shirt that had blue stripes. Ezra had a shirt but it was too big. I went and the interviewer was a young guy. There were two other girls there. There was a busy room in like a sports club. He said 'why not come back later today' and there were jobs on slips of paper. A girl took one -- it was something about someone called George looking for a character to play. The other girl took one that was to blow up this sports centre. Stellan Skarsgard was the father of something and a girl said she had finally gotten a team for the place. He called the girl and asked her to abort. She asked someone for something and they said no. It was night. Then I was there and it was day. There was a fire. There was a room with my DVD's, Wii etc and a bookdshelf of my diaries. The DVDs were all burnt and I was like 'not Monty Python and Red Dwarf!' and grabbed my Wii and this other thing. The fire burned out. I opened a door slowly and moved a curtain out the way and the fire got sucked out. I left. The guy from before was walking down the street and said I could have the job. I complained to Mom about losing my stuff, but was happy about the job. I went to Red Rooster and someone blocked out the 's' and they had a weather sign."
"3604"	"(2010-09-08 (19)) I was at school. I had done a lab report but they didn't like my answer for one of the questions. Calvin was there and was going to copy, but I erased mine (there was something about a lion on there) and accidentally erased his too. I asked to go the library and the teacher said mine looked nice and she let us. There was a line to get in and everyone got checked."
"3605"	"(2010-09-09 (19)) I was watching Glee, but it was different and I only remember Kurt. They were in a gym. Then this blue guy was in the shower and a girl followed him in. He covered her back with a towel and covered himself up. A lady had told someone to call their 'dead' parent and say there were problems and secrets? Then Mom was getting her car back and I went back with her. Ezra and Darren went in Ezra's car. I sat on Mom's lap and the door wouldn't close. We almost hit a car who stopped suddenly. Later they went for dinner at Aunt Sally's. I got some Oreo wafer sticks and some chocolate snack out of a cupboard and she told me to give some to Ezra and called him the 'fattest'. I said I was the smallest in the house ""by 4am"" and Ezra said 'you sure' and I said yeah and she said ""3?"". Then I was back home and we went out and got that Asian soup but one had no veges. They were going to give that one to me and I told them to go down and get me another."
"3606"	"(2010-09-09 (19)) I was watching a Youtube video from the 80s. Jason Alexander and Robert de Niro were in it. Jason Alexander said he had a crush on him and jokingly kissed Robert de Niro."
"3607"	"(2010-09-11 (19)) I was at this building that was usually used for something completely different (concerts maybe), but had some event going on for The Room. Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero and 'Steven' were there. Wiseau was wandering around and was lonely. First I was outside and I was going in with Dad and Ezra. There was a huge, empty basketball court. I took a photo and said it was going to be very busy in a few hours. People eventually started to come. We got in and bought a ticket for a photo with Sestero, and got the photo taken. I asked Mom if I'd shown her the 'hi doggy' scene and she said she had watched the whole movie. There was an alternate scene of Lisa in the red dress, it was pulled up over her bum and she was walking weirdly. She walked backwards at one point and was flirting with some guys. I ended up befriending Sestero and he said he paid for a photo with 'Steven' and he got one too. It was like $60 for a photo. 'Steven' was actually an Asian and had a Mohawk and earrings in each ear. There were only three people in his line. I think he bent down and picked me up and could just carry my weight, but struggled and I had to put my hand on the floor to help. Then he left. I looked at the pics and I was cut out of them and the rest were all stupid. I complained to this lady and asked for a refund because I didn't know where he had gone. A black guy had just sat down for a photo and Sestero was going to pay for it. We got scratchies and hung them up and got them later."
"3608"	"(2010-09-12 (19)) I was at a place with ATMs, though it had something to do with 4chan and I didn't know how to use it. I was playing a game with a girl. I stole a car and had to read the manual. It was a smooth drive. People were shooting at me and I had to rescue someone who had been kidnapped by some people involved with drugs."
"3609"	"(2010-09-12 (19)) I was at university and part of one of my subjects was to this group discussion. There was about 20 of us sitting in a circle at a desk and were chatting about the questions the teacher asked us. We did a second one with different people. The teacher lady asked us all to say some stuff and I was annoyed I had to do it twice. Alejandro and Rodney were there. I wondered which group Eugene was in. We all got symbols and mine was a lion, so I got a plastic figure of a lion but it looked like a jaguar. Evelyn was then next to me and Calvin was on my other side. Evelyn said ""what do I say?"" and I said ""... hello?"" and then I sat back down and ignored her. We had to draw something and get the person next to us to hold the pencil. Evelyn drew a house and I held the pencil. Then I ended up somewhere else and I was quoting ""I fed up with this wurhld!"" and make a red button (which was a thing from The Room) and put it in the front of my desk and it bounced. I said ""Thank you Quentin Tarantino!"". Then it was a movie and this guy escaped from somewhere. A guy found him and asked him to tell him secrets and he got him into college. Someone asked him ""Princeton?"" and he answered ""San Francisco""."
"3610"	"(2010-09-13 (19)) I was on a plane and some others and I got trapped in it. Then it started spinning and it was going to be like that for '4 missions', which meant 'years'. Eventually it stopped and we got out."
"3611"	"(2010-09-13 (19)) I had lost weight and when I put my arms to my side, I couldn't feel any fat. I was thinking 'thank god that's done'."
"3612"	"(2010-09-13 (19)) There was some gathering thing at Dad's old house. The pool was iced over. Spaceman and Gizmo were sitting on it. Spaceman's bit of ice fell in and he kept sitting on it and kept dipping in and out of the water which looked funny. Then I jumped in and saved him. Gizmo fell in, but got out at the steps in the shallow end. A creepy black cat stared at her. Some guy decided to make me do a magic trick, so I needed a pair of pants with a zip. We were going to to the shop to find some. Ezra and Dad were there and I decided to go with them instead."
"3613"	"(2010-09-14 (19)) I was in a dream. I was at a house with celebrities including Bill Murray, who was in a coat and hat with glasses. I made breakfast for everyone but I had toast with a really red and tasty apple. As I left, Darius and some others went to the front of the house to get autographs. I got in the car with Mom and Ezra. Bill Murray took the bin back up and I pointed him out to them and said 'that's Bill Murray'. I told them this was a dream and we talked about it. They were very 'real' and seemed to actually be thinking for themselves."
"3614"	"(2010-09-15 (19)) I was at school. Will from The Inbetweeners was there and a girl offered him sex but ended up laughing at him and walking away. Another girl took him into this cupboard. Later, I found them in there and I was laughing and I told a lady who then told everyone and they all came and stood around. Jay had a ring on his end finger. Will came out later and was annoyed at all the people that were there and blamed me. The principal guy was there. There was a short blonde girl and he pet her on the head. She had a slight Southern accent. She put her arm around him and they were talking. They walked together and she said she was the granddaughter of someone's Dad. They got pizza and she ate this white one. Someone found something and asked her ""did you have an exchange?"" and she had."
"3615"	"(2010-09-15 (19)) The best movies of some director had some relation to The Room. There was a movie or something of 3 people driving up a hill. One guy was in a long truck. He stopped because some guy had died. He asked one of the people to bury the body and the other one to drive to go see his wife. The latter one went crazy and caused the road to come apart? Then I was there running down a hill. At the end it was completely vertical and I dropped down carefully. I ran away after and went into a room. There was a small room to the side and it said 'Stop'. I had a feeling of being trapped. There were holes in the wall and glass windows and it showed the front of someone's house. I yelled 'help me!'. A little girl nearby asked her mother 'what's 'help me?'. I broke off bits of something and then this duck was out the back and I was trying to catch it and tried to climb through. I was also then a 'duck'. A woman came out and I said I was human and she said she was a 'blackcoat' and I said I was a 'browncoat'. But she was bad and came after me and I ran. Later Dad and I were at a screening of The Room. Someone sent an email with a ""blood ring"" which was like a ticket. I forgot my shoes."
"3616"	"(2010-09-16 (19)) I was playing a game where you could pay cash to buy a special kitten. Mom had enough so I asked to use her account but we couldn't transfer the kitten to my account. Then it was real. Home was different. The kitten went outside and I heard it meow and I had called it Gizmo. I went out and there was snow. I called the cat back in but the door wasn't locked. I tried to get help but no-one could be bothered. I asked Ezra and I said ""I don't want a crazy murderer to come in""."
"3617"	"(2010-09-16 (19)) I was at university in a lecture with a young girl who wasn't really a science person. We left and Rebekah asked us if we would join her. I told her Samantha had already left and I didn't know where Calvin was. I didn't know why she was talking to me. I was outside and I heard Calvin talking. Some girl fell down a hill and slid into a building and was trapped. There was a 4WD next to my car with two guys in it and they reversed but then had to wait for a friend. My brakes were werid. Then Ezra was in the car. We got to a set of lights and this alarm went off. There were red lights and this robot was up in the sky. I put my foot down and drove. It followed me and I kept hiding in various places. It found me and I blew it up. We were going to hotels and on the top of each one and it was like the edge of a cliff. We would jump down and it would blow them up (but not totally). Then it was a movie and a guy went in and asked everyone to hide him and thye refused because of something he did earlier and he said ""I didn't know you then!"" and they didn't believe him."
"3618"	"(2010-09-17 (19)) I was at Nana's and Mom and Ezra were also there. I had to leave and lots of people were coming there. My car was a Holden V8 and it drove smoothly. I got to the road and heaps of people were coming in. I realized Mom was coming back in and I turned around. Someone was then trying to trick me so they could take something."
"3619"	"(2010-09-18 (19)) I was at school and had befriended this dude who was kind of goth [like Adam Ant style] . He had dark black hair, very white skin and rings etc. Samantha made a joke that I liked him and he had brought weapons to fight zombies with she went with him and when I looked up at him he took it to mean that I liked him and I was jealous. I said 'I was just wondering why I didn't get a weapon. I'm out of bullets'. I was in a classroom and a teenage girl was there and I went to the back and put my head on my desk. The guy was talking to Samantha and asked me if I wanted something and I said 'no, Samantha makes stuff up'. The teacher came and it was a drama class. She told everyone to take their shirt off and trade with the first person they saw. I crawled out through the door and she said something like 'Izzy has snuck out' and I tried not to laugh. Then the people had to change back into their shirts. There was this series of shorts called Window which was about zombies. They were in a few lists. The first one was good and was a bit weird. The second one had two guys in a car on a TV in the background but they were out of sync. At the end there was a 40 second scene which was creepy. Then it was real and we had a room. Then I was in a hall and there was a room full of zombies. A female zombie came into the hall and almost broke down a door trying to get in. We got her back in, but someone opened it up. I had one bullet left. I started whacking them with the gun. I walked to the side of the room and went through the window. Then people were doing an ad for TV with a black woman and a white guy. A guy was filming and kept pointing the camera at her boobs. When they played it back, they laughed about it. Then I was driving and was driving under 50km/h, but a guy was right behind me, so I sped up. Then I was walking but I had no pants on and was wearing bright pink undies. I thought it was a dream so I wished for pants and I looked down and I was wearing shorts. Everything became clear. I was walking around and it was quiet and no-one was around. It reminded me of a One Tree Hill episode [that I watched last night] . There was a path and I called out for Eugene. Because it sounded and felt so clear, I was worried about saying it out loud in real life. There was a big oval and a wind sound, but there was no wind. I heard someone start talking and it was Eugene. [I then woke up in real life because of people talking] ."
"3620"	"(2010-09-19 (19)) I was out with some people who were my friends. We went to Dome and I thought it was closed, but it was open [last night we went to Dome but it was closed] . People were ordering sponge cakes and mudcakes. I felt like a sponge cake. There were cakes on display. Someone I was with thought they were old. It was pink and moist and soft. I took a bite and ate it. I told them to go pay for it. We left and it was night. We walked towards a dark subway and saw a group of dark people coming and then saw some others so I started backing off, but more came and they surrounded us and asked for 'jewellery, money and phones'. I freaked out and didn't want to give up my phone, so I hid behind something. Then it was a weird movie and I got caught and sent down a drain. I hid my phone in a nook and a guy's head popped out of a sprinkler system. A young girl and her father were there and I asked them to get him out. There was a place with insects. I went back to the past to change the future and some were cut off so I cut years with scissors to continue."
"3621"	"(2010-09-20 (19)) I was friends with the people from How I Met Your Mother. Something weird happened and I had to do something and I ended up in the hospital and was told to do this group task and take some medicine which stung. There was a button which I had to press until the pain stopped. I left without the group and was hanging with Marshall, Ted, Barney and Robin. We were talking and laughing. There was a zip lock bag which was a contraption in pants and made it felt like something was missing? There was a show on the projector with a ninja and some other stuff. Then I found a note detailing Ted and I having a romantic moment and we had all had romances? This upset me. We kissed later. Then I wasn't meant to be 'out'. Then there were Nazi's. There was a crowd outside. Bill Murray was an animal thing and showed us the path to get outside but people didn't want to do that. Ted, Barney, others and I went to find some place. We had to line up for something. Then we were at a university. Rover was there but he wasn't allowed to be. This Nazi guy saw him and ordered for someone to put him down. I started to cry and shouted ""I'll put you down!"" and ran off with him. It was Mom who said that Rover was ""the dog""."
"3622"	"(2010-09-20 (19)) There was a girl called 'Repeat Paddy' and she got in trouble at school. I had to talk to her. Then I killed some guy? A guy friend said ""who can you trust?"" and I told her first. Another lady sat next to me and we later asked her to leave. I'd also made a movie about breaking into prison. It had something to do with her and I had to get her to sign some stuff saying there was no resemblance between her and the person in the film. I went to some guy's house. Outside there was a row of movies and they were all IMDb Top 250 movies and were marked off if they'd been sen. They hadn't seen The Great Escape and I said ""they've never seen The Great Escape"". Ezra and Dad were there. Dad parked Ezra's car right on the edge of this 'cliff'. Ezra bragged about his car to the guy."
"3623"	"(2010-09-21 (19)) There was something to do with kissing. A guy had been bad to his girlfriend? We told him off. A guy paid over $800k for a girl and someone said something about me. Owen Wilson was looking for some girl and four of us hid in a room. He opened the door, which was like a sheet, but he didn't come all the way in and didn't see us. He left and we giggled, but called him back and the girl came to see him and they united. I saw a car and realized it was Eugene's and saw him in it. Later, I saw his computer and wanted to go on it and see what was on it."
"3624"	"(2010-09-21 (19)) I was at a shop with my schoolbag. I realized after a while that no bags were allowed. I brought it to the front of the store and I took my book and pen out. I took a cheese and cracker snack to eat. The fridge had a freezer section with water. I took a guy to see some creatures in it before. I thought it was 2 years ago but it didn't make sense because they were too big to fit. There were ripples in the water and it was vibrating. I asked him if he saw it and he said 'feck no'. He put his face in the water. Then it was a movie and I was this girl and she said ""did you not hear what Manny told you"" and he slapped her. A door opened. Manny left and the girl screamed ""Manny!"". I was watching a video of Greg Sestero on his phone and the acting was really bad and I wondered if I'd seen this before but I didn't think so."
"3625"	"(2010-09-22 (19)) Ezra got a second job, part time at Bunnings. Dad had gotten him the job. I went with him for some reason. There was a 'forest' maze with green snakes and I walked around. I was annoyed that I didn't get a job there because I would get more money."
"3626"	"(2010-09-23 (19)) I was on Facebook and Greg Sestero [who added me on FB yesterday] posted the top 10 movies he'd seen this year. Seven of them were on my list, including Breaking the Waves. I was at a shop to sleep there and went into the wrong 'room'. I curled up on a lounge to sleep. Calvin came in asking where I was. He said ""this must be why you're a girl"" and lay down behind me, though I complained. There were water bottles in a fridge and filled some up. Ezra and some friends were there."
"3627"	"(2010-09-24 (19)) Rover was jumping around being hyper. Ezra was on his knees and Rover scratched his back quite deeply and drew blood. Mom said 'everyone over 18 in 2 years can come to [somewhere] with me' and then said 'I meant just Darren'. Later I was waiting to get on the train with Dad and Ezra. A girl got our tickets, but forgot mine and we had to do something to get it. Then we were on the train. Ezra started to cry. He took his shirt off and showed Dad the scratches."
"3628"	"(2010-09-25 (19)) The Kids Are Alright was actually about a couple where one was from the future and one was from the past. I wondered why I hadn't wanted to see it."
"3629"	"(2010-09-26 (19)) Ezra sent me a message to help him prepare for ""CAR men's"" birthday. I went to see him and questioned him about it. It was a guy he met on the internet? He was also chatting to people for 'sex' which was a joke and some joke about 'the 9 year old inside me' which was some pedophile site. I had email from the guy before. I had makeup for Ezra and was putting stripes on him. There was this Alain Delon movie similar to La Piscine, but a suspicious cop got to the woman. She got him to confess. They were in a bedroom and were on tape. There was also this movie with Romy Schneider and Tom Hanks."
"3630"	"(2010-09-26 (19)) I was at home and we were having this gathering with lots of people. Ezra, Roland and Mom were there. There were lots of other friends of Ezra there too. I went out to my car at one point and a CD deck had been stolen. There were some mice and Ezra pulled them out of something gently. They were all pregnant. One started giving birth and there were lots of little grey mice, some had no fluid on them and were already moving around. Others were dead. I was filming it. There were some that were brown and white, white and grey and black ones. Tigger came over and sniffed them and I shooed her away from them. They were walking in a line. I went into a room and my wallet was gone. I went to the car to put the video on some stereo, but it was gone too. I was angry and I saw a few dodgy people around."
"3631"	"(2010-09-27 (19)) I was at university. There was a room with steps and planks for chairs. My legs were close to the edge and I was worried I was going to fall. I was next to Evelyn. We got put into groups and I was with Eugene and Evelyn. I complained to someone that there wasn't enough room, and Eugene helped me pull out the 'steps' so there would be enough room. Ezra was there and I said I needed socks and he gave me red socks that were like my work socks. Eugene waited for me to continue moving the steps. He asked ""can I add you as a friend on Facebook?"" and I was excited but calmly shrugged and was like ""it doesn't matter, it's only Facebook"". Calvin was in the class too. He made a new Facebook account. The class ended and we left stuff under the seats for next time. I complained about having to ""drive all the way down"". We passed Alejandro and I asked him if we had chemistry labs today and he said no."
"3632"	"(2010-09-28 (19)) Mom was watching an Alain Delon movie and said it was ""very French"". He and this girl were romantically involved and having tea. At first it showed him looking old and weird, but it was a disguise. I said he was my favourite actor and I was thinking he was hot."
"3633"	"(2010-09-29 (19)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. It was night. There was a car behind us but I could only see the silhouette of a 4WD. It followed us. I went through this coop thing to lose it, but it found us. Then we had a few dogs and one was rare. He was after it. I was at this place near the sea. I had just watched my clothes but had to jump over the water and I fell in. When I put pressure on a bit where the clothes were they went into the water and I complained about it. I pretended this guy threatened us because he thought we would turn him in. There was a place which was the first place to let women drink alcohol. Dad got me a drink. I drank it quickly and felt weird. Ezra's mate asked me how to get rid of some drug. It was bright orange and gave you a sensation in your elbow. I just hid it. Then the drug people came asking for it. I renamed the label on it to cough syrup. There was a cinema which was circular and had one screen up high."
"3634"	"(2010-09-30 (19)) I was at a shop with Ezra and he was reversing the car. I was living at the old house and home and Dad's new house. I was at the old house and there was a water tower thing out the back. For Ezra's birthday they had done some experiments? There was an electrical short which affected the tower and brought it down. It would take months/years to fix. I was then at home and I asked Darren how we were supposed to survive summer without an aircon and I said ""I can barely survive summer with an aircon"". There were lots of bits of paper outside. Mom said I had to walk the rest of the way down a hill or the paper would get shredded. I didn't understand but did it anyway. The paper slowly shifted and I took a photo. I asked if this was a dream and she said yes. I went to Dad's and looked for food and movies. I couldn't find anything. He was talking later and said my diary would be affected. Later I was at a house with some people and people were getting killed. I think some of them were my friends. There was a bad girl and I chained her up. Cameron Diaz was eating food in front of her. She got close to her and she attacked and escaped. Quinn (One Tree Hill) and someone else ran up the stairs."
"3635"	"(2010-09-30 (19)) I was playing Runescape with Ezra and Ryan. In 'real life', Ryan, Lloyd (Entourage) and I tried to show Ari (Entourage) we were a good team. We ran to his office. There was chocolate and Ari ate some. There was a car and some girls said it was some colour and we said it was pink. The card said it was pink. I dropped my wallet and heaps of $1 coins rolled on the floor. An old lady was in her car and she gave it away. Then we were on Runescape and there were some new interactions and I was doing some to Ryan to get achievements. One was 'erecting'. People were after some French thing which I had something to do with and they chased me. I was hiding. I went to the shop with Dad and took a toothbrush. We went to the carpark and someone called him a ""toothbrush"". I said I didn't have one and then took it out of my pocket and threw it. He looked for it as we drove out."
"3636"	"(2010-10-01 (19)) I was talking with Evelyn and mentioned 4chan. Eugene overheard and asked if I'd mentioned 4chan and I said yes. I put pictures of Zoltan on Dad's wall. I went to the cinema and there was a sci-fi movie from the 70s I had seen before and it was bad quality. There was a magnetic storm that had been going on for the last 10 hours. We were sleeping almost outside and had shutters on the 'roof'. There were electrical things in the sky."
"3637"	"(2010-10-02 (19)) I was watching La Piscine and some of it was in English. People were complaining because of the way everyone pronounced something, like 'I am teh pool'. There was a scene where Alain Delon was going into the pool and Romy Schneider was going crazy. It reminded me of a scene from Christine and then I remembered that was a different movie."
"3638"	"(2010-10-02 (19)) I went for a drive with Ezra. We drove past a weird abandoned school and kids were in there. We went in and it was a game. We had to escape the kids and find the exit. We were outside and threw something that hit the wall and it bounced off and hit my car. Something got swung around? We went to my car and it was near a big round desk."
"3639"	"(2010-10-03 (19)) I had a boyfriend and we went to a house to have sex. The house was on a weird angle and we were on the floor. He couldn't work out how to get on top of me, though nothing was in the way. We eventually worked it out and we had sex. I kept hitting the wall with my feet. I was worried someone would hear."
"3640"	"(2010-10-03 (19)) I was at a cinema with Dad and Ezra seeing a Twilight movie. It was really bad and we left at one point but came back and it was weird. There was a guy at a table and something screamed like a monster. There was another strange scene with no music. There was a late season of Cheers with Jensen Ackles in it. He was really fat though and I couldn't even recognize him. I was then at some concert place with Dad. Ezra saw an ACDC concert then said we had to see it. There was some Beatles thing on the day after. There was also The Doors, Roxy Music and some others. There was a Tommy Wiseau movie which had something to do with Roxy Music."
"3641"	"(2010-10-03 (19)) I was watching something. Coach Beiste was in it and was a tough woman and she was complaining about stuff. She asked me if someone had a diabetes shot. We rounded up everyone (we were in a shop) and stopped the music to tell people about the diabetes shot. A guy did something near me that made something poke me in the head. She said she was giving away free shots at a place in the city. Some guy was like 'we don't have to listen to you, don't have a medical certificate'. Then she pulled a certificate out and he walked away. I went to talk to her later and this 'village' for all the teachers and students in Glee. She was in this little house. I told her to stop being mean. I said I was a well behaved student and was never in trouble and didn't speed because I was scared of police and said 'when you yell it makes me want to laugh and press stupid keys and be naughty' etc. I said 'here's $100 and 3 weeks break'. She laughed and said ok. Then it was Glee and it showed pictures of everyone on a door of a house. They were all around a pool. I only recognized Rachel and Finn. I was there too with no shirt on. The water started pouring in and was cold. I held something against me and someone said something to me about cold water. I ended up at some fancy house. There was a stage set up for a performance. There was a rope and Rachel swung to the ground and started singing."
"3642"	"(2010-10-04 (19)) I was in an apartment with some girl and we talked about black and white vs colour. The house was in black and white. She said movies in colour looked happier. She painted the floors yellow and bright. A guy came and was angry. We book stood up to him. Then he left and bad guys came. Alexander Skarsgard was there. I had coins in my pocket including some Swedish coins. He and the other guys came in. I tried to get past them and eventually managed to. I had to go down heaps of stairs and they chased me. I hid and then I was with someone else. They said 'assume that someone was looking for us there' so we went the other way but there were people in the bush. Wil Wheaton was one of them. Some other people saw us and we ran. We went into this building and there was a guy and girl with plastic suits on. Linus made a thread on FilmForum about all the movies he'd seen with stats. He'd seen The Big Chill 10 times."
"3643"	"(2010-10-04 (19)) I was at a house. Dennis and Charlie (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were there. There was a lady and I had met her best friend before. She had someone get 'H2O' and I asked her what she was looking for and she said Coke and I said ""I don't drink Coke"". There was a bag of pretzels and a packet of thin chocolate fingers. I was at a table and Dennis and Charlie liked the same girl and I realised it was me."
"3644"	"(2010-10-05 (19)) I was watching Glee. Rachel sang a song that I thought was catchy. Quinn was pregnant again but had slept with two guys. She and Rachel had sex with a guy. It was Rachel's first time and she was annoyed afterwards because she didn't like the guy. There was something on TV about Bobby Vinton and Blue Moon. I was like 'oh I love this song!'."
"3645"	"(2010-10-05 (19)) I went to the park with Mom and Rover. There was a weird lake with a tree and pink flowers on the water."
"3646"	"(2010-10-06 (19)) Darren went to the vet and they charged $225. He was short a few dollars and thought they were lying. Mom also commented on it. I was at university and I had to learn French or German. I don't know where I was but I went to the toilet. I could see the shadow of a person under the door and it was Calvin. I went out and he was talking and joking and a weird troll creature came in. I screamed and it attacked Calvin and I shut the door and locked it. Not all the doors were locked and more came. I ran down and Elijah had a pole and I grabbed one and we flung them away. We ran to the end of the room and there were more sharp, pointy things. There were two others with us and we put ourselves into a circle. There were eight of them. He said each person would get two shots. I was in a room and Darius was there. There was nothing outside, just a blue sky. He said ""that's me!"" and I saw a dog on the bed and I said ""hi doggy"" and we quoted The Room."
"3647"	"(2010-10-07 (19)) I was in a building. Dad had a letter for me and I was being accused of being a traitor. Bill and Sookie from True Blood were there. I was confused about what was going on thinking that I'd done nothing wrong. Bill told me to calm down and she explained that it had something to do with her and letting him into the country by water and something to do with mixing with a werewolf. He said ""oh we did that"". They had to pay a fine later and left the city. There was a big monster that was like a chicken with big wings. It was very big not quite as big as Cloverfield. The front of the building collapsed a little. I was hiding in the wreckage and Eugene was there too and we were dating. There was some kind of bubble that was limiting the air. Dad came and had a lid and we told him to hide. People came and caught him and some others but not us. They drove off in a little buggy. The chicken had made a deal with them to collect people and stuff for it. As they drove off we opened the lid and it made the sound of releasing air pressure. Eugene was confused and I kissed him (just a peck) and touched his face and he smiled. They came back and we couldn't get the lid back on so we just pulled it down. A guy came past and caught us. He had a blade that was short and that he could throw. More came out of the building with guns with other people (there were four of them). They argued and Eugene ran and I followed. We hid in a bush but they found us straight away. We begged them not to kill us and said we would do something in exchange. They had to collect a quota of these broken things that were in the ground. I agreed to do so and the others reluctantly followed. There was a lady at a pub and a guy stole her handbag down her phone rang and she came over and he was like ""Lynyrd Skynyrd"" reading off the phone and she said ""yeah"". He started hitting on her and asked her what year they started performing. She said ""1979"" and he said ""1976"" and she said ""they recorded in 1979 and released it in 1979"". Then they were at her house talking about her music collection. She had something called Ensemble from 2008. She said they thought they sounded weird. They put on one of her CDs. The first song was Rooty Toot Toot, which was catchy and the others were ok."
"3648"	"(2010-10-08 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I saw a character called Jef Costello and I got excited. There was an event on and I clicked to join it but the connection lagged and it didn't work. I found out that it was Alyssa. Her favourite movie was a random Arrested Development movie that I'd just seen. I was at work with Mom. There were lots of rooms to clean. She and Ezra were going to Africa some time."
"3649"	"(2010-10-08 (19)) I was at school. I was getting a reward plus I had $300. Someone told me this was the last chance to redeem. I went to a booth and there were two women. There was a soft puppy toy. They asked me ""what is your thing that no one knows?"" I replied ""I have no sense of smell"" and they said ""oh, that makes sense"". Some girl I knew asked if I wanted a job at the cinema and we went there for a test. The manager called Ezra and he looked like the principal from Community. There were lots of people and lots of food. It was almost like a shop and it had four hotels. There were three people in the food section and there was a table. There was a table with two Adam Baldwin's, but he was young. I was doing bits of the job. I was letting people in and showing them a presentation. I decided something else was better because they weren't drones. There were lines of people at the door freaking me out. No one else had seen them and I went out the other door. I chose a better trick involving drawing lines on the road and one of the ones I picked made people drive around and then have to drive all the way back. I got in a car and a car smashed into the back of another one. I left and was driving fast. I couldn't stop very well. Some of the red lights had speed cameras but I didn't get flashed."
"3650"	"(2010-10-09 (19)) Mom was watching Law And Order. Alain Delon was in it and I said excitedly ""Alain Delon!"" And she was like ""what"". We went for a drive to see an accident but there was a lot of traffic. A guy, who turned out to be a cop, came up to the car and recognised Mom. He said ""what accident"" and that it was over a hill. He gave us paper with houses where we could see it."
"3651"	"(2010-10-10 (19)) I had a boyfriend. I was sometimes with Mom. She left at some point and a guy was after me. I changed my shirt and I was then with Mom and some others. Then my boyfriend looked like Adam Baldwin and there was another guy who looked like a young Kiefer Sutherland. I heard something coming from a shop. Someone shot at me and Adam Baldwin shot back. I looked up and saw Kiefer. I snuck in. They ended up confronting each other and each other laugh. Then it was a girl and someone else. They both took their clothes off to see which one I would go to. I looked away. Someone went on their knees making a retard face and the girl saw and laughed."
"3652"	"(2010-10-12 (19)) I was at a shop. There were aisles of different horror things which I was doing for the challenge. I was watching The Sixth Sense in one of them. Dad was there, as was Leif. One of the aisles at the end had a John Lennon section. I went to and they played his music, though they also played Every Breath You Take. Other people came and were moping. Dad and Ezra also came and I took a picture of all the people. I was then playing a game where you get trapped in a room and you have to try to escape. Some were hard and took me a while. One of them was in a bathroom that was only the size of a toilet. The only thing in the room was a mirror with a cabinet and a big water section. I couldn't work it out and freaked out and started crying and screaming. They opened it and let me out. They said that that one and some of the other puzzles had no way out. I was then at home and had two pieces of toast with jam. I put in another for Vegemite. Mom said not to eat the jam ones."
"3653"	"(2010-10-13 (19)) I was at a Royal Show type of place. There was a rounded pyramid game and each bit had different prizes. You had to run up and grab something and when it stopped you would get that prize. There was one with a coin and you had to drop it in the slot at the bottom, then you had to get it out quickly before it started again. Evelyn was there. My pockets were small. Eugene and I were dating. We were walking around there together. There was a movie with Alain Delon and he was a rich guy. It was set in Il Gattopardo times. He tricked a girl into marrying him before changing stuff around, his clothes etc to make her think it was actually his father who she married. She was angry when she found out and confronted him, but he played innocent and said that he didn't do anything. Then it was back to real life involving someone's family life. They had a superhero costume that was part of a family tradition and they had to wear it every Halloween. I got a stick and was poking spiderwebs to take them off. I heard a ayell and saw Poppa pull up in a car. Poppers was there too and the stick scared him."
"3654"	"(2010-10-13 (19)) Nathan Fillion's Twitter said we was going to be downtown and working at some competition. I told Mom and ended up going by myself. There was a little forest section and a cave. You could pick your name and your skin tone. There were only a few people there and he was in the cave. You could get and lose points. There were some people in charge and I got their name wrong at first but I recovered from it. We hung out most of the day. Then it was night. There were rooms for each skin colour. There was a big square bed where two people would lie from the top to the bottom and two people would lie left to right next to them. Calvin and Genevieve were in my skin colour group and were working together. I wanted to change to Nathan Fillion's group but I couldn't find the people. There were spare rooms and Calvin called out for one and Genevieve was annoyed. Calvin called me over to the computer lab. They sat me down at one and I had a password and the name of a site from Nana. I entered it in and it was a news article about homes and it mentioned Barlow way had been caved in. All of my storage stuff had been there and I started shaking and crying. I eventually left and one of the rooms I passed was Mom's. I thought I saw Nathan Fillion in there and then I heard sex sounds and I was sad because I wanted to have sex with him. I went to his room to look for him but I couldn't tell if he was there. I kept walking past and then turned down a corner and saw Eric (True Blood) lying on the floor. I jumped and he wanted to know why I kept looking in there (it was his room too). I said that I was just checking it for the 'middle guy' and Eric added ""with the big puppy dog eyes?"" and I didn't say anything and he said he moved upstairs. I went up and saw Nathan Fillion there and was happy and then I remembered about our house and collapsed near the door. Dmitri came out a bit later and saw me and helped me up. Then I was still there but in a shop. People were doing Glee type of things and singing and dancing around. I turned off the lights and they passed by. I was hoping to get Dmitri in the dark to makeout with him. We turned off two each at one point and they were angry but they continued dancing to a different song. We then all had to get out of the place as it was collapsing. I got out but didn't see Dmitri and started worrying, but he was ok. Mom picked me up. We drove home and I mentioned the house and how important everything in there was to me and I started to cry again. As we were leaving I had texts come through from her and Dad about the house and this other thing. Dad mentioned something with Robert Downey Jr and said he was hilarious. There was some show with James Gandolfini, as well as The Sopranos. We were 'in' it. His last name was Gunn in the other show and he was a lawyer. I kept calling him Tony Soprano and he was looking at me in confusion."
"3655"	"(2010-10-14 (19)) I was questing on World of Warcraft. It was in space and people were floating around. Then I was with Dexter (Dexter). We were at this party thing and Eliza Dushku was with us. She used to be a dancer at this place with Britney Spears. Eliza and this other couple that we knew would scope the place out for people to scam. Britney Spears had been one of these people and had recognised her but she pretended to not know who she was. She had bruises on her. Dexter and I went around the corner and we pretended to argue and he beat me up to explain the bruises and nervousness and we got into an elevator and we kissed. Then it had been a girl that we were going to scam (Britney, though she was a black girl). We would go up to a random floor, find a room and use that. We got off at the second floor and left the elevator and waited for a family to come out of this room. We were going to use the room across the hall (we had been kept out of there for a while). I went in and Dexter started cleaning up. I locked the door but then he said ""please leave the door unlocked"" and I unlocked it and then this girl came in. She looked excited and happy that he had beaten me and that we had a house, as it meant that her suspicion hadn't been correct. She ran away excited to tell someone. We left the room and went down the hall which was the only way to get to this big area. There was a little bridge that we had to lie down on to get across. He said that next time we should have more of an adventure. He got on top of me and kissed me. I'd told him to be quiet in case someone heard us. I put my hands on his back nervously and he pulled closer to me and I relaxed and we made out. He rubbed against me a bit. It was very vivid and I really enjoyed it. Then I had this creature which would printscreen for me. It was like a little floaty jellyfish that would float on top of my finger. Then it was like a guinea pig. I couldn't remember what I had called it so I called it Alan. I was telling Mom about how awesome it was. I had gotten it when we got Rover so Rover had taken precedence. I wondered how I'd forgotten about it. She said it was because in summer they needed extra cooking and care"
"3656"	"(2010-10-16 (19)) It was Winter Veil on World of Warcraft, but it was different. I was in this white area was covered with snow. There were lots of quests and for the one that I was doing I had to get five out of five different things. There was a mini quest where I needed four of each. There were polar bears to loot. There was something with black eyes and I ran off. Some lady had been attacked by something. Mom and Darren were at home and I was worried they were going around to houses to attack people."
"3657"	"(2010-10-17 (19)) Dad, Ezra, Acquaintance-M-02 and I went on holidays. They bought condoms and Dad said that Acquaintance-M-02 had been having sex with his girlfriend but they wanted to have fun too."
"3658"	"(2010-10-17 (19)) A girl, her brother and their 'uncle' were reminiscing about their father that had died. He used to take them to a spot in the woods with some fish. They remembered about it and decided to go there. The girl went back for something but on her way back a guy slit her throat. The others waited hours before deciding that something was wrong. She ended up being okay. The girl was a teenager, the brother about 10 or younger. I was at a restaurant thing. There were lots of people there and I said I'd been playing this lame song a lot lately then it came on the radio - it was Lovers in a Dangerous Time. People complained and I said it was a good song."
"3659"	"(2010-10-19 (19)) I was at Aunt Sally's. She wanted me to redesign the dining area and the lounge room. They went to bed and I tried to decide what the best thing to do was. She came out at one point and I said I hadn't thought of anything. I was also at work at some point spraying the window on the rotisserie oven."
"3660"	"(2010-10-20 (19)) I was watching a musical and it turned out to be Rocco and his Brothers. It confused me that it was a musical."
"3661"	"(2010-10-20 (19)) I found videos and pictures that Eugene had uploaded of him in his room. He was now in a relationship with someone and I hoped that it was just a joke or something."
"3662"	"(2010-10-21 (19)) Mom and I were driving down a familiar street. There were cops coming down the other way, she turned suddenly to follow them but they pulled up at a closed shop, so she went back. A female pedophile put pictures of Alain Delon and Ashton Kutcher onto toddlers."
"3663"	"(2010-10-21 (19)) I was at school in assembly. They would usually update us on how we looked etc. I got down and this guy said that we would have to sit down differently and everyoneleft he said that's not what he meant and then everyone had to come back. There was a guy on a laptop playing World of Warcraft."
"3664"	"(2010-10-22 (19)) We had a school excursion at another school. For some reason I had to drive there and back three times. The carpark was 'squished'. There was a lollipop man who let us across. I wondered why he was there. I had water bottles and was drinking my third one by the second hour. I went to the toilet and the girl's toilet was only open on Wednesdays (It was Wednesday today). I went in but only a few toilets were in cubicles. Mr Stevenson and someone else came in and saw something in the sink. When I came out he accused me of whatever it was, jokingly. Ms Corbett was there too and said something about oranges and China and 'I thought that must've been why you knew so much about China' which had something to do with something that happened at school. Then I was in a bus. I was at back and Eugene and Darius were at the front. I think they saw me looking at Eugene and they moved to the back. A teacher who didn't like Darius argued with him and I took a photo. There was a big flash and everyone looked at me and I pretended like I hadn't known my camera was on. They moved next to me and I was squished. Darius was talking to Eugene about shoes that he'd had with an 'evil' horse on them."
"3665"	"(2010-10-23 (19)) I was at home and it was different. Mom had a different boyfriend who was younger and sort of hot. He flirted with me sometimes. At one point I was bending over, like leaning forward on a table reaching for lollies in a bowl (there were worms, ice-creams and pineapples) and he commented on my butt 'in the nude'. I was like wtf and Ezra said there was something odd about him too. The guy said he had sex with me in the shower. I argued with Ezra over the net about dreams and aggression in dreams. I'd also had a dream aout some guy with a last name like 'chemoprawn' and I looked him on Facebook and his name was slightly different and it had 2043 on the end. I thought it was weird. He was only 13 though and in the dream he had been 18/19. I did a quiz and there was a question about Eric Idle."
"3666"	"(2010-10-23 (19)) I saw smoke coming from the back of my desk and I turned off my computer and got Ezra. He had a look but couldn't find anything."
"3667"	"(2010-10-23 (19)) Mom and I were doing some test/game and you could die, but you could be resurrected. We were in a place with a lot of noobs and it was almost like a World of Warcraft dungeon except you could get close to the enemies without being attacked. There were threes stages/quests in the area. Someone was on the last one and summoned a huge dragon from the water. I quicky ran out. Then Mom and I did the next bit together. We had to go up steps and we had lots of platforms and steps to go. When we got the end, we then went back. One bit had a bunch of cows fall and then they ran across and one went the other way and I got stuck and left behind. I dodged it on the way back. I drove back and everything looked different. I was in a field where giant needles rolled towards where you were. Then I was on foot and alone. A guy was in front of me running backwards slowly and talking to himself (but no words were said). I ran towards him, but I didn't really catch up. I was scared and freaking out. I got to the 'end' and it said to not open the 'pressurized chest' until September. I felt a slight to open it but then I just wanted to leave. This guy had a white mask on, only showing his blue eyes which now looked red. It was then a girl. I asked if she was real and she said yes and took it off. I hugged her and I thought 'that's weird of me'. I managed to get out. Then, I had a small scooter and was with others who were on rollerskates and scooters. There was a big dippy hill and a girl was there with her daughter. Then a big truck backed up behind us. I warned them to move but it was slow. Then we got to the side of the road and it followed me. I got him to crash into a fence and he found a saw and laughed crazily and started cutting people up. We ran. I found a small deli with weird hillbilly types. There was a four lane road and lots of traffic. I waited until there was a red light and then crossed. A mall was on fire and there was a car with Linus's name and picture on it. I went to get help. Then I was at school. Mr Stevenson saw me writing my dreams into my book. He tried to get it and I snatched it back. Mr Noonan and some others were there too. I was up to April 2008. There was a dream with Dmitri and some girl and they both died, and Alain Delon was on top of something."
"3668"	"(2010-10-24 (19)) I was at some place like a cinema. There was a train involved too. Cam and Mitchell (Modern Family) were there. They did something and Alejandro and I stopped them for a photo. They joked and licked my face."
"3669"	"(2010-10-25 (19)) I was in this dome shaped room in a larger building. People started running to the door, then to a door on the other side, but I couldn't see anything and didn't know what was happening. Someone said that 'it' had 6 legs. I ran out of the place and then I saw all these small dinosaurs running around. I ended up back inside and someone else and I walked to the top of the roof. We jumped over to this thing on the side. A dinosaur came and it was a bigger one and it was blue. We stayed still and it jumped up to me and I quickly got onto this shelf thing. We then ran outside. Ezra and I ran to my car and got in and locked the door. I drove off and there were other people driving away and it was stressful. We went to this shop place sometime later and there was raw fish and the dinosaur things ate it. One came and I threw fish at it. Ezra packed up some and we drove away. We went to another place without the car. We cooked chicken. Two were ready and three had a few minutes left (but they had to do something else with them). Rover was there. We packed up all important stuff. There were mechanical things. We ran out and there was a robot like in World of Warcraft and it came up with the green arrow to get in. This other guy climbed up and I pushed him off. We got in a fight and something big was coming and we went the other way. At one point, I strangled some girl and pulled tight on the cord and it made a bone stick out of her neck. We had a place set up now like a village. At another time, we were in a clan and there was a picture of me with the dinosaurs. I got us out somehow."
"3670"	"(2010-10-27 (19)) Ezra and I were in the car in a carpark. A big dude picked up a car and threw it. Then he picked up another one and threw it right in front of us. I started up the car and drove away before he destroyed my car."
"3671"	"(2010-10-27 (19)) I was on FilmForum. There were two entries for Mr Klein. One with no lists and the other with a static 'worst of' list by a critic. I was wondering how since it won a Cesar award and had Alain Delon in it. I was driving around Northtown and Midvale. There were cops behind me and they put their lights on and I went to pull over but they turned down a side street. There were heaps of other cops and I realised something was happening. I had been going 60 in a 50 zone so thought I was going to get a fine. Midvale shops was up the road from Northtown High School and I ended up at the school. There were job notices up. People kept asking who I was and I was like 'I don't go to highschool or know anyone except Farrah'. I saw Farrah a bit later."
"3672"	"(2010-10-29 (19)) Mom and I drove to university (today). We stopped in the middle of the freeway (which was different) close to university and it was nearly time for my class to start. She had found some diet thing on the internet that Timmy was a part of and she met him and he was with some girl. I realised that I forgot my lab coat and books and I told Mom and we went home and I got my stuff and grabbed a jumper too (I had complained it was cold and she was wearing a jacket and said a book said to make the sleeves shorter. As I got ready to leave, there was some weird stuff and I turned around and Mom was in the passenger seat of Timmy's car and I was confused and she just looked at me. He got in the driver's seat and I went to the car and realised Mom was paralysed and couldn't speak. He started driving off and I opened the car and dragged Mom out. Then I was at the old house. I called the cops and he came and he was like 'how do you know she isn't faking it?'. She kept vomiting. I said I needed him to write me a letter excusing me from university today. Dad was there. I opened a cupboard and found Nice biscuits and 4 square Vegemite things. Dad and the cop talked in the games room and said 'child gets 1.5% of whatever' like in a will, and I was like 'is she dead?!' and they looked at me sympathetically and I went through the kitchen to the lounge room and she was lying next to the long lounge on the floor. She had a cigarette in one hand and it dropped on her and I grabbed it and shook her and she woke up like 'what's going on' and I said 'you almost set yourself on fire, you idiot'."
"3673"	"(2010-10-30 (19)) Ezra, Dad and I were in Russia as part of a holiday. It went back and forth between a movie and real life. The movie was called Watch Out for the Automobile but was not the same movie. There was a guy who was an American actor but I couldn't remember where I'd seen him. Dad said it was Matt Damon and I said it wasn't. There was a nocturnal bird and a kitten? I told Dad to check in on Facebook. Then it got weird and only a certain number of people were allowed on this ship thing. A guy got two more spots for his girlfriend and some girl, but they ended up dying. Then it was a game and it started out good and then you go on a spaceship and it got weird and hard."
"3674"	"(2010-10-30 (19)) I had a concert to go to. I got there and it was in a small room. The ban was called K'Um. I didn't know any of the songs except they played 1985. I wondered why I paid $100 to see this. The guy next to me had the same shoes as me. I left after 30 minutes. I went to the Royal Show and Seamus got a balloon for this young kid. I went to walk out and had to push this woman out of the show and then I waited for the traffic to slow down and walked across."
"3675"	"(2010-10-31 (19)) I was in the UK. Mom was there too. We were staying at this house. I was trying to sleep but there were no curtains on the windows and I had a hard time. I eventually fell asleep but I woke up to people talking outside. Mom and I went to the shop. The checkout was at the back and it was like a deli section. There was a fudge section and 2-3 rows of ice-cream freezers. A lady came up to us with a 1-2 year old daughter in her arms and said to Mom 'do you have a daughter? Why aren't they dressed in school uniforms?' and I said ""I'm in university"". She said oh and I added ""back home"". She still said she was unhappy with what I was wearing and I said we were practically wearing the same thing -- black shirt and black shorts (she was wearing pants though). They were her work clothes. I found a box of dark chocolate Golden Gaytimes in the ice-cream section. I was trying to find a single one instead of a box. They also had lamingtons, but not many. Then we left. An Asian lady at the counter asked what we were looking for and I told them and she said they didn't have them. I called Mom and she drove off and I said 'how am I supposed to pay for this?'. I asked a lady who knew me and she paid for now. Mom went to this house and said some Asian guy had mentioned me wanting to move there and everyone knew. Then I was in some group. We were planning something illegal (but for a good reason). We were in a place that was like a hospital. We saw nurses starting to trickle in and they yelled for us to surrender. River Tam (Firefly) was there and started running and I followed her. There were lots of floors with just beams and she ran easily but I had to go slow so I didn't fall. She led me to this guy and she said 'he's found a cure' and he asked something and I nodded and he kissed me on the forehead. He looked like Preston. He told me to go and I surrendered. We were out the front of this place during the day and the 'police' pulled up fast and in front of this cute cat and I said it was kind of mean. I was trying to work out who would go in what car. Then I was waiting in a car with Ezra in a carpark full of cars. Then there was water nearby with boats. Ezra asked if I saw the guy and I said I did and he was trying to guess what car he was in."
"3676"	"(2010-11-02 (19)) I was at home and I checked my calendar and it was the second week of November and I realised I'd missed my Forensics exam. I panicked and then found out another one was on today. I then decided it didn't matter because I was going to drop out anyway and I informed Mom."
"3677"	"(2010-11-02 (19)) I was out somewhere with Mom. She had decided to take Rover for a walk at the park there. We had my car, Dad's van and Ezra's car. Then Dad took his van. Mom wanted me to take Ezra's car. We went for a drive to find the way to get back without any speed bumps. I was like 'you left Rover alone there, now I have to drive you back and then pick you up'. I ended up at this place where highschoolers were doing yearbook stuff. There were shelves and one was made of cardboard. Ezra was there. Rover and Sam (Supernatural) were there and I was telling Ezra that Mom left Rover behind earlier and Ezra said to the other Rover that Rover was our dog and that he was named after him. The cardboard shelf fell apart. Later, I was at the old house. Ezra was there. There was this thing where something would come to your house if you won a competition and it was saying 'sex'. It was night. He ran out front and a group of people came to the driveway. Our cars were on the lawn. I thought something seemed dodgy. There were people with antlers and some were on the roof. It was hard to see because it was dark. Someone across the street turned a light on and saw them and a girl screamed. I realised some were inside and I went in. They could turn into puddles. I realised they were evil and they turned into puddles on the lino and lit them on fire with a lighter. Another one looked like Spaceman and I set it on fire and there was a note saying 'real pet'. I reset it and burned the other one instead but it didn't work. It turned into a person and wanted to make a deal that it would do something if I let it live and I agreed. I was then somewhere else, inside. Then it was like a movie and a girl went into a bathroom and in the mirror, it reflected this big 'pirate' head (it was like a mask) and it was the leader trying to trick us."
"3678"	"(2010-11-05 (19)) I was going on a trip overseas for school. I can't remember where the first place was but I was also going to Greece for a month or two. I had a daughter, who was about 3 years old, and she was Asian -- I had been dating a Japanese guy. I asked Mom to look after her and Mom said no and I got angry and yelled at her. I said I needed her to because it was too difficult to organise a passport for her. I got some guy I knew to set up the flight for me, but we hadn't organised a hotel yet. I asked Calvin what day he was going for the second trip. Then I was going on holiday, except Ezra and I were going. Dad and I went to the airport the day before. I forgot my shoes and I ran to get them. I went outside and I chased someone through snow which was freezing and I said 'Ocean Reef' and it went back to normal. I tried to get to Centerville Cinema but it was another one and weird. This bad guy copied this gay guy's outfit which was orange and yellow. Ezra and I stayed at a place and watched some weird show. Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and John Cleese were in it. I didn't get to sleep until 3am."
"3679"	"(2010-11-07 (19)) Dad, Ezra and I went to the movies and were seeing a Star Wars movie. Ezra wasn't feeling well. Nana worked there and she offered him a choc top. It was busy. The seats moved and had a tray underneath and I had to reach over and get it. The film started with some ghost train but then there was nothing else. Dad went to go see what the problem was. Stash was there with some boys. The movie just turned into Lord of the Rings. Merry and Pippin were in it and played by the same actors."
"3680"	"(2010-11-08 (19)) My 19th birthday was tomorrow and I had organsised with Darren to find someone to lose my virginity to. At night time Darren picked me up and we drove. I said 'can we pick someone up' and we agreed to go the shop. There was no-one I liked at the place. There were pictures of some celebs -- I remember Nathan Fillion, but he as in Switzerland. A lady showed me a picture of a guy and he was old and had a comb-over and I said 'ew no'. I eventually found a guy who I thought was ok. Mom didn't know about it. I also talked to Leif on Facebook and he asked how much I got paid and I said '$6' and some other stuff. He said 'it's like you almost speak another language sometimes' and I said 'you don't always make sentences correctly' and he was like 'fuck you' and I said I wasn't' being mean and that I wished I could speak another language as well as he could. Linus also commented on something. I went to the beach with Dad and the waves started pulling back and I ran to get away from the huge wave."
"3681"	"(2010-11-11 (19)) Mom was babysitting a kid who was about 3-4. We were at a big house. I was in bed and got up to see the kid crawling around. I called out to Mom and we looked for it. Eventually we ended up outside shops on a road and the kid was right near the road. I went near her and she walked in front of a truck and was decapitated. The body was still standing though and I was shocked."
"3682"	"(2010-11-12 (19)) My car was out the front of the old house (on the grass in the middle). There was a note on it left from these people who lived across the road. Dad left a note about Zalgo and the next day they put Zalgo stuff all over it (like 'he comes' etc). I went to work and Ezra was there. We finished most of it and then we started chatting and I realised I hadn't done the floors yet. I quickly got to cleaning them but the place was bigger and different and there was a small office room. Ezra left to wait for me and Isaak came out. He looked in the sink and asked if I had relatives here and I said no and then said Ezra was here for a bit. He said something about my car and the police. I ran out and there was more writing on it with 'fail' on the door. I went to some place with a bunch of people and some of them were in the group that did it. Everyone put their feet and hands on someone else and a girl asked to leave to take a pregnancy test."
"3683"	"(2010-11-13 (19)) Some guy was going across the USA to different motel. America was in the shape of a square. There was a place with a big shop called Northtown. He got to his final destination where he had a prostitute waiting, who was played by Megan Fox and I was like 'urgh, she's ugly'. Her boobs were big and there was stuff like tea towels between them and then she took her clothes off and then there was a montage of them having sex in various positions. Then he left with some drug people. The cops stopped them and found drugs and I was sad because he was a nice guy, but he had been aware that they had drugs."
"3684"	"(2010-11-15 (19)) I had a university exam. I sat at the front because Alain Delon was there. I finished the exam and went to leave but I went back into the hall and Alain Delon was there out on a break and I wanted to get a photo with him."
"3685"	"(2010-11-15 (19)) There were zombies. It was like a game and we had health and experience etc. We were running away outside. We tried to climb up on a roof which was the shape of a 'b', but there was a zombie there. I eventually ended up in this shop place. A guy ran out to help get something and instead went to lock the police out the front who were dropping people off. I put the lock back (in a book outside and it had a switch like they have for trains). I went inside and this leader guy told us to all go wait at the back of the store and I said 'no, you did that before and all the zombies went there'. Zombies came in and we were ripping their throats out. I cut the throat of an old lady zombie and then yanked out her throat. Eventually there were only a few left."
"3686"	"(2010-11-16 (19)) I was on FilmForum and watching an edit of The Room done 'properly'. I remember seeing Mark and Johnny and it was a musical too. I made a note that it was alright and Frankie had commented too."
"3687"	"(2010-11-16 (19)) I was at Nana's. The cops were searching for drugs. They said they found some and I protested. I ended up with some girl on the run from someone. There was a guy with raccoon eyes and he went into our place. We ducked into this abandoned shop. There was nowhere to go and I hid behind the counter. He came in with goons and looked around but didn't find me. We now had Kurt from Glee with us. As he went to leave he said something and two guys found us and tried to get us and we fought them and ran. There were guards outside. They moved and we left. We went into a shop through the back windows. It was a Muslim shop with food shops etc inside. They came in after us and had to make small talk with people as they made their way through. I bought water at one place. We went into a clothes shop and changed our clothes quickly (it was in a montage). At the end of the montage I was wearing a big black coat and high heel boots. The guys found us and we fought again. Then we all talked."
"3688"	"(2010-11-19 (19)) I was at university. I was in a computer lab or something like that, on a computer. This hot guy came in and I somehow found out that he was knowledgeable about programming. I asked him how to have a table with spry links and how to display results. He said he was in a rush but sat down and showed me. There was a mouse on the loose. I saw a rat and it had dried blood on it and then people said there was no rat but I could clearly see it -- it was a ghost. Mom made food and I went to shower. At first I was with a group of people but sometimes it was just Ezra. We were climbing across a scaffolding. Two people had to get there and they got a passport and went overseas to get away from some other guy. Once I got down I was walking and then I was in a car. A car stopped next to it and Ezra was in it. I waited for other cars and a police with sirens on came and then stopped on the corner. Then Ezra and I put on captain uniforms. Mine was dark blue and his was a lighter blue. We got in the car and changed into them. I ate and then they left. I hadn't gotten to park all the way up yet. I passed an electronics store with 20% of everything and Dad was like 'you should've bought a TV'. I went in and there were cheesecake slices for dessert and I stabbed this guy with a fork and then the police were on their way. Ezra and I cleaned the fork and fixed our uniforms up. I can't remember what happened but then I'd been downloading some game show. I watched an episode and Neil Patrick Harris and Matthew Perry were on it. It was from the early/mid 90s. Neil Patrick Harris was ""noted for his wit"" and they were actually really funny. Darren asked about my downloading and I said it was a freeleech and one of them was ""from KG, not yours"" and he was worried about ratio. I switched cameras and someone looked like Lydia. There was a Glee performance and I remember seeing Rachel and Finn."
"3689"	"(2010-11-19 (19)) I killed someone and the news people swarmed the house which was tiny and like a caravan. Mom made a lasagne for people but we had something else instead. I left at one point and ended up at a school. I had to go in and it was 3pm so everyone was leaving and everyone recognised me so I ran trying to get out. I had a pocketknife thing and I used it to make people get away from me. There was a guy and we ran through a dark tunnel. I used a LED light and my phone to help me follow him. At the end, he believed I didn't do it."
"3690"	"(2010-11-20 (19)) The characters from Friends were on holidays. They were in an auditorium thing which had a stage. Someone was gay. Jeff from Community was there and had a brother. Then they were at a house. Monica and Chandler had started seeing each other secretly and had slept together. They were kissing in a walk-in cupboard and the others walked in and caught them and Monica freaked out but they were all cool with it. They walked across train tracks and one was 'open' and the other had a train slowly coming. Then they were at some place and Chandler and I had organised the luggage. We put water bottles in the cupboard. Some girl was with us and we had to hide her. Someone was looking for her and I said I couldn't find her ""there are like 50 girls wearing white singlets"" but she decided to look anyway. The girl out of the little building thing she was hiding in and into some animal clinic."
"3691"	"(2010-11-21 (19)) I knew Castle and Beckett (both from Castle) and I was on a case with them. This guy was suspected of taking an ID of some other guy. There was as pic of the other guy and they looked very similar and had the same mannerisms etc. We were in an alley near a house and Beckett went down with a gun and said 'show yourself!'. The guy was there with his facial hair shaved off. We were in a car and the other guy was in the back and he gave himself up and looked scared. Beckett and Castle had to go somewhere later and she gave me the report and asked me to see if I could find out how they saved it. There was a picture of a clothes rack and dress? I went to Alexis and asked if it was because the dresses weren't on the clothes rack and she said yeah. She seemed shaken by the case. We were staying at the old house. Mom and Darren were there and asleep. Alexis had a nightmare about a guy standing at the door. I told her it was safe and that I'd had a similar nightmare. She ended up freaking out and I heard a car start. I went to Mom's window and called out ""Alexis!"" but she was driving off. Later, she came back with cash. We got food. I said something to Beckett and she said no but that something was in the lab report. It said something about pushing the clothes rack but people had been pulling it?"
"3692"	"(2010-11-22 (19)) I was in a carpark. Dad was with mafia kind of people. They were taking my car somewhere and they gave me this other car in the meantime, but there wasn't much space between cars and it was squishy to get in. Then we were at Midvale shops. I parked at the side of the road and checked the map book. I told people to go. I was then with characters from Friends. I was dating Chandler and Rachel was dating Ross. Monica was with someone too. Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, Ross and I went shopping. Rachel and Monica bought lots of clothes for their boyfriends. I kept leaving my wallet in random places. We were in the sleepwear section and Monica and Rachel were like 'oh we should buy the guys pyjamas' but the guys weren't interested. The pyjamas were folded on shelves and I touched one of them. It was soft and slightly silky and unlike anything I'd ever touched before and I called them over. The guys touched it and wanted one each. The girls ended up choosing this other one which was just as soft. Then they were shoes and they had pink and I chose blue. The pink one also had green and were very child-like."
"3693"	"(2010-11-22 (19)) I was driving on the freeway, which was different. I was going 70km/h so I changed lanes and sped up. I was approaching the tunnel and there was a cop with a sign. I realised he was doing breath tests so I stopped. I said to this lady, who was smoking, 'excuse me, I don't know if I was supposed to stop'. She said 'me neither'. I saw everyone behind me stop too. Elijah was there. It was then my turn for the test and they had to give you a needle that went between your hand and arm. I didn't want to do it. They also tested your heart rate. Phoebe and Monica (both from Friends) were there and Phoebe was pregnant. Phoebe got into a bed and I saw water on the floor and I said 'did you spill a drink or did your water break?'. It turned out her water had broken and I got Monica and we went to take her to hospital. At one point Ezra had my phone and he said he looked at my photos and I yelled 'DON'T!' as I was worried I had naked weight loss photos on there. He said Nana looked too and saw pictures of Joey and Chandler from Friends and I was like 'so what?'."
"3694"	"(2010-11-23 (19)) Mom and I were near a busy road. Spaceman kept wandering around and we had to run to catch him. He was near the edge of the road and a bus drove over his head and paws but it didn't kill him. He was limping and acting a bit odd. We took him to the vet and they said he might not make it and I was angry at Mom for leaving him and I was upset. There was a British Mission Impossible movie except it was called The Thing and it started off silent. It was made in 1974 and John Cleese, Michael Palin and Courteney Cox were in it. A goth/punk girl and two friends went into this person's house. The lady was asleep was on the lounge. They were just sneaking around, but the lady woke up and saw the girl. She knew she would tell her 'supervisor' and so she ran outside and stabbed her with a metal star knife thing, but everyone saw. She got into pretty big trouble and I thought it was silly because it wasn't really her fault."
"3695"	"(2010-11-24 (19)) I was at university/school. Classes were sets of seats near edges. There were these balconies all across and in the middle was nothing. One of them had a fat kid sitting in front of someone else and it blocked their view of the lesson. There were two groups and one needed a stick to pick up loot and the other was mine and we could just pick things straight off the floor. But I still had to pay $1 for a stick. There was a letter from a Macedonian church saying something was free. The teacher lady thought it meant stuff related to this loot business."
"3696"	"(2010-11-25 (19)) I was a spy, along with the most of the main cast of Friends. Ross didn't know about it and was an engineer and was checking something out about something he had built. While he was there, terrorists took over. A guy was in a pool and went under the water and pretended to drown but then actually drowned. Then we were at this house and a guy said the guy had died from a Japanese disease linked to some machine. This guy had been Japanese and had cut out his eyes. Then I was watching Chuck and Jeff dreamed about Sarah and it was in slow motion and focused on her chest. Then Joey (Friends) had once been really high up in the spy world, but then had become like he is in the show. A sniper saw Ross in the building. My phone was there and I wanted it back. I called him and I was now his sister and I explained some of the stuff. I told him how to escape and that the terrorists were watching him. Then I was home, which was different. Ezra came home late at night with food. Mom was confused and he said he drove and Mom was angry and he got upset and said 'I thought you'd be proud'. I said 'by breaking the law?'."
"3697"	"(2010-11-25 (19)) Dad and I went to the UK just to check out something -- we could do a 'quick' flight, and it would often land in front of this building near the sea which was near an embassy. Right next door to our building was a huge pet shop. There was a big exhibit in the middle with lots of cute brown puppies. There were ducks and geese there. I told Dad that some of the characters in Friends had a duck and chicken as pets and they were cute. Then it turned into a zoo. Some koalas and another kind of animal had all been packed on top of each other. I thought it was mean. I ordered one and told them to deliver to some address. A guy put the koala in a plastic bag and laughed. Then I walked away and I was like 'slice him open, slash his face'. I heard them do it and then I was carrying the plastic bag and dropped it in the middle of a park. The koala ran and went up a tree. I was thinking I would call it Chandler or Joey."
"3698"	"(2010-11-26 (19)) I was at the old house with the characters from Friends. I only remember seeing Rachel, Chandler and Joey. Joey was trying to pick someone up. I was dating Chandler. He was sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor of the lounge room with someone else. Rachel wanted to get pregnant and started to cry. I offered to do it and she said ok and we went to my bedroom and I started clearing the bed. She then said she couldn't and I said it was ok. We went back to the lounge and then we'd been up all night and it was early morning outside (like 5am). Chandler woke up and we kissed (just a peck) and he made a joke about how good the sex was on the couch (we hadn't done anything). There was a zombie movie with a group of people. At the end, someone put the infected into a microwave. A girl walked past and it exploded. She was ok, but some got into her mouth. The director/writer was a girl."
"3699"	"(2010-11-26 (19)) There was a FilmForum get together and I walked there. A lady with a dog and a weird accent talked to me. Leif was on the other side of the road. I got there and had a deep cut on my arm -- it started about halfway down and was about 10cm long. A girl asked if I'd seen this new porno and I said I hadn't. I played some game that was an hour long and was going to play it again. There was a little carpark and you had to stand in front of a parking space and place a light and then park the car. George Clooney had a 'fold up' car. I was watching Friends and Chandler was the one who liked to cook."
"3700"	"(2010-11-28 (19)) Dad, Ezra and I were on a plane. Ezra and I were sitting next to each other and Dad was behind us. A guy was willing to swap but then I couldn't be next to the window. Then we were in America. We were stopping there for a day or two, then going to the UK. I took a photo of a street sign. There was a koala and I said to Dad that I had a dream about a killer one the other day. Then just Dad and I were in the UK. There was a building where they had shot Friends and pictures of the cast were all around the walls. Lisa Kudrow was outside having pictures taken and I took a photo. Then Matthew Perry came out and I was excited and got a photo taken with him."
"3701"	"(2010-11-28 (19)) I was in the UK. The police were chasing me and someone else. We pulled up into a garage and they didn't see us. Granny was nearby and I went to her. She said she was tired and I had to take her to some place to sleep."
"3702"	"(2010-11-29 (19)) I was driving down a two lane road. Two cars behind me were going the other way. Then it was like a movie. They got out and walked down the island in the middle of the road. There were two cars and two girls. They were like 'is it weird I feel drawn to these cars'. They decided it was their destiny for them to take them. They were worried that it could be a trick to make their lives worse. Then it was years later and they were all successful. One of them had just got a part in Friends and was given pot. They all met up and had a smoke and hallucinated. One of them saw a leopard and a dead baby in water. They all ended up dying. A guy reset and things went differently."
"3703"	"(2010-11-30 (19)) It was nearly time for me to go to work, so I started getting changed. I lived with Ezra and some of his friends. I took the train to work and I was late. When I went home, there were two mice in my bedroom. They had round ears which meant they were wild."
"3704"	"(2010-11-30 (19)) I was at a party. Matthew Perry was there and I got a photo with him. Someone showed me some photos they took at the zoo with Jennifer Aniston and she looked like she hadn't wanted to have a photo taken. There was also another character in Friends who was an Indian guy called Vikram."
"3705"	"(2010-11-30 (19)) This girl and I killed some people. She decided to kill this guy in a ditch in front of this house. There was a 'door' and a room behind it. The police turned up and arrested us. We were allowed to pack our stuff up."
"3706"	"(2010-12-01 (19)) I was watching Friends. Rachel and Chandler got drunk and slept together. They kept it secret for a while and then they just blurted it out to Monica. She was upset, but stayed with him."
"3707"	"(2010-12-01 (19)) I liked this guy, though he was dating someone else. I think he did something that made me think he was interested in me and I kept trying to get him alone to flirt. We were in a car and sent everyone else outside to look after some stuff and I got closer to him and was like 'soo...' but then they came back. Another time I sat right next to him and he moved over a bit but our legs were still touching. Then there was snow. He was in a little hut thing and we were discussing what we were going to do (as it was my first time with snow) and I said 'oh, we're alone'. The TV was on. This girl came in and I was annoyed that we still weren't alone. Later we were near a river. The guy wished for zombies and some came out of the river. We ran. There was a 'balloon' baby and a guy was holding it and it snapped at others. It followed me to the toilet and I kicked it under the door. Then it got bigger and was huge and I ran. A girl said ""Alcatraz man"" and someone said 'Candyman can'."
"3708"	"(2010-12-02 (19)) Tanita posted on Facebook something like 'omg The Walking Dead is awesome' and a reference to some place they were going to on the show. I commented saying 'lol I can't wait until they get to that place. That was my favourite part of the comic'. Then I was in show. Kelly, Dmitri and Alisha (all from Misfits) were in it too. We were in a group along with Rick from the comic and some other people. There were two kids. We were in a house. Another group found us and they were bad guys.  They wanted to talk to this guy and his kid (but didn't realise there were two). They argued over which kid would go. Eventually Carl and Rick left, but it turned out the people weren't so bad. A black guy in our group betrayed us. I was telling two girls what happened while I was putting my shoes on. Then people started trying to get in. We couldn't open the back door as it was controlled by a computer and we didn't have someone who could program it. We did manage to open it and we ran. It was night and I was very slow. There was a strange grass field on concrete (like a small park). We lay on it, but the people found us easily. They shot one of us and questioned the rest of us. They asked why I didn't run and I said ""well, as you can see I'm overweight, unfit and have a dodgy knee"". They asked what was wrong with my knee and I said ""I don't know, I think it's hereditary"". They let me go and now the group was huge. I sat at the end of this long table where everyone else was sitting. Alisha sat next to me, chewing gum. Dmitri was at the desk behind me. Then I came later, running in saying there were zombies and we needed to run. They all aimed their weapons at me but then we all got guns and ran. We were shooting zombies as we ran away. I ended up in this building with two others. We had to climb through this duct and they said it smelled. We dropped into this big office. Something in the light had busted and smelled. We looked out the window and there were a few zombies around, but we saw people that we knew across the road. They stood still and the zombies passed by them. We did the same thing but this person we were with whistled and ran and hit the zombies with chairs. We met up with the group again eventually and were in cars. I ran into a fitness shop at one point and Dmitri was watching me."
"3709"	"(2010-12-03 (19)) I was at a school. I had taken this dance class for university and I could've done it externally (just theory) but I went in anyway. This was our last performance and I was chosen as the 'lead' dancer. This guy and I were supposed to dance together and I didn't want to do it. At the start, we weren't dancing together and I copied other movements. Then as he started to go to the front, I ran. There was an area under the building where I went to hide. I lay on the sand but they saw me as they walked past. The teacher threatened to fail me and I protested saying that I'd done well until now, I had been chosen as the 'best' etc. They eventually gave in and I ended up with a B grade."
"3710"	"(2010-12-03 (19)) I was at the old house. I was with two others and we would kidnap a random person and torture and kill them. We had this girl with her hands tied up in my room. I was talking in Dad's old room and I saw she had untied her hands and was sitting on my bed, naked. I ran and jumped on her and she grabbed a pair of scissors and I got them off her and stabbed her in the chest. I tied her back up and got ready to go to bed."
"3711"	"(2010-12-03 (19)) Some others and I had to go downhill after something exploded or something. There was a video of it happening and this guy I liked had reached his hands out to grab me and this other girl. I had reached out and then pulled my hand away. This girl was like ""you're so lucky"" and it turned out he liked me. I was then in a cafe place. There was a big 'exhibit' full of cakes and chocolates etc. The currency was in pounds. I got a cheesecake. The guy asked this girl to 'read' me and to see if I was enjoying it. It started off not tasting like cheesecake and then was warm and sweet. He got angry and left. We waited for this other group to come and we left. Ezra was there now. Then this young fat teenager wanted 15c from this gay guy. He gave him 16c and he wanted more. Then we were near the gay guy's house and we walked through it and he said people weren't gay friendly so no-one knew he was gay. I said that the guy might cause trouble for him. Then we were at a rodeo thing and the guy came around a corner on a motorbike, really fast. We ducked behind a wall and the guy was after the gay guy. The guy started talking loudly and found us. I trapped him in a fridge and the guy filmed it. Calvin and Samantha were there and he gave her oral sex outside."
"3712"	"(2010-12-04 (19)) I was watching a movie with Alain Delon in it. He had a nose ring that went over the bridge of his nose and it annoyed me. He was also sort of Asian looking and I was thinking that my favourite actor was Japanese. He said something and I said 'You're Le Samourai' and Mom seemed to recognise the name."
"3713"	"(2010-12-05 (19)) Amelia was turning 5 and still couldn't talk. Mom insisted she could but I said it was just noise. Later though, she said something and I was like 'ok now she's talking'."
"3714"	"(2010-12-05 (19)) I had a brother who was around my age (or older). Later, I went into a room and some people came. I hid in the bathroom. It was an old fat guy (like 50-60 years old) and his daughter. My 'brother' was his son. The guy and his daughter had sex and then my 'brother' came and joined in (having anal sex with his father). Then Greg Sestero was there and was doing the daughter from behind but then they saw me in the reflection of the mirror and I was like 'ok what the hell is going on?'."
"3715"	"(2010-12-05 (19)) I was at home but it was different. Mom had bought heaps of these thick red socks. Leslie and Valerie had taken a few. Dad had been seeing this girl and he said she might come over asking for money and I was to tell her to go away. She worked at this place which sold epilepsy pills and was a drug addict. She pulled up on a motorbike and Mom turned off the outside light. She came to the door and Mom refused her money and she said ""of course not"" and left. She was actually super crazy. Later I was staying at Dad's. I watched some Alain Delon movie from the 1980s and he was old. It was a weird horror film. We fell asleep and I woke up to the video player opening and I looked up and saw someone outside wearing ""superhero clothes"" and then ran off. I saw the door unlocked and open. Dad locked it and shut the curtains. Later, Mom and Ezra were there too. This bench top had a weird texture and she wanted it. She sent us a video."
"3716"	"(2010-12-08 (19)) I was getting married to Eugene. I had reluctantly decided to have a wedding. It was in 2 days and we were getting ready for it. I was wearing a wedding dress and I decided I looked too fat and refused to wear it. I wanted to see Eugene in his tuxedo, but was thinking of asking him if we could do a casual wedding. We were spending this time apart. I packed up my room, which was different, to be left for a day or two. Mom was helping me."
"3717"	"(2010-12-09 (19)) I was at the old house. Ezra was in the study. I asked ""one, where's our mother and two, why is this here?' and pointed to a lit candle in a birthday cake. He mumbled quietly and I asked him to repeat it and eventually he said he didn't know. Mom finally came back with Rover and she said she'd been in an accident in my car. She'd had to slam the brakes on. I was angry because the front of the car was smashed in. I took photos and said that I'd never let her drive my car again."
"3718"	"(2010-12-09 (19)) I was watching a movie that was set in the past, but it was kind of weird and not accurate. There was a house that had a circular room that could spin. Jim Carrey's character went into the room and then got excited that the room could spin. Breckin Myer had a small part in the film and George Clooney was in it too. Then I was there and Jim Carrey was following me around like a puppy and I was trying to get away. Sometimes we liked each other. The doors wouldn't lock. I went outside and the back of the house was like a barracks. There were notebooks that I used as diaries. There was a guy with a big ring on his second finger and ring finger and I slept with him. People were coming after me and I ran. Jim Carrey met me behind this wall and had a bear costume. We held hands and skipped back, then ran. There was also a movie with John Cusack in it and he got a letter from the director saying ""please do not use your real hair"" and to wear this cornrow wig. It also had the words 'fuck' and 'cunt' in it and ended with 'Wolfman'. Then it was World of Warcraft, but in real life. I was driving back from 'Azeroth' which was in Norway, which was near us. I was then on a bus and it went to turn right at the lights and I realised I was on the wrong bus. The girl in front of me called someone and said she was on the wrong bus and I tapped her on the shoulder and asked if I could go with her and she got annoyed because she was on the phone and I told her not to worry about it and that I'd call my Mom. I tried calling Mom but she wasn't answering. I got off at the next stop. I went into this building and outside I could see huge waves. There were boats and trains nearby. I asked how to get back downtown and this guy said I had to get hit by the waves a few times. I said 'I got here on land, I can get back on land'. I ended up with Robert Sheehan and this girl was helping us. She invited us to a cafe. He ordered 'pseudo spaghetti' and I didn't want anything, but there were chips and I ate some. You could buy carrots for $7. His dish came and it was spicy. It was also rude to not eat all your food at this cafe."
"3719"	"(2010-12-10 (19)) I was at Nana's for Christmas Eve. The lounge room was slightly different and Dad and Ezra were down there, along with Eugene and his brother Rodney. I wondered how they knew them. We were watching TV and I moved to sit on the floor next to the TV. We had all been talking together and I was wondering how to 'get in' with him. Later, I was in the house alone and I was just sitting on a step and I looked up and Eugene was in the hall and I said he scared me. Then I walked out and went into this new room and everyone was in there. I sat in the corner on a seat next to Poppa and Ezra. Eugene joined me. Then we were in another room and Ezra and I had a huge fishtank each. He had a piranha and I had a normal fish. There were big groups of little fish for the piranha to eat and it was practically jumping out of the tank. Ezra got it and put it in my tank by mistake. I freaked out and got a net and tried to fish it out, then he tried and managed to catch it and put it back. Then my tank was low on water. I ran to get Poppa. There was a rabbit cage which had a little pipe. I said 'they're going to die!' and he quickly got a hose and filled it up. Ezra's was going down too. We had to raise the tank and it was full and started to spill. Poppa was also impersonating the Marx brothers at one point."
"3720"	"(2010-12-10 (19)) I went to the shop. I was in a car/motorbike with Ezra, a guy and a girl. Ezra and the guy went in and we waited. Two guys were trying to seduce us and she went with them. Then I was in a church and she was a cop and was Torres from Lie To Me and it was a set up. Then it was One Tree Hill and some of the characters were in a car. Nathan thought it was a set up, but they started walking and he jumped out in front and fell. He got hit and ended up with a pole through him and a big snake wrapped around him."
"3721"	"(2010-12-11 (19)) I was watching Supernatural and Dean and Sam were with an old guy."
"3722"	"(2010-12-11 (19)) Eugene and I were living at this apartment place. He was hiding out and was a writer. Some new people came and didn't like us. This guy threw our ball and I went to go get it and it landed in an empty lot. He was annoyed because it meant I would come back soon. Morena Baccarin was a prostitute. There was a guide on how to level up quickly on World of Warcraft and it said to make a money you had to have a baby at level 1. There was a new 'race' and it was seals and they were the strongest."
"3723"	"(2010-12-12 (19)) I was at a video shop with Ezra. I had a list of my top 20 movies and I told Ezra to give it to the guy behind the counter. We waited a while and he came back and said he found 11 of them. I said 'let me see' but when I looked at them he said he had rearranged the list a bit, but had actually made his own list of 21. He said ""you like cool movies"". He asked us what we thought of Sean Connery and I said I didn't really care. He said that James Bond films needed to be studied. I asked if they had any Alain Delon movies there and he didn't know who it was. Then he said ""have you seen Le Samourai?"" and I was like 'how can you have seen that and not know who Alain Delon is?'. Carl Weathers was then with us. I said that I felt like rewatching Arrested Development and he started singing 'it ain't easy being white'. And I said '... black'. Everyone else asked what we were talking about. Then this weird stuff happened. There was a reddish liquid on the floor. It Cortexaphan and I said 'oh no they di'nt'. There was another liquid that glowed green. It turned out the guy behind the counter was dodgy. There was a lab out the back. I said that I knew something was up because he didn't know who Alain Delon was. Then he was Alain Delon and I was watching him in his lab and he was watching me and had a knife. I said 'I'm just watching'. Then we were outside and he used the liquid and sprayed it with water and he explained (in a French accent) that it kept the wall in a different 'plane of existence' so that the water wouldn't stay. I asked 'so if it was used on a human, they wouldn't age and their eyes wouldn't fail' and he said yes. Then he was actually a 'good' bad guy. There was another bad guy doing other stuff. Alain Delon stood on a little step and yelled at the guy and I was thinking he looked really hot. I started checking him out and was staring at his butt and was thinking that wasn't like me. Then he said that ""it's now"" and the liquid was going to explode. We lay down, as did the bad guy. Then he told me to run for it. As we did, it exploded and there was red smoke. We walked through a highschool and people were leaving and not even paying attention. They looked very 80s-ish. We walked away and he put his arm around me."
"3724"	"(2010-12-12 (19)) I can't remember how it happened, but a black guy was lying on the side of some water with heaps of bullet holes in him, but he was alive. A friend and I were there and she decided to drown herself. I jumped in to save her, but I started drowning and someone saved us both. He was wearing a hoodie etc, so we couldn't see his face. On the news it said that it was Mike Bailey. It became a famous event and was all over Youtube etc. No-one believed that I was one of the girls there. I found a video with a close-up of me lying on a rock and coughing. Mom was telling me to straighten my hair to talk about it on the news but I didn't want to. Later I was in an audience. A guy asked for people to participate in a game. Evelyn and I volunteered. People commented on my white skin. We had to go underwater to find stuff. The second one was in Morse Code and was a list. I took a waterproof radio and we sat at a bench trying to work it out."
"3725"	"(2010-12-13 (19)) I was in a desert-like place. Someone found something with a 'neverending' supply of orange gems. Some others and I went there. We went through a door and Rick from The Walking Dead show was there with a black guy. A kid said he wasn't his father and left and Rick was sad. The place collapsed and a big door went down and we got trapped. It talked to us and said we were stuck forever. But then it decided to give us 515 days to get some stuff done. There was a party. The black guy proposed to his girlfriend. I drank alcohol and was lying on the floor pretending to be asleep. Ezra was dancing in a hoodie, which was a fashion thing he was into. The black girl from before was saying the wedding was expensive and fragile. Someone asked this other girl and I what our favourite part of the cake was and I said 'the nice bit with the hard chocolate bit'."
"3726"	"(2010-12-14 (19)) I was at university doing the first lesson in a new course. We had to pair up and I ended up with this girl with curly blonde hair and a weird mousy face. It was boring and had nothing to do with the topic so I was playing on my phone. A guy complained about it. Then it was school. The desks were really close to each other and some faced the wall. I moved my desk back a bit. Dad was in the class too. Ms Eckert was the teacher. There was some activity where we had to take letters out of our name and that would be your name in some weird place. Mine was Lamp and Eugene's was something like 'eathinin'. They were on a sheet in a 'museum'. Then I was in a house. Jensen Ackles, Alexander Skarsgard, another guy and some others were at a table. Someone was making me write up a list of 'love' for them (ones that I had dated?). I had those three left, but Jensen was next and went to do something quickly."
"3727"	"(2010-12-18 (19)) I met this guy and we started dating. He wasn't overly attractive and his name was Mac. There was a photo of him and Alexander Skarsgard in a magazine. I pointed to him and said something like 'I like that guy. But I'm going out with him so whatever' and Ezra looked at it, confused. His sister was mean and didn't want us to be together. Then it was a movie and the actor's name was Daniel Ekslay. It was a sequel and based on a real story. He dated this dark skinned girl with short hair. There was also a blind girl and her sister had to walk with them everywhere. Someone killed them. There were pictures in this book and one was hanging from the roof and the room was covered in blood and they had separated the girl's vagina into two holes. Another girl had her face beaten and there was a graphic close-up. Then Dad, Granny and I were watching a movie called 'Devil in the Dark' and I thought it was the same movie and I said I liked it and Dad said it was ok. Then I said I meant the sequel. Granny gave us an ice-cream on a stick which had chocolate bits on the side and mint and vanilla ice-cream. She kept falling asleep."
"3728"	"(2010-12-19 (19)) A bunch of us went to a party. Santana and Brittany from Glee were there. When you hovered over someone with a mouse, it came up with a percentage and first it was like a compatibility score, then how much you had done with them. Sexual energy was high. Brittany said ""this isn't a smile"" and just had a blank face. She was then trying to do a crazy smile. Santana ended up naked and lay down on the counter and began to hump it. This other girl whose name began with M was wearing a black dress and had a vibrator with her. I liked this guy who looked like Judd Nelson. Some random guy kissed me. The Judd Nelson guy and his friends were talking to me and they mentioned something about a first kiss and I said it already happened and that ""a guy shoved his tongue down my throat"". We were supposed to sleep in cages and we were involved in something that I think was a set-up. I went into a bedroom and as I left, Judd Nelson came in. There was a cupboard next to the door and he kind of flirted with me and got close to me. I got around him and said we should get a room across the road in case it was a set-up. But then we were called outside. We were guests there and as people sat down, the numbers on this screen increased. We had to run across this lake. Then I worked somewhere until about 4am [last night I had to go out at 4am] and I walked home. There were lots of joggers and cyclists, so I started jogging but I started sweating and felt tired. I ran through a school and it was usually empty. There was a class of just guys. I talked to this guy and he said his daughter made $2000 in a week doing some 'low' level job. I got lost and then remembered where I was. I went to this shop and then it was Lie To Me. Lightman came out and said ""hello Izzy"" and then Torres and another person came out. Everyone looked at me. Then Lightman was like ""pay up"" and the other one was like 'damn' -- it turned out they bet that when I came back I would kiss him. He was wearing a wedding ring and was married to this dark skinned girl that he had been friends with before. This girl was married to Andy from The Office. I said I hated being away because everything changes."
"3729"	"(2010-12-20 (19)) I was at the old house. I had a small grey bird called Andrew Bird and it came when you called it. Ezra was out the back looking worried and drunk. Dad said this girl he slept with was pregnant and we were shocked and saying that he'd ruined his life. Iinet had different internet bandwidth graphs that were squiggly and told you the percentage of download from each person."
"3730"	"(2010-12-22 (19)) I went through McDonald's drive thru with Ezra, Selena and Lorelei. First we were walking and then we were in a car. It was night, but we got breakfast. I had a burger too. Ezra's patty was red and mine had egg in it. I grabbed them and went inside and complained to the manager. She said it would be best to talk to the person who made them and it was Kayleigh. I said 'I know you're friends with Ezra'. She called Paul and after one ring and no answer, she hung it up. She listened to my complaint and looked sorry. I said something about Mom and she remade my patty. A guy in there mentioned to Ezra that he liked me (saying that I was hot) and Ezra teased me and the guy about it. Ezra filmed on his phone and got the guy to say ""will you have sex with me?"" and I said ""go away""."
"3731"	"(2010-12-24 (19)) It was last night and I couldn't sleep [I also had trouble sleeping that night] . I ended up taking a swim in this pool. Everyone was awake and got confused. At 6am I asked Ezra and Dad when I needed to get up for Christmas but they didn't know. Then I was at school or work and I was cleaning and my shoes got filled with white stuff and I kicked them off and people laughed at me. Eugene was there too and we were sort of friends. There were other people there and they were laying on the floor and people were pouring alcohol into their mouths. I also did it. Eugene was trying to tell me something (that he liked me) but I kept waving him away."
"3732"	"(2010-12-26 (19)) I was at Nana's. They had these beds with sheets and we all had our own bed. Uncle Wilbur was in his bed. Ezra and Dad's were next to his and mine was at the end. Then I went to a Jetts Gym to check it out. There was a line on the floor (which was tiled) and I followed it. This girl climbed up this thing and fell. It was fake and was a special effects demonstration. There was a very big treadmill and I was looking at the buttons. This guy got on and it was really fast and I slowed it down. After he was done, I got on and it kept changing speeds and was faulty. This guy said they would have to recall them. They asked if I wanted to join the gym and brought me to this office. He said he would call me on Monday to sort it out (it was Friday). I told Mom when I got home. Then we had ID chips in our ears that could be scanned and mine said I was married to Robert Downey Jr."
"3733"	"(2010-12-27 (19)) I was at a shop but then I was in a hall at a house and it kept going back and forth. I was dating Robert Sheehan and his name was something else and his last name was Brown, but he was basically Dmitri from Misfits without a power. I thought someone was following me and I screamed and he came but there was no-one there. Then we were at a shop. We found this pile of dead bodies in this toilet cubicle. This guy who looked like Ben Mendelsohn was an old friend of someone in our group and was an interior designer. We ended up getting attacked by a killer. They had these leprechaun/elf things. They had a few powers and we went to run outside and Dmitri grabbed some chocolate mints. There was a car that would only run if you were eating chocolate mints. We were waiting for it to register us eating them and the leprechaun things were coming closer. It finally started and I was driving (though I was in the middle of the backseat and was reaching over. We went to this beach and there were heaps of people and they all turned around. We ended up getting out of the car and they attacked us again. Later we were at a party and this guy mentioned the Ben Mendelsohn guy and this guy said 'oh yeah, I remember [different name] , he's a [different career] ' and we were confused. He went over and said 'sorry about the divorce' and Ben was like 'yeah, I came out 5 years ago'. Later, he was married to this guy and then realised he was straight. He kept talking and then he realised we caught him out as the 'goblin king'. We trapped him in the car and said 'in 2 minutes there's going to be a car accident and you're going to die'. We left and he just sat there. This guy who was the brother of someone in the car (which was a 4WD) was driving towards it. Ben 'teleported' out of the car and in front of the guy driving towards it and stopped it. This caused him to kill these other people because he now had control of him. He shot down these dancing kids and their parents."
"3734"	"(2010-12-28 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was in a place with lots of lava. There was a dire dog and it growled at Ezra and he ran. Then it attacked me and I ran and jumped up high onto this cupboard. Then something happened to cause the whole place to implode and then rebuild. Then it was real life. I went to this shop place and Justin Bieber was there and some guys were making fun of him and I filmed it."
"3735"	"(2010-12-29 (19)) Something had made me and someone else see everything bigger. We could also see these floating islands in the air. We were in a forest. We did something and ended up on a spaceship where I did something. Later I had to do the same thing again but I couldn't remember it exactly. Ezra wondered if they wiped my memory. Dad was talking about Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson and said it seemed like they didn't like mess as they wore suits everywhere. They had a new live show."
"3736"	"(2010-12-29 (19)) Some people got powers and it was a well-known event. I could read minds. I was driving with Dad and some pale people were standing in the road -- they were vampires. We went to some place and there were some vampires there. We got in the car and locked the door. I went through the wrong set of lights and there was a big hill which was fun to drive fast on. Then I had to walk back because it was quicker. I had to go over a bridge. This guy did an apprentice thing from 11pm-1am which would later lead to paid work and he said 'it looks promising'. I got a box in the mail with a work uniform."
"3737"	"(2011-01-01 (19)) I was married to Eugene. We had a fight and I went to get a divorce. Granma and Uncle Gabriel were getting one too. The Oscar nominees were getting announced on the TV there. I changed my mind and went back. I had to climb through this pipe to get to this room. Dad came to get a key, but I had changed my pants and they were in my other pair which were on the floor. I sat on the lounge next to Eugene and it was awkward. We went home. We had 7 kids. Mom had bought each a Labrador puppy. I didn't remember being pregnant or having any of them. This American guy was around and I sat outside on a step. He huffed ""What is it with y'all and steps?"" and I said ""What is it with y'all and 'y'all'?"". It was smoky outside. Mom wanted us to get started on the next kid. She was buying the Labs off a friend for $3 each. I said that the dogs would be dead before the kids were adults."
"3738"	"(2011-01-02 (19)) I forgot about The Oscars and I woke up as they were announcing 'Best Supporting Actor'. An actor announced it and the winner was Geoffrey Rush. A woman I'd never heard of announced 'Best Director' and 'Best Picture' which were both the same and it was a lame 'cartoon' [like, new cartoons] sequel. I also announced an award."
"3739"	"(2011-01-02 (19)) I was in a place that was like World of Warcraft. Some others and I walked to a place called Fae to get to the flight trainer. I ended up with George Clooney and we were running away from someone? I think it may have been the police. At one point, I was on Princess Rd and I heard a cop siren behind us and I pulled into the carpark next to the sports centre and drove around. Then I was at a shop place. There were zombies or something. We went in. Each door had two people and we had to pick one and they were like 'magic'. For one of them, we chose ""the Asian"". One of the doors was called 'Night Watch'. We put some animal in a container full of carbon monoxide and took it in the car as we were on the run. George was in the driver's seat and was like 'why the hell are you bringing that?'. We left other people behind. Also, Leif joined the FilmForum Facebook group again. He posted on a conversation between him and I, and Linus called it a ""bullshit convo""."
"3740"	"(2011-01-04 (19)) I was at a shop with Eugene and we were dating. I joked that we should go outside and pretend to have sex to annoy the security guard, but we didn't. Two other friends were there and we were using our iPhones and a headset to communicate for some game. Some guy had drugs. He gave us these sticks of marijuana and some other drug. We used a 'tube' of pasta to snort it. We liked it and kept taking it. I was then at a house. Dad and Ezra were there. A girl knocked on the door and Dad said it was a girl he slept with and not to answer it. But she said she was just here to do something that I can't read. She had a weird English accent (Northern) and she was young and blonde. There was a notice on a board for Greg Grunberg having a party. There was a new Tommy Wiseau movie about the war. I watched a trailer and Neil Flynn, Zach Braff and other fairly well-known people were in it. I was then driving and I got a call from the guy with drugs. He asked ""Where are you?"" and I said ""Stirling, near Target"" and he said ""Good, come over"", ""Where do you live?"", ""Just come over"". He just kept saying that so I drove to the shop where I normally saw him. I think he actually lived there? He said he didn't want anything and I asked ""Well, what do you want?"" and he said ""Dunno""."
"3741"	"(2011-01-04 (19)) Isaak gave me Chicken Treat [as in, the store] . The other people who worked there (all different) and I tried to work out a schedule. I said 'it's my birthday in a few days/weeks'. Then it turned out it was actually January 27 today and I was like 'what the hell, I thought it was the 4th!'. I posted on Facebook saying 'It was my birthday 2 days ago and I didn't realize'."
"3742"	"(2011-01-05 (19)) Bryson had heard me talking about the list of movies I was working on and he decided he wanted to do it too. Aunt Sally had made a spreadsheet which had all of us so we could input our details. Nathaniel was dissing Bryson and Braden in a room and then turned to me and said ""your body is overweight"" and I said ""only 5kg"" [actually, it's about 10kg, but I was lying] and Braden was like ""6"" and I said ""5"" and then ""I'm on a diet and am still losing weight, so that's good"". Then I was watching TV. There was a movie called 'I Killed [name] '. Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Shaun Micallef were in it. The police chased Micallef out to a car and he was talking to the NAV system to tell it where to go as the cops just stood outside the car."
"3743"	"(2011-01-06 (19)) I had work, but before that I went to the movies or something with some girl friends. I ended up a little late. My pants were ripped at the crotch, so I changed them. I then realized I had no shoes and it was now 5.40pm. I told Isaak and he went to the shops nearby to get some. I said I was a 10.5 in men's. He got work shoes though and I said ""I'm an 8 in those!"". They were way too big. Chicken Treat was different, by the way. I helped a little without going out the back. I still got paid for it, but I wanted to go home."
"3744"	"(2011-01-07 (19)) I was driving and had to pull onto a fast road (110km/h). It was very busy. I got onto it, but then missed my turn off (which was on the right) and had to turn around at the end. It was a house. I went in and it was supposed to be the family from Christmas Vacation, but Chevy Chase was the only one I recognized. The wife was vacuuming the lounge and assumed I was there to help and told me what to do, so I followed along. There was a thing to wet the lounge with (like, soak it). Then I had to do the dishes and they had a tiny sink. Chevy came in and was like ""Wow, you look hot"" thinking I was his wife and she was embarrassed. I knew it was a dream, but in another dream and I was 'forcing' this dream [not a real lucid] . The wife left. I was in a hall and Chevy came and I kissed him. I told him it was a dream and then we had sex. We had an affair for a while. Then it showed the wife with a guy and she told him that she loved him and they were actually bad guys. I was thinking that was good because then she was out of the picture. Later, I was at a shop with Ezra, Emery and some of his other friends. They started playing 'my' music and a song by The Beach Boys came on and they covered their ears and I was like ""Yeah, because this is REAL music, not noise!""."
"3745"	"(2011-01-08 (19)) We were out the back of the old house. For Ezra's birthday, Mom bought him a $350 chair, $135 pair of 'remote control' shoes and 'dream boots'. The dream boots were like a soft pair of thongs which also massaged his feet. He seemed to like it, then let me try them. He tried the remote control shoes. Mom controlled them and then he just stomped out the front. I yelled at Mom saying 'why the hell did you spend all that money on him and you just give me $150?!"". I followed him out and he had thrown bits of the shoes around. I picked it all up and there was a small square bit of cardboard that flew off. It flew up over the roof, so I ran out the back and asked ""You can't take it back without that?"" and she couldn't, so I walked around to find it. There was a big park behind the house. I walked to the other side of it and I saw it stuck between two bushes. I went back and said ""you better be able to take it back""."
"3746"	"(2011-01-09 (19)) Porky had been in Iron Man. There was a photo of her and Robert Downey Jr. She was with us and was foaming at the mouth and she had AIDS. We figured that was how Simba had gotten AIDS. Mom was going to get them both put down."
"3747"	"(2011-01-10 (19)) There were a group of British guys (they may have been brothers) who were around 25, and were trying to find wives. One girl agreed to marry one of them, after she had decided she would never find love. One of the girls was called Izzy and had been with the guy for 4 years. Ezra watched It's A Wonderful Life and wanted to stay in a hotel room that James Stewart stayed in. Darren organized it. I was then at work. I accidentally put a metal plate in the microwave (the boss had called for me, and I had quickly put it in there) and I was like 'I'm an idiot!'. I said that I'd only done it once before; the first time I used a microwave and I didn't know you couldn't put metal in there."
"3748"	"(2011-01-10 (19)) I was watching a movie from the 1910's. It was about a Disneyland theme park. There was a shot of a part from the 1966 remake with ""Christian Bale"" who I then realized was actually James Brolin. I played the 'girl'. The Dad was mean. Her bed was outside and the Dad sat at the window, inside, with a lamp on and watched her. She wrote in her diary. He got angry at one point and I locked this door thing. He stood there and pushed it open. I had studied something and was spouting information at him. He came in and I ran. My car was outside and I ran to it and got in. I locked it, but then thought I unlocked it and did it again, and he opened the door. I started the car up and put my foot down. I got 'images' of people on the streets."
"3749"	"(2011-01-10 (19)) I was at Nana's. There was a party? There was food and stuff outside but we had to cook as we ordered (it was set up like Chicken Treat). They had a 'run' which had different sections, all enclosed, with lots of grass and bushes that had a yellowish colour. I went to the end and there was a dog tied up. I walked back and I saw a sign saying ""Snakes like walkthroughs"". I then saw a black one with white bits looking at me. There was a log in the middle of the section with a small purple snake on it. I was trying to use the top of the cage as monkeybars, and then the snake left. I picked up the purple one to throw it, but it latched onto my foot. I picked at it, pulled the back of it off, but it's head and 'stinger' stayed. On my way back, I had to crawl through a section. Everything felt weird and I told them that I had been bitten by a snake. People were like 'ok'. Beyonce was a table talking to people about how ""I have sex and touch myself"" and I was like 'what?!'. Nana took me up to the granny-flat. Poppa was walking around."
"3750"	"(2011-01-11 (19)) I was dating Eugene and he was the future creator of Facebook (it was before Facebook existed). Some people were after him because of it. We were in a building trying to get away. There was a hall with little nooks with paintings or doors at the end of them. None of the doors would open. One of the nooks had an Inglourious Basterds poster and a secret door, which opened, and we went in. There was a statute of 'Hamlet'. There was a soft wall in there with a room on the other side and I thought it was a theatre. It was darkish in the room. We tried to work out what to do. Sometimes we would time travel and try it again. Eventually he said he was going to make an announcement over the PA and he wanted me to stay here. When he was done he would travel back? He managed to make the announcement and as I listened, I was proud of him. Then it was the end of school/university. We were like 'we're not going to forget today!'. I put a book away and Elijah was standing next to me. I was then standing with Eugene and some others. His rival came over and touched my butt and I kicked him in the nuts. Nobody saw and I was annoyed. Also, at some point I was on the FilmForum group and Linus made a forum post like 'most handsome man' and I posted a list in alphabetical order. Tommy Wiseau was in there and I was confused as to why he was in the list (I thought maybe I'd put it in there as a joke, but I didn't remember)."
"3751"	"(2011-01-13 (19)) I ended up at this place where they were doing an Absolutely Fabulous live show. Jennifer Saunders and another woman were there, along with their husbands. Adrian Edmondson didn't look like himself at all -- he had hair, which was grey, and a beard thing. Rik Mayall joined them and he looked very Rik like. There weren't many people in the audience. I left and Mr Ripley was outside. He said I should ask for some detective to 'partner' up with for work experience. I was like 'ok...' and I figured someone had told him I was doing forensics, but I couldn't be bothered telling him I wasn't anymore. Mom called him asking whether I wanted her to pick me up and I said that I drove here myself. We went to a bakery and I wanted some hedgehog slice or a brownie but there weren't any. There were a lot of chocolate-y things though, including mudcakes."
"3752"	"(2011-01-13 (19)) I can't remember properly, but I was having sex with someone. It was my first time and I couldn't get to the climax and he told me to go on top. We ended up like, both sitting and we were face to face. I was thinking of the song Laid."
"3753"	"(2011-01-14 (19)) A boy and a guy climbed up the wall of this building to break in somewhere. They were good guys but needed to do it. It was day. The cops came and all went around the outside of the fence. One went inside the fence. The guy from before was now Seth Rogen and he pretended to be retarded (the area was known for retards) and watched the cops and then walked off around the corner. I was watching from his point of view and I could feel the adrenaline as he walked away and then when he was out of sight, he ran."
"3754"	"(2011-01-14 (19)) I was playing a game. I turned into a rat and went through the sewer line. The level I was at allowed me to build a place where all the sewers would link up. I built a pet shop (which was a cover). Then I was a rat again and I hid in a 'doghouse' at my boyfriend's house and he came to say hi. I can't remember why I had to hide."
"3755"	"(2011-01-14 (19)) I was at the old house. I woke up to Ezra getting organized to be taken to dads [also happened when I woke up in real life] . Everything felt weird. Then I was at this weird place with halls. One had this curtain and there was a hand behind it -- it was the 217 lady. I tried to scream but no sound came out and my throat was sore. I ran and she was walking down the other hall. Then I was home again. I found my phone and called Mom, but Ezra answered. I said I was hallucinating and that someone was trying to break in -- there was an Asian girl outside trying to pick the lock. I said ""I thought it was a dream, but it's not"". I went to my room and packed up my externals to go to dads. Then I woke up. An Asian girl was at the front door and she was naked. Rover barked at her and Mom told her this was the wrong house. I said 'I dreamt this last night' and Mom was like 'of course you did, these Asians are always doing this'."
"3756"	"(2011-01-15 (19)) I was at someone's place/hotel. It was small and apartment like. A new season of Dead Like Me was playing on the TV. Ellen Muth was the only remaining cast member and the new girl characters were really lame. It was very serious and dark. She was no longer a reaper and was living, but had been called on to do it again. Then some others and I were in the show and we had to go down a toilet to get to some place. A lady caught us in there the second time and I panicked and went down. But it hadn't been activated so it was just a normal toilet and it spat me back up. We paid her and she activated it. Ellen's character liked this guy and they were on a bed covering each other with blood and fleshy bits. I had no idea what was going on. The next day I watched an episode with Dad and Ezra. I complained that it was too serious and he said he liked it more this way. I said it used to be quirkier and that it was created by ""Bryan Fuller, he does Community or Modern Family [actually Pushing Daisies] "". On Facebook, people were wondering what the names of the kids of a character in Modern Family were called. Someone mentioned me in a comment. There was a character called Jacqueline, but people would interchange it with Izzy."
"3757"	"(2011-01-16 (19)) The sun was doing to die and then we were going to get a new, lesser one. It was happening today. We weren't really worried. Mom and Darren were with me and we were looking out the window to check every now and then. The last movie I watched was called 'Last Day on Earth'. Dad watched this new sci-fi show. There was a new one starting soon with Brad Pitt in it and I wondered what he was doing on TV. I looked outside and it was pitch black. We were like 'it's so weird, I didn't know what to expect'. We checked a few minutes later and I saw a ball of fire (the sun) and then nothing -- we died."
"3758"	"(2011-01-17 (19)) I was watching Le Samourai but it was different. It started off with Alain Delon working in a sushi place. There was a long fresh spring roll on a plate and he pointed at it and said ""Le Samourai"" and he sounded Japanese. A friend of Dad's on Facebook said it was awesome and said that he 'kind of wanted to have sex with Alain Delon'. He also ranked the 'of the Deads'; Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead (original), Night of the Living Dead then Dawn of the Dead (remake). I said Dawn of the Dead was one of my favourites and that the remake was good too. There was a movie with Eduardo Noriega and Vera Farmiga. Dad complained about Farmiga. We went on our holiday and I felt like orange juice. There was a lot of it around. There was a self-serve machine but the cups were like, folded up paper and I spilt it. I put some chocolate in my pocket and went into a shop. A security guard asked me about it and I pulled it out and they asked me to leave it outside."
"3759"	"(2011-01-17 (19)) We were friends with Tommy Wiseau. I was at home, but it was different. I went to my room and my computer and bed had been taken; only my desk ad cupboard remained. I had only been out for 5 minutes. I knocked on Ezra's door to ask him, but he hadn't noticed anything. We found Wiseau and he had gone crazy? He chased us and we ran into my room and locked the door. The door knob was round and had a lock on top of it. I could see his shoes through the bottom of the door. He was going to release some ""prune juice"" into the air -- which made it smell and hard to breathe. I put my head at the window (against the fly wire). Ezra wanted to leave so I said to get weapons first -- I grabbed scissors. He also had tongs which had been heated up. We opened the door and Wiseau had foil on his hands. The scissors were blunt and I couldn't cut him. I grabbed another pair and dooped him a bit in the stomach. Then we were at an airport and he got caught. There was a small rotating thing with socks on it. We drove past school and I yelled out ""rapist, animal killer!"" and the people there had a cat. Mom was driving."
"3760"	"(2011-01-20 (19)) Selena, Lorelei, someone else and I were trying to get away from someone. Selena was the leader, I think. We climbed through a building, through the windows etc. We smashed some other windows to trick the guy we were running away from. To get through something, we had to masturbate? The people gave us vibrators and mine was purple and jelly. I went off to a room and felt uncomfortable about it, but then I did it. I then realized we had to leave now, so I went and told the others."
"3761"	"(2011-01-20 (19)) I was staying at this big house for the night. Mom and Darren were there too. My room was huge and had a backdoor and had stuff like, a table and a lounge (it was kind of like a hotel room). Light came through the windows in the morning. I put curtains up and closed the door. Ezra came home 'from his job'. He was talking outside my door and I complained saying that I was trying to sleep. Later, during the day, Bill (True Blood) was looking for something. I said 'before you do my room, give me time to hide my private stuff' and he agreed. This girl was planting memories in another girl so they could be friends. I went somewhere outside where she was and we were standing on sand with green stripes on it (originally was a tennis court?). Then it changed to water and I was trying to run before her power took over. I got to my room just as Bill got there and I said I wasn't ready. He said 'I would've come for you' and said he'd wait. I put my pads and diaries in a bag. There were new True Blood characters; 3 guys, who were supposedly attractive but were muscly and square jawed and ugly. Two of them were family of the Stackhouse's. I was watching an interview with Robert Downey Jr. and his 'wife' (who was born in 1985 and he was born in 1959). Her ex was a creepy Indian guy with gaps between his teeth and back teeth. He was friendly though. Michelle Williams and another girl had been with 3 others (?) and one had died and she cried, and I cried."
"3762"	"(2011-01-22 (19)) Mom was babysitting a baby. It had no teeth and was chewing on something and crying and screaming. Ezra was like 'is that how our screams sound when we are older?' and I said ""all babies sound the same"". Mom had been in a movie with Brad Pitt, called Children of Heaven [Deepak had commented on the real movie on Facebook yesterday] . It had a low rating on IMDb and it was supposed to be from the 30's. At the start, they all turned into weird plant monsters and were talking about weird alien stuff. They realized they had squashed someone and they came out of the form (caused by drugs, I assumed) to help him."
"3763"	"(2011-01-23 (19)) I went to France with Dad and Ezra. It was hot. I thought something weird was going on; it had something to do with the sun. We ran into a building we thought was safe."
"3764"	"(2011-01-23 (19)) Mom and Darren were looking at buying another house. A guy said we could get $330k for this house and they had paid $400k. I told them not to make any decisions without permission from us."
"3765"	"(2011-01-24 (19)) Dad and I were doing something and the TV was on in the background. David Lynch was announcing music. It sounded like Killer Klowns From Outer Space was going to play, but they tricked us with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head but then it did play. I was in a shop with people later and someone did something naughty and we all ran. I saw a bunch of police, so I started walking and slipped into a food shop. They walked past me. I had no money, so I left. I was watching some movie. Someone cut off a small pigs head and a girl was convinced that we had to put it in a container so they wouldn't die in vain. This guy pretended to be another guy to get close to the girl. She saw the real one and realized he was dodgy. Alan Tudyk was in the movie too. There was a Joss Whedon show with Lee Pace playing a soldier. It was about this girl was actually a guy called Beverley. I thought the show looked lame and most people wanted him to do a show based on Lee Pace's character."
"3766"	"(2011-01-25 (20)) I had a job interview at Bunnings. It was different. I had to shake hands with heaps of people and then shake fingers. A lady gave me a uniform and I accidentally dropped some keys into a chute, but they didn't go all the way down. On my first day, I forgot the uniform and she just gave me a spare. She got me to sit at a closed register and said to read 'mobile network' books. Elijah was there as a customer, but then he was working on the front counter and said ""I just had Bob Dylan [as a customer] "" and everyone was like 'What? Why didn't you say anything?'. Mom made fun of the uniform. It was a darkish green and the shirt was quite stiff and the shorts were short."
"3767"	"(2011-02-02 (20)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We went through a drive thru and there were kids shoes on the road. I saw two small animals hopping over the road. I sent Dad a text and post on Facebook saying 'It's my birthday, I'm straight [hair] '. Lots of people sent me birthday messages, so I removed it. There were lots of animals around. I went to Red Rooster and a girl ran to help another girl. The aircon was blowing right on her. Someone was cleaning the toilet doors. There was an Asian movie and this girl talked to a guy talking about her boyfriend and saying that when she was younger she hung around with other people and slept with this guy she liked. But she was actually still a virgin and a guy called her out on it and said 'pathetic'. Someone joked that she needed to do it. She pinched some guy's butt but he thought it was the guy sitting behind him."
"3768"	"(2011-02-03 (20)) I was watching Misfits and there were zombies. In the last season, Dmitri had fallen in love and become boring. In the first ep of this season he ditched her and he and some others escaped from some house. It was spreading through the air or something so pretty much everyone was turning. I was then there. We left a building and I followed Dmitri and we ended up in a car. I said 'what are we doing? Where are we?'. We went to a house where there was a young girl. He spoke to her and said 'this is Izzy' and she said 'oh. Dmitri's girlfriend'. He had secretly been talking to her for a while. Then we were driving again and a car came around a corner and hit us and sent us straight into a pole. Zombies came out to us and opened the doors and took us. They took us to a house and outside there were lots of flies and Dmitri said it smelled really bad. The people there looked really dirty."
"3769"	"(2011-02-03 (20)) Ivan was different and had left them as a teenager. There was a story in That's Life saying this guy came back from the dead. He had died, but not really and it was him. He visited us. Then Chuck (Chuck) was there and he turned into a robot and exploded. Mom came home and Ezra went to the door and was confused and she said 'he didn't turn into a robot' and he said 'yeah, how did you know'. Chuck returned as a girl and she touched this strong glass and it shattered and everyone was shocked. Then there was a big guy and security came and he just ran away and I wondered why."
"3770"	"(2011-02-03 (20)) There was a sickness going around. A guy said he thought it was spread through children. A young black girl sat next to me at dinner so I moved and ate somewhere else. Years later, it turned out that it had been spread from kids. A brother and sister who had been kids then were now teens/adults. This guy had worked for their parents and they were rich and he was now infected. His face was splotchy. The sister was talking to him and kissed him and then there were splotches on her ears. They had been secretly dating since she was 17/18 years old."
"3771"	"(2011-02-04 (20)) I was watching an episode of a show like Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction. This girl was outside her house and her dog didn't let her come back inside or put her shoes. She had hurt her leg. She lived next to some bush area and she dragged herself down the track with the dog. It turned out there was a snake in her shoe and in the house and it would've killed her. It turned out to be a true story."
"3772"	"(2011-02-05 (20)) I was with people from Community. We were in groups and had to perform a short scene. Mom was there. There was a performance for everyone and one for just the crew. Pierce kept a recorder in his bag. I went to the toilet and sat on the toilet and talked to someone. Pierce held the bag up and Shirley was like 'he's recording, as he does'. He was grinning. In the scene we were doing, someone looked like Frank Whaley and he was playing the lead for their play. Ezra said he would probably be good. Alex (One Tree Hill) broke up with this guy and she ended up with a chipped front tooth. The guy met her in a room to propose sex with her and she took her clothes off. Her boobs were weird looking and she had this gold belly button piecing in her belly button and it was like a bell and really gross. The guy went down on her and then it cut to the guy walking in and she was touching herself."
"3773"	"(2011-02-05 (20)) I was at Nana's. There was a broom placed across the ramp to the back door. I asked why later on but I never got an explanation. Dad said he noticed the shoes had been put away and I realised I didn't take my shoes off before coming in. Someone was singing 'The Way It Is' and I went down the ramp near the granny flat. The geese and chickens were there and I squealed. Poppa was there and he tried to scare them away. I went inside and Ezra got a guy to call Uncle Vic (who was there) and tried to sell him something. There was a thing on TV with Alison Brie, then a thing with Chevy Chase and I said 'he's everywhere'. I said something to Ezra like 'I'm Chevy Chase and yeah, no"" in an American accent. I tried to rewatch Juno and it was different and not as bad, but still bad and I said 'I can't watch this'. Mom and I went to a petrol station and I asked for a chocolate. The security guard got in the driver's seat and messed with the lights and we were confused."
"3774"	"(2011-02-07 (20)) Dad and I went to a shop thing and he ordered two Kitkats each, but they gave us two altogether. We went to a stationery shop and there were no notebooks left. We ended up at Raquel's and she had a different mother and brother (who was young, fat and big with curly orange hair). At one point, I said he was 'gay and stupid' and his mother yelled at me for using the word 'gay'. I said 'it's just a word' and she carried on and I said 'in this generation, it is not insulting and homophobic, it's a word. It's people like you that make it homophobic' etc. Then she told me 'get out of my house'. There was a fridge outside and I had to get 5-6 trays of cakes and things. I took them back to the car but they were empty -- they had fallen onto the grass, so I just left. Abed (Community) was with us and he told me to turn in to a carpark and then go to this deli place. I went in with Dad and asked if I should get a new Kitkat. There was a phone near the door and I said 'is this Ian's [Community] ?' and Dad said yes, that he used it to bill him as a joke. I replied to something on Facebook from my phone and it said 'from Steve'. I left and Abed came back from where he went."
"3775"	"(2011-02-12 (20)) I at was at Nana's. She told me a story about the fish. Mom was there too and sometimes it was our house. We fed the chickens, which were weird and made a noise like 'brr woof' which was them copying Rover's bark. There was a party or gathering. I left and saw some guys hiding in the bushes. They saw me and chased after my car laughing evilly and I put my foot down on the accelerator and I started crying. Later, they had attacked the party and had tied Rover up and killed all the fish etc."
"3776"	"(2011-02-13 (20)) I went to some food place with Mom, Darren and others. We met there with some people I didn't know. There was ice-cream and chicken. They ordered for me and basically got me nothing with no ice-cream and I asked for chips and they said there weren't any. Then they said it was a long wait. I was angry and annoyed. I watched a movie on a DVD player on a TV and Mom watched a bit and thought it was interesting. Russell Crowe was in it. Then the movie was real and this guy a girl needed to get somewhere quickly and they dressed up as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to get to this place. I had to get through this level and at first I fell through some stuff. Then there was one with apple bits and it was hard to breathe. I was then with another girl. There was a squares game and I had to do 4 of them and I had to go first. This lady said we had to do something, but she got interrupted. They caught on that we were lying and we had to run."
"3777"	"(2011-02-14 (20)) I was with others in the bush. This guy lead me to this empty patch and told me to take a step. It turned out to be this invisible house with an alarm. They had parts like a camera/phone and I had to plug in a cable and download from it? We had to do something to get in and this guy came and we made up a story about why we were there and tried to keep him away from seeing the open parts. But he saw them and we tried to make up an excuse. Then I was at a shop, at a table with some guy who was the Mexican from Kiss of the Spider Woman. I purposely left something facing him so he could learn the truth and then he gave me money to get a water bottle. There was a big bottle of Mount Franklin. He came into the shop while I was at the counter and the lady was counting my coins. Then Chevy Chase was on our side and was in the movie playing on the TV in the shop. His character was called something like George Stromapolous.I called him and he answered in the movie so I talked in code. I watched some of the movie and there was lots of boofy hair. I thought he was hot in it. I needed to buy some stuff, including a USB. This guy motioned for a brush. I joked that it had 'been on your head'. I called Chevy again and said ""where are you"" and he said ""I'm-"" and then I woke up."
"3778"	"(2011-02-15 (20)) I could teleport. I was at a clothes shop with Mom and I said I didn't like the look of the store (the style was country like [like that shop at Brookland] ). I was rolling around in a wheelchair and went to explore the rest of the shopping centre. A guy in a wheelchair talked to me and was with a group of wheelchair bound people. I got away from him. There were three different toilets -- male, female and any. I was dressed as a guy so I went to the male toilet but there were only 2 cubicles free so I left. I couldn't find the female toilet. The 'any' toilet had some that were totally enclosed and others were in a group. Most of the dirty. The only clean one was with a bunch of others, so I left. A girl was on one and a group of girls were waiting."
"3779"	"(2011-02-16 (20)) I was staying at this hotel thing. The rooms were small and there was just a bathroom and a little bed with a tiny bit of space. Before we'd come here, Dad and Ezra had discussed places they wanted to stay for something to do with tea. Then we were at the old house and Dad left the car running outside. Some kids went into it and I started banging on the door yelling at them. Dad ran out and turned off the car and it rolled down the hill. He ran to the house across the road to stop it. Nana and Poppa drove past. Then we were at the hotel again. Alexander Skarsgard was there and his hair was wet and down and he didn't look as hot. Then he looked normal and we were secretly seeing each other. Mom was in the room too. When she wasn't looking, he would kiss me or touch my arm. At one point, Mom bent over next to us and he pinched my bum. We went into the hall and he held me against him and the wall and kissed me. I heard Mom coming. My hands were on his chest and I pushed him away. The others left to go somewhere. He went to leave and said that he forgot his coat and he came in and held me and kissed me again. Then I was at Nana's and Poppa asked if I'd gotten rid of 'that friend' and they meant Calvin. I said I hadn't spoken to him in ""a year and a bit"" but we were friends on Facebook. He said he was the devil. Nana had a cold and I said I was just getting over one (I still sounded like I had one). There was a movie called Dead of Night, but it was different."
"3780"	"(2011-02-18 (20)) Someone's dog had killed a sheep. The people who owned the sheep decided to kill the dog. Mom and I drove them to the place (they were friends of ours or something) and we stayed behind. We had a poodle dog and called it to make it follow us. We went back to the car and drove to the people's house just around the corner. There was a black lady and we told her they were killing their dog. We brought back the dead dog and sheep and put them together. I was sad. Then someone peed on their lawn, which was covered in snow and it all turned yellow."
"3781"	"(2011-02-19 (20)) Dad and I were on holiday. I checked a map to see where we were and it said Jakarta. I zoomed out a little and it was next to Manhattan. There were lots of Asians around. I zoomed out more and it was in England. There were toilets where you had to pay on the way out and you had to pay more the drunker you were. People were lining up and I decided not to use them. Dad peed and gave them $2.52 and I gave them 50c. Then we were on the street and there were shops and a beach below us. The tide came up high. We waited for a while but then Dad decided to walk through it but I didn't want to get my phone wet. There was an episode of The Young Ones which had lots of explosions and stuff and had good effects. Vyvyan was doing it and looked at the camera with a smile. Then there was a building surrounded by hedges. Some bad people came and I hid in the building, but they saw me and I tried to get out. I lay on a floating platform which was wobbly and scary. I peeled glass off the window and tore the flywire and crawled out. I ran along the hedges and had some plan to get them but I can't remember what it was."
"3782"	"(2011-02-22 (20)) I was at Comic-Con, which was different. There were lots of guests and they were all split into different locations. Morena Baccarin and Nicholas Brendon were there. James Masters and someone else were in another spot. I got there early but they weren't coming out until later. There was a movie playing and as it ended, I snuck out. There was a long line to buy tickets, but it was moving fast. I didn't know what to do so I asked if we had to buy them now and they said no. I walked past and then I realised I was supposed to, but I'd already gone. Someone asked me what my dog was called and I said Rover. Spaceman was climbing on me on the floor. Morena Baccarin stroked him and accidentally touched my face. I posted a status on Facebook about whether I should get her autograph. Some random person commented saying 'why don't you make the decision yourself' and a long comment. Nicholas Brendon had a starshaped piercing. I was hanging with them. I was trying to find an ATM and asked Morena but she didn't know. Someone gave me a stamp. James Masters was at his booth signing stuff. Nicholas Brendon had to leave, so he was replaced with Matt Morrison who joined us. I left to find an ATM and found one backstage. There was a horse and I said 'do you own a horse? I disconnect'. I opened a door and it moved and looked more like a pony. I said the horse escaped and they chased after it. There was a shop and a black woman swiped a key card and got money out."
"3783"	"(2011-02-24 (20)) We knew Greg Sestero a little. We went to his house for some reason. He seemed to want me to leave after a while. I packed my stuff up; I had my phone, water and some other stuff and went to the carpark. There were 4 red cars in a row and then another a bit further away. Greg came out and got in a car with other people and they took off. I took a photo. Samantha was pregnant and made a post on Facebook. I found out I was pregnant too and then we were in the True Blood world. I was seeing Eric, but had had an affair with Sam, which is why I was pregnant. We asked for someone's advice and they asked how I had gotten pregnant and Eric said 'she had an affair' and seemed annoyed about it, but didn't really show it. There was a game with a hose and a water slide and you had to use the hoses to climb up while reading out lyrics. I forgot the lyrics to the song and a hose fell and then another one did too. I tried to work it out and get out. At one point, Sam was bending over and he was wearing tight jeans. Ezra had a smoke which was made from acid and no-one seemed bothered."
"3784"	"(2011-03-01 (20)) I was at university in a computer room playing Spider Solitaire. I had an achievements window open. A guy had used hacks to get them all. I found a phone sim that had everyone's birthdays on it. University was big and was like a shop on the inside. I walked to the carpark and there were lots of red cars. I realised I was in the wrong section because I had gone to the shop section. I went back in and then I was with Ezra. There was a zoo section with big tigers. There was a shop and the clothes were all like 2XL+ and Ezra was trying on 6XL and when he came out the shirt was nowhere to be seen. He reached up his shorts and it was there. We got food with Dad. We got some meat and I had fish with tomato sauce. Mom watched a clip of a re-enacted scene from Community with Chevy Chase. I told her to go to the proper one. There was a place at university which people from Firefly -- including Nathan Fillion and Adam Baldwin. Meredith (Grey's Anatomy) was on top of a cupboard. I took a photo to upload to Facebook."
"3785"	"(2011-03-02 (20)) Mom was pregnant and pretty far along. I drove her somewhere and we got into this big argument and we yelled loudly and I got angry. Then it was a movie. These 4 teens/young adults were at this house. There were dragons in this building across the road and they could talk. They had to sleep on this 3 layer platform outside. Three moved to a lower layer and one left and went inside. It showed a dragon stabbing a blanket and then it showed them sleeping underneath. A guy inside came up from a trapdoor to the basement. There was a hologram of these nerdy collector cards if you took this carpet away. He ended up finding out all this information about it and got armour and special powers. He took some others to this bridge thing. They had to hold hands and touch this thing and hold their hands up high and aim at the bad guy (who was fighting the good guy). It was hard to keep your balance though and they lost the first time."
"3786"	"(2011-03-05 (20)) Mom was pregnant and went to get an abortion. I told her to roll the car after getting 3 random numbers. I also used a syringe to take a small amount of fluid. After rolling the car, we stopped in at a drive thru place. This guy said we didn't have to do the car roll. Ezra was in a shop and he came out and asked if they did anything to her and she said no, that she did it herself and he said 'I'm so stupid' as he had told the checkout girls and they weren't allowed to say anything for a certain number of days. On Facebook, Ezra sent a private messaging saying that a friend of mine had sent him pictures of me drunk and I said 'I've never been drunk, or drank alcohol -- it's not me!'."
"3787"	"(2011-03-06 (20)) I met Javier Bardem and he had been interested in me so I had sex with him. We had also spent a bit of time together. Some people and I were hiding out somewhere. Someone else and I went to a police station to check a file. A policewoman came into the room and was like 'did you check the conversation in the file?' and we said no and she saw paperclips in the wall and knew we were lying, but she was friendly towards us so let us go. Later, we were near a school at home time and got into a fight as kids streamed out of the classes. We called a hospital and there was a code we needed to get an ambulance. A guy and I tried to swing out legs around this tree but we couldn't. The guy pulled a log thing out of the tree and hurled something down this hill and a car almost hit it. Four of us got onto a bike."
"3788"	"(2011-03-06 (20)) Foxtel had heaps of music channels. Some girls had been watching TV. Ezra and I took the remote and I saw something on Jean-Luc Godard. I said to Ezra that he wouldn't like it. The girls changed the channel, but I had the remote so turned off Foxtel. They left and I put it back on. The music channels played You Spin Me Right Round and In Dreams and I said 'ooh! Roy Orbison!'. They also had Electric Light Orchestra and OMD stations and sound bites from A Fish Called Wanda. Mom said she wanted to get another dog and I joked 'is Rover not good enough for you?'."
"3789"	"(2011-03-08 (20)) I was in my room and Mom came in with some muffin things. They were long and rectangular. I ate it and Ezra said they were stronger than his ones and I asked if they were space cakes and she said yes. I said that I had work later and she was like 'so' and I said that I couldn't drive high. She told me to take the bus and I said that wasn't the point. I started to feel hot and my heart started racing fast and I kept shivering. Some time later I was at work. I was there a few hours early, so I had a different job to do. I was cooking in the back area, which was different and bigger and had a second storey. I had to go to the toilet and it was in the middle of the floor. Isaak told me to use the other one on the stairs which had this see-through sheet which you had to lower. I couldn't work out how to go safely so I left. When I came back it had been taken down. I used the middle one instead and I had my period so I put a cup there and then peed."
"3790"	"(2011-03-09 (20)) I went back to highschool to redo it to change my course at university. Darius and Eugene were also in my class. Darius sat next to me and a short time later, he and Eugene were talking about something that I couldn't hear but it turned out they both liked me. They more than hinted that at this girl sitting in front of us. I whispered something and she told me to shut up and I yelled at her. I was in a car later and she smashed a rock on my bonnet. I got out and smashed her phone and hit her in the stomach with a rock and drove off. I went to this place in the forest and asked Darius to lie and said that she smashed her phone and I only hit her once after she threatened me. She overheard me and said he didn't have to lie. Then I was at a resort place with Eugene and we were dating. I followed him to our room and was searching through everywhere, opening cupboards and I was touching his clothes. There was a folder with school work and something that he'd written mentioned 'homosex' and I laughed. He said 'I love you' to me. Then this girl was having an affair with this old guy. He turned into a fish and then it was a movie and it was shot like Zelig. At the end, he turned completely into a fish and was on the floor. She put him in a bowl."
"3791"	"(2011-03-10 (20)) I was at a school. There were two schools there and the other one got angry at ours for some reason and they started fighting. People had knives and people were dying. I hid in a toilet and there was a hole in the wall and I snuck out. Everyone came around the corner but I didn't know who was who. A friend of Eugene's was dead. I said there was an island we could go to to hide. This guy threatened us with a knife and we put our hands up and watched him but he just left. To get to this island, we first had to go to this small island which had a river thing with a waterfall and a house. We sat in a boat and were sprayed with water which would teleport us. At some point, I had a son and a husband but I chose to get rid of them to be with Eugene."
"3792"	"(2011-03-12 (20)) I was at a house with Dad, Eugene, Darius and Jeremiah. Eugene had this video in a dodgy lounge for safe keeping. It was from some really hard achievement in a game. If he lost the tape, he would lose everything. He had a photo with Joss Whedon who had been at a book signing and I was jealous. I said I almost got one with Nathan Fillion once, as I'd met him in a doorway at a nightclub [I was thinking of a previous dream] . I leaned on the lounge and fell back, but the video was ok. He told me to be careful. I did it again, but barely touched it and it all fell apart and I fell over it and hurt myself. The video tapes shot out and Eugene came to check it and they were bent. He looked devastated. We weren't friends, but he didn't yell or anything. I sent a message apologizing to him. I cried at one point because I was sad for him and because I'd probably lost any chance of being with him. I was talking to Jeremiah on MSN and he said to not worry about it and that it was just a game and that Eugene places too much importance in it."
"3793"	"(2011-03-12 (20)) I was driving home and went past Kingsway shops and there were police. When I got to the traffic lights, all the power went out and it was pitch black. An ambulance was coming down Hepburn Ave and I figured something was happening there. The lights were out the rest of the way home. Then I was walking and it was dark and spooky. There was a laundromat at the back end of some shops and this guy walked out. He followed me and asked me where I was doing and I said 'just up there'. He seemed dodgy so I started walking the other way towards this female hospital which had lights on. I told him and he was like 'oh, that's clever'. They had a big bus and he had a knife and threatened to kill us all (there were more than 50 people there). We crowded into the bus and he was like 'do you feel safe up high on something that collapse at any second?'. And this girl said 'I know who he is, his last name's McArthur'. He was the son of some guy who had died and a girl had taken his building and left it, but the stuff was old and collapsing. He fought to take it and restore it/knock it down. We got there and we lay on top of these shelves. There were magazines like silk. This lady offered me a collar and lead for a dog which was from some houses I'd applied for."
"3794"	"(2011-03-13 (20)) I was at Nana's, out the back. Uncle Wilbur showed me a video of when I was younger, hopping around in an animal costume. I went on the computer and Mom was with me. There was something about a movie on the wall that Dad and I saw and it said that it had been mailed to Ulrich Thomsen. I explained to Mom that he was in my second favourite movie. She asked why I hadn't invited Nana and I said that we did and that she was sitting right there, but she couldn't leave. Dad and I were then in Amsterdam and Dad wanted to break into a hotel we were staying in to check it out before having to pay to stay there."
"3795"	"(2011-03-14 (20)) I was with Casey and Sarah (Chuck). We were in a carpark and had to get into some place. Casey had to put on an accent which sounded really bad. Sarah and I were like 'for once, we don't have to put on an accent'. We got in there and there was a computer which scanned fingerprints and illegally had spy information. Casey put his finger on it and it came up with his file. He went to leave and a lady saw it and went after him and caught all of us. We were brought to this torture room 'for the Aussies' and it was a heat room. It was very hot in there, but we got out somehow. Later, I was with a girl and she flashed some guy saying 'he won't let you in otherwise'. We got to the door of this pub/club and he let her in but not me, so I flashed him and he let me in. It separated into 3 sections and only the middle one was open and it was crowded. This girl collapsed in a pool of blood and died. She had just gotten married. There was a young guy at the bar and he said 'there's a bad Christmas flu going around. I developed a cure, but sometimes it kills'."
"3796"	"(2011-03-16 (20)) Ezra and I went to see Battle: Los Angeles and it was directed by Michael Bay. I said that I hated him. It started off boring and then it started to turn into a disaster film and it had ok effects. There was a big tsunami thing and buildings were collapsing. This girl tried to make a guy stay with her and drown. He grabbed this thing and survived. There were lots of wooden boards floating around to save people."
"3797"	"(2011-03-16 (20)) I was in a room. I had a bed, TV and I was lying on the floor with a pillow. I was dating a guy who looked like a young Rupert Everett. I thought he was gay but he came in and we started flirting and kissing and we had sex. I was then at Nana's. I was rolling around on the floor with a pillow, thinking about him. Nana walked by the window and I thought it was zombies at first. It got to 2pm and I said that I had to go home because I had a test. Dad and Ezra were like ok. I asked Nana if the internet was fast enough for Youtube (it wasn't) or if the scanner worked (it didn't). I panicked and said we had to leave. It got to 2:50pm and I said I'd just have to do the test here."
"3798"	"(2011-03-17 (20)) I was at home, but it was a new house. We used to have an outside fridge which I had lollies and other things in. It was gone now, but Mom had just moved the lollies which I later found in the lounge room. Granma came in and I said ""oh... hi"" and she mumbled unhappily about it. There was a picture of Chris Colfer on display, as well as many others. She asked 'do you think that guy is gay' and I didn't know which picture she meant and then when I realised I said yeah and said that we met him, then he kept being over all the time but I wasn't inviting him over (Mom was). She made a joke that he was dating Ezra. I remembered a video I'd made with Cory Monteith talking to me as I filmed it. This guy was in love with a rat. It got hurt and he was angry at it. It could talk and stuff, but it was a bit weird. The rat crawled to the door and he told me to close it. I got a person to say these 'dying words' and the door opened and it died. He put it in his pocket and we tried to convince him to remember another way."
"3799"	"(2011-03-18 (20)) I was at home, but it was different and possibly a new house. My room was big and had a desk and a bed. It didn't have carpet. Cuddles came in and a small slug dropped off her. There were heaps of slugs around my door, including this big brown snake thing. I told Mom and she told me to spray this stuff everywhere. It ate through things so I had to put the LAN cord and all my cords up high."
"3800"	"(2011-03-19 (20)) I was at the old house in my room. Ezra was watching TV in bed, across the hall. Three zombies came down the hall and I used these long metal things to stab them. They kept coming and it was like a game and they had to be stabbed with certain things. A later level was in the living room and some needed to be stabbed with a long pole and others with something else and I had one in each hand and twirled and killed them. Later I was with a group of people and I said I had been on my own since then and they let me go to finish killing them. I killed two hard ones and then there was a 'ghoul' and it required a weapon that I didn't have, so I ran and almost ran out of health. They were annoyed with me after that."
"3801"	"(2011-03-20 (20)) I was watching something with Ezra. James Spader was in it and was wearing a tight red jacket and looked really hot. I thought he seemed gay and then he kissed this other guy and I was happy about it. Ezra said he didn't want to watch it and I said 'it's the 80s, it won't be graphic', but he left. It ended up being quite graphic for an 80s film with a graphic sex scene."
"3802"	"(2011-03-25 (20)) I was watching The Amanda Show, but it was actually with Drew Barrymore who hosted it from the ages of 3-10. Drake Bell was 13 and had had a kid at that age but separated with the mother until he was 'of age'. I told Mom about this in the kitchen. Then I was in France with Mom. There was a shop and I found Alain Delon related merchandise on a shelf. There were also his personal belongings. There was also a diary I liked. I realised there was a queue behind me, so I took the diary. Mom said she only had $20 and no Francs. I said I had money and the lady behind the counter said that she could convert the currency. I told Mom to 'shut up' and the lady behind the counter said I should shut up too and I said she'd been driving me crazy. I realised I had grabbed the wrong diary and I went back, but it was gone. I got an alternative and she said it cost ""2x5"" and I said it was too expensive. I was walking with Dad on a big road. There was a bridge with a huge drop. Cars were driving vertically down and I walked behind Dad and we had to hold hands to walk down."
"3803"	"(2011-03-26 (20)) There were slow zombies. There were patches of people still alive. I was at a school place and the kids there weren't helping out. This lady called a meeting and everyone ran to this room and sat down. The door to the room was saloon like (it was a kitchen) and it didn't close. The zombies got in and I was near the door. I told everyone to be still and the zombies just walked past, looked around and kept walking. When some of them passed, everyone scattered. A few others and I sat at some desks. The zombies just walked past again. Later, only a few of us were left. Analisa was there and I asked her about the stopover times for America and the UK. She said it was as few days for America and 15 days for the UK. Then I was in an area that had something to do with science. The rooms were full of medicine and stuff. We looked outside and lots of zombies were coming (we were like the last ones left). We went into this freezer to hide. Then it was a game. Ezra and I had this thing out the back of the old house. It was sort of like a vertical bullet and was like a TARDIS inside. It also had this tight spot with a pee box and a big toilet. People would come sometimes to trade stuff or they would just steal. We discovered a way to beam up to space. There was a call from some official people, including Poppa."
"3804"	"(2011-03-27 (20)) I went into work for a bit as Isaak had called me in. A guy I didn't know was working there and he couldn't remember what I did there and I left out the back and it was still light outside. My car was out the front near the road. This guy had a gun and I ignored it and got into my car. He came over and I locked my door and started the car and left. Then I was being chased by the cops and others. I drove to some hard to find building and went in looking for someone."
"3805"	"(2011-03-27 (20)) I was at Nana's. I got splinters in my hand and 3 on the edge of my left thumb. There weren't any tweezers because she had 'sold them at 11.45'. I found some big, dull tweezers and tried to get them out of my hand. They were under raised skin and it was easy to grab the edge and the splinters would just slide out."
"3806"	"(2011-03-31 (20)) I was at Sorrento which was different. I went to a restaurant with friends. I was dating a guy and we were there with another couple. I had now become interested in Ryan Cartwright who was a friend of mine, and another girl was interested in my boyfriend. I was at a table and my chair was close to Ryan's and our legs touched. I got up and sat at a table with some other people. A homeless guy was asking for money and I said ""I literally have no money"". Then I was there with Dad and Rover. I got this sausage with ham in it and gave it to Rover. I was then walking with Ezra at night and I said ""but we forgot Rover"" and he said it didn't matter. Then the girl from before told me she liked my boyfriend and I said I didn't know why we hadn't 'swapped'. I think we eventually did. There was a movie or a TV scene where I lay on top of this guy and kissed and rolled around. There was a list of all the guys filling in and it was 16 or so different celebrities."
"3807"	"(2011-04-02 (20)) I was watching a movie set in the future. This lady was the boss of this company. There were lots of bottomless drops between desks and sections. She yelled at everyone about something. Some people had devised a plan to steal her pills. I was there. Everyone brought me stuff as a cover to get the pills. Kevin (The Office) had a piece of paper with a name on it and I said 'what am I supposed to do with this?'. There was a round container with pink mesh on it and this girl had two of them; one was to stop her period. I took one to give to the guy to look after it. Adam Baldwin played a character in it and had a daughter called Alex. This girl collected animals in a car for something and it crashed. Someone decided to save the baby animals and they were upside down in the car. Then I was with Mom and Ezra at a shop. There was a game where you had to look for this lady with the lights off. I crawled to look. There was something to do with Emma Thompson. Then Rover was on the floor and Jensen Ackles was next to him and I said to Ezra 'you just wanna touch Jensen'. Dad couldn't find the lady and made us leave. Nana wanted to play Runescape."
"3808"	"(2011-04-03 (20)) Mom and I went to a screening of The Room. It was the 2nd April and that was the anniversary of the first release and we all got DVDs. They showed weird ads/short films with Paul Rudd first and I was confused."
"3809"	"(2011-04-03 (20)) I was at school. My seat was next to Eugene's. Ms Solomon started writing up codes and numbers for us to copy. She checked them and gave the people who finished this hot, flaming tea. She asked who lived in Midvale and Eugene put his hand up. She gave me a list of people for him to seek out to give information. There were big pieces of paper and lots of stuff was written on it. Darius got up and was being silly with it. Then I was with some people at a basketball court a while away. Some people from another school came and had these little marker things and were creepy. Then we were in a different class and I was still next to Eugene. I had to climb around the back of his chair. He was wearing a Spongebob shirt. Then I was at a shop and there were zombies. A baby was turned and it started talking and went rabid. No-one wanted to kill it."
"3810"	"(2011-04-04 (20)) Hoyt (True Blood) came through a drive thru. I was thinking that he knew of something? Dad served him and he asked him if he could call me. Dad asked me and I said yes. We organised to meet at some point. We met up and were chatting and flirting, then he came up behind me and turned me slowly around to face him and we kissed. We stopped after a while and he just held me. I was thinking that he was adorable and that I was happy. I talked to someone about animation and I said I liked Spirited Away but no other anime. I watched Ren & Stimpy but it looked different with crappy animation."
"3811"	"(2011-04-06 (20)) I was at a school. Usually I'd leave at a certain time to get to work. People were distracting me and when I checked the time, it was 5.15pm and was late. I was already dressed, but panicked and said that I'd never been there later than 5 minutes early. This guy kept annoying me. I couldn't find my keys. He came up to me with my keys and it turned out he had taken my car. He said he just took it up the road and 'Angela' got in and kissed him. I ran to my car and it was now 5 minutes from start time. I called Chicken Treat and it was the wrong number and some music store. Isaak called me saying ""Izzy?"" and I said my car had been taken but that I was leaving now. They called in another guy to help me. Outside there was a tree with fruit in baskets and some were rotten. Chris O'Dowd and some others were there. One of them said something about something we did last night -- a 'drunken adventure'. There was a video of Chris blowing himself up in a car (though not really)."
"3812"	"(2011-04-09 (20)) I was with some people and there was a group of people dressed in green who decided to come after us. We ran down a street and this guy and I ducked into a hotel building. The people went back because all the buildings were closed. One of them came in to the hotel and followed us. They confronted us on a balcony thing. We ended up getting away. Then we were running up stairs and they all looked the same. Every floor above us had people waiting. I said to the guy we should duck into this room. They opened the door and I waited to hear the cock of a gun but there was none; it was just a guy reading something and he said it was boring. We ended up in this big gym like room. One guy was Timothy Olyphant. There were 2 doors and 2 cops came through. There was a ladder up to this area which had another door out. This guy went up and I couldn't reach, so I put my arms around the guy from before and he climbed up. The door led to these air ducts which were made of tent-like material. The guy from the room caught on fire. I grabbed something in the duct and it collapsed and they shot the guy and put him in the fire."
"3813"	"(2011-04-11 (20)) I was in a building and there were evil people trying to kill us and keep us in there. Elijah was there and we escaped and ended up in the 'wall between the elevators'. We hit the buttons and I had worked there and led us to this spot, but then there were no buttons. We opened the door and we were trapped."
"3814"	"(2011-04-11 (20)) Two years ago, Lilja (Lilja 4-ever) was put in a time machine and it looked like those water things they have in offices. There was a lever hanging off it which was supposed to open it, but only at certain times, but someone said it would make it explode. Ezra and I were outside with it. I said 'she's been in there for 4 years' and gave it a little push, but it started to fall and the top of it popped off. They tried to find a way to open it and had to call a place. Then Mom and I were trying to go somewhere by jumping a fence. Mom made noises as if she was hurt and a group of people, including Jeremiah and Eugene, were hanging around. I laughed and called her a noob. I easily got over the fence. She had taken her shoes off too. There was another drop to some train tracks. I told her not to follow me. I went back over to get her shoes. I opened a way for her and Eugene described how to beat the boss -- there were shelves of chocolate biscuits and it would put them to sleep. We filled them up fast."
"3815"	"(2011-04-13 (20)) I watched half of the silent Napoleon film and thought it was ok, but couldn't remember it very well. I discussed it on our Movies 2 group on Facebook."
"3816"	"(2011-04-17 (20)) Someone turned into a werewolf (An American Werewolf in London style) and I knew that's where the inspiration came from because I heard Moondance playing, then Bad Moon Rising. I climbed to this top shelf and hid behind some containers. The werewolf came in and I accidentally knocked a container and it ended up eating Mom. Then I ran and went into this room and jumped on these beds and knocked all these things off. It was now a dog. I was at a party and Teresa was there and mentioned something of mine and I didn't remember putting it on Facebook. Then I started a conversation with Benjamin and Vikram. Benjamin said some movie was horrible and Vikram said he thought it was ok and Benjamin explained that he meant 'horrible images', but it was a joke. I hated it. They mentioned Amarcord if it had been directed by Kurosawa."
"3817"	"(2011-04-18 (20)) I was at the old house and I had a boyfriend. Something happened and he left and I followed him, pleading him to stay away from the car and he broke up with me by saying that he was 'busy for a year'. I was upset and went back in. Dad and Ezra got into an argument and Dad said he saw what he did with Emery last night. He called Mom saying he wasn't a virgin and it turned out he had had sex with Emery. Ezra was quiet and upset about it."
"3818"	"(2011-04-18 (20)) A guy took his girlfriend and ran off and people were sent after him. Then it was me and this girl. It was night and we were jumping over walls and then it was day. We hid in a university but this cop came. The girl was sleeping and I told her to run. I walked out the door with an American accent and pretended to be someone else, but this guy stopped me and knew I was faking. There was an argument and the girl ran off and I followed her. We went to a park with a 'magical' forest and she was tired and saw elves, which carried her. The guy found us again."
"3819"	"(2011-04-19 (20)) I was talking to Benjamin on MSN. I mentioned I was watching this movie and Linus said he loved it and it affected him deeply. It got to 2.30am and I went to bed. The next morning, the chat log showed us talking for longer and he decided to go on mic for about an hour. I didn't remember it at all. I told Mom that we had been chatting from 8pm to 4am. She was getting a cold off me, as well as Darren and Ezra. I gave her the cold and flu tablets. I told Benjamin I didn't remember speaking last night and he said he had recorded it."
"3820"	"(2011-04-19 (20)) Dad had auditioned for a part in a movie a while ago. I went along with him to another one which was outside. ELO walked past and I went to Facebook it and saw Robert de Niro and Al Pacino and other famous people. I went inside and went to this room and started chatting with this other lady. She asked me what my favourite genre was and I said 'science fiction and horror... that's it'. Then I was at home in bed and I woke up and Anastasia was in my room and I said ""why are you in my room"" and she said sometimes she needs to apply her heat transfusion bag -- which was a chest thing. I opened something on a rack and the mirror fell off. It reflected another half without me in it. My phone vibrated and I had Facebook notifications from Benjamin and Samantha making a joke about the transfusion bag."
"3821"	"(2011-04-20 (20)) This fat girl called Katie somehow pressured me into taking her to Nana's with us. She disappeared and I realised she took my car and bought something with my debit card, and said she'd give it back. After finding her name, I tried calling her and she hung up. I was worried and angry and Dad said 'you're the one that brought her here'."
"3822"	"(2011-04-20 (20)) I was at a house which was Dad's, but not. I was watching a Russian movie with Benjamin over MSN, and there was a girl with me too. I didn't know her very well. She started throwing these little yellow balls (like Bingo ones) and I told her not to because Dad won't like the mess and had recently vacuumed the floors. She ignored me. Then Timothy Olyphant was there and was Mickey (Scream 2). I wondered why I had the killer there. I pushed onto a table and climbed on top of him and kissed him. I wondered why I was doing this. On Facebook, Benjamin wrote Leif and Arnie' names into a song by The Police he didn't like. I thought the lyrics were Sk8er Boi. He made a joke about 'gasming'."
"3823"	"(2011-04-21 (20)) I was forced to go to a Lady Gaga concert. It was very small and there were seats placed around. I yawned and fidgeted and told the person next to me that I had to review it. Before she came on, they played a 2 hour weird movie. I saw Calvin in the audience but he seemed normal. We played this 'game' to pass out from alcohol. Some time later, there were new words on my shirt. After the show there was something related to a game or movie that cost $16 and Calvin wanted to buy it. We called someone and they said the password was 'Bald', but he ended up not doing it. I was then at home and everything seemed weird. I was talking to Benjamin on MSN and he asked if I like his posts because they're cute or 'make you want to put the cat down' or because they were funny."
"3824"	"(2011-04-24 (20)) It was night, around 9pm, and I decided to go to the movies. I drove to Centerville cinemas and it was different. I was checking the times, then Ezra was with me and we were going to see some 'bad' movie, but we decided to see this other one. Then I was with a guy and he was 3 or 4 years older than me, but really short. He looked younger than me. I liked him though and I was worried that people would think I was dodgy if we dated."
"3825"	"(2011-04-26 (20)) I woke up at 8am and Benjamin and Blaine were going to watch a movie. I asked if they had started and if I could join. I somehow met up with Benjamin and another British guy to watch a martial arts movie. There was a row of recliners on the side of the room. Benjamin was filming it and was better looking in real life and his accent was cute. The movie was silent and weird. We played a zombie shooter game. I watched the video and he had been filming me and my legs. I went to a fast food place with Ezra and some of his friends. There was an Asian guy that I knew from somewhere. I accidentally threw Ezra's burger at his face and he said 'I hate you and said he'd had enough and would kill me, but was over it after a minute. There was a video of Mom taking off an earring that was supposed to be funny."
"3826"	"(2011-04-27 (20)) I was watching the last season of How I Met Your Mother and it was as 12-parter with a huge budget. Barney woke up to their apartment being half blown up. He jumped into some water below and got electrocuted by a TV and made a 'shoot' joke. They said Ted's wife was Robin and saying 'just because you are gullible'. There were waves under the sea which had something to do with milk getting mixed. Later, Benjamin had a long rant about it. I think we were dating, but hadn't actually made it official. We kept saying 'moo' to each other. Gunnar had commented on some posts. Benjamin made a joke about some nudity saying 'if that doesn't get you off, you're on your own'. James posted too and said #17 was beautiful. Benjamin said 'Yeah, I kind of wish she was here with me now lol' and I was sad."
"3827"	"(2011-04-28 (20)) I was at a shop with Mom. She got cheap clothes and also wanted this baby outfit (it was like for the Royal Wedding). A lady said it came with a gold bracelet and I said it was disgusting. She asked if I meant the bracelet and I said I would rather hang out with a child molester. Someone thought there was a bomb at the shop. I hid down near the checkout. Then I was home and tried on a white shirt that was way too small. It was made of netting so had gaps between parts. My other clothes had holes in them. I was talking to Benjamin on Facebook and he pasted something about Edinburgh and I said we were going to Scotland and that we should meet and he agreed."
"3828"	"(2011-04-30 (20)) I was at home and my room was smaller or had more stuff in it. My bed was next to a robe which had drawers. I was talking to Seamus and he mentioned a conversation that me, him and Elijah had all paid $127 a month to hang out, but never did. I had cancelled it not long ago. I went out and talked to Mom. She said (maybe jokingly) to invite him over. I did, in the hopes he would refuse, but he accepted and then I remembered I had to work. It was 6.30pm and I really didn't want to. I got a call from a woman asking if I could do something, saying ""quarter 25 now"". I told Mom that I wasn't going to work and she got angry about it. I had a shower and Seamus opened the door while I was standing in a towel and I closed it. Mom said he was sleeping in my bed and I said ""what's wrong with the lounge?"" and he said 'I don't want to'. I went to my room and my bra and underwear drawers were open and I was annoyed. I was trying to work out what to do. Ezra was on some site like Facebook and posted about my 'geekiness' for watching movies and keeping stats. He made a joke about Seamus being my friend."
"3829"	"(2011-05-01 (20)) I got a letter saying that I had a dentist appointment at 9pm tomorrow and it would cost $87. I also had something else to go to at 10.40[m. I went to some place and checked my phone for the Movies group and Dad had posted and I asked why he was in that group. He said Gunnar invited him. Then Dad was with me and we went out to the car. Rover and a black dog were there and it kept going in my car and then lying on top of Rover. I tried to get rid of it and it somehow 'fell up' into my car. I waited for the owner to come out and then it was tiny and in a bottle. There was a greenhouse type of thing and the door was thin and wiry, but started to crush me. Ezra and his friend were there and were ignoring me. I couldn't breathe and then managed to get away. Benjamin was then there. I was in a car with him and Mom and it was awkward. He said he was getting messages all the time recently and Mom was like 'oh, because of Izzy, she's always checking her phone' and he said he doesn't go online with his phone."
"3830"	"(2011-05-06 (20)) I was at a shop. A little kid held my leg and I had to drag him along. I was then with Dad and Ezra. Then I was driving with someone and they wanted to stop at Centerville cinema and it was totally different. We went in and it was really quiet. Then she was Emma Roberts. Then people were dressed as characters from Alice in Wonderland. They closed a curtain and put on a dance. Emma Roberts went up herself and she was good. She did this backwards smooth very smoothly. We left. Our car was blue. She had changed settings on something which annoyed me."
"3831"	"(2011-05-07 (20)) I needed to go to university and Mom wanted to pick Ezra up along the way. I was annoyed because it wasn't on the way there, but I had to pick up some clothes anyway. It looked different and fancier. The beach was different too and there were lots of shops. I went to the movies and saw an animated film with Mia Kirshner as one of the voice actors. I mentioned it to Benjamin later on the Movies group. I was then at the shop and there was a weird bird thing with a baby and you had to let it sniff you or it would attack. It kicked my leg. I left with Dad and Ezra. Then I was at the shop with Mom and there were broken ornaments. Mom asked a lady why and she told us about these people who brought them back saying they were broken but had come back months later admitting it had been their fault. They were back to try and become friends with her to get something out of her and she cried. Jake Johnson was at a shop offering people free samples and called me out and gave me a Snickers."
"3832"	"(2011-05-10 (20)) I was at a party. Benjamin was actually 18, though I thought he was 20. I wasn't sure how I felt about him being only 18. I don't remember the party very well, but afterwards the house was spotless and I was impressed at how well they cleaned it up."
"3833"	"(2011-05-12 (20)) I was with Mom and Darren. I had my stuff in the car but had to go back to this hotel thing for a bit and they drove off without me. I asked someone to use a phone but none of them could call mobiles. I went on the forum and there were posts about the Turkish mafia films."
"3834"	"(2011-05-16 (20)) Tanita was at an AC/DC concert and bought tickets to something where she'd be 'next to a running TV'. She had posted this on Facebook and no-one had commented on it and she was upset. She got them to stop the concert and call someone for her. Gunnar knew her. She had said she had cancer and Gunnar was annoyed at this. I was leaving this place at night, walking through the carpark. I got into my car and locked my doors and wound my window up. I was driving down the road, which was a dirt path, and there was a guy with a gun. I went another way, but there was another one and I had to keep driving around. Gunnar was there and helped me. I was really scared."
"3835"	"(2011-05-17 (20)) I went on the forum and it was different. Someone had made a joke about Benjamin and I being married. Arnie had left and had closed his account because Facebook was screwing up too much (they were combined somehow). I asked Benjamin about it. Then in real life, Benjamin and I were in a big, old house with no windows (like post-apocalyptic like). We each had a gun and heard a noise and we were sneaking around trying to hide. There were 3 girls and a guy and then we saw more, so we gave up. Later, Benjamin and I were in bed which was just a mattress on the floor. Then it wasn't us and this guy kissed her shoulder and she pushed him away. He did it again and she didn't resist. She then blurted out that she wasn't a virgin, using some word like 'skag''."
"3836"	"(2011-05-20 (20)) I joined a group on Facebook for FilmForum and it had less than 10 members. Raquel and Leif were friends on Facebook. I wondered who she was on FilmForum and thought she was Mary Rose for a second, but then remembered she wouldn't have seen more films than me. There was something being filmed outside. I had a microphone that was like a flat map and I realised the person hadn't filmed lots of things. There was a kid on some rocks near the water being interviewed. There was a zoo which a mouse creature. I had a big lamington and it kept grabbing at it. It had a long nose and was weird looking. I was then with Mom and I finally got to the and ate the lamington. I offered some to Mom and she said 'ew, lamington' and I offered her more and then remembered she didn't like them. I ate half and then gave her the rest."
"3837"	"(2011-05-27 (20)) I was at Nana's and people were after us. I was outside and realised bad guys were coming and I went inside. I went to a room at the back and hid in a cupboard. I heard them tell Poppa that they had everyone and he said 'what about the dog' and a guy turned into a dog and sniffed around in the room. They found me and pulled me out. Later, I was on my computer and I had sent an offline MSN message to Benjamin and he had sent a weird reply. He said his uncle did it and suggested we talk on this game via inbox instead. He had two messages from his family and one of them was from a cousin in France. Nathan Fillion added me after seeing that I was a fan of him on Facebook."
"3838"	"(2011-06-01 (20)) I was talking to Vikram on MSN, then went to make food. The house was different and had a big kitchen. There were sandwiches and cakes on a plate and they kept getting taken. I asked Mom and she said it wasn't her. I went back to my room with lunch. I was in the lounge room at the old house and there were ads for Chicken Treat and Chicken Treat stuff all over the room, including a uniform. Then I was at a shop. There were shelves with bed sheets. I grabbed one and pulled off something that was eating it and I was surprised. Someone pulled a light green one off the shelf and then it was Arnie. He sat at a bench next to mine, then Vikram joined. Arnie asked Vikram something and he replied and I felt weird, then I remembered I hadn't heard them speak before. Neither had much of an accent. Arnie said 'don't make fun of my accen't and Vikram said 'that's part of the fun' and I said 'what about mine, that's going to get some laughs'."
"3839"	"(2011-06-01 (20)) Benjamin, Gunnar, Vikram and I used to regularly go to this restaurant where they served 4 meals at each table. Ours was Hababam. I had Kaldi, Benjamin and the first one, Gunnar had Tatilde and Vikram had Uyaniyor. Vikram was the only one who was always the same, the others kept changing who they were. I sat next to Vikram and across from Benjamin. On the day, they changed the theme and we were annoyed at requested Hababam meals anyway. One had a long piece of cucumber."
"3840"	"(2011-06-04 (20)) Mom was having people over. She asked me to get these mats to put up on the windows to keep cool (like small window shield things). I wanted to watch the lamest films first for our mafia watching. We watched Vuk and left it because Benjamin liked it. I played a game called Fockle which was a word game based on a TV show."
"3841"	"(2011-06-06 (20)) I woke up late for an exam. I got to the train station and the next train was 10 minutes away and each station would be another 10 minutes. I asked Mom to drive me or I'd be late. I got there when there was only 40 minutes left of the exam."
"3842"	"(2011-06-08 (20)) Benjamin and I went to the movies. I was in the car and realised I didn't have a bra on and put my jumper on and my bag in front of me to cover it, but realised you couldn't tell. He bought tickets and put change into this thing which gave out things. He put in a few dollars and got a tiny chocolate that we split in two."
"3843"	"(2011-06-09 (20)) Benjamin and I were leaders of this secret group. We invited someone else to it. There was a bunk bed and he climbed into the top bunk and shared with some guy. Benjamin and I shared a bed. I was at university, which was different, and I got my results and had passed altogether, though had failed 2 units."
"3844"	"(2011-06-11 (20)) I met with Benjamin and his parents. His 'grandfather' was asking me questions about my feet and health and said 'well you two should get started on some grandchildren'."
"3845"	"(2011-06-13 (20)) I was talking to Leif on MSN and sent him a message Benjamin had sent me about Linus, then thought maybe I shouldn't show it. Then Benjamin came online and we talked about Linus. Mom was in the bathroom getting ready to go out. Rover and Spaceman were on the floor and Rover was barking nonstop so I went out to see what was going on."
"3846"	"(2011-06-17 (20)) I went to the old house with Mom. A guy broke into the car and took my laptop and some other stuff. We went back and got something back but the rest was gone and I realised it was Quincy who had taken them. I said that I'd ruined Darren's chances of getting a job unless I got it back. Ezra was there. Quincy was on the phone and yelling saying 'she's telling the truth' and that he'd already gotten rid of it. I said I wanted money then. He said ""I'll give you $50"" and I said I needed at least $300-$400."
"3847"	"(2011-06-17 (20)) I was at university and Dad introduced me to Audrey Tautou who he had met there. They were hanging out. At one point she was talking to Ryan, who also went to Westland, about how Amelie was originally not going to be a film, talking about the script and 'talk' and she said ""not the right... what's the word?"" and I said 'medium?' and she said 'median'. Later, Dad gave me this wine in a fancy bowl/glass and mixed them together and it exploded."
"3848"	"(2011-06-23 (20)) I watched Dr Strangelove with Ezra and some others. The end was similar, but different to what I remembered and they found it funny and I said I didn't anymore and brought it down a rating. They had accidentally started the countdown but had stopped it, and then the guy was on the bomb. Ezra and I were outside on the grass and I said I'd been outside heaps lately because of reading at Nana's. Uncle Wilbur and Mom were there. She made a joke about him being single and in his 40s and said that I'd be copying him/beating him and I said 'that's what I wanted'. Queer as Folk had different endings. There was one that people said was ""like 2004 style Queer as Folk"" and Stuart had an orgy with 3 guys. This black American woman moved in with 2 gay guys who owned a business that allowed people to move in with gay people. The room for them was soundproof. She said 'I spend most of my time caring for this child' and was very posh. She said 'as long as the latest you go to bed is 2am, it should be fine'. Brian showed up there."
"3849"	"(2011-06-24 (20)) I was going to go on holiday by myself the weekend before our holiday started, but I forgot and it cost me $1500. We lived at the old house and Nana was over and she said she'd pay for it. She bought me a new ticket and I missed that flight too."
"3850"	"(2011-06-24 (20)) I don't know where I was, but there were big steps going to a school. A fat guy could hear thoughts and was trying to get my attention but I didn't notice. There were lots of toilets and 2 were for marriage and the rest had sex. I went to the marriage one and he followed me in. I was peeing and couldn't stop and tried to shoo him away, but he wouldn't leave. Then I was playing an online game with Bernard and Benjamin. Bernard kept killing me and they had killed over 2000 people and I killed about 4. They stopped and I got to level 2 and could change my title and species. There was an eel type of thing which was better than my current one. Murlocs looked like little fish and I was collecting them. I went a bit further and there were lots of lollies and biscuits etc, all going to a vending machine. Benjamin got the guy who ran it to put some in a container for me."
"3851"	"(2011-06-26 (20)) I reorganised my room, which was big and different. Mom and Darren had stuff in there too and wanted to look through it. I said I was going through my private stuff and they had to wait. I was later on the computer talking to Benjamin and he said he got a girlfriend and that he hadn't dated since he was 12. I was annoyed and wished it had been me and sighed. He said something like 'it's so perfect' which implied he didn't have a girlfriend, but then I wasn't sure if he was joking or not."
"3852"	"(2011-07-06 (20)) I went to the cinema and saw about 10 minutes of Tree of Life. Casey Affleck was in it as Jesse James and was like 'this is my land' in a gravelly droning voice every few seconds and it was really annoying. The cinematography was nice though. The next session was starting but our plane was in 2 hours. Benjamin and I found 2 dogs and a few children dead with their heads cut off. I thought Rover or another dog did it, but then this bad CGI purple rock type humanoid monster came and finished them off. It talked to us and teased us, eating any people that came and we hid in a building. We then ran out to a car. It ordered pizza and ate the delivery man. Then after a while it silently took the car doors off and turned out all the lights. I closed my eyes, scared, and waited for it to kill me."
"3853"	"(2011-07-09 (20)) There was a sign mentioning Calvin doing some dance/show thing. There was a video called 'Tubby' and Benjamin, James and someone else were in it. Mom saw it and thought it was funny. At some point people from FilmForum were around and I asked if Poopsie was there and she asked who that was and I said 'James' and she knew who I was talking about. She said he was good-looking and that there was another good-looking one and I was like 'ok...'. The tubby thing was like a Tiny Teddy cartoon. Benjamin had written a bunch of short stories which featured me (and others). These alien guys came down and they had been in one too, but they got in trouble or something so had to come and fix it (we didn't know they were real). The stuff in the books was coming true and they had fixed some of it to come true and I realised they were going to kill me, but Benjamin hadn't clicked on yet. He eventually did. I started running through the house and they chased me. I ran into a bedroom and tried to open the window. It had a little latch, which I opened and jumped out; sliding down the side of the house. There was a car, but the doors were locked so I kept running down the street. I came across a bunch of bikes and took one and started riding. I ended up fairly far away, but then my friend, Vinny (who was now the guy who had written the stories) - found me and told them my coordinates. I dumped the bike and looked for somewhere to hide. I found a nook in the ground with a bed and stuff (gypsy like) and lay there. They walked past it but then one of them stopped and found me. Vinny was there and had an earring and was all douchey looking and he said 'I need the money'."
"3854"	"(2011-07-13 (20)) It was Harry Potter like - me (Hermione), Arnie (Ron) and Harry were in a building, which I think was our school. I was near a window and someone suddenly and calmly said 'there's a balrog' and everyone started running and screaming. It said it could smell Harry and wouldn't stop until he was dead, so we ran as well. We ended up in these tunnels and there was one that went underwater. Everyone was going in there. The building started falling apart and I went alone into the underwater tunnel, but there were 'spies' there so I went back up. We eventually got away and went to sleep under a tree. We tried lying down, where Arnie would be touching me slightly but it didn't work, so we sat up close to each other and Arnie was leaning on me. Then later it wasn't Harry Potter like anymore. We went to a cinema which was weird and had shops and arcade games everywhere and even a conveyer belt thing like at airports. Then we were at a house. Some stuff had happened that I can't remember and someone said that Arnie was in his room getting stoned. I went in there and he seemed ok, but a little down. We talked for a bit and then we had sex. It 'faded to black' though and the next thing I knew I was waking up with him in bed."
"3855"	"(2011-07-14 (20)) I was being held hostage by two people who i knew, sometimes it was Ezra and a friend. We stopped at this shop place, and at first I was driving this little car thing (they had a gun to my head), but put it down here. They wanted me to drive straight through this crowd of people and I argued it would draw attention, so we went the other way. We were then walking and went through a security check and it beeped for me because I had my phone, money and a thermometer thing. They let us go. At one point, I stole the guy's keys and ran to the car to get away. It was slow to take off and they jumped in and stopped me before I could get anywhere. Later, I was at school. I was called up to the office for news we (Ezra and I) wouldn't want to hear; Darren had died drinking a ""ratty beer"". I wasn't sure whether to be happy or annoyed at this news, because this Darren was a 'bad guy' and I was worried about what money we would survive on."
"3856"	"(2011-07-16 (20)) While we were in London, we decided to go visit Leif in his country. Soccer or something was on, and they gave me a Macedonian scarf to wear for it. I couldn't work out how to put it on and I said I've never worn a scarf. They said I didn't have to wear it if I didn't want to and I said I would, but I'd prefer a local one, so they gave me one. Leif and I went to see Klovn, but it was a different movie to his one. It was in English as well and Aidan Gillen was in it. It was based on something that had happened in Leif's part of the world. There was a celebration thing and then afterwards this room had been trashed - monitors had been scratched on, smashed etc. It was based on some kids who had died. Eugene was there in the cinema. He was from a Scottish background. I thought that was weird."
"3857"	"(2011-07-19 (20)) Some others and I had been kidnapped? We were being kept in this old place and were like the equivalent of Jews in World War 2. We escaped and the guy had been our teacher? Benjamin was there too. I went to class and there was a package with stuff for me on my desk full of in-jokes. Benjamin left and I followed and jokingly asked if he needed a lift. He did, so I gave him one. He had an earring. Dad was in back of car and the brakes weren't working properly. I couldn't stop at a set of lights and crashed down the hill. I got out, but Dad was still in and acting weird."
"3858"	"(2011-07-20 (20)) Mom and I were driving down a road. I was in the back. A guy turned a corner and flipped onto his side. He got out and slammed his car onto the other car. I filmed it, and he looked back and saw me. He chased us. I can't remember what happened but then a girl was after us. We were in a shop. After a while, I got this long knife but couldn't cut through her skin. She grabbed a serrated one, so I did too and cut her head off. But then she was still alive and came after me and then her head fell off and she died. I placed her at the accident and tried to hide the evidence. I walked past the scene a day later and police were there; we knew one of them. Then Benjamin and I were walking around this place looking for somewhere to have sex. It was like a giant house. Some people were having sex outside against a wall. We went into this house where the person had a lot of kids and had just had a baby. We went onto the lounge, but got interrupted. We went onto the table and were interrupted again. We then found a small bed and began having sex [I woke up during the 'end'] ."
"3859"	"(2011-07-25 (20)) I was talking to Leif on Facebook and said that if someone interesting offered me sex, I would be interested. I was on holiday in this weird country. I went to take a photo and a lady told me I had a bug in my arm - it was sticking out the back of my arm, and was serrated so I couldn't pull it out. I went to this guy who could get rid of them and he put sewing stuff on and then said he wasn't 'good with Chabrol'. There was a list of all the guys who could get rid of them and their 'strengths'. Feargal Sharkey was a 'Chabrol' so I went to him. He put it underwater and then just easily pulled it out. Thre was a little bit left alive - the first bit was meat and the second was skin. There was a guy who was invisible and a drug dealer. He could appear for a while sometimes and could float. A guy came looking for him and he floated out of the way. His girlfriend heard a girl in his room and was listening to his voicemail, and knew he was there too."
"3860"	"(2011-07-28 (20)) I was at the beach. The waves were getting bigger and bigger and I started walking away. They were massive by this point and I started to run. Dad took us to his house and I said it wouldn't be safe and that I had had dreams before of huge waves. There was a big window and we saw the wave come crashing through. We started going down these stairs, which were flooding, but we found our way down. We were going down the street. More waves were coming our way. Someone hosted some party which was all painted and fancy, but there were stingy rooms. An old guy complained and I explained about the waves. Apparently aliens were stealing our water."
"3861"	"(2011-08-05 (20)) I went into this school place. Acquaintance-F-09 was there and she was a physicist or engineer and was really smart and playing some games. There was a game with a house that you had to protect from bears. You had to build a fence and then bears would come and you had to reinforce the fences by placing them around the outside. If they broke in, you had to click on them to kill them. It got really difficult later."
"3862"	"(2011-08-06 (20)) I lived in a dorm at a school. I think it may have been in the UK, but not sure. Someone said something bout Benjamin. There was a voicemail from Benjamin saying he was going to get laid. Arnie said something like 'oh, you're finally meeting up with Izzy?' and it had 5 likes. I was annoyed at the voicemail. I left the dorm at one point and it was difficult to get back. There were stairs at the other end and bridges. There was a guy trying to find money from his kid and asked me where I kept my money. Someone suggested my bedside table and I said ""no, that's my underwear"". They pulled out the drawer and it back. He asked again and I said ""in my wallet!"". I talked to Benjamin on MSN and he was seeing some Irish singer guy at a concert and said he liked Irish music."
"3863"	"(2011-08-09 (20)) I was back in the UK for a bit. Benjamin made his profile picture a picture of himself. We met up for a bit and it was easy to talk to him this time and we actually talked. We met again and went to a water park. We went through it collecting 'peanuts' which were park currency and you could hand in anything leftover at the end to get turned back into money. We got food and I couldn't decide what to get and I asked if the meat was spicy and they said yes and to go with the roast chicken, chips and tomato sauce. I had a small water. I made a joke about making decisions. Then I went there with Dad. We had some fruit stuff and then it was time for dessert. This lady with her daughter said we should line up behind them. We asked why and she said that she had to be somewhere in 45 minutes. We said we didn't care. I argued that there is a queuing system in place and she was being a bitch. We got back in front of her. I went to this stall with strawberries and sorbet."
"3864"	"(2011-08-12 (20)) I was at Midvale shops with Dad. I had this music thing in my car that was expensive. This young Native girl followed my car asking for directions in Subiaco. I tried to show her the bus/train map. This white guy with scraggly grey hair approached and tried to steal it and it was hard to get him away. I went into the shop as it was just closing and they said I had to tell them what I wanted and they would get it, but I forgot what I wanted, so I just got this big block of white chocolate."
"3865"	"(2011-08-13 (20)) There was this obstacle course thing at this theme park. Ezra said it was good exercise, but it was expensive and not open all the time. Then there was a game where you had a maze and could delete parts of it. I didn't know what to do and realised you had to delete things and then draw a path through it. Then I was in the game with Ezra and there were rooms with puzzles. The first two were easy. One was super dark and I had to use the light from my phone but it didn't really help. We wanted to give up, but no-one listened to us and we fell asleep. In the morning it was light again. We worked out what to do and Ezra left. There was milk and cookies on the table with a card for Santa. The next room had some David Lynch thing which was from a movie I had watched the day before. Aidan Gillen was gay and was with his boyfriend and another guy. They said we should have sex first and I asked if he was serious. I followed Aidan Gillen to a room. He got undressed and put a SARS mask on his face and a condom around his body because his boyfriend had AIDS. I was a 'mole'. I took my pants off and the rest of my clothes and lay on the bed. He got on top of me and kissed me, then we had sex."
"3866"	"(2011-08-14 (20)) I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Izzie was wheeling this closed off thing with a patient in it, who turned out to be Karev. He stopped it though and got out and kissed her and they were happy. Then it was real life and I was her and he was the guy I liked. He got out and Mom and Darren were in the room which was like a big warehouse shed with nothing in it. He kissed me and then did a 'drop' thing and kissed me hard. We kissed for ages and then Mom said 'cake' and there was a weird yellow cake with icing. Then I was on Facebook or something and Benjamin mentioned ""his small son"" had added some favourite movie to his list. He had mentioned the kid before, but I said that I thought he had been joking. I was upset."
"3867"	"(2011-08-20 (20)) I called Isaak to ask how many hours I had and he said not many because it was busy. I went in and talked to him and he said he had hired 3 new people and 2 of them were Seamus and Samantha. I said I was friends with Samantha when I was 15/16 and hung around with Seamus as well."
"3868"	"(2011-08-22 (20)) I was at the old house. Benjamin and Ezra were there. Benjamin was staying for a bit and it was awkward. We were dating though. Mom's car was in the driveway and it was dark red. I had trouble locking up. I tried to call Mom but there was no answer. I said I was going there to get my car. Benjamin was in the passenger seat. We went to this cinema place. There were horror movies with different themes, one of them was food. There were appetizers in the shape of rings and I was happy that no-one got them. Then it was a movie about World War 3. These bombs were aimed at this island where the main characters were. It was a little bomb and they ran. They survived, along with one other person and had just been far enough away to avoid getting burnt. One of them had a kid."
"3869"	"(2011-08-23 (20)) I was getting married. I was with a bunch of people the night before, getting drunk, and someone was unhappy about it. On the day of the wedding, I was worried I would get my period. There were people making jokes about the 'wedding night'. Mom and Nana were there. I went to the toilet and Kurt (Glee) was a part of it, and we were good friends. Some people were bullying him and he was upset. I walked past and there was a group protecting him."
"3870"	"(2011-08-24 (20)) I was talking to Benjamin on an instant messenger. We were joking and flirting and knew each other in rea life and were possibly dating. I sent a message joking 'why did I sleep with you last night?' and figured he would send back a love heart. It showed that he hadn't read it yet, then he sent a love heart and I giggled. I was telling Mom later about his uncle who was rich and famous and had ties to royalty and had brought the Stonehenge to his wedding, but then they said it was the wrong one -- they had wanted a fake one, so had to send it back."
"3871"	"(2011-09-02 (20)) We had seen pictures of some snowy place in Switzerland so had gone to the place in the picture. Then I knew Alexander Skarsgard and we had sex. It was very vivid and he was on top of me and close to me and going slow. It was my first time. I also knew Benjamin and I was thinking that I felt like I was kind of betraying him. Mom had to get a passport for her course and they asked me about my holiday and I said I had passports for two countries. I was part of some secret thing. There was an elevator that went really fast and you had to rate your experience before going down. If you chose something wrong it could sometimes go wrong and you could be killed. One day this guy was near it, eating and it hit a 7, so had heaps of time. This guy was Scottish and we got talking and joking about the guy eating near the elevator was spooky."
"3872"	"(2011-09-09 (20)) I was at work and it was different and there were lots of people working there. Isaak was getting me to fill out a form for a uniform. I heard someone crying in pain and I walked out this door to a hall outside, which led to the inside of a mall near a McDonald's and there was a girl on the floor holding ice on her leg."
"3873"	"(2011-09-10 (20)) FilmForum 2.0 had half been released. There were notifications when someone commented on a page and you could see all the posts people made and I was worried about the forum. We could also see a breakdown of genres and stuff that we had checked."
"3874"	"(2011-09-11 (20)) I was friends with someone in a European country over the net. I was on webcam and his parents were in the background watching. They were not attractive. I didn't have my webcam on though. They were laughing and teasing him in another language."
"3875"	"(2011-09-13 (20)) I was at the old house. I went to go to bed and Uncle Gabriel and Granma were in my bed and weren't going to move. I called Mom to ask if I could stay the night there. My car was on the lawn and I carefully drove out. It was about 3am and I saw police and I was worried they would pull me over."
"3876"	"(2011-09-14 (20)) I was at work with two other girls. Isaak wasn't in and they decided to leave for a bit. I went with them as one of them was in charge. We got ice-cream and some other stuff."
"3877"	"(2011-09-14 (20)) I was at some restaurant place and this room was part of a big building. People from the forum were there and a bunch of us were told to wait outside. I knew bal3x was there and I wondered which one he was. I sat on a chair and there was a wall in the cinema in front of me with a mirror on it, and I could see Benjamin sitting down behind me. He looked into the mirror too and I looked away. I put my feet on the wall and this lady yelled at me, like 'don't put your feet on my belongings'. I moved to a chair so that I was facing the other way. Benjamin was moved and told to sit next to me and he sat 2 seats away. His friend came and was Neil from The Inbetweeners. They joked about us not talking. Benjamin and said Neil didn't like my profile picture and that 'he liked the one with sin' and sin was some Scottish word. Neil said Benjamin and said 'she looks so normal'. Benjamin said 'then I met you and thought you were the most not-normal person!'. We laughed and continued talking."
"3878"	"(2011-09-16 (20)) Benjamin came to university with me one day and I had to organise stuff. Someone took a photo of me as I looked up and around and it was a weird picture of my neck. There was a cheese camera and I was confused as to what it was and Benjamin was annoyed and said 'a camera wrapped in cheese' and I wondered why he was so angry. We went to the cinema with Dad and Ezra. Benjamin was fine with them but was angry with me for some reason."
"3879"	"(2011-09-16 (20)) I was with Benjamin and we were dating. A friend of his made an in-joke and Benjamin explained to me that it was 'just an annoying in-joke'. This guy did a Peep Show quote and Benjamin said I'd seen that. There was a little nook like kitchen with the cups down low. Then I was at his university, but it was like a castle and near water. Someone delivered a note and it was written by Poppa saying that some family member was dying and it was sent hours ago and they were following up thinking I had ignored them. I had trouble getting to the office to call them."
"3880"	"(2011-09-24 (20)) I got on Facebook and Benjamin was back on [yesterday he said he wasn't doing Facebook anymore] , saying that there were so many hot girls at his university, but he was worried about the other guys still. He was saying there was one girl he really liked and he was in the same class as her. He was rating them and I was really annoyed and asked why he was telling me."
"3881"	"(2011-09-30 (20)) I got a message from Benjamin on the forum. He said he watched Summer With Monika and liked it and gave it a 9/10. He said he was going to post that comment on Facebook and I hoped he was returning to Facebook but figured it just made a mistake. Then it was night and I was at work. This guy was fixing something for inside customers. I accidentally took the tomatoes with me and then Darren ordered some of them for dinner and I hold him not to and was worried I would get caught out."
"3882"	"(2011-10-01 (20)) I went to the shop with Dad. We were in the clothes section and I saw Jason Segel and Seth Rogen and I pointed them out and walked past silently. I wanted to ask for a photo but felt too shy. Dad seemed to know Seth Rogen personally."
"3883"	"(2011-10-04 (20)) I was at home which was different. There were people across the road and I heard Scottish accents so I listened closely and there was a curly redhead guy. He said his friend was ""local-ish"". His sister came out as well. This guy said 'fitba'. I was thinking that I loved the accents. Then I was in a car with Benjamin and two friends in the front. Farrah came and gave us an invite to her birthday on the 22nd October. Ezra was there and said 'happy birthday' and so did I, but it got drowned out. Emery and someone else had gotten back from a holiday and we went over. There were nice biscuits from Canberra. They had really neat hangers on the wall."
"3884"	"(2011-10-16 (20)) I was at Nana's. They weren't there, but a bunch of people that I knew were. I went into the kitchen and there was a trail from the fridge going underneath the cabinet. There were big dead spiders and other creatures. Gunnar was there too and was talking to Mom in Nana's room. Then he left and I asked what they really talked about and she said a movie festival, the law and water bottles. Lafayette (True Blood) and I decided to look under the fridge and we shined a light to see something big in the middle. We focused and there was a huge spider with 3 minions in front with angry/evil faces. We screamed and ran. I got someone else to take photos and we killed one without the evil face."
"3885"	"(2011-10-20 (20)) I arrived in London to stay with Dad and Ezra. Dad mentioned that he was leaving in a few hours and Ezra was saying for a week. I started to panic about being alone and wondered what accommodation to get. I ended up befriending this girl and we got a room for £20 (I said ""20 bucks"" and then corrected to pounds. There was a bed big enough for 7 people and it was just us two. The next day more people were coming and it would be more expensive. We found another place which was more expensive. There was a room with 5 beds. There was one bench with 2 beds next to each other and 3 were on the floor next to each other. The place offered live-in jobs, but only for 16-18 year olds."
"3886"	"(2011-10-22 (20)) There was a ghost guy at this place. Someone saw a vision and we went around the back and smashed this wall in. They found the kid frozen and dead in this concrete. Then I went around the side and my boyfriend/husband was lying there and I lay on top of him and kissed him and rubbed up against him. I took my pants off and pulled his pants down and grabbed his penis, which was hard, and started rubbing him. Then I got on top again and put his penis inside me and started having sex. I lay down on him and kissed him, but later we were sitting up having sex."
"3887"	"(2011-10-28 (20)) A bunch of us ended up in this building which was a house or a school. This guy was chasing us. I ended up with this girl and we hid in a room. He came and we climbed through a small window, which I was surprised I could fit through. I ran ahead and then she called out for me. I went back for her and the guy was in the room. I ran and later she was upset that I didn't help her. The guy was diseased and similar to a zombie. He bit one of us and they turned into one. We bashed them to death. There was a hot guy in our group called David. Eventually we ended up being able to get out and David asked for our wallets to get our details. Mine had bra size and said '14DD', but I was thinking that I was a 16. His wallet said he was a 14 and I was confused."
"3888"	"(2011-11-07 (20)) I was watching Community. There was a naked lady in a pool and a kid was taking photos. Then it was Abed's mother, though she was white. She said 'Charlie' was bad. Charlie was actually Jeff and he was the kid. There was a fire in this building. He went in and there was one guy in a cinema and he took himself and Jeff and put themselves into a typewriter and I wondered what had happened to the show. I was then at some big market/farm thing. Brantley asked where some stall was and I said to follow me, but I got lost and ended up in a cinema. I walked up heaps of steep steps and lost him. There was a lady right outside and I asked if Brantley had gone in and she said she thought so. A friend and I went to get desserts. Eugene was in there and I got a mudcake and 2 chocolate mousses."
"3889"	"(2011-11-16 (20)) I went to the John Cleese show and the room was small with only like 10 rows of seats and I was at the back. There was a small stage. There were other acts and one had Frank Woodley. None of them were very funny or made sense. During the break I went to my car and this other girl was there. A couple went into this shop and started shooting. I snuck off but they came after me. I went into this other shop but no-one was there. I went through lots of doors trying to find the way out. Then I think they had some disease and their skin was falling off. Nana bought tickets for the Wakakiri and I thought I had to dance so was going to cancel, but then realized the ticket was just to watch it and I decided to go."
"3890"	"(2011-11-26 (20)) I had witnessed a murder by a gang. Mom got me and Ezra to stay with some friends that were high up in the drug world. We settled in well. One day I went into an office and was talking to them and someone turned on the police scanner and they heard they were coming to this street and going door to door pretending to be a charity. They quickly hid us in a basement. There was a window with blinds and Ezra opened it a little but I told him not to. There was a lady in sunglasses. A guy was naked and standing in front of a window. Then we were actually in a car and under a seat. There were 4 cars. The lady thought something was up and opened the car next to us and there was a guy in it and was confused. She said she was as cop and he pulled a gun out to shoot and she shot him first. He died and this other guy came out and shot her. There was a big shoot-out and everyone died. Ezra and I got out and decided to run home. There were police sirens in the background. I got my phone out and took photos. The house was on fire and there was lots of smokes. We ran and I took more pictures. We got home and Mom was there. I said 'they're dead, everyone's dead'."
"3891"	"(2011-12-06 (20)) I was living in London. There was some David Cronenberg thing happening at Benjamin's university, so I went up to Edinburgh to see it. I was sitting on the floor between chairs and Benjamin came out and saw me, but ignored me ad talked to this other guy. Then we got sent out as it was not on or had changed the time. I went back and people were posting about what they were watching and it was now on and I was sad that Benjamin didn't speak to me at all."
"3892"	"(2011-12-10 (20)) I just got back from our holiday and later that day/night we were leaving for a trip to Africa. Ms Solomon was at this outside deli thing and saw me and asked how my rabbit was and I said it was dead. I was using the same luggage for Africa. Dad and Ezra were there. Then I was watching Castle and Castle and Beckett slept together once and she got pregnant. They decided to keep it and then they got married (or seemed like they already were)."
"3893"	"(2011-12-18 (20)) I was at home alone at night. I heard a noise and saw 2 neighbours trying to break in. There was a girl and a guy and I'd seen the guy before. I got their attention and they took off. Later, they were there again and had opened the door. I called the police and they did as well so the line was engaged. I got through and they left again. I was a little scared, but mostly annoyed."
"3894"	"(2011-12-19 (20)) I was at the old house and checking Skype on my laptop whilst sitting on my bed. There was an on-going call and I joined it. Arnie was talking to me. There were babies over crying. I had to go somewhere so I quit the chat. There was a movie where a guy had sex with a dog and people came over but the dog penis got 'locked' so he couldn't get it out and I thought it was weird."
"3895"	"(2012-01-08 (20)) I got a flirty message from Benjamin and it had two links to his favourite sport scenes but saying 'this is when my love for you grew over 24 hours' or 'I like this less than you' etc. I was then at the back of a zoo thing and Mom was like 'this looks so different' and there used to be lots of trees but now there were none. There were elephants in the exhibit. Some Natives snuck through a hole in the fence and sat at the top of this hill. A young boy came down and took a can of cat food out of our bag. I grabbed it and said 'that's ours' and he tried to grab something else and I said no. Then the mother came down and ended up grabbing Mom's food and shoving it all in her mouth. I went around the corner to ask for the police and they sent a lady who dealt with Natives. Then I was playing a game. I heard an alarm but didn't know what it meant. Rover was on a platform near some water and I saw it break and I remembered the alarm was for a giant octopus. I called out to Rover and he just looked at me and a tentacle grabbed him and pulled him down. The game reset."
"3896"	"(2012-01-16 (20)) I was talking to Benjamin on Skype but we lost internet. I could still talk for a bit and I said I was going to my Dad's to go on the internet. I had to go somewhere first, and had to climb these 'steep' natural steps. I had some paper in my pocket and my phone but I was worried they would fall out so I put them in a zip lock bag. There were some mountains and stuff in the distance and it looked cool and I wanted to take a photo but I had to move out the way. At the top there was an office where I had to do something. I went on Skype on my phone and told Benjamin I'd be 30 minutes or so. I got to Nana's and went on the net to talk to him. Then I was sitting outside my car in front of a school. The people from the car in front of me were having an argument and they said they should start charging people to listen. I was like 'well, I'm going now' and went into another red car on the other side of the road. Benjamin was in the passenger seat. I told him what happened and drove off."
"3897"	"(2012-01-17 (20)) I was in a building, possibly an office. There were 'zombies' but what was actually happening was people would get sick and either die or turn into controlled 'robots'. You were likely to catch it if you went near them. A bunch of us were hiding out in a back room and went out the front to have a look. Some people got sick and us others went into a small booth and they fell down. Aliens were doing it? Their 'car' came and they could kill anyone by pressing a button (we all had a number and if they chose yours you would die). They hit a few and some people dropped."
"3898"	"(2012-01-27 (21)) Anastasia asked a friend about a job for me and brought a menu with my name on it to say that I got it. I called her friend to confirm (her name was Julie) but she was busy. I went to the restaurant and the guy there welcomed me and he was weird. He stared at me and said ""you're beautiful"" and stuff like that and I was confused. The others didn't seem to react. Grady and other people I knew were there. He plugged in a microphone and started singing Dear God and we laughed. He wrote down that we laughed and seemed upset. I said I'd laughed because I liked the song. Someone told me that he was not the actual boss and brought in to be like this as a test. I then got to do a trial and wore a trainee badge. I followed one of the girls. She served some customers and had to put sauce on a pizza. There was a lot of it and she had to do it slowly and carefully to draw a pattern. The John Cleese show was at 9pm and I took off without saying anything to get there in time. Mom picked me up and I realised I should've said something. I called to explain. My battery was almost empty."
"3899"	"(2012-01-29 (21)) I can't remember properly, but Arnie was staying with us. Home was different. He was a huge perv and would often stare at me and come into my room. One day, we ended up kissing and he pushed me onto my bed and got on top and started kissing me again and started kissing my neck and going lower. I just lay there wondering what I was doing but just decided to let it happen since I didn't want to be a virgin forever."
"3900"	"(2012-01-29 (21)) I was playing a game. I escaped from this farm and jumped onto a horse, while an evil horse was trying to escape. I had to run next to lava and 'beat' the lava a lot. Then I was in a street in real life. I was with Benjamin and talking to a lady when I saw a car fall (like following a direct 45° angle from the ground), from the sky. No-one saw it. Then it suddenly came headfirst down into a tree near us across the street. I said 'maybe someone strong threw it' and Benjamin made a joke about The Hulk but then we saw this giant rock/clay monster roar and we ran. I hid behind a pillar and some steps but Benjamin said we needed to go high. We ran into a building across the road and up steps. We could see the top of the monster's head from the window. The roof had these 'monkey bar' type of handles to swing across. There was also a game, like a card game going on. We watched for a while. Then we had to hide and went into the other room, which went lower. Someone pointed out this giant snowman in the window who was smiling (a fellow monster, but a nice one?). Then I was in Benjamin's apartment sitting on the lounge with him. He poked my knee and I complained and he did it again and I said 'you're as annoying as my Mom' and he kept poking and we started wrestling playfully. He also stroked my leg and put his hand up my pants but I let him."
"3901"	"(2012-02-06 (21)) Mom was reading a newspaper and there was a picture of a guy and she said he did something bad. I was talking to Benjamin online, but sometimes it was in real life. He mentioned this 'bad' uncle of his and it turned out that it was the guy in the paper. He had gone to jail and his name was Eric. I told Mom about it. In real life, I'd written some comment like 'follow a Scottish guy around for his babies' and something about wanting flowers. Benjamin saw it and looked thoughtful (like he realised it was about him and that I liked him). I pretended not to notice. He had to leave for a bit and left me with the house keys (it was in his house?). There were keys to a locked drawer. I opened it and it just had envelopes and stuff. I closed and locked it as he came back in, but it wasn't closing properly and it stayed open a little. He said 'I don't even know why we lock that drawer' and shut it. He said something like 'my granddad might not like that you know a South Korean [if we dated] '. I was still fat and wondered why he was interested."
"3902"	"(2012-02-08 (21)) I had a dream within a dream and was slightly aware. I was on a bed with Benjamin. He was behind me and I was pressed against him, but I didn't know why. My shirt had ridden up a little and I could feel a belt or something on my back. I wanted him to touch me, but he didn't. Then the blanket was 'aubergine' and I decided I wanted 'pancake', so it changed to a pancake coloured blanket, which 'smelt' like pancakes. When I woke up in the first dream, Mom and Darren were trying to work out what some pancake phrase meant -- I had written it in my sleep. I put on a bra and my right boob was 2x bigger than the left. I told Mom I needed to speak to her privately, but she was like 'just tell me' and I started to cry and made her come into my room. I told her and she was trying not to laugh and was like 'ok'. I had to get braces as well."
"3903"	"(2012-02-10 (21)) I had met up with Benjamin a few times (with Dad too). Every time was awkward. We were in a hotel room and Benjamin was in the shower. We went in the bathroom for some reason and I could see the back of him from where I was. He didn't seem to care, although I tried not to look. He turned to get a towel and I peaked, and his penis was really small (like a kid's one) and I was confused. Later, we were talking a little bit, but conversation was still much better online."
"3904"	"(2012-02-14 (21)) I was in the UK after having moved. Dad was with me. I was texting Benjamin on my phone until I realised I hadn't gotten a UK sim yet, so I stopped. I had messaged him about my accommodation and house mates and he sent back 'what about me? It's my turn!' and I was confused and wondered if he was somehow asking to share with me and I hoped he was. An old lady offered me a room in her house so I didn't have to put up with a roommate snoring."
"3905"	"(2012-02-18 (21)) Some people from Lost -- I remember Charlie -- and I were in a group after some apocalypse had happened. We were staying out the front of home. Charlie and I ended up in a car to sleep because everyone else took the space inside. He touched my leg and I didn't react so he ran his hand up more and then stopped and went into another car. I was thinking it had something to do with Ben. The next day, I saw a car with my licence plate and I pointed it out and they were like 'typical Izzy, only noticing something small like that'. Ben was there. I also got a call from Rohan and I couldn't understand it because of bad reception. It was apparently a threat, but he was laughing and sounded like a 12 year old."
"3906"	"(2012-02-21 (21)) I lived in England, but somehow ended up just wandering over to Edinburgh. Nana was also Benjamin's grandma (?) but we weren't related. She was living there for a while (and had done before). I was at a shop and using an iPhone app to find nearby restaurants/cafes. I went to visit Nana and Benjamin came downstairs. I was playing on my phone on a lounge. He called out my name, but I wasn't sure if he was actually calling me or just saying my name, so I ignored it and then he called out again and I said ""what?"" and he said ""Come here"". He was close by and there was a guitar. He said it had 'five' [notes?] and I said ""yay?"". He said something I didn't understand and I asked him to repeat it and he said ""did you just say 'yay' in your language?' and I laughed and went back to my chair."
"3907"	"(2012-03-01 (21)) Benjamin asked to meet up, 'do you want to go out?', and we went to the beach near Dad's. We actually managed to talk, but he looked different (I didn't actually notice that in the dream though. We went up to see Dad. The place was different and all of it was inside (joined by halls). There were lemons for $5. There was a lady at the counter and I said I'd get some later, but I wasn't going to because it was too expensive. Ezra had to wait for the neighbours to leave before he could leave because he'd annoyed them by being loud."
"3908"	"(2012-03-14 (21)) I was in a pub type of building and there were two floors. Benjamin was there, but I was on Skype and went to send him a message and it said something like 'user doesn't exist'. I decided to not send him a message on the forum, but instead leave a note. I asked the bartender guy to tell him he had a note and it said ""Did you delete Skype?? WTF. Thanks. P.S. We need 1 new member to hit 500, I count it"". Then I left and got in my car. I could see him through the window and saw him reading the note and he looked like a young Jeremy Davies. He took out his phone and mine was on silent, but I pulled it out of my pocket and he was calling. He looked at me through the window and he said he didn't delete it and mentioned that he was doing an assignment (which was why he hadn't been online). I started driving out and then I was walking and a guy flew over this hill and kept spinning around and bouncing off the ground and I was like 'oh my god, oh my god!' and hung up when the guy stopped. A bunch of people ran over and picked him up and straightened him out. He looked screwed, but he was alive. I called an ambulance."
"3909"	"(2012-03-26 (21)) A young Jeremy Davies was confused about something and I said 'Spanking the Monkey' to help."
"3910"	"(2012-03-26 (21)) I was a monster? At first I was just hiding in a bush, as me. An alligator or dinosaur and a blind woman were around and thought they heard something. I was friends with the woman's grandson. I hid in the bush, and the alligator thing smelled me, but she called it away before it found me. I decided to find somewhere to live and ran through the neighbourhood during the night. I stopped at a kid's house and it started to get light and people came out. There was nowhere to hide. This family invited me to eat with them. I was trapped in another time/universe or something."
"3911"	"(2012-03-29 (21)) I was out with Ezra. There was a lecture on that I went to attend. It was packed inside and we had to go to the opposite side of the room for a seat. The seats were labelled like 'boring and nice' and I went with a boring one on a row by itself. I forgot to bring paper, so I went down to get my bag. A guy sat in my seat as a joke, but I said I'd just go to the row behind it. They showed 4 different scenarios and you had to pick which one was true. There was one about The Sims. I was bored. I went online and there was some lady obsessed with Christian Bale. I think she was Asian. She was married, but also liked women? She hadn't updated her profile in over a year."
"3912"	"(2012-03-31 (21)) Mom went to someone's house. There was a cute guy there, but they said he was 16 and I was like 'ergh, pedo'. His name was Alex. Somehow we spent some more time together and he liked me. He was nice, but he was 'bad'. We needed to hide from some people. We were with some others and they said that we had to go into hiding for some years and I said no and they said we had to go to Disneyland. We went to this huge house. I was by myself and it was night. I walked in and locked the door. I went to the kitchen and there were 2 dogs and a cat and I said hello and pet them. I kept walking and then I saw Alex hiding around a corner. He flirted with me. There was a cleaner lady there. He kept trying to corner me and kiss me and I tried to go somewhere else. There was a wall next to his bedroom and he leaned up against me and went to kiss me, but the cleaner walked by and he pulled away. She finished and left the house. I walked off into a bathroom. I sat at the end next to the counter and wall. I could see the mirror and saw him coming this way. I got up and he was still flirting and I said 'you're 16!'. We ended up back near his bedroom and he talked very candidly about sex and referenced a guy I had gone out with, but I couldn't remember if I had gone out with him or if I'd slept with him and I assumed not. Alex was being pushy and I tried to resist, but he got me up against that wall again and kissed me and we went into the room and had sex. When I woke up, there was another guy in the bed too. I hid and Alex told him to leave. Then he left and the guy came back and saw me and realised what had happened. He grinned and left. I was feeling weird about the age difference. In an alternate version, he drowned 'me' and then opened my shirt and touched my boobs. Then he jizzed in his pants and was like 'damn it' (but it was actually a movie)."
"3913"	"(2012-04-05 (21)) I was at home, which was different. There was a giant spider and Ezra had it trapped in the aircon and it was hanging outside it. He pulled it off and it looked dead and dropped on top of a kitten called Sarah. Then it grabbed the kitten and went backwards under the lounge. We pulled out the lounge and it moved back and Ezra killed it. The kitten was ok. Then we remembered about this giant snake that was also in the aircon. I went up the hallway and saw some of the aircon vents were bent. One of the rooms had bits broken off and mine were bent inwards. I saw the backdoor open and closed it, but thought nothing of it. Mom and Ezra checked the rooms for the snake. I mentioned the door being open and we went outside to check, but couldn't find it. Then it was a movie and this detective was questioning someone and saw the snake shadow behind them and shot it."
"3914"	"(2012-04-06 (21)) I was at a shop with Mom. I was looking at the movies and you could tick your favourites, so I did it with a few. Benjamin turned up and said hello to Mom and me. I ignored him, not even looking at him. I remembered he had mentioned shopping here before. He said goodbye and left. Then we were at a Science Museum type of place. I was alone and went into this aquarium bit, saying to myself that it was my favourite part. There was a turtle walking on the path and I took a photo. I was taking lots of photos and was thinking to put them on the forum, until I remembered about my silent protest. I saw Benjamin there and I tried not to look. I could 'see' his thought; 'ok, just ignore me and don't talk to me'. I thought 'that's the same thing I thought when he ditched me'. I was happy that he felt ditched as well, but was still confused why he did. Then I was at a food place. He and a friend sat in front of me and I still avoided looking. An ugly girl started dancing and Benjamin was staring at her with a 'pervy smile' and I wondered why it was always the ugly ones. I hoped that he would notice me once I lost weight."
"3915"	"(2012-05-09 (21)) I watched a Finnish movie called Lichtenstein and it was really good. I was watching The Big Bang Theory and Sheldon did something 'bad'. His father yelled at him. He took his shirt off and held a button out and Leonard said to Penny 'he wants you to do it' and it was a symbol of kindness? She took her shirt off. I said to Ezra that 'Sheldon was like me at the beginning, now they've just turned him normal'. I was secretly putting on foundation. It was over almost all of my face and was red. It was going a weird green colour and was scaly. I washed it off and got some on a towel."
"3916"	"(2012-05-12 (21)) I was in a line of prisoners. A guy behind me joked about him and his boyfriend having sex. Somehow I got out and ended up in this sandy place like a town/village. I was with a girl. I saw this guy who I'd seen earlier shoot and throw his hands up. Nothing happened and he told us to come with him. We tried to run up this big sand hill which was impossible to climb. He ran 'into' it and then stairs appeared -- there was a secret button? It didn't reach to the top, but we went as far as we could. He had to get some peanuts. Then we were sitting on a small round disc on the top. The stairs were gone. The police came and saw us eating on there, but I don't know how we got there. His name was Common [something] but later he said his real name was Windy Bags, which I thought was weird."
"3917"	"(2012-05-15 (21)) I was at Comic-Con a few days early. Joan Rivers had a food stall and made me sit and eat chips with lots of tomato sauce. I left and there was a monkey with long dirty hair and I brushed it. I sat down but it ran away when I finished. I found it again and put it in my car, along with a guinea pig, because I was collecting one of each animal."
"3918"	"(2012-05-17 (21)) I looked on the Comic-Con site and Adam Baldwin had cancelled but Nathan Fillion was replacing him and I was really excited. But the next day he cancelled. Then I woke up and it had been a dream. I checked the Comic-Con site and Adam Baldwin had cancelled and I was annoyed. [I woke up in a panic and had to check the site -- all was good] ."
"3919"	"(2012-05-22 (21)) Magic Mike was actually a Billy Wilder movie with 50 Cent. It was poorly done. I watched it, except it was 'real'. There was a delicious muffin/cake. It was weird tasting, but it was the most delicious thing I'd ever tasted. I was trying to convince a friend to do something with it. Then Charlie Chaplin was a friend of mine. I can't remember what they wanted me to do, but I had to get next to him in a cinema. There was an old guy next to him and lots of old people were in the cinema. He got up to pee and we giggled and I went over. He had a big hat and I took it and put it on. Then I gave it back. It went over his eyes and he had another floppy hat on which held it in place. I had to kiss him and I was uncomfortable about it and realised I liked him. I can't remember what happened, but I think I did kiss him."
"3920"	"(2012-05-25 (21)) There was a weird zombie-like disease happening to animals that would make them attack you. I was in a room with some of them and I ran out. I tried to hold the door closed. Outside people were getting infected animals to attack us, so we ran. I got chased into a building by a fat lesbian/bisexual. She asked us questions about sex in slang. One was about blowjobs and I was like 'ew no'. I climbed up a ladder where I found this little helicopter thing which I'd dreamt about previously and I got on that and flew away."
"3921"	"(2012-05-25 (21)) There was a new season of Castle. Castle and Beckett were acting the same as normal but she was flirtier. They were investigating a crime scene and she flicked her hair while Castle wasn't looking. The case was weird. She was calling him Henry at one point and he got really annoyed. There was a teen called John Huston and had an Aussie accent. He was cute. They were at a highschool/university where he was in an acting class. He was a suspect, but he was nice. Later, there was a video hologram thing of him dancing. Beckett moved to parts of the room so it looked like she was dancing with him. She got out and found Castle. He had a twin but they weren't identical, just very similar, so that was how he managed to do whatever he did. Beckett found an old Castle interview where his alias was Henry and that was where she'd gotten it from."
"3922"	"(2012-05-29 (21)) I was at the old house and the neighbours were across the road. I went into the study to see this fat, old, Native woman lying on the pouffe thing. I yelled 'what are you doing here? Get the hell out!' and she waddled out. The window in the lounge room was lifted up and there was no lock. A lady was trying to get in and failed and left. Two guys with uniforms on were at the door. I was suspicious and kept asking them questions. I went to get something and came back to see them trying to get in. I tried to hold the lock down but somehow it got pushed up. I'd grabbed a knife and I threatened them with it. I think I cut one guy and he pulled out a gun and I didn't know what to do."
"3923"	"(2012-05-29 (21)) It kept changing between a slasher film at a party and real life. I thought the killer was this girl -- for no reason other than she didn't seem like the killer. Two people had sex in their parents' bed. I was helping someone in my class learn French and I couldn't read this French thing properly."
"3924"	"(2012-06-01 (21)) It kept going back and forth between reality and the Game of Thrones universe. I was a new character and later in the books I got married to Jon Snow. Kit Harington and I were friends in the real world. I think I was flirting with him and said I was looking forward to it and I think I asked him to ask me out. He lived in this village (in Game of Thrones) in the common area. There was a tunnel and you got richer as you went up. I was on a raft with Jon and others. There was another raft ahead. Joffrey and Cersei were standing up ahead and Joffrey liked me and hated Jon. He called out and said he wanted Jon and two other 'good looking' guys (he said their names but I figured that was the connection between them) to swap rafts. Jon obeyed and rubbed my shoulder. I tutted and made a face going past and Cersei told me to watch myself. Then I was back at the village. There was a really peaceful and pretty park. Kit asked how the ride was. Then it got weird. I was alone in the park, standing up against a tree. Two girls came to 'check my weight' and I was 53kg and they bullied me and were hurting me. Then it was only one and she'd been doing it for some time. After some attempts, I got the better of her. I held her arm out and stabbed her wrist with a pencil. I did it to some others and then I went back and dragged the pencil down her wrist so she would bleed out. She died and collapsed. I text Kit saying 'come to park NOW'. He turned up 25 minutes later and I had disposed of the body but he had seen it all and helped me take care of the other bodies. Then I had pretended to be dead as a joke. Then I had a baby in the park. Its head and name was on a box and it was called 'Chander' and I wondered why we called it that and how I misspelt it. Someone came with an Aussie accent. Kit said it was a baby of my favourite [something] . He looked at it and there was a pic of me and Kit with the baby, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's head on it, and he took it off. I assumed he knew about the murders because of this, but I don't know what the connection was."
"3925"	"(2012-06-02 (21)) There were pictures of famous people and I had to write down their names. Kit Harington and a guy I didn't recognise were there. I wrote 'Kit AWESOME Harington'. Then there was a picture of Katie Holmes and that was the one we were working on, Kit Harington was also naked in it, just his backside."
"3926"	"(2012-06-03 (21)) In Game of Thrones, Tyrion got killed. It was half off-screen and I was like 'what they can't kill Tyrion', it looked pretty final though [the last episode it looked like he died] . Joffrey was killed too. His lifeforce was in a sword and Sansa was going to smash it. His mother was different and she came and she couldn't smash it. I was thinking they would find Tyrion hiding out somewhere."
"3927"	"(2012-06-09 (21)) I was at a video shop. I was looking at the horror movies and counting the ones I'd seen, only 5-6 I hadn't. They had Children of the Corn III on VHS. Ezra was counting the ones he'd seen as well and he'd only seen lots of new ones. Grave Encounters was there. One movie was called Absolum: Mega [something] . I had had a dream about it and Donald Sutherland was in it. I thought it was weird and told Mom and showed her the dream over the phone. They had the Demonic Toys soundtrack and I said ""oh another movie with Daniel Cerny""."
"3928"	"(2012-06-09 (21)) I went to the cinema. There were people in front of me talking (the movie hadn't started yet). I recognised a girl's voice and I suspected it was Ramona. The chairs were movable and the cinema was eventually packed full. The screen was like a TV. They made us move to the sides and I sat on the edge of the middle set of seats. Then it screwed up and they told us to leave. There were lots of people outside. I started walking and a guy in a car propositioned me. I said no and he said 'good' and continued driving. I couldn't find my car and kept walking. I saw it reversing out. I opened the passenger door and said 'what the hell, get out of my car'. This guy just looked at me and continued reversing. I reached over and pulled out the keys and stabbed him in the arm with them. There was a Ute nearby. The guy who had flirted with me earlier got out of his car and helped me. I called Nana and said some guy was stealing my car and she said she would call the cops."
"3929"	"(2012-06-12 (21)) I woke up and heard Mom complaining to someone about a guy who was coming over. He was a drug dealer and preferred sexual favours over money and also gave better drugs for them. He came over with his wife and kids. I went out and he flirted with me. He was really dodgy. Mom went out and it was just me and him alone and he raped me, but I didn't mind. His wife and sister had a ranch up north and wanted us to go there for some reason. We went up and it was the day of the storm [there's supposed to be a storm today] . Mom said we should stay up there to be safe. There was a llama that liked me and kept nuzzling me and putting its paws on me. It ended up curling up on my lap. I didn't have a car so borrowed a horse to ride back (sometimes it was the llama), but didn't tell anyone. I was nearly home and stole a car. I got back home and grabbed some stuff and then drove to this block of flats where I lived? I thought we'd be safer at home but it was too windy outside. There was a grey cloud coming from the south. Cars were getting blown into each other. There was a girl and a llama in one of them and I helped them get out."
"3930"	"(2012-06-14 (21)) This guy murdered women and he had a daughter. Then it was my daughter. I went to the shop with her. Some work friends suggested this store because they had costumers for her to have some fun. I told her to get a costume and she picked this stupid pink princess dress and I was annoyed. There was some chocolate and I said ""ooh, chocolate"" and they had Skittles too. They were all years out of date. I bought a bag of Skittles which had 'Tom Conell' written on it. There was a little kitten in a shelf and I thought it was dead but then it opened its eyes. I helped it out. Then there were a few kittens. I named them Spaceman and Powder. We told the girl at the counter to make sure they were looked after. Then there were puppies too and one was small and dark brown. Then some time later Rover had had puppies with that dog."
"3931"	"(2012-06-22 (21)) I had my first stocktake job. It was at a supermarket and I was about to scan the first item and then we were told to evacuate because of dodgy people in the building nearby who might break in. We went out the back door and ran to hide under a hill. I went to another job and was scanning and I made a mistake. People treated me like a noob."
"3932"	"(2012-06-26 (21)) I was playing Minecraft [I started playing it last night] except it was real. I was in it and everything looked normal but I could shoot blocks out. My home as similar to the one I built in a cave. I had trouble with the door when the zombies came at night. Then people turned up and tried to steal everything, but I convinced them to join up with me instead."
"3933"	"(2012-06-28 (21)) I checked my email and I had to schedule an induction for a stocktaking job. I was on the phone and there was an entry fee of $500. There was a boot camp with pictures of an island place. I still had to do my exam and it was a few hours before my induction. I watched a movie and then had to leave because it was getting late. For the induction I had to weird stuff, eg write down 5 things we want to do (I wrote down 5 movies including The Adjuster and Foolish Wives). We had to take 5 things out of our bag to show our personality; I had magazines, movies and a puzzle book. This guy said I had no personality. Then my bag had different things in it and I was confused and everyone was like 'that's what you came in with' and I said it wasn't. I said ""don't pull this Matrix stuff on me"". There was a broken thing and I grabbed food out of it and threw it at the wall. They came to stop me. Then I was back home, but something was not right and I realised it and it was another trick."
"3934"	"(2012-06-29 (21)) Our house was different and joined with the neighbours. There was a door between them. I'm not sure of the whole story, but I had a boyfriend and he somehow got stabbed. I rushed to drive him to the hospital because it was peak hour and I couldn't call an ambulance. I was on the freeway. I kept yelling at him and hitting him to keep him awake. I think he died. Then it changed to a guy in a wheelchair who got stabbed. He was a quadriplegic and his mother drove him to the hospital. They saved him and they did something to his foot and he felt it and he could use his arms. The doctors were shocked. Then Rover ran off and we went looking for him. People speared him and he died. Sometimes what had happened was Mom had accidentally stabbed him with some glass. I was really depressed about it and crying all the time. I woke up (within the dream) crying, and had a dream he was alive and woke up crying again. People were over and didn't seem to care. Mom was on the lounge and she said that I was crying out 'fat puppy' in my sleep. I collapsed on the floor, face down, bawling and saying that I hate waking up. A retarded guy was over and asked me to make him a sandwich and I told him to make it himself."
"3935"	"(2012-07-06 (21)) There were people in a park. Something started happening in the sky, like a split, that was getting lower and chopping things up and people were dying. A girl yelled to a group of people to get down low and they lay down on the ground. She got close to them and they asked 'how low' and it cut the girl's hair. One lady had the top half of her lead cut off. A building sunk and disappeared and then reappeared a bit differently. A few other things changed too, like an instrument that had been lying on the ground. They realised all the world was dead. They said they needed to find more survivors to make it fun. There were some more around the corner, including the girl's boyfriend and another guy that she had recently started dating as well. I was then her and I kissed him on the cheek as a greeting. We went into this building and then it was kind of half time travel and half parallel universe. We went down stairs and there was a gladiator fight. There only one good looking guy in the first group of people. He chased some big guy and went out a door and got trapped against a car. There were dead people everywhere and he got killed."
"3936"	"(2012-07-08 (21)) Dad, Ezra, Tyrion (Game of Thrones) and I were going to some religious place in Italy to learn priesthood stuff and become maesters. Dad and Ezra got dropped at one point. I was in a fancy-ish hotel. I drove and Tyrion took the bus. I followed him to make sure I got to the right place. It was #999. I went in with Tyrion and he dropped his glasses case and I picked it up for him. The glasses were very round and fancy, but old. I wondered where I was supposed to go."
"3937"	"(2012-07-09 (21)) I was in Red Dwarf and it was sometimes just me, but sometimes me, Lister, Cat and Kryten. It was very boring when I was alone. With the others, I found a thing to travel back in time and we went to Rimmer. He was packing stuff away and I said ""Rimmer"" and he looked at me and I told him what to do that day so he wouldn't die. Then he was with us in the present. Lister said to me 'you brought back Rimmer?'."
"3938"	"(2012-07-09 (21)) I was at a Comicon type of place. Leonard and Sheldon (The Big Bang Theory) were there. There was a small game stand and I walked past them and kept walking through the store. I was walking with no real purpose, but walking fast. Then I suddenly wondered what I was doing. I began counting the stuff I had. I had a biscuit that cost $2.50 and then I went to the games stand. Then I was leaving the place and it was dark. I started going down the steps and saw this guy below me and I tried to scream but he suddenly ran up 2 flights of steps and put his hand over my mouth. I pretended to pass out and he took me with him. I planned to scream when we walked near somewhere that was lit up."
"3939"	"(2012-07-12 (21)) I woke up and got on my computer to discover Malcolm McDowell had died. I posted on Facebook saying that I loved him and that it was sad. Then I discovered another celebrity I liked had also died."
"3940"	"(2012-07-12 (21)) I was at a school type of thing at an old house. We were put in pairs and had to have a baby or something. I was curled up on a lounge waiting for people to come back. Alexander Skarsgard and a girl came and saw me and approved. They wanted the names Tiffany and Tina for a girl and apparently they were very picky about who they accepted. I went into the games room and pulled out Monopoly, but it was not the British one. We didn't say a word to each other the whole time. We started playing and I rolled 21 and I had trouble counting then had to just skip to 21 since each side was 10. The lot was orange, but should've been green and then I ended up in jail."
"3941"	"(2012-07-13 (21)) I was at school and had classes in different suburbs. I had one in Como. Then they all just at the same school and I was looking through my phone to find my next one which turned out to be discrete math. Vikram was also in my class. The desks were all close together and Vikram and I sat next to each other. Eugene was in front of me and Jeremiah sat on the other side of Vikram. As soon as the teacher started talking I got bored. A black friend of mine had to do some test. We weren't allowed to do have drugs or weapons and she gave me her lighter and cigarettes beforehand. My pockets were bulging. The packet of cigarettes had a picture of a section of the eastern part of the country highlighted with 'Bob Geldof' written there and a pic of him in the top right. Then Bob Geldof was with me and said to me 'I wanted to see what kind he smoked and if it's one of mine'. I said my pockets were full of smoke and he said 'and you won't ever smoke them' and I said 'I won't'. My friend finally joined us. Bob said he was addicted to cigarettes. I said I'm addicted to chocolate. I said I loved chocolate fingers and said they were so delicious I ate an entire pack in one day. Then I was in a big room with lots of people. Kevin Spacey and Chris Barrie were there. I tried to get a picture of them with Bob. I walked through a shop and looked at puppies."
"3942"	"(2012-07-14 (21)) I was watching Red Dwarf and it was like season 7 (eg, drawn out jokes and not funny). Kryten lost his memory and found Lister on a raft and he didn't remember who he was and it went on forever. Lister also said something like 'work, slave, sleep, work'. I woke up at home because Amelia was singing along to some AC/DC song that they'd put up loudly. I was tired and annoyed. Then I had this life-size cardboard thing and it had a list of old TV shows that had been cancelled but were coming back."
"3943"	"(2012-07-19 (21)) I was on a boat with a school. I was in a bottom compartment and it had seats like a bus and windows to the sea. It suddenly started spinning around really fast. I looked out and realised the boat was sinking due to a storm. It stopped and we tried to work out what to do. There was a doorway leading to stairs that would take us to the top. I left to see where it was. I held my breath and went under water but a little bit of water got in. I saw a shark and it had a smile and on one side of the mouth the teeth were always showing. I quickly went back. I realised we were going to die and some of us decided to breathe in this thing which would suffocate you. I died and then a girl realised how to get out, so I reversed it so I wouldn't die. We were then on at the top of the boat with all these control panels open and on top of the water. I got up to it and it had been going fast and straight. I couldn't slow it down and it hid bridges and boats and finally crashed to a stop. It felt good to be back on land."
"3944"	"(2012-07-26 (21)) A wife found out her husband was cheating on her and she banned him from seeing women. He was frustrated because she hadn't been sleeping with him. A friend said to her 'he's not so much as looked at another woman' but when he was left alone with her one day, he gave in and slept with her. This new girl came into his life somehow and he wanted to be with her. He ended up snorting cocaine out of her vagina."
"3945"	"(2012-07-26 (21)) I was at the old house. Mom was in the kitchen and I was talking to her as she made this ice-cream thing. She melted chocolate onto it. This guy was at the door to see Mom about something. He was a little chubby, but kind of cute. I let him in and he took my ice-cream and left. I went back to my room and had an odd feeling that he liked me and I went to lock the front door. Suddenly he knocked and pushed the door open while I was closing it. He said 'I just wanted to look around'. He looked at my computer starting up and nodded. I was thinking of posting on the forum and I felt confused."
"3946"	"(2012-07-26 (21)) I was watching the last episode of House. House and Wilson ran off together with a baby. Wilson explained how it happened and then it showed House in a car saying a phrase over and over to himself, and Wilson was in the back and he was telling him to keep repeating it. His face was bruised."
"3947"	"(2012-07-27 (21)) I was with a group on an excursion thing at a place similar to Hillary's. Once I got in, I realized I had no money. There was a drinking fountain with cans on it, so I took a handful after a guy friend I was with urged me to. I bought a ticket with 50c pieces. Then we went to this thing for water. I gave a $2 coin to the lady and said 'that's $2 a night' and she looked at it and wondered. She saw that it had some Olympic thing on it and she asked where I got it. A tracking thing said it had last been used at their water fountain. I said I found it on the ground. She started questioning me and said I needed to go talk to someone about it, but I ran. They chased me and I climbed over a fence with those sharp circular things and got to my car. She chased me down the freeway, which was very busy and different. She got pulled over by the cops as her car had 'stolen goods' in it (which they were going to use as evidence of my crimes), so she got caught and I was let go."
"3948"	"(2012-07-28 (21)) I was watching Game of Thrones. Arya and Gendry kissed and made-out. Arya was only 10 and I thought it was weird, but I liked that they got together."
"3949"	"(2012-08-05 (21)) Alexander Skarsgard and a guy we sort of knew got into a car with us. I was on the left and Alexander Skarsgard got in after me and sat in the middle. He was touching me, which I was excited about. I got my phone out to try and take sneaky photos."
"3950"	"(2012-08-06 (21)) I was with this guy who was very serious, but hot, in his 30s/40s. He was like a bounty hunter. We were looking for The Hound (Game of Thrones), who had been captured. We found a grave that said 'The Hound' on it, but we thought it was a lie. There was a water park and we had to go down a slide to reach another part of it."
"3951"	"(2012-08-07 (21)) I was at Red Dwarf live and I was sitting at seat C9. It was at a bar place. My seat was on the side and in the first row. I thought we could get to the back of the set, but a girl and I went outside to do something and could barely see anything. Cat came on and sat in a chair and said ""We're dirt poor"" and he kept going on about it and he said he was going to write a note to remind him how he felt. He put the note in his chair, then sighed and took it back out. Then someone in the audience said ""this sucks"". A kid coughed and there was hardly anyone in the audience. It started filling up after a few minutes and people were still coming in throughout the show. Rimmer came out with no shirt on but he didn't have the same voice. Him and Lister did something weird and then were running and dancing with sparkles. There was a bin on fire and I was confused. I took some photos with my phone. Rimmer went to the row behind me and took this girl's brownie and took a bite and she giggled. A bit later he ran back out and we followed. He needed a phone and everyone chucked their phones at him. I took my phone out and took a photo. I tried to lock it and put it away but I accidently called someone and I had trouble hanging up. Then he asked me for my phone so I gave it to him and I was excited."
"3952"	"(2012-08-14 (21)) Morgan Freeman and someone else were at a park. There were bouncy horses made of grain and Morgan Freeman went on one. There was a company called Slush. The name was an acronym for something and they did catering for parties."
"3953"	"(2012-08-18 (21)) I was at home and Raquel was over. She asked me where to find Winrar and some movies and I asked if she used torrents and she said no. I said we used Pirate Bay 'like Google'. We watched a movie called Psycho Killer. She left a note in my room. Uncle Vic was having a 52nd birthday party. He lived in Oceanside and I was going to stay the night there. Roland and Ezra were also coming. Everyone kept making jokes about hangovers in Oceanside. We were buying alcohol."
"3954"	"(2012-08-19 (21)) There were sets of tables and chairs for the cast of Game of Thrones, then there was a gap and then tables for other people. I was dating Kit Harington so we walked in together and we were at the back with this interviewer guy. Dad had sat down too and tapped Emilia Clarke on the shoulder, saying 'Daenerys' asking her to move. They asked us to move further back because more important people came."
"3955"	"(2012-08-22 (21)) Jayson was still friends with Ezra. Due to something that was happening I agreed to hang out with him one night. We went to this restaurant/hotel which was near the beach. We sat on a high wall with food and it was actually pretty fun. We were talking and joking most of the time. It was the 22nd of January and he suggested I come drinking with him on Saturday. I said I wasn't sure and it was my birthday in a few days. There was a quiet moment where I looked around and I could feel him looking at me and I felt uncomfortable. We made a house made of matchsticks. The lights around the wall got turned off and he said 'I think they're telling us to leave'. It was about 10 or 11pm by this point. We jumped down and walked past the restaurant. We were outside but it was undercover. He stopped under this archway and I kept going and he said 'stop' and I said why and he said 'because I want to kiss you'. I said no but it was a no out of confusion. He asked why I came out with him and I said I didn't know. He came closer and we kept walking and he was still flirting with me. I got home and it was different. I was happy and I looked forward to seeing him again."
"3956"	"(2012-08-25 (21)) I was playing a game. I occasionally joined up with a group of people for some post-apocalyptic stuff. Some of them were Game of Thrones characters. Sansa was in a castle. A guy had just been injured and she rushed to the bedroom to see him, saying 'oh please, let me marry him'. There was a Korean guy. Eddard was at the bed and told Sansa to be quiet in case someone heard. I was with the group from before wandering the streets. We were looking for a bad guy and we turned the corner and saw a huge guy standing there, and it was the guy we were looking for. He roared and ran towards us and we ran. He jumped up and turned into a giant. Some others and I organised to find a tall flat surface. The giant said it was for me and a guy to have sex on and gave us a few minutes. We hid behind stuff as he walked past (he was like a skyscraper). He tried to make a guy eat an orange but he was having trouble. I shoved a bit into his mouth and told him to hold onto me tightly. We grabbed this kid and went to the edge and I told them to hold on tight and jumped. I woke up in bed with the guy there. He said it worked but it wasn't perfect as they hadn't eaten all the oranges. Sansa and Arya joined us. I came back later for an exam. I asked where everyone was and it turned out someone had died and Arya was captured."
"3957"	"(2012-09-10 (21)) I was watching Game of Thrones, but it was different. I was talking to Benjamin on MSN at the same time. Arya and Jaqen were talking on a path and he left. I was thinking 'a man is gone'. Arya started to leave but returned and then there was a test. She held her sword out then a lady came and told her to follow her. She led her to a door which was a portal to somewhere else. Then it was me and I went through the portal. There was a stage and Eric (True Blood) and I went to climb up, but my legs started to feel like jelly and I fell. Eric asked me if I was ok and I said yes. I tried to stand up but couldn't so he picked me up and carried me. I had my arms around him touching behind his shoulder. I was trying not to blush or giggle, but I was excited. There was wine and alcohol. I couldn't remember which was which. I asked a girl to sniff them and she told me which was which. The wine was nicer. Eric gave a boring speech and I waited to see what happened next."
"3958"	"(2012-09-14 (21)) I was at some place that had a little deli/cafe place at the front. I went down one section and there was a bus sinking in water. In the main shop they had a bunch of green apples and they were in lots of 5, but only 1 was ok. I was with a guy and a girl and we used a knife to cut the apples into sections to check them. We found the right one. The guy came over to use the knife to do something. He then walked back and said something implying that a bum had been a murderer. He still had the knife so I suspected him and pointed it out. He came at me but I got a knife and stabbed him. Calvin was there and a girl who I hated and who hated me. Calvin went another way and there was a big open area with a window to the sea. I went on a balcony and looked down at the bottom floor. I could see a little bit of water lapping at the shore. The girl was annoying me so I grabbed her and slammed her against the wall and threw her to the floor. I ran before her other friends could do anything. There was a game with locked doors everywhere that were techy looking. People started coming so I grabbed a gun and hid in a cupboard. They came in and I shot and killed them all."
"3959"	"(2012-09-23 (21)) I was on the forum and a thread derailed and Benjamin posted about how he had a folder about how his future wives should look like, called 'Wives'. He said they were all sizes 10-12 and 12-14. He said he planned on trying others and the next one was the 'fat one from The Spice Girls'. It turned out he meant Sporty Spice and I said she wasn't fat and that she was ugly."
"3960"	"(2012-09-28 (21)) I went to this P90X boot camp thing. It was free, though you were expected to have already bought the DVDs. There was a free package which had weighted gloves and resistance bands and I couldn't lift level 2/3. Tony Horton came near me while I was looking through the package. Later a group of new people asked a girl to get something so they could measure their weight. She refused to show them and Tony called to me. It weighed you and showed everyone your weight, but I did it anyway."
"3961"	"(2012-10-07 (21)) I was at a video shop with Ezra. I was in the horror section and had seen most of the ones there, but found a few interesting looking ones. We left and I saw Spaceman and Rover and put them in the car. I drove off and it was raining. I ended up in a lake and the car sank right to the bottom, but we managed to escape just before that. I got back to the shore and then remembered about the pets. I swam back and found the car and got them out and pushed them to the surface."
"3962"	"(2012-10-15 (21)) Ezra, someone else and I went to see a sequel at a cinema. A later session was the 'premiere' but we went with this one instead. As we left, Bruce Willis drove up and parked right near the door. He said hello to us and followed us in and sat in the back of the car. I accidentally locked it, then unlocked it. I tried to take a photo but my camera kept screwing up. Dad went to the later session with Ezra and a friend."
"3963"	"(2012-11-07 (21)) I went to McDonald's for a job interview. It looked weird inside and the desks were cirlces and looked like sushi. I said I was there for an interview, and I felt confident and was smiling and speaking well etc. This guy took me to a table and was asking me questions. It seemed to be going well, then he said something about people pretending to be friendly and confident etc. I pretended not to notice. Then he asked me about poetry and I said that I hated it, laughing. He said that someone in the back loved it. Then he scrunched up his face and said '10'. Then he just got up and left and I saw a clock behind me and I realised that the interview had to go for ten minutes. I was shocked and a bit embarrassed and just left."
"3964"	"(2012-11-08 (21)) Ezra had fallen in with a scam where he had a job doing roulette but he had to pay them. He ended up $100k in debt. We ended up outside this abandoned building. A big truck came and they were shooting through the windows of the top floor. Mom, Ezra and I were there and we hid behind something.  We were shooting back and they said that I'd shot at the truck so we had to run. I ran to go hide and they ran into the open and started shooting. There was only one guy left, but he killed them both and I was upset. I picked up a hammer and went upstairs. I shot at this guy and we both ran out of bullets so I hit him with the hammer. Then I was watching a movie and this girl fell asleep on a bed. She woke up with other people in there and they weren't threatning her, but were probably not going to let her leave."
"3965"	"(2012-11-09 (21)) I was at home, out the front. There was a big van and I was poking around in the back and I took some stuff out. They went to drive off but the back wasn't closed and I ran after it trying to close it. They were heading towards the church and I was sitting on a log at the corner of the street and I was thinking if someone hit them I would die. The car slammed into them and it flipped over. I was shocked and I went and told Mom and Ezra. They went to go sort some stuff out. Then it was night and I was at home but it was different. I went out to the lounge room and it was dark. I turned the kitchen light on and it was flickering, then I turned on the dining room light and it flickered as well. I realised I was in a dream and I closed my eyes and blocked my nose. I opened my eyes again and the lights were on and there were 2 TVs and a big gaming console. Mom and Ezra were walking up to the front door. Later, I was at a shop and some people were acting dodgy. A girl and I escaped and she forgot her purse. A door was closing downwards and I quickly kicked it out. She left it and we ran. We got in a car and this girl (who was one of the bad guys) was standing in front of the car. I accelerated and hit her and her head got stuck under the wheel. There was blood everywhere. I got home and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to go to England."
"3966"	"(2012-11-13 (21)) I was dating Jason Segel. There was a weird place which involved a stereo speaker where you would go onto a 'pixel' which had a little squishy bit of sand with water. He took me there and we lay down and he got on top of me and kissed me. We hadn't had sex yet. We had dated in secret for a while but some old guy worked it out and started hinting about it to other people. There was a pregnant lady. We were with some people later, including Mom. She invited me and Jason Segel for pancakes and he was making jokes. For some reason they thought I didn't want to eat pancakes. I said that I did and we went."
"3967"	"(2012-11-25 (21)) Benjamin was talking about something that he'd gone to with his ""love"", but he'd broken up with her and was now dating someone else. I was helping Ezra with a quest except it was real life. I did it recently and it was in this haunted house and you had to put torches up to stop spiders spawning. There was a staircase and we had to mine blocks and replace them with paper and climb up. We had to stand on the sides and it was hard. We had to use the walls to lift ourselves. Then we were fighting the boss and we didn't realise we had to poison him to kill him. We killed him then we had to donate something to Morena Baccarin who was the hero of the quest. Ezra decided not to though. I was then at a shop that was closing. I had two water bottles but one was an empty Mount Franklin and was warm, and a half full Pump. A lady was saying the shop was closed but it was like, the freezer was closed and the counter was open. I just left. The doors were closed but opened, shaking slightly. Eugene was there and he was chubby and with a girl. He saw the shaking door too but no one else did. We got to his car and he was worried about it but got in and left. Two guys knocked on the passenger window and gave me contact information for some collection."
"3968"	"(2012-12-01 (21)) It was the day of my flight, except it was night. I hadn't packed anything and I didn't have a suitcase. I had that light blue bag and a plastic bag and I was putting my stuff in them until I realized I couldn't fit my clothes. I called Dad to ask if he had a suitcase. It was almost time to leave for the flight and I started to panic and wanted to cancel, but tried to stay calm."
"3969"	"(2012-12-04 (21)) I was doing an errand for Matthew Inman. I had to go into this shop and write how much he bought one of their comics for. I didn't know so I wrote £1000, then I went back and changed it to £2300, then I found out it was actually £30. Ezra called to ask about some mail which was something to do with first aid from Fruche. I told him to keep it and he said Poppa opened it thinking it was a scam. Mom was watching something on TV. It had Jason Segel in it when he was young and I said that he was quite slim when he was young, then he got chubby, then suddenly got slim again. I was walking on a pier with Kit Harington, but his name was something like Tom Woczyk. The air tasted weird and it started getting stronger. The water looked weird. I choked and passed out. He said that he knew CPR, but he just opened my mouth and blew into it; then he did it properly. We went away from that area and some bottles of Sriarcha had leaked. Two friends walked into a closet and saw something. A lady held them back and they said ""I didn't see anything"" and she said ""you can go"". Arnold Schwarzenegger was there and he said to me ""You must be Phil"" and then I said ""... Izzy"". We shook hands and swapped something."
"3970"	"(2012-12-06 (21)) I was following Benjamin around. I was right behind him in a queue at one point. Then I started keeping my distance. He went into a shop and kissed this girl and I realized it was the Bulgarian girl. I started to leave and they saw me and started following me. I ran into an auditorium and went down to the floor and sat. They didn't see me. I asked a girl next to me if they had seen me and if they left and she said that they hadn't. I thought she was lying and went to move and they saw me. Then there were terrorists. They set the place up in flames and there were a few survivors. Midge Ure was the leader of the group I followed, with another guy. Another two guys were leading another group. We had to hide and a guy and I went into a lake. We went under a jetty but then saw they were looking at us. The girl had replaced a manifest and some birth certificates but they noticed straight away. Then it was like Far Cry 3 and I ended up with a gun and was taking people out. I mostly used a sniper rifle. I was at home and Mom made some pot cookies. I had some and felt weird after a while."
"3971"	"(2012-12-09 (21)) I wiggled my tooth and it was loose and then I found a few more loose teeth. One of them came out and there was a tooth underneath. I made an appointment for 6am the next day. I got to the dentist and they said because my regular dentist wasn't there it would cost extra. I mixed up the time and I got there an hour later than I was supposed to. It cost $2300 for the exam and $3000 for being late. I was depressed to see my bank account down to only $3000."
"3972"	"(2012-12-27 (21)) I was at a party or a gathering at a house. It was like the after party of a big funeral or something. A guy in the family, who was about my age, was a bit weird and someone suspected him of doing something dodgy. I found some bombs in some bins and I moved them into one bin next to the house. My car was a few metres away and I went near it and wondered what to do next. I heard a noise and saw that a small bomb had gone off in the bin and the other bombs followed. The house caught on fire and an explosion ended up throwing my car over the road. I ran around the corner and started filming it on my phone. I turned another corner and everyone was screaming and running around. Then it was a movie and 'I' was calling out for my mother and found 'my' mother and checked if she was okay. Then 'I' was part of the conspiracy. I was talking to someone about it and they were saying there could be evidence so I should stop filming."
"3973"	"(2013-01-03 (21)) I woke up and went on Facebook to see a million posts about Kit Harington having died. He had been in a 'fatal car accident'. The headline on an article was 'Kit Harington dies a brother' -- his last word was apparently 'brother'. I was worried about the future of Game of Thrones and also felt weird and sad about it."
"3974"	"(2013-01-16 (21)) I was watching Detention 2. It was like a 'choose your own adventure' story. There was a guy that Riley (Detention) liked and a chubby guy that she kind of liked who also liked her. Sometimes Riley was me. I was in a restaurant and I sat down at a dirty table and said that my Dad worked here and organised stuff, and the waitress looked at me impatiently so I just gave her my order. Two guys sat down with me. At some point there was something chasing me somewhere. Every time it ate something or moved, it mutated (sometimes only slightly, other times a massive change). It was huge. It would jump and try to land on me. I had a bow and arrow to attack it with. I ended up at this place which was maybe a school and now Cinderhella was chasing me. I went outside and everything was covered with snow and it was freezing. The cold hit me hard. I was wearing shorts and a shirt and had no shoes on. I found 3 taxis and got into the second one. I was now Riley again and it took her to the guy she liked and he asked her to prom. Then it was 5 months later and Cinderhella attacked her again. Then it went back to the taxis -- the first one would take her to the guy who liked her too and the third had a taxi driver whose family was being taken hostage by Cinderhella and he had to take her to them. Then it was me again and I jumped out and run back to pick another one."
"3975"	"(2013-01-19 (21)) Hugo was on the forum. He had been for a while, but we had never mentioned it. I sent him a message about something and when I was him at work next, he mentioned it, saying he had been too uncomfortable to bring it up and was glad that it was out in the open (or whatever). I laughed nervously and agreed (it was something irrelevant to anything, like a forum list). Then he suggested we go on a 'double date' or get something to eat or something and I was confused. Later, I was out with Mom at a shop. I felt sick and threw up a little bit."
