    "description": "Rob Bosnak is a well-known, Jungian-oriented dream analyst and dream-group leader who has written several books on dreams, including one -- Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming (Delacorte Press, 1996) -- that includes 53 of his own dreams and his analysis of them. But are his interpretations plausible?  Does he understand his own dreams?  To answer that question for yourself, you can make your own analysis and then compare it with his.  You also can compare his analysis with what emerged from a Hall/Van de Castle content analysis of the dream series, and with what several students concluded after they made their own separate blind analyses of the series before they read his interpretations."
