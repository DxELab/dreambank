"001"	"(04/23/1983)"	"[my last year of high school] I was walking outside in a neighborhood, nothing I recognized.  It started to get grey outside, it was going to rain.  The clouds were huge, puffy, and they were moving fast.  A grey cloud descended toward me.  It went over my head, and when it got about 3 feet from the ground, behind me, a lighting bolt struck out of it, down to the ground with a loud crash.  It occurred to me that I was in a dangerous spot, that I could be struck, too, so I began to run back to my house.  Then another cloud descended.  These were agile clouds and moved quickly.  It also went over my head behind me, but this one skidded to the ground, and the minute it touched the cement of the street, the earth crumbled.  A tremor earthquake split near me and I ran, or climbed, it seemed, for the earth seemed to be rolling, falling, and I had to keep on top. It was suddenly just a huge ball.  I scrambled toward my home because in front of me was a large crack splitting open the earth.  I thought: I'm going to be separated from everyone.  The earth kept falling apart until all I lay on was a red, orange substance or ball.  I could see ahead across the black space (I was in the universe, or space, without an atmosphere.)  I saw a fragile white globe with a hole in one side, the hole was about 50 feet across.  This sphere was large, as large as our moon, and I could see it from a distance so that I could see all of it, how large it was.  It was hollow inside where the hole was.  The hole was not ragged, it had a beveled or smoothed edge.  Somehow I knew that white ball was my destination, that I should go to it, climb in the hole.  But I was debating it.  I don't know if there were other people with me, or who I was discussing it with, but I was telling them, yes, we/I should go there.  I did.  It was easy enough to get there. I think I just crossed over or stepped on to it.  But there is something more about the red 'lava' ball I had just left, that I am forgetting now, something I peered into, got swallowed.  So I crossed to the white globe.  I clung to the edge of the hole and looked inside.  A bright light filled the entire globe, but it was coming directly from the other end of the globe, opposite the hole.  This huge bright light did not have implications of life after life.  It seemed rather more like a sun, a life, a place to go to live.  It was just a light inside a globe.  I knew I must go there, but I hesitated.  It was very windy.  I can feel my hands clinging to the edge of that fragile globe, as I climbed over and dropped.  I let myself go and dropped fast all the way through the middle of the white toward that light.  This part I don't remember as well.  All I remember is a grey, milky substance that I could see in slow motion, bursting, forming into drops or streams.  It was as if I had come out through the other side of the globe and was either shooting out in front of, behind, or within this milky liquid.  I was heading directly toward something.   I was being pulled, gravity.  I thought - where is the gravity coming from?  My memory now skips something, and I found myself in a large house with red-brown furnishing.  I knew something then, like, 'this is my entrance into it, my way in, through this, my house.'  The house was for me and I knew it.  I had started exploring it, walking in and out of rooms, up and down levels, steps through doorways, looking around my new house.  It was furnished, and not exactly to my taste, but it was nice.  I suddenly thought - here, I can have anything that pleases me - so I set out to get a dog.  I was not in my house now, but I came to a door (in a line of doors, in a wall outside), opened it, looked through, and on the ground, lined up were 20 or 30 black labs sleeping on their sides, in a line going across the doorway.  A man came to help me choose.  I told him I wanted a weimaraner and lab mix.  We looked through them, turning them over and looking at the labels, until we found one marked 'lab/weim.'  They were no longer alive, but statues of dogs.  I can't remember ever taking one home, or going back to the house, for that matter.  I walked around my new area, but it wasn't a neighborhood, there were no homes that I saw, just areas divided by steps, fences, passages, outdoors.  There were some large open spaces.  I then found out that in this place you could have anything you wanted, that you didn't even have to ask, but just 'think' that you want it, and it was there.  There was so much creativity and freedom to be curious and invent/materialze things.  You could move things with your mind.  It seemed that I could do this more or better than everyone. That I had the largest house.  Everyone was most partial to me and I discovered that I was the leader, or head ruler, here.  I just 'knew' it all of a sudden, because of something I had done, maybe entering through a more physical way than the others.  The next events were all showing how I could use my mind to do things, that anything I wished for appeared.  I spent several years there full of events I can't recall now, but one day, (this is somewhat hazy) across a large breezy field, was a small house.  I saw myself first from the other side of the field, then close up, and then my mother and father were there, talking solemnly to me, explaining something.  I remember thinking to them - but I don't want to die! I like it here - but what I was thinking to myself was - I don't want to leave here and go live with you.  But they calmly explained something.  I think I submitted to it then. "
"002"	"(02/10/1984)"	"[my first year of college] Mother, my middle sister, and I were outside on a prairie.  There were 4 clouds (white, elliptical-shaped, and fluffy) moving slowly.  One descended and as it almost reached the ground, it separated and became frantic ostriches who flew quickly away.  The next cloud did the same.  Then I looked up and said, oh, this one above me must do the same.  As it descended over my head I reached up and touched, palm flat, the underside of the mass.  At once it frantically separated into ostriches.  I looked at my hand and saw that it was dirty and dusty, the entire palm.  (From the ostriches flying so long, they had picked up a lot of dirt.)  But this group of ostriches seemed confused, a few toppled.  I saw one ostrich in the distance fall from a great height, but as it hit, it merely settled softly like a feather puff.  Then a switch - it was a camp I think.  It wasn't clear who or what was going on, but somehow this ostrich was still there and it was very dangerous.  A man and a girl were there.  The girl became my oldest sister, and the guy became Ken [her college boyfriend.] My oldest sister peeked out from behind a structure, and it looked (to the ostriches) like an ostrich was peeking out, so the white ostrich raced after her and killed her.  Then Ken was on his own.  I remember thinking: 'He would have to make it on his own.'  He became another person, perhaps me, and began to climb a steep hill, but couldn't make it up.  The ostrich became a person who was still after the Ken-guy.  The Ken-guy tried to pull himself up onto something which had a refrigerator door and handle, and the door kept opening.  Then it had 4 handles around it, like a cube.  He tried something else, I think he was hiding in a cubicle in a wall of earth - but someone else came on the scene, and then the killer (ostrich) guy realized he would have to stop.  He began talking to the Ken-guy about the situation, in a very open way."
"003"	"(06/??/1986)"	"I dreamed I was impregnated by a bat.  I was walking down a road with three other girls, and I suddenly knew a bat had impregnated me, and that he had chosen me over the other girls because I was a vegetarian."
"004"	"(06/30/1989)"	"I dreamed I could move things with my mind, that I could bring things to me with the right combination of relaxation and concentration.  I also dreamed my wallet was stolen, but the only things taken were my collection of calling cards, not the money."
"005"	"(11/??/1989)"	"I was with an alien.  We were on the alien's planet, a dry rocky landscape.  In this dream I was male, and the alien was female.  I was getting to know her, but we did not speak the same language, we communicated telepathically and with hand motions.  The alien was very small, under two feet.  It was pink, very sensual, it moved gracefully.  I kept thinking of the word nubile.  Its features were not very distinct, just a general impression of femininity, alien-ness, sensuality.  I dreamed I made love with this alien."
"006"	"n/a"	"(06/11/1990 (#1)) My sister (the middle one) was in a weird mood - childish.  She was being mean to me, so while she was on the phone, I went to bed.  She came in (this takes place in our childhood home) and started teasing me with a brown puppet.  ""Now be careful,"" she said, ""this is made of chocolate.""  I reached over the covers and hit that puppet as hard as I could.  ""Uh!  Be careful,"" she said.  I would not respond the way she wanted and she turned to leave. But then she turned and came back for more.  She did not see Mom come in the room then.  My sister was jabbing me and poking me with a fork.  I was cowering by then, because she was really hurting me.  I tried to scream, glad that Mom was finally there.  I got this little squeak out and it woke me up.  "
"007"	"n/a"	"(06/11/1990 (#2)) Early in dream, I was looking for studio rental space for Tom M.  Saw about four places.  Then I was out with friends.  Unclear.  I met a man who I felt like I may have met before.  He was deformed, but not like the Other one, seen in channeling.  This man's eyes were strange.  I think he was bald.  He was a bit pitiful.  The Other one in channeling was confident, strong within himself.  This man was needy.  I invited him over.  We went to my childhood home, to my oldest sister's room (my room during high school).  We talked, but did not have sex.  I think I stopped him from touching me a few times.  I knew he liked me.  Finally I just wanted him to leave.  His eyes would change from one long eye - a slit, to two eyes, to other deformed eyes.  It was very early morning.  I told him he would have to sneak out before my parents saw him.  He almost cried and said no, he wanted to meet my parents!  I was horrified, but managed to tell him that my father was very mean about me with men and he couldn't find out that he was in there.  He was upset.  I went out of the room and discovered Dad awake and ready for work and Mom up too.  I really did not want them to know I had brought someone home, especially someone that pitiful.  I thought of having my middle sister help me get Mom distracted, wait til after Dad left, and slipping the guy out.  His name was Hardy??  Well Mom asked me about the man in my room!  So she knew.  Then Dad was creeping around the bedroom door and I had to tell him I really didn't want him to go in.  So he knew too.  Then I opened the bedroom door.  Hardy was gone, but he had left a note, engraved on three pieces of thick leather, telling me how much he loved me.  My family saw the leather notes, they had pictures and complicated flowers drawn in.  They were beautiful."
"008"	"n/a"	"(06/11/1990 (#3)) Ed (another student) and I are looking at maps of California.  He is laying on top of my back.  It feels good.  We're looking for Gilroy, and I see detail and towns I never noticed before.  We kiss a few times."
"009"	"n/a"	"(06/11/1990 (#4)) I am in bed and the phone rings.  When I answer it I say something unintelligible, like ""Channel 13, oops, I mean uh, Tara"", because I'd just woken up.  The person on the other line is a child or two children, sounds long distance.  I can't understand her, she sounds young.  While listening I go to the apartment door, it won't seem to close, the deadbolt is too far from the frame.  This worries me."
"010"	"n/a"	"(10/09/1990 (#1)) [I was dictating, speaking out loud the following while waking up] : ""The young men and women have each walked up to their grandfathers and grandmothers.  This is the word for overcome.  The litany..."" [Dreamed as I was falling asleep, visions really, not like dreams] :  1) The incident with the guy in university library when I was in high school, coming away from that and crying as if it were rape.  2) Delivering a baby, midwife telling me it should be no problem, it will go smooth, let it out, and then seeing vision of an ear of corn and pulling husks down exposing ear.  Like - giving birth to corn."
"011"	"n/a"	"(10/09/1990 (#2)) Rob and I - we each feel the fertilized seed inside me.  It doesn't dawn on me that I'm pregnant til later.  Then I'm very upset.  He is calm.  I thought I could give it away somehow before it starts development.  After stressing about the impending abortion, it suddenly hits me:  I don't have to give it away.  This is Rob's baby, I've wanted this.  I'd be stupid to give it up.  I can keep it.  In this dream, Rob was thinking about other women, there was this impending future separation, when I would give the embryo to his new girl (or old girlfriend). [Rob was a major love interest of mine, met him while fighting a fire in California, fell head over heels for him, but he was always 'unattainable'.]"
"012"	"n/a"	"(10/09/1990 (#3)) At a singing convention or something.  I get my hotel room, meet my roommate.  Another girl walks in.  As she's leaving she starts to kiss me, then says, ""of course, if you don't want to, I understand.""  ""Wait,"" I say, ""let's talk about this.  Do you want to go somewhere private?""  I'm looking at my roommate and her friend, wondering why they're listening in.  My roommate says, ""We'd rather watch this.""  But the girl and I leave; down the hall.  We're getting into some cupboard like the kind under a grocery register.  She's not as open now.  I tell her that earlier I had wanted to kiss her, it had felt so natural, did she know what I meant?  ""Yes,"" she "
"013"	"(01/31/1991)"	"[Saw Mindwalk last night.] Since people feel powerless at doing something about pollution, set up coin-op river (or stack?) scrubbers, like a little parking meter, you put in a dollar, and so much charcoal is emptied out into the water to purify it.  Then people will feel an immediate part of the solution. Low cost per person."
"014"	"n/a"	"(03/27/1991 (#1)) With Jeff (ex-fiance' who is a chef) in restaurant in a house, upstairs.  Some danger or scare.  I run downstairs, then up."
"015"	"n/a"	"(03/27/1991 (#2)) Important dream, more substance, neat things happening but I can't remember any of them.  Surroundings unusual.  I go downstairs.  A man is there who I like.  Events I can't remember, playing.  I get on elevator and just before the door closes, I pull the man in too.  We go up.  We are happy, smiling together.  Rob? or Dan?"
"016"	"(04/15/1991)"	"I met Michio Kushi [macrobiotic guru] at a gathering.  He had a great sense of humor.  He held a round heavy ball in his hands.  We talked about food."
"017"	"n/a"	"(04/16/1991 (#1)) I had a small cat I wanted to take care of.  I wanted to mother and love it.  Then it was a roach, in the cactus pot I have that is pink stucco and oval.  I still wanted to take care of it.  (Like if I can't have a kid, I'll have cacti to take care of.)"
"018"	"n/a"	"(04/16/1991 (#2)) A traveling dream."
"019"	"(07/20/1991)"	"The fire crew is around.  The houses we live in are much nicer, larger, with shiny black tile floor in the bathroom.  Bathroom is much larger than in reality.  I start to feel sick.  I am aware the rest of the crew are in their houses or one nearby house.  I have trouble breathing.  It seems lungs or nose is so blocked I can barely get enough air in.  It gets worse and worse til I am using all my effort just to suck in air.  I see the assistant crew boss and tell him I can hardly breathe.  He seems totally unconcerned and says something like - Well it won't last very long.  I find if I just move [I actually turned over in bed] I can suddenly breathe okay, but the potential for blocking air is still there.  Next I am in our bath / bedroom.  It is nicely furnished.  I undress, look down and discover I have a penis, an erection.  Female parts too.  I think: so this is what it's like to feel an erection.  Then blood - I get in the tub - lots of blood - clumps, not drops.  Feel like I will pass out.  I call Michelle to take me to the hospital."
"020"	"n/a"	"(07/20/1991 (#2)) My oldest sister's college boyfriend is telling Dad how to do something. [I had asked earlier, on the fire crew bus, for lower back pain to go away, to discover the emotional reason for this pain.  I fell asleep immediately on the bus.]"
"021"	"n/a"	"(07/21/1991 (#1)) I am at a dating service / match-up in an upscale neighborhood near Dallas.  Very nice house, uppity, well furnished, deep browns.  Filling out the form / questionnaire.  Two or three young women, impeccably groomed, go over it with me.  They are nice.  I have been called back to change the form, later.  I have too many requirements for the man I want. Michelle [of fire crew] is in the house, she's filling one out.  I vaguely recall she was the one who marked some of the requirements for my match man, things I didn't really want or need in  a man.  Like - ""good-looking"" and ""has money"".  We had been in a hurry or something so she did these for me, although she wasn't there the first time I filled it out.  So I'm redoing things on the form, the women come over to help sometimes.  Meanwhile they are throwing a party, matchmaking party for a group of the women and men who are clients.  It is in a nearby room with door closed or cracked.  One man (reminds me of a firefighter on another crew) comes out of the party, I hear party sounds, and comes over to me.  I feel rather underdressed, not re: style, but bare-legged, but I like his attention.  I look down and see I have wild tights on, shorts?  Colorful patterns.  It is understood that he is part of, or was put in, the group of available people in the party room, and that he is not to be part of the group I will be matched with.  He is smiling and likes me.  Oh, before this, I could see my reflection as I refilled out the form, in a nice wall hanging.  Once, the table I was sitting on moved and I scooted it back so I could see myself again in the mirror or wall hanging or picture.  I sat on the big table most of the time, then moved to sit at one end.  Anyway, something about liking how I look when he comes over.  We are talking when one of the business women comes over and admonishes him for coming out, because I am not part of the group of women they would have picked for him.  I am amused at all this, not sad or feeling loss.  Michelle is in that party room, I hear music and laughter.  I wonder slightly why she already has a party set up when I filled out forms before her but it doesn't bother me.  I am just amused this guy left his group, came out and saw me and took interest."
"022"	"n/a"	"(07/21/1991 (#2)) Next I am dreaming of Cher.  She is very buoyant, big personality.  She is talking about what she would want to be, professions.  She goes through each one, and acts each out, jumping, diving, in various costumes.  She goes through several, all action.  Then the last one, she says, ""or I would be a lap-dog.  I had this lap-dog once, and he was so (wonderful?) or (cuddly?).""  To act it out, we go to see him at her house.  (Now, apparently she still has him.)  We walk to her house.  At the entrance, she opens the door, there is a staircase, white, stucco or rock or cement, smooth and clean, right there by the door.  She calls the dog and sits on a lower step.  Dog comes around the corner, down the stairs.  It is white, small, a kind I do not like.  She holds it and pets it."
"023"	"n/a"	"(07/21/1991 (#3)) I see a small pool of water between the stair and door.  The door is still open.  I sit at the pool/fountain and am pushing small pebbles around with my bare foot, moving them into places.  Cher says, when I take my foot out, that I am tracking rocks around (the steps) or (her house).  I pick up the pebbles with my toes and put them back in the water.  Slightly embarrassed at getting her house dirty."
"024"	"(07/25/1991)"	"I dream about my middle sister's baby, its name is David. [In reality she doe not have any children.] My middle sister is sad about being pregnant.  But it definitely changes her, makes her stronger, more mature.  I don't know who the father is.  Mom cooks 15 turkeys - ovens all over the whole wall - pumpkin pies, Thanksgiving.  Telling someone about the time I had to go outside to turn off a light - being scared.  Good feelings in all parts of this dream.  Male friends (I don't recognize them) coming by, or I meet them.  Or male friends are there for Thanksgiving - good feelings about this. Making love with a guy, telling my pregnant sister so she can decide to leave the room.  Hazy:  Deciding to get in my car and go to Northern Arizona, Petrified Forest, or Hovenweep?  Or to school?  Looking at baby - its eyes, its smile, not picking it up but thinking about it.  (Why don't I pick it up?  I want to, but don't.)  Baby's eyes moving - first they're close-set, then wider apart.  Pregnant sister is about to go on a trip - She's planning on delivering baby while on trip.  When we protest she acts like - what can I do?  ( I think she won the trip.)  She feels she has to follow through with the trip."
"025"	"n/a"	"(07/26/1991 (#1)) First the assistant fire crew boss is taking the crew through the USFS compound.  Houses are older, SF style and others, stylish, but running down and abandoned.  Then I am coming to a home - not mine.  I go inside and there's a housekeeper - male - he looks like the maintenance ranger at The Maze or that guy on Star Trek.  He is rather weird - quiet, over-polite, but it's like when he gets alone he is laughing at us.  I feel sorry for him.  He has a sort of power.  Scene of me running around old buildings / houses, up and down steps, through passages.  Scene in apartment, preparing to or taking a bath.  Boyfriend there?  Him cleaning up after my spill - food?  Something about unpacking a suitcase."
"026"	"n/a"	"(07/26/1991 (#2)) Allen (my good friend from high school) and I are out partying.  Lots of traveling around, some car scenes, headlights?  Allen is okay, then he starts to have like drug withdrawal spasms or coming off drugs.  He's spazzing out, shaking, convulsions.  Scares me.  I try to get him home, which is hard.  I'm pulling him at one point - we're out by the road, and half his middle finger comes off in my hand and goes flying.  I ignore it and get him home.  Curvy roads, narrow, dark.  Next morning I ask him how his hand is.  He pulls it up and notices for the first time that half his finger is missing.  Sadness, anxiety.  When I woke up - 2 things in mind.  First, I was repeating the phrase ""time is time for asbestos"" or ""the time is the time for asbestos"".  (They're doing asbestos testing here at the fire crew houses at Blue Ridge.)  Also, I had the feeling some character had been pleading for something in the dream, over and over.  Like ""please mister can we sleep here?  or stay here?""  Or ""do something"".  Feeling it had to do with Marten (fellow park ranger, casual lover, never a boyfriend) telling me about the kids dying in the car crash he responded to.  Like one of them asking?"
"027"	"(07/29/1991)"	"[Slept outside] I am pregnant, I figure out the due date by counting exactly nine months.  It is soon.  I see and feel my big round stomach.  I tell two friends when the due date is and on that day we wait for labor to begin.  It doesn't start.  I am disappointed and keep counting, recounting back nine months, going, yes this is the day, then realizing it could be within any two weeks or so from now.  Later I know it's been born but realize it is a colt.  Same two friends and I go see the colt.  I am very protective of it, wanting to feed it.  It seems violent or the object of violence by other horses.  This is a dream where when I woke up I was repeating a sentence or phrase (again) which had nothing to do with the dream.  Can't remember that phrase now.  At one point I and the fire crew are in a house under construction.  We are waiting to work there?  Some stuff goes on.  Then I see a little smoke, like from a cigarette.  I look for it but can't find it and also feel so drowsy and hazy that I begin slapping my face and hitting my head to try to wake up.  I say to myself how blurry everything is.  Then I see smoke again and pinpoint it around a corner in this house.  But I'm still too blurry-eyed to get it exactly.  I feel sleepy and foggy.  Slapping my face.  Doesn't work.  At this point is when I think I opened my eyes a bit on the couch and actually did see a hallucination of smoke in my living room.  Then I experienced a false awakening.  I dreamed that I woke up and went to the next room and found Kevin, another firefighter on the crew.  I tell him laughing that I just saw smoke and that I tried to wake myself up by slapping myself but it didn't work so I must have been dreaming.  I go up some stairs and must have been thinking about how strange what just happened was, when I got the idea that I had traveled astrally.  I think maybe something else happened in between that was astral travel, because I was convinced and excited that I must have just left my body.  I either went up those stairs excited about it or I sent my astral body up the stairs.  I turned and saw Brion and said ""Brion - such and such just happened so I was traveling in my astral body!  I went out of body!""  Then seeing him and still being blurry-eyed like before I said:  ""Come up here and just stand there a minute.  I think I can see your aura.""  He came and stood.  I took a good look all over him.  ( A rushing sound?)  Close up, certain parts.  I remembered reading you should half-close your eyes to see auras, so I did.  The feeling was intense as I did this.  He had a white glowing halo all around his body.  It didn't have great shape though and I kept feeling it was just because my eyesight was so bad and I couldn't focus, so maybe it wasn't his aura.  I don't know.  I looked at a few other things and the people I think all had that white hazy glow around them.  Then Kevin saw some cigarette papers and wanted a cigarette.  I didn't want him to because I remembered seeing that smoke in the house.  I told him - ""well we're not supposed to smoke inside, and your tobacco is not here, it's out (in the car?), and also I had that dream, remember, and maybe it's a precognitive dream?  What if it comes true?""  I was pretty convinced it was precognitive.  That's why I really didn't want him to smoke.  But I couldn't tell him no.  Next I went to the jeep and drove somewhere, like a shopping area.  I found Mom and Dad and they had just bought my middle sister a new Toyota pickup truck - red.  Dad especially was surprised to see me.  Said something like - ""well look who's here.  What are you doing here?""  Don't remember much else."
"028"	"n/a"	"(08/22/1991 (#1)) I decide to run away and live in Carlsbad Cave.  I want to disappear from my known society.  I bring a few things, but realize later the things I forgot.  Seems like I had a pillow or sleeping bag.  I go to the cave, planning all the while where I will sleep in the cave, how I will live.  The cave is a totally different setup than it is in waking reality.  But I know my way and recognize passages.  I wonder how I will get into a side passage without all the tourists seeing me.  I look for the passage I want, passing up some because they are not the right ones.  I find the one I want and carry my stuff in.  I am thinking about cave security, logistics of getting out, when they close the cave and lock it, etc.  I go back in this passage (I wanted one with light so I can read) and at some point realize that it connects to a ranger parking area, like a covered garage or in-cave parking.  So a ranger sees me (seems like he recognizes me), and my stuff and he frowns, wondering what I'm doing there.  I realize this is pretty impossible, living in this cave.  So I decide to go home and to impress everyone, I think, I'll walk home.  From New Mexico.  Then I think how will I get my jeep home?  I think, I'll push it home."
"029"	"n/a"	"(08/22/1991 (#2)) I am in a suburban area.  In one part I am in a bar or restaurant.  I go in alone and am going to order and eat alone.  My oldest sister is there, with someone.  I say hi and find a black high stool to sit on.  She is really surprised I am not going to sit with her.  Then I start seeing people who know me.  One big man comes out, sees me, gives me a big hug and says he missed me. [Tom B?] It is like being at Charly's [bar in Flagstaff] at open mic., everyone knowing me.  Then Joel (another student) is there.  I am so glad to see him.  We hug and talk, look for another black stool for him.  There is something significant about doing this in front of my oldest sister, like showing her how many people like me and miss me.  Later I am driving around, looking for Joel's or maybe Pat E's house.  It is an unfamiliar area to me now, but it seemed like I'd been there once before.  I read the street signs but don't quite remember them now."
"030"	"n/a"	"(08/29/1991 (#1)) I am in a dream with Dad and family and we're traveling in a Volkswagen bus or van.  The car breaks down?  We have to push it?  We are low on food or ill-prepared and I tell Mom or Dad I'm really hungry, ""don't they have any food? because I didn't bring any.""  Then I remember I do have some.  And I get up and rummage around this makeshift wooden shelf built in the van, at about head level.  It's like the car is either packed full or these boards are really hard to get around.  And I see a paper bag full of my familiar foods - rice cakes, macrobiotic stuff."
"031"	"n/a"	"(08/29/1991 (#2)) I am in a place that is remote, desert or seaside and not wealthy, like Rocky Point, Mexico.  But it is not Mexico.  I am hired as a housekeeper/nanny by a particular household that is quite wealthy.  On the way there, we hire another woman for the same job, so there'll be two of us.  She is beautiful, tall, blond, capable, sure, grounded.  I know I will enjoy being with her.  The house is huge and very nicely furnished.  There are so many floors and rooms I keep discovering more.  But right away the other woman housekeeper and I find out there is something strange and unfair about the family.  We never see the mom or dad but the son is about ten and very spoiled.  We also see the house manager or cook or someone, an older? woman.  The blond girl decides to start laundry, and she is going through the house finding things that need doing, while I am unsure because I've never had this job before.  She is in the kitchen by a wood block, talking to the son.  Manager woman is there?  I find out she's agreed to keep a secret for the son, about two fish he had as pets.  He has taken them out of the water and rolled them in a newspaper sheet and put them in a kitchen cupboard, a higher one, above an oven or something.  Blond girl says she won't say anything.  But then there is a blowup where manager comes in demanding answers to the fish mystery, son is silent;  absent mom, we find out, is mad.  I am quiet too.  Blonde girl is doing laundry when manager comes in, talks to her, fires her.  Blond girl is upset, her boyfriend comes to get her.  I can even see them as they drive down the road in that poor place, although I haven't left the house.  So I get to work.  I start stripping the beds, I discover another laundry room in the house, I'm working quickly, trying to do a good job.  Right before she got fired, after the blowup about the fish, I had either written a note or told someone I would show them where the fish was and solve it.  Now, while working, I realize I had better stay out of it.  Manager comes in and, seeming sorry about firing her, asks - so how good a housekeeper was she (the blonde girl)?  I say ""I don't know!  I've never done this job before and have nothing to compare her with!""  I go running while the laundry is in.  I'm running through streets, deserty, toward a beach or strip, it's poor around me."
"032"	"n/a"	"(08/29/1991 (#3)) Also I dreamed I was in a situation with a boyfriend I had after Robert K, but I don't know which one.  He was pretty normal.  In this dream I was cleaning up Robert K's ""messes"", I remember a big pizza box in the back of a house that he's left there, with half eaten pizza.  This man and I do or decide other things, walking through house. [I think this came before the housecleaning dream.]"
"033"	"n/a"	"(08/29/1991 (#4)) Also had a dream I was in the Sarah Lawrence Performing Arts Center, watching a student-choreographed piece.  It was in the present because I clearly felt sad that I had once watched Xandria (a fellow student at Sarah Lawrence) dance there, one time after her abortion.  The piece in the dream was incredibly beautiful and moving.  I remember one young woman sitting with one knee up? moving her head in precise, haunting ways.  Lighting was interesting.  I remember missing seeing those concerts, and missing Xandria and Isabella and also the person that I was then, feeling the happiness of the person I was at that time and place."
"034"	"n/a"	"(08/29/1991 (#5)) I am on the back patio of a wealthy ranch-style house.  Dad is around.  Richard Dreyfuss too?  He keeps bugging me.  I am standing up the whole time.  I am weaving with cotton, a small thick rug, like an Indian rug.  Then I take a stiff card and scrape, scrape hard down the square I've weaved.  It becomes more finished-looking.  Then I think - that's the Pueblo way, now the Navajo way is to scrape horizontally.  So I turn the card on its side and scrape horizontally, and more fluff comes off, it's like big pieces of extra fluff are coming away, making it look better and better.  This guy comes up and tells me something negative.  Like I'd better do something (can't remember what) or it won't be right.  I feel contempt for him.  I am aware that I've been standing this whole time.  Later I'm with Dad in the front yard - well manicured lawn and trees. [Dad was in another Native American dream located near our childhood home - something about a cave.]"
"035"	"n/a"	"(08/29/1991 (#6)) I am in my room as it is in Tucson.  Visitors are there.  We three are sharing the bed.  But they keep rearranging the room, the pillows, the board under my bed is cut in half, half gone.  It is late.  I am getting annoyed.  Then Mom is there, taking clothes out of the closet, she wants just one dowel rod.  I am getting more upset, telling her to stop but she doesn't.  I remember the clock over on the windowsill."
"036"	"n/a"	"(08/31/1991 (#1)) I am driving in the jeep with Robert P (a former boyfriend), toward a National Park.  It's a generic N.P. because I don't recognize it.  We're going uphill.  We start to roll backwards, downhill.  The brakes are not working well.  I try the emergency brake.  It also does not work.  We are rolling fairly slowly backwards, downhill.  I am scared but Robert P seems unconcerned, almost mocking me.  I finally have to ask him what to do.  He is not helping at all.  He says something about jumping out at a certain point.  I look out the window and rear-view mirror, notice I have my white filmy dress on.  I decide to roll the jeep into a ditch.  I do, it stops.  I get out and walk up the hill.  After that, Robert P's not in the dream.  I come to the N.P., feeling comfortable and sure like I always do in N.P.'s, that familiarity.  I talk to a ranger inside about the car trouble, ask him for phone.  Nice visitor center.  I go to the phone, there's a line of people waiting to use the phone.  A woman cuts in, and everyone else crabs at her about how long they've been waiting.  She leaves, suddenly it's my turn.  As soon as I step up to pick up the receiver to call Dad about the car, Dad walks up to me right there!!!!  I find this amazing!  Dad and I talk about the jeep, he figures out what's wrong without even looking at it.  He's a little disgusted in his way about car trouble - a nuisance.  Then there's a N.P./Ranger series of events. Something about Dad wanting this wood and wire net structure they were going to throw out.  A ranger is frowning at him when he picks it up (it's pretty big).  Discouraging him.  Ranger suggests he can do it (whatever he needs to do -  like carrying a bunch of these items out) another way.  Ranger helps him set it up.  Mom is there now, in background.  I help too but the technology is all new to me.  I feel incapable but learning.  The Ranger gets a larger tarp-like thing and says Dad can use this.  It is a thing that, when wetted, will keep things warm.  Ranger gets hose and Dad and he are hosing this circular part of it to activate it.  It is a rubber-like material.  I get on hands and knees to help, and feel the water coming toward me, washing over my hands and nearby items.  I really felt like I was witnessing some new, incredible breakthrough technology, something we don't have here on earth yet."
"037"	"n/a"	"(08/31/1991 (#2)) I am at Rob's.  But while the dream is long, and it all occurs at Rob's, he never appears in it.  It is clear that he is always busy with some errand or task with another woman.  I am sure he is not 'seeing' these women romantically, he is helping them out or visiting them, but then again, he does like women.  In one part, I decide to clean his bathroom.  The details of each fixture and the black trim on the woodwork are very vivid.  His sister is around?"
"038"	"(09/02/1991)"	"Rob and I are at a dinner party or get together at one of his friends'.  We are happy together.  He is introducing me to his friends.  I start to help hostess make salad.  Salad spinner.  Even though Rob goes to talk to friends now and then, he always comes back to see how I am, to see me.  In the kitchen we hug and he starts kissing  my neck, slowly and teasing, up my neck.  He is turning me on and we are both so happy.  I have to push him away because my legs have started to climb up his legs of their own volition - he is turning me on.  We are laughing and I pull him close and whisper fiercely - I am going to kill you! (for turning me on at this party).  The hostess asks me to watch one of the children.  I sit down with him - he's pretty young.  There are other children, adults mingling.  The child I'm watching takes a blue water bottle and presses it on the head of one of his toy men in a little car.  I tell him ""No"" and take the water bottle off, ""don't hurt your toy, No.""  I check to make sure the toy man is okay because this toy is alive, he's a little man, and though he is squished, he pops up with a dazed look.  Back to kid I'm watching.  He understands the admonishment and turns straight at me and says ""rhyme?"" and then starts reciting poetry he's making up right then.  His arms are gesturing passionately, he is totally uninhibited and talented, spouting off beautiful phrases like ""sky of blue. wings of swans! . . .""  There's more, longer lines.  At 'wings' his arms curve over his head.  Incredible kid.  I am blown away.  At the end of the poem Rob has come over.  I say ""what's this kid's name?""  It's something like Albert.  I tell Rob he is an incredible and expressive poet.  Rob and I then have some playful interlude, some joking or horsing around.  It is much fun.  While there are moments in this dream that I am taken by little worries - e.g. why doesn't she want me to make the salad?  Is Rob embarrassed that I got so turned on?  The difference in this dream is that I am able to very quickly say - who cares? or - not worth worrying about, and go on to the next playful move or task.  There is an air of playfulness and joking, caring with Rob."
"039"	"(09/12/1991)"	"Death Penalty dream.  A group of people was supposed to guard me, but they were not allowed to harm me physically.  Lake, turn left.  Decide to escape.  Sleeping pills and pretending to die and then escaping."
"040"	"(09/15/1991)"	"I was in a dance/singing group in high school.  We had all auditioned for it, but it seemed like I didn't know what to do in it anymore.  I felt out of place and almost sick when we had this engagement.  I couldn't clear my head.  I asked people what we were supposed to be doing and they kind of lost their patience and said - look if you couldn't handle it, why did you try out?  We were at a big building with a long bathroom or green room / backstage, long mirror.  I kept going to the mirror to look in my face, feeling like I had a fever and was disoriented.  Then the group got on a little 'train', like the mini mine train at Six Flags.  We were traveling, at one point at a very high speed.  I realized I couldn't remember if I had my shoes, reached down for them under my seat.  My face and hand were very close to the asphalt streaming so fast by the open car of the 'train'.  I thought how close death could be, if I was just on that side of the slat instead of here in the seat, if I tumbled out onto the asphalt, and I reached my hand toward it.  The asphalt, when I straightened back up, was a path only wide enough for our train.  I could see ahead where we were headed.  Maybe a tunnel?  I thought - this is incredibly dangerous.  When we took curves, the whole train would tip and our feet hanging slightly out would scrape or get too close to the pavement.  I thought 'this is stupid and too dangerous to be doing.  I should be out of this group.'  Next scene I am in my bedroom.  It is dark, the old telephone table (Mom/Dad's) is there by the bed. [I used to have that in my bedroom in high school.] I see myself on the bed, laying like I am during the sleep I'm actually in.  The darkness is intentional because I am depressed or disoriented about not fitting in the singing group anymore, and also feeling feverish.  My middle sister comes in.  She has news or is peppier than I am.  We talk.  We decide to go somewhere.  We get in her car:  She drives, I lay down in the hatchback area.  Although I am acting so despondent, I really don't feel that bad.  I know my middle sister is there, and I know I have a good life.  I think I am just sick.  When my middle sister came in I told her I'm sick, and that I'd thought about going to the hospital or doctor but was too disoriented to do it.  So maybe we are driving to a doctor. ..While driving, I see we are near the beach, like Monterey or Highway1.  Either they are doing some 'work' with the ocean, or there are natural causes, but the waves/tides are coming in over the road.  They have either brought in grass, or caused grass to grow over the highway, and the grass is thick, sopping, straight and about two feet tall.  It sloshes under the waves when they come in.  The grass hides the highway. ..I see a bunch of seawater come like a wall over a cliff toward the highway, not dropping away from it, and a few people out there, struggling through all the water.  It is not like waves, more like an overflowing swimming pool or lake, big portions of water being sloshed up over the highway.  The thick sea grass is covering the highway. ..My middle sister will come to a portion of the highway where this is happening and drive through it.  She has a lot of confidence in getting through the road and it doesn't seem to scare her.  I am getting anxious and crying out to her to wait one out or stop to see if it's too deep, but she keeps going.  I see cars from the other direction getting bogged at one area, look back to our highway and just then the car starts to slide.  It turns to the right but keeps moving straight, she can't control it anymore.  We are turning around and around, sliding off the road, I feel us go over grass and dirt.  I lay down close to the floor and think to myself - ""We will both live through this.""  Although it was scary, I started breathing myself into a relaxed state until I am totally relaxed.  I accept each turning of the car, fully confident that my sister and I will not be harmed, because I will it that way, and I have things to do yet in my life.  I am relaxed.  I feel us go downhill, then the car stops. ..I pull myself up and look over the back seat and ask her if she's all right.  She says yes.  We get out and the car is completely unharmed.  We are speechless and dazzled to have just gone through that, willed it to be the way we want, and nothing is harmed!  We look around.  We are far off the road (can't see it, just 'know') and there is a very steep embankment, like the powerline hill at Blue Ridge.  There are even poles or power lines on it I think.  My sister tells me we just came down that.  I can't believe her because it's so steep I know we would have crashed the car somehow.  But she says yes. ..There is someone down there, who watched us.  He is male, he seems either hesitant or distant, unwilling to come see if we are all right, content to let us approach him.  Seems like a hillbilly?"
"041"	"(09/18/1991)"	"Looking for engagement ring, to buy myself.  Same store and woman and jewelry cases as when Jeff and I went to try some on (in reality).  Humor:  She shows me one ring that is for ""people from Texas"" (tiny star or Texas on it).  I wake up laughing.  I am aware that I'm doing this to show people I am loved, even though there's no guy, but I feel strong in this endeavor.  In fact, I'm strong, humorous, the whole dream."
"042"	"(10/28/1991)"	"I can't even explain this dream it's so bizarre.  I and a boy named Michael were under a girl's power.  She had us hooked in some obligation to go down to this basement every day, in an old church or old school.  The basement was big stones, darkish, hidden.  She made us, once a day, do this thing.  It was supposed to be very threatening but doesn't seem so now.  We had to pull at a string in the ceiling and sparkling stuff would come out of a tear in the ceiling.  We dreaded this every day.  But we still went down there and did it.  It was very threatening.  Then the girl with the power would tell us how she was taking care of me and Michael in these events.  She would give the most absurd examples of things she was doing for us to make us more comfortable, while knowing we were incredibly anguished.  One day after this went on for a while, I went into the woods to find someone who would know what the hell was going on.  It was like we were brainwashed or blackmailed and couldn't get out.   I found this man in the woods who had amazing inventions.  He led me over to this ""Bible"", which looked like a clamp or a vise, on a shop table.  It was compressed and you looked into it as if it were a microfiche.  He flipped through it, knowing each page well, and found the page he wanted.  I read along with him - 2 full pages of Bible that explained exactly what this girl was doing.  The last lines of the page are:  ""fusing the wounds together.  wound wound wound wound, oh.  Abominable.""  Something about wounds fusing together.   So I went back to the basement now knowing what she was doing to us.  And Michael was there and the confidence I had about finding her out went away as I was in there with her.  I also discovered I was pregnant and due now.  I squatted, feeling a pressure to give birth.  Michael seemed unresponsive, passive, but it was something like the ""wounds fusing"" meant he and I 'fusing', conceiving.  I don't know !!   A long string of matter began to come out of me.  At this point I could see it as they (Michael and the girl) saw it and as I saw it.  Through their eyes, it was red, bloody, definitely pregnancy-type material.  With my eyes, though, it seemed grey and rather dry, just some digested organic substance.   Then I realized I was not in labor yet, but soon. The girl was trying to show stuff to Michael.    Notes 10/91  -  Main thing about this dream was the control and power this girl had to make us keep doing these things.  Interpretation:  Rob is this girl.  He has this power over me.  And Michael and me are both sides of me.  (That's the ""fusing"".)  Point is that I have a choice.  I can be passive, going on as always, like Michael, never trying to find out anything or do anything for myself.  Or I can be like me in the dream - trying to help or improve myself.   Note 6/97  -  Interesting that at this time I had dreams about being in someone's power, brainwashed, not understanding that I was under control while I was in there, until I got out and asked for help.  Sounds like my time with Lynn in 95-96, before therapy.  But this dream was years before Lynn. "
"043"	"(10/29/1991)"	"We're in the Soviet Union.  Touring the 'new' effect of politics on buildings.  I separate from my family / tour group.  I go in a theater.  Natasha Richardson is on screen.  Very sensual, moving her torso, breasts in a tight tank.  Several scenes of this and audience reacting.  Then Natasha comes off screen and floats or slides up the aisle to me.  Rest of audience 'goes' away.  Just me and her.  I know who she is.  Very sensual and close.  I want to be close to her sensuality."
"044"	"(10/31/1991)"	"I dream I have gone back to the (Blue Ridge) fire crew to finish the summer.  They're playing volleyball.  And they are not happy to see me.  Also there's a dorm there, like a big college dorm and at the front desk is a young woman who I knew already and wanted to be better friends with.  But I can't remember her name.  I like her and want to be close.  I ask for the directory so I can look up her picture and find out her name.  I'm looking but another woman keeps shoving in, turning pages and interrupting me.  Finally I tell the other woman to get out of the way, I'm trying to find out this woman's name, and I'll give her the directory when I finish.  She leaves me alone.  Back outside, near the crew, all our boxes of belongings are being stacked up by delivery people.  I ask a friendly person who the woman is (at the dorm desk) and she says her name is ""Slaundry Rolls"". [what?!] The woman looked like Stephanie Sloan [my friend in 2nd grade, who was more popular than me] would look if she were older, [and I can see a faint connection with the names now.] The crew is all moving its stuff into dorm now when I realize I don't have to do this.  It suddenly dawns on me that I had quit the fire crew earlier and taken off, and was now back to work with them again, but why put myself through it?  I thought ""I need the money"", but then told myself I should just go apart from them and stand there and think it over and decide whether I really wanted to do this.  Later moving boxes into dorm.  I try to get info from crew members, I ask questions.  But I get poor answers, they're mean to me, and won't let me in on anything.  I hear my alarm/music in the dream.  ""With You"" (Tony Terry).  I like this song and tell myself again to go stand apart, think about it and Jeff (former fiance') and maybe just leave the crew again right then.  Scenes of carrying boxes up stairs and down little rungs.  And thinking 'what a hassle, I just unpacked'."
"045"	"n/a"	"(11/18/1991 (#1)) I remember a man in my dream, we had been talking, discussing things (saw Slacker last night), like at a coffee house.  I remember thinking tax consultants contribute nothing to the economy.  This man made me very happy.  I think we were in love or attracted to each other.  I felt again an unmistakable feeling that I would be meeting someone and falling in love very soon.  Have felt this for about three weeks."
"046"	"n/a"	"(11/18/1991 (#2)) I am in the R&B band again. [I was in this band, Rhythm Box, during my college days at UCSC.] John M and Billie Jean are there.  But we are either near Moab, Utah or Edgewood, Texas.  It's rural.  We ride horses to the gig.  Cody is there. [He was my horse during junior high and high school years.] We're setting up for the show and I realize I forgot to bring any performing clothes or anything.  I just rode up there with the band members.  I have 40 minutes before show.  I ask John if I can go back to ""Tucson"" and he looks doubtful I'll make it in time.  I go to Cody and see that he's tied up okay.  I untie him to work with the rope, to tie it better.  He lays down.  I rub his stomach, head, neck, he loves it.  I'm really taking care of him and enjoying it.  I want to give him a longer lead so he can lay down during the show.  I go in a garage and know I will find long-nosed pliers which I need to cut off rope and fix his fastener.  I do.  I fix up his lead, he's laying sometimes, standing up sometimes, he's very loving to me, appreciative."
"047"	"n/a"	"(11/18/1991 (#3)) I'm at The Maze (Canyonlands N.P.), but on the other side of river.  I can see the part of ISKY (Island in the Sky, Canyonlands N.P.) that sticks out separate from the mesa, above the confluence of the Colorado River and Green River.  There are junipers, pinyons, I can see Chimney Rock!  Red dirt.  It's like I'm near that walk I took the day I stayed out all night in that cave, and I had walked up that ridge to Chimney Rock.  Then I felt like I was on the other side of that ridge.  But I could see up a red incline at the end of the ridge to Chimney Rock.  There are other people there and I sit in the car and wait for them to leave because I want to be there alone before I explore and I also need to take a shit.  There's a family, some kids.  I don't mind, I just wait for them to leave.  I came with someone - a woman.  She has already gone off to explore up the ridge.  I get out of the car.  Thor is there. [Our family dog when I was in grade school.] I sit with him on a picnic table.  He is young.  I make him comfortable.  Then he seems thirsty.  I give him water from a cup but realize it had sugar in it.  I worry about this but he was really thirsty so I let him drink.  I get him more water.  He is happy, appreciative.  Both of these later 2 dreams involved important events in my life - the band, and the Maze.  But while I am on the verge, in the dream, of participating in each one, I am also taking care of Cody and Thor and taking care of them takes precedence over doing this important event.  I.e. - in my life right now, it may be more important to care for someone, to be concerned with loving, than to have incredible adventures."
"048"	"n/a"	"(11/20/1991 (#1)) I am taken hostage by a young woman with a gun.  It is a school-like area.  She had taken others or killed others just before me.  She makes me go into a bathroom.  We go in one stall, stand on the  toilet.  First she says she wants to watch me pee.  I do this for her readily.  Then we press up to one another, we start to kiss, necks, ears.  I really like this woman.  I want to be a lesbian.  Some kids start to come in the bathroom.  We yell at them to leave or take the consequences, i.e. being shot.  They scurry out.  We get back into each other.  I am sad because I really like this woman and am torn between this feeling and knowing she is a killer and psychotic.  At one point she asks if I was going to kiss her on the lips, looking at me like that would be too intense.  I like being near her femininity, her softness, slim thighs and lovely waist.  We go to a stall further down, the walls are higher.  She has to pee.  I wait in the next stall.  I think of telling her ""I'm right here.""  I care for her a lot.  I want to know what it's like to have a woman lover.  As we were walking down to the higher stall, a young man pops in the door - whispers - ""Tara! - Lions, right here!""  He gestures to an area of the bathroom.  He means that in a few minutes they are going to bust in and have a big shootout and I'm to scurry to that area because that's where the protectors, the ""Lions"", the good guys, will be.  I look at the woman;  she seems to either ignore the statement and the man, or to have not heard him.  This is why I am protective and caring when she goes to pee.  Because I know soon will be the big shootout and she'll be shot.  I wake up slightly.  I think of escaping out a window with her and running away with her."
"049"	"n/a"	"(11/20/1991 (#2)) [I am half-awake, but mostly asleep.  However, I am aware that I am laying there dreaming.] It is not trance-like though, because I am reading pages and pages of material.  I mean no pauses.  There's line after line of beautiful language.  I want to remember them but don't remember any. [I think I should keep a little dicta-recorder by my bed.  Definitely.  I really want to know what I'm writing in my sleep!!!] When I start to be too aware of the writing, I am quite able to get back into it and produce more.  My eyes follow these lines I write as on a page.  Wild!"
"050"	"n/a"	"(11/20/1991 (#3)) Traveling in an old car, like Robert P's '61 Mercedes.  I meet or know a girl.  We are to travel together.  We go to a wilderness area - there's a rocky hill back up off the road.  Looks like Utah, Arizona.  I meet her friends who were in a different car.  (Carved like a toy car, bright pink.)  One man and I start to really like each other, but we have to be careful because this man used to see my girl friend, who's around.  This man and I go up to the base of that hill and talk and kiss.  This man is young, long haired, bohemian.  I don't feel like it is a potential permanent relationship, just enjoying the attraction.  We do lots of stuff, can't remember, some interaction with other people in group on trip.  We go to the trunk to get something.  I had packed all my stuff in there.  There was a huge squash, pumpkin in color and taste, but crookneck in shape, in the truck on my stuff and I was afraid it would leak and rot all over.  Some of the people scoop some squash out of the middle to eat.  I try to cover my things with plastic, under the squash, but the people don't care and it's heavy.  I realize that there's no way my girl friend would not know I had been seeing her (ex?) boyfriend.  It is so obvious.  The area in this dream was specific, like we knew there was a small old town nearby, but I'm not sure where it was."
"051"	"n/a"	"(12/??/1991 (#1)) [At Needles, Canyonlands N.P.] Robert K and I were making love.  He stood up with me straddling his waist and I thought - this is something only Robert does.  I got tired of it and did a back flip, rolling away from him.  I expected him to be a little impressed with the gymnastics, but he turned away to do something.  He cut off his penis at the base, and then said ""look, I knew you weakened it by doing that, and I had to cut it off!""  I didn't buy that.  But I wondered why he was blaming it on me when he had done it himself.  I said ""well, to the hospital then?""  he agreed.  Then came a long sequence of driving and pushing him in a cart and some frustration about not getting to the hospital sooner."
"052"	"n/a"	"(12/??/1991 (#2)) [At Joshua Tree, the BLM one, by St. George Utah.] I am in a house.  First I am aware that a woman wants to be my love partner, then I notice Paul V (my middle sister's ex-boyfriend) is waiting for me in bed.  I tell the woman I really want to be with her and keep explaining myself but she says, Tara, you don't have to explain.  Paul and I start to have sex.  It's sensual and fun but I can't get his penis in.  It's not totally hard.  I am on top.  The last scene is me looking down at my thighs around Paul, sitting on him but moving back and forth, squeezing my thighs into him and out.  It's fascinating to feel and watch."
"053"	"(01/22/1992)"	"I am in a city, downtown, night.  Some parts look like Santa Cruz and some parts look like Tucson.  Jeff [my ex-fiance'] has let me use his car and I drive it into a bad area.  There is some problem or I have to do something.  I am at Robert R's law office but it is a tiny little shack or warehouse in an industrial district.  I need fervently to see him.  I knock but someone else, his friend, is staying there.  He's nice and lets me in but can't give me much info.  Robert R has fixed up the place and there's a bunk and desk.  But it's small.  And I'm very aware of this bad area of town, ramps, dirty streets, fencing, etc.  I look in a mirror there, I think and I notice this large circular red blotch on my cheek - left cheek.  It's like dark rouge at first.  I go out and the car's gone, and I know who took it somehow.  I notice that the spot on my cheek is getting different.  It is being eaten away, like acid, and I'm getting a hole in my cheek, deeper and deeper.  I'm terrified about this, and know I should see a doctor but it's more important to get Jeff's car back.  The hole keeps getting deeper so I can start to see bone, jawbone.  It's smaller than at first in circumference - maybe the size of a half dollar now, but just eating away at my cheek.  It's red and tissue-y.  I look for Jeff's car.  I run all over the damn town.  I get to know it inside out.  It's like I've been there before.  I know who has it but can't find her.  I go up ramps, around corners.  It dawns on me that Yvonne [another student] has the car and she's doing it to get my ""attention"", meaning love in a relationship way.  She wants to have a relationship and this is how she's getting my attention.  I am furious at her and frustrated.  Then it seems like Paris or a foreign city, but still familiar.  I go down one-way ramps, end up in people's back yard, go out, back to warehouse district."
"054"	"(01/30/1992)"	"Dreamed I was in jail, lots happening.  I decided to go shower, went into a big tent or something, was getting my stuff together for shower, turned back to my mat where I had dropped my stuff, and written 'in water', or in the patterns that water makes on a mat, was all this info about me, the kinds of relationships I get into, who I am.  Lots of writing.  I read it and turned to a man to my left (sort of behind me) who was sitting on his mat, and I said, ""Do you know me?""  I was really surprised at how accurate the writing in water on the mat had been, about my unhealthy relationships.  He looked at me and said - ""Yes, I am your guide.  I am here to assist you through your life.""  Think he said his name was Bill, and I thought of Bill K.  Then he laughed outrageously - saying ""Get that!  I am your guide, ha ha ha.""  In a joyous way but totally outrageous, not really appropriate.  I became skeptical at his reaction and also his bluntness.  By this time I felt more trance than dream - like and I asked to pull out, I couldn't handle this.  I pulled out, and felt as I did a definite feeling of another consciousness occupying my mind and leaving.  There was a rushing in both ears, a full feeling in my head, then feeling that consciousness pulling out. [Note Jan/2012 - In fall of 1989, without intending to, I did channel in a being who behaved and spoke to me as my spiritual guide. It was quite a momentous experience for me, so for the next few years, before sleeping, I sometimes asked for him to return. The dream above was humorous in its mockery of the original experience.]"
"055"	"(02/05/1992)"	"I am in Wisconsin [that's where Rob lives, but I've never lived there, only visited] , with Mom, Dad, Grandma, in a Wisconsin house.  In other words, a stifling and 'polite' atmosphere.  Now I am participating in a basketball tournament with Rob's teams.  The purpose, I know, is to better understand Rob - his motives and need to be part of coaching these teams.  The people on the team seem high school age.  They are outgoing and good in team dynamics.  I realize that I have very little experience with teams, group activity.  I know I have a lot to learn from them.  But I am like an observer here - a participatory observer.  My purpose is to get inside Rob's team, to understand him better, and also why being part of a team is an excellent / beneficial experience.  I realize this is a part of Rob I have never really tried to understand.  I accept that part of him, but have never looked at the value of it, and how it can better help me understand and be close to him.  The team is large - 20 to 25 people.  There is no real shooting of hoops or even a ball.  It's more like a 'show' of basketball team, synchronous movements, passing (socks?) to each other.  But they are really good at it.  They have rehearsed and trained well.  At the beginning, I see the team we are 'competing' against; they look unhappy, because they can see how good Rob's team is, how much support they have (there is a large audience of family and spectators).  So we do our show.  I participate, keeping up with the tricky movements and watching the team work together.  At one point, I am standing within the group, excited about taking part in this team, experiencing a team.  I think of Ann C's (Tucson tall girl) thoughts about wanting to be part of society.  I am getting a clear message about learning this, and that this learning is to help me understand Rob.  Also I get the message that I need to find out more about Rob, that this dream is an impetus to get me to communicate with him more.  Rob is not visible, but I know it is his team.  After our presentation, I am ecstatic.  We did so well, a great success, the crowd was impressed how well we worked together.  I move along our group, standing on the court, raise my arm and give a shout - ""Whoa!  Yeah!""  I expected the team to follow with their excitement but they are fairly passive.  Later I am back at the house with my family.  3 or 4 members of the team had come to the house previously, to get me for the presentation/game.  I remember feeling slightly odd about them and parents/grandma.  Like they have such a different lifestyle - young, carefree, and they are humorously sarcastic.  But I really didn't care - I didn't feel responsible for this dichotomy in front of family members.  Rather, just let them be themselves.  So back at the house, some team members come by again.  They come in and ask if I want to come with them to celebrate the game's success.  They are fooling around and joking.  I want to go.  One girl, blond, is asking if we still have that same crummy toilet paper in the bathroom.  I want to investigate this bathroom.  I go down the hall, into the bathroom.  Here my vision is extremely clear.  I see the golden wood paneling, carpet (light blue?), the bathroom walls.  I look at it carefully.  It is a very midwestern 'Wisconsin' (older) type house.  Don't know how I know that."
"056"	"(02/16/1992)"	"I'm in Wisconsin.  I take a walk.  It's snowy, silent.  I go for a long walk.  Across a field, over a small ridge or embankment.  Snow everywhere.  I see my footprints in it.  I see a barn or house across a snowy field and go there.  There are horses in stalls.  Big huge horses.  They are willful and strong.  Stomping.  I watch them and somehow get caught between a wall and a horse coming in, just as the man I have come to visit comes in.  I am not too worried.  I just get out of the trap between horse and wall.  I talk with the man I came to see.  He is tall, strong, independent, authoritative, but playful too.  Reminds me of Larry W.  I decide to go back to my place or house.  Instead of experiencing the long walk back, I am immediately transported there.  I wondered about this.  Also I wondered about the ground I'd covered on the walk over - Did I go over the bogs?  Were they frozen?  Why didn't I break through into the bogs?  How deep was that snow?  I remember that walk as almost Russian - like - I was alone out in a snowy, flat wilderness, some trees far off, a wind, but all else silent except my footsteps.  Now I'm home.  The man comes in.  I have just come out of the shower.  I am in a towel and aware of my skin showing, glad it's smooth, the skin showing as I raise my arm, feeling sensual.  I am trying to adjust the towel and it won't clasp in the back.  A little later, the man is working at the floor.  The house I'm in is large, older, wood floors, interesting.  He is like a professor, or authoritarian.  I like him.  Mom is there, a few others.  I recognize the lowboy (furniture) from our (childhood) house, although it looks stripped and different, bigger.  The man is demonstrating something or questioning a problem.  A small drop of water appears by him and rolls to the right, under the lowboy.  It is dark blue and rolls like a drop of mercury.  We pick up an edge of the lowboy and look under it, wondering if the floor was slanted.  Then another drop starts from where the man is and rolls exactly opposite, to the left.  We all wonder at this.  Is the floor crooked?  Both ways?  We talk about measuring it.  Mom comes in with a right-angle measure.  I ask her for a level.  She remarks at that like it's a ridiculous idea, slightly chiding me.  We look to the man for explanation about the floor.  I look carefully at the floor, it seems slanted both ways.  This house seemed empty, like we didn't live there.  It was snowy all around outside.  Like that house in Dr. Zhivago, the cold and outside environment had all come in.  Feeling of open-mindedness, curiosity, questioning, learning, with this man.  Desiring something, like being part of his questioning and learning, discovering things, playfulness.  The atmosphere of the walk - snow/Wisconsin/northern was striking, unmistakable."
"057"	"n/a"	"(02/23/1992 (#1)) In a car with people (women) from jail.  They are rough people.  talk rough, tough, we're off to do something.  I see my camera slip out the window and see it on the street, see the car run over it.  I get a little hysterical about going back to get it.  We do, some of the women cursing about it.  Notes 2/92:  This reminds me of that vivid memory from first grade - when my drawing flew out the window of the Maverick while Mom was driving the Montessori carpool of kids home.  I flipped, made Mom go back and get it - I couldn't lose that manifestation of my creativity.  Always thought the lesson there was giving up materiality, holding on too much to the past and material things instead of relying on my continued creativity."
"058"	"n/a"	"(02/23/1992 (#2)) I was at Jeff's parents' house.  Drawing, or designing a small poster.  It felt like when I used to make cassette tape playlist covers.  I was drawing a tiger, and running across / below the tiger was a broad torn-edge area, with tiger stripes which I was drawing with a wide black marker across thin cut strips of white paper.  It was beautiful.  I was making it carefully, deliberately, I could see each black line and the strips of paper, I was getting intent about it.  Jeff's Mom was handing me the markers and art supplies I think."
"059"	"(06/16/1992)"	"I was at a car wash in Tucson.  A horse was being raised up with ropes.  Lowered, leg bent.  Raised, lowered.  Hooves."
"060"	"(06/25/1992)"	"Someone was applying needles in my back.  I thought it had to do with my back injury.  They were put in all over my middle and upper back.  This took forever.  The needles were huge and long.  And when applied there was pressure around them - like cupping technique.  It went on and on.  It was a woman putting them in.  I could feel the pain as each went in.  And there was something about a substance being put into the muscle, through a syringe."
"061"	"(06/29/1992)"	"Eating shit - I was back on the fire crew;  this shit just multiplied.  It went on and on.  Got in shoes, floor, mouth, everywhere.  Couldn't hide it anymore and I was frustrated because all these people wouldn't leave or let me use a bathroom and clean up.  Shit forced on me."
"062"	"(06/20/1992)"	"Flooding.  We're in my childhood house - middle sister, Mom and I.  Waves getting higher up the street, rising water.  We knew it was the ocean flooding the whole country.  It stopped at the floor of our house.  There was a doll in the water.  I pulled it out - a Chinese doll - obviously from China.  At first I had thought it was from Africa.  I was happy because it meant that cultures and people were coming together.  Also Mom, middle sister and I were amazed that because of the flooding this item could float over and connect us to other continents.  Next scene - a small group of us were on an island or desert.  We were an independent group.  Maybe exploring or looking for a place to set up a new society.  We looked up and saw guys in a jeep approaching.  They four-wheeled down a steep hill.  We knew they were bad but we didn't leave.  They came up to us and took us with them.  Next - we were in an area that had been a ruin but was now being used by the group (jeep guys) to start a new society.  It was dark, cave-like in areas, sandy.  The ruin walls were adobe and went up and down several stories.  This group wanted a society with which we didn't agree but we didn't object.  They took our friend who was like Chewbacca and were going to kill him.  At first we tried to free him.  But we were afraid for our own lives if we objected to it.  There was a racial reason for killing him.  They took us to a lake beach or seashore.  We were playing.  Although we had been trying to free our friend so hard, we now forgot about him.  As we were leaving the beach we looked at our watch and noticed we had missed the time our friend had been killed.  We were sad because we had not even been concerned.  At one point we were told to eat in a cafeteria with the other warriors/ residents.  It was in one of the cave-like areas.  We chose food, but there was something about the colors of the food that had to do with gangs."
"063"	"(07/11/1992)"	"Jeff (my ex-fiance') and I are either flying, bouncing, or traveling.  We go in his room afterward.  After a bit I notice a woman sitting up high on a shelf.  (The shelves remind me of my middle sister's blue and green furniture from our childhood.)  I think she was small at first, like a doll, then a human.  I say ""who's that?"" to Jeff, and she's then beside us and Jeff says - ""Oh that's Clara.  We've been seeing each other behind your back for 1 1/2 years.  You never found out.""  He was very casual about it.  We had just had a great day together and he was now telling me it was over in this very casual way.  I was upset and sort of left stormy.  Later I found a grocery bag full of stuff in my Jeep that Jeff was returning to me - supposedly my stuff.  But it was not recognizable, and there were bunches of grapes on top.  I took that sack, marched to his house, opened the door (screen?) without knocking and flung the whole contents across the floor.  People were there, stunned.  The grapes smushed all over.  I said ""I don't want anything from you.""  Later he tried to give me something else and I found his brother (blond) [he does not have a brother in reality] and asked him - are you Jeff's brother?  Yes.  Give him this and tell him not to give me back stuff.  In this dream, although I knew it was Jeff, he looked like David (my first boyfriend) and I called him David too."
"064"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1992 (#1)) In bed with a woman, in my (and at one time my oldest sister's) old room in my childhood home - making out.  The room is messy and her lover / boyfriend is asleep on the floor.  But she and I like each other.  She is tall and slim.  Dark hair?  We make out and I touch her very softly near her pubis, stroking.  She gives me permission to touch her sex organs but I tell her I've never touched a woman.  She pulls my hand in.  I touch her the way I would like it.  While this is happening, I sense a dark presence above me, turn to see a dark figure - male - hovering over me, really getting in my face.  It is a bit threatening, but with a neediness about it, something it is trying to inflict on me brought on by its own anger / fear / helplessness.  I am frightened but also annoyed and I am aware that I can overcome my fear / keep that fear away, by just telling it off.  Which I do.  Something like, I just rouse myself up enough to yell at it to go away.  Then I go right back to focus on the woman again."
"065"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1992 (#2)) Somehow I am out in the driveway behind my childhood home.  I look down and find some of the Matchbox cars we used to play with out there when we were kids - that purple one, a truck, others.  I remember these cars, the names we gave them, how special they were.  I think - 'they have been hidden or lost out here all this time' and I start to pick them up.  Then my middle sister comes around from the front yard.  She is drumming (Taos drum) and excited about discovering this new drum technique with her hands.  She shows me and finishes it off with a flourish, with a plastic ten-inch square cookie-cutter type thing that she draws along the bottom of the drum for a final roll / swish sound.  It's beautiful but I am preoccupied by something else - an earlier dream image, the toy cars, or it being out of character for her.  So I don't join in her enthusiasm, just watch.  Mom appears on my left then.  Note:  The cars - when I woke I felt the cars had to do with letting go of old (childish?) attachments = Jeff maybe; old loves."
"066"	"(07/15/1992)"	"I take a shit and there are whole roots or sticks in it, fibrous roots like licorice root.  I look at them through glass, they are in water."
"067"	"n/a"	"(07/22/1992 (#1)) I am in the middle of gang warfare somewhere.  It kept going on, everywhere I went there was shooting and scary violence.  I was hiding upstairs in a house at one point, looking out into a dark neighborhood, watching this go on.  I came downstairs and two guys came in and one told me to get on the couch.  At first I just hesitated.  He kept demanding over and over, finally I squeaked out this little ""no"" and turned, to go upstairs.  The two guys laughed at my wimpy refusal.  I got my gun and came down and shot him in the chest.  He was blond.  He seemed surprised, indignant.  Then I said - ""you were going to rape me on the couch, weren't you?""  He said yes and I told him, ""Well, I'm glad I shot you then"" or ""you should be shot then."""
"068"	"n/a"	"(07/22/1992 (#2)) Dreamed I went to a big ranch.  Everyone who worked there was Texan - big, hatted, slow moving.  People (tourists) were buying Indian rugs all over.  Lots of rugs.  Like they were being scammed by the ranch, selling them so many rugs.  I wanted to swim in the creek but they told me I couldn't because it was too polluted.  Then Dad said, ""I'll show you where to swim.""  And we got on a boat with other people, and went down a river.  One guy looked out and said, ""We're coming up on the 30 mile an hour part!  It's too fast.""  I looked out and the river was narrower and going pretty fast.  We drove that boat right up a bank.  Turned around, and came back up the river.  It was now a power boat."
"069"	"(07/23/1992)"	"I dreamed that Mom and Dad divorced.  I am in a wheelchair (traveling or camping, a new place, by a playground).  I know the wheelchair is temporary, but it still bugs me.  Anita K and I together, talking.  Peeing but not shitting."
"070"	"(07/24/1992)"	"I am in a store, there are other people I know there, also.  We talk and chat while we shop.  The store is closing soon.  I buy all this junk food, like candy, caramel apple, bagel, etc.  And though it's late, I think, what else would I like?  I think - lox for the bagels, because there is too much sweet food here.  So I know the store is closing and I go up to the second floor because I think the deli is there, but I turn a corner, hallway, at the end of the hallway there are people in business suits and briefcases coming out of a door, and a sign over the door:  County Attorneys or Deputy D.A. or some public law office.  I am immediately embarrassed, for thinking the store was up here and I also feel out of place and hope they won't notice me.  I turn around and go back downstairs to the store.  During the whole time I had been shopping, I had been taking bites of this loaf of bread and cheese.  Like I was too hungry to wait to get home.  The cheese had little crumbs through it, which another customer and I talked about, like it was a good cuisine idea.  I knew that the store employees knew I was eating this bread and cheese and that it was paid for by the pound.  I was a little unsure about how to remedy this since I wanted to eat from it, not the whole loaf, just a little.  So then one of the clerks, an old woman, kind of hag-like, but very kindly, sticks a price on the bread so it won't matter that I ate part and helps me weigh the cheese.  I am grateful.  Some of the employees and customers are like this, in appearance - hag-like but kind.  There is a model there too.  I pay for all my stuff and go home intending to watch TV and eat junk.  Apparently I live alone.  And it feels like I've set up house (in Tucson?) for myself.  I'm snacking away, thinking some about obligations the next day, and watch TV.  On TV is a news show.  They follow this group down to Monterey for a meet - a race or expo or rally or something.  The leader will not cross some famous bridge on the PCH until he's taken a look at it so he drives in a dirt lot to take a look, others follow.  Then the camera goes up to a helicopter that is flying in to alight.  There is a tall pedestal, very thin with a little platform at the top, that the helicopter is supposed to land on up there in the air.  It's almost like an invisible, transparent, or imaginary pedestal.  But we all know the chopper should stop on the platform.  One of the pilots is standing, half out the door, waving, part of the show/expo.  The helicopter stops just short of the platform, like an imaginary rope had just pulled taut and it couldn't go further.  This caused the pilot to lose balance, and fall out the door.  The helicopter also fell off the platform, sideways, falling through the air.  Halfway to the ground the chopper was righted and flew steady again.  I thought at first the guy who fell out had somehow climbed back in and taken the controls.  But they kept doing slow-motion replays of it.  Apparently they had coverage cameras inside the chopper, on the guy, on the ground and in the air; tape recorders too. (video)  So while I was thinking ""how did that guy get back in the chopper?"", they showed him, he hadn't.  He fell out and the camera on him showed his fall all the way into the ocean.  It was long and sickening.  It had views all across the land from high up.  Then they showed the camera inside the copter and there was another man in there who had scrambled to take the controls.  Apparently he wasn't supposed to be there and no one knew who he was. [subconscious, hidden self?] .  Then they went back to the footage of the man who fell and played what he had transmitted over his radio or mike.  It was so panicky, really horrifying.  A slow-motion transmittal of someone who knows they are going to die petrified.  While the footage showed his fall, how high he was unprotected, I was thinking how scary that would be and wouldn't you die of a heart attack just looking down?  Then the sounds he made told me no.  He was panting really fast and agonizing.  Then even in the water he was still alive, panting, screaming.  Something took over him (cold? water? sharks?) and he died.  Everyone heard this whole thing.  It was sickening.  More about who the other man was.  Later he wrote a letter admitting he piloted, but refusing to identify himself.  View goes back to me sitting on the bed watching all this on TV.  (In the dream it became the dream image, it was not like on a TV screen once they got into it.)  I am so sick and depressed from hearing this, in shock.  However, I start to get a sexual feeling like I could come in my sleep."
"071"	"(11/13/1992)"	"I am at a house, feels like Utah.  The house is old, dirty, messy and there are lots of people around.  A gathering / party.  I see who I think is Rob walk in with someone else and they are midgets!  They have taken a drug or herb concoction to be midgets temporarily.  Someone at this house is dispersing this formula for those who want to try.  Mostly out of boredom, I decide to try it.  I feel confused about why I am there, a little out of place because of the disorganization.  I am cautious about this formula.  I'm not sure I want to try it but decide to because it's something I've never tried.  But, I take only a ""shaving"" (the word I thought of in the dream).  Not a whole dose.  So I don't know if it will work or not.  While I'm waiting, I go outside, front porch / yard.  Sort of wondering about Rob's presence there.  Unhappy feeling.  Then I see a pickup truck pass the house and slow down.  It is night or dusk.  The people in the truck - I know what they're saying telepathically.  They are saying - This is the place where the woman can make you a midget for a short time! They stop to gawk.  They have driven far enough that I can see in the bed of the truck.  The bed has been enlarged.  It's the size of three truck beds, and partitioned for animals.   There are all kinds of dogs back there.  I notice one dog - it looks like Risk [my first dog as an adult. I got her in September 92] .  I call and call to it to come back to me.  Then the dog turns and I see it is not Risk.  Then another dog looks like Risk.  I call again.  It's not Risk.  Then I notice that all these dogs are deformed, (like the midgets inside).  They are for the circus.  One dog on the back right corner is really weird.  You know how you can make a shadow-dog with your hand in front of a light.  This dog was a hand, horizontal;  a big oversized hand that was a dog!  It made me a little sick.  I turned around, back to the porch and there was my middle sister coming up with Risk.  I asked her not to take Risk without telling me.  She acted unconcerned, like she didn't care that I was worried."
"072"	"(07/12/1993)"	"I am watching Dad remove his contacts in my middle sister's room.  I see the contact case wells with saline in them, close up.  Then Dad is in a white coffin, being pushed out of my middle sister's room."
"073"	"(07/13/1993)"	"I am pregnant in this dream.  I'm proud of this and can't wait to experience childbirth.  I'm excited and scared by it.  I get glimpses of the meaningfulness of life coming through me, of perpetuating the physical existence of beings on earth.  I am with my parents.  I am scared about the delivery - it's going to be soon.  Mom and Dad do not really help me emotionally with it.  I start my period and I think it is a sign that labor will start soon.  Part of the discharge is three objects, strange rectangular blocks with markings.  They seem to be made of lucite or hard rubber and are slightly translucent. [Reminds me of the exhibit at Flandrau I played with yesterday.] I look at the markings close up and one seems to be a little grave stone.  (They are about two inches) with writing.  I wash them off and am baffled about why they came out of me.  I think it signals labor starting soon.  I am not getting what I need at 'home' so I get on a bus.  I realize labor could start soon while I'm on the bus.  I ask the driver if he's going to make a loop.  He says I should get off and cross the street and get on the bus going back.  I get off.  At the return bus stop, lots of busses pull up.  They are not the bus I'm supposed to take.  At one point, I start walking between two busses (in a long column of busses).  Then realize the danger.  I go back.  A girl at the stop and I discuss which bus to take.  Throughout the dream I occasionally experience pains like cramps and believe labor will start.  I am returning home.  Suddenly I realize my baby will have a single parent, that I have no mate to raise the baby.  This is connected to my parents' sadness or displeasure at my situation.  I am upset that the baby won't have a father because I think it is really wrong to do that to a child.  I always wanted better if I was ever going to have a child.  (Not fulfilling my moral standards or goals.)  Then I say to myself, at least the baby's father is Erik. [Erik was my most favorite boyfriend, met him when I was a park ranger at Bryce Canyon, 86.] I am overwhelmed with satisfaction, happiness, contentment, fulfillment, that my baby's father is Erik.  I would not want anyone else to be my baby's father.  Still sad that the baby won't have a father in its life.  I consider how hard it might be to find a mate so it will have a father."
"074"	"n/a"	"(07/27/1993 (#1)) Dreamed I was giving oral sex to Chris C [girl at law school 2 years ahead of me] , then to another woman.  She had shaved her pubic hair on top and sides."
"075"	"n/a"	"(07/27/1993 (#2)) I was at the Moose Hill Orchard [in New Hampshire, I worked there picking apples in 85] , I woke in the bunkhouse and saw the pond down the hill.  It was beautiful.  I thought - I don't remember driving here, is this real?  The bed and window were vivid, the feel of the bunkhouse.  I realized I was the first to arrive at the bunkhouse and must set up my apple crates around my bed.  I started doing that.  (Happy that I was really there.)  I was in the apple storage building.  The woman I spoke to on the phone was there, helping me find Macouns [my favorite apple] .  I saw the spotted skin of Macouns.  I looked in drawers under big tables for them.  I was happy there.  It was beautiful and peaceful and something I really wanted to do.  I felt though like the decision had been made too quick, without enough preparation.  I just arrived there all of a sudden."
"076"	"(08/??/1994)"	"I was with a group of people, about ten of us, walking on Mars.  We walked by a sandy, rocky ledge in a reddish landscape.  We were on an archeologic or geologic tour of Mars.  I hung back from the group, I felt an alien might appear.  From behind the ridge, a male Martian came out and walked up to me.  He told me:  ""You people on earth shouldn't be so uptight and hostile about homosexuals.  At one time on your planet, everyone (or every being) was homosexual.  You need to be more tolerant and accepting to homosexuality.""  In the dream I took this to mean: when life on Earth was one-celled and simple organisms."
"077"	"n/a"	"(12/??/1994 (#1)) I was in a courtroom.  I was an attorney in the dream, but was not trying a case that day.  Suddenly an armed man came into the courtroom and threatened all of us.  Some people hid or screamed.  I noticed a way I could escape the room without him seeing me, and I went around to another door.  I got out the door, and went to the clerk's office to report the man.  The clerks knew about him already, but seemed unconcerned.  I was still shaken up.  I left the clerk's office and walked down the court hall.  I turned a corner, and I saw Robert G [One of my law professors. After law school, we had a short love affair. He is about 20 years older than me] .  I was wearing the light green shirt with short sleeves that I had in reality bought but had never yet worn.  By some strange markings on the front of my shirt (it looked like white powder on my shirt), Robert knew without me telling him that I had been involved in a hostage situation.  His eyes questioned me, asking me if I had been in a room with an armed man, but without either of us speaking.  I nodded.  Then he took me to have dinner.  We went to his house or the supermarket and he microwaved a frozen lasagna.  I said, ""Robert, are you really going to microwave a frozen lasagna?"" because he always makes such beautiful and careful food, and I couldn't believe he would microwave a lasagna."
"078"	"n/a"	"(12/??/1994 (#2)) I was driving down the highway in my red pickup.  It looked and felt like Dallas or Arizona south of Phoenix, it was wide open plains or desert, very flat ground.  A plane flew by me, not very far off the ground.  It was following along the highway, using the highway for a route.  Another plane came up beside it.  The pilot in the front plane looked back, out his window.  (Somehow I could see the pilot, tho I shouldn't have been able to.)  The pilot was alarmed at how close the other plane was to him, and wanted to make space between the two planes, but by his looking back, (and going too fast), he lost control of his plane.  The plane went out of control, hit the ground, flipped over several times, and blew up right in front of me on the highway.  This caused the second plane to also crash, flip and explode, and then a third plane also crashed and flipped over and exploded.  I was amazed that I had just witnessed three major, horrendous plane crashes right in front of me.  I slowed down and stopped right in the highway lane.  I got out of my car, and started walking toward the burning planes, wondered what I should do.  Then I noticed that there had already been set up an emergency tent, and officials were meeting and dispatching there. I went to the tent.  The police wanted to talk to me because I was about the only one who had seen all three happen, and I could help them investigate how the accidents had happened.  A policeman or investigator sat me down on a folding chair in the makeshift tent.  I told him what I had seen.  He said, ""when you stop on the highway like that, you should be careful because (something like:) you're gears can't go down that fast, or the turbo will be damaged.""  I was crying now and answered, "" I know, I tried to slow down slowly.""  Then the magnitude of all the deaths and all the people's bodies probably scattered over the highway hit me and I became more upset.  I told him ""all those people that died . . .""  I don't remember his response.  He told me to wait, he had to go do something.  While I waited, I picked up a magazine to read.  It was more like a catalog of stores and items.  I noticed an interesting ad for a store that sold animal things, like dog figurines; things for people, not for animals.  I wanted to go there.  I looked for the address, and it was in London.  I knew then that I could never go to this store, it was impossible.  But I looked again and there was a San Francisco address too.  I looked hard at the address and memorized it hard.  I observed it so intensely I was sure I should have remembered it when I woke up."
"079"	"(04/??/1995)"	"I was canoeing in an area with lots of lakes, the way it looks in Wisconsin - land with lakes all around, waterways connecting.  I realized I had not looked up or noticed my surroundings in a while, that I had been focused on the boat or myself.  I looked up and right there in front of me in the distance was a big perfectly round grassy hill.  Across the hill in a perfect row were big rocks.  They were lined up like a train.  It was so beautiful and perfect, I was amazed and glad I had made myself look up right then, or I would have missed it.  I viewed that hill with the rocks lined up across it for a long time.  I felt inspired and contentedly ecstatic.  I boated toward the hill.  On the way toward the hill I saw many islands, each island had a single house on it.  They were beautiful well-made houses, each interesting, artistic.  I said out loud that I would love to own one of those houses on an island, and liked the solitude and privacy of them.  Then I was on ground near the waterways.  I was collecting field samples of plants for an ecology job or project.  I was trying to label each jar or container that each plant sample went in.  It started to rain and I was trying hard to keep the labels and plant samples organized and clear."
"080"	"n/a"	"(05/??/1995 (#1)) I was with Erik.  We did many things, always together.  We worked together, we were driving together, we camped together in a mountain area.  We were doing some job outdoors, we were at a cabin, there was a metal urn and wooden cupboards.  We were making or fixing wooden cupboards.  At one point I heard or became aware that some acquaintances or town people who did not know Erik were saying: ""Why does she spend so much time with him?""  Then they saw him, and their faces said they knew exactly why I wanted only to be with him so much.  After I saw their reaction I was in a car beside Erik (a convertible I think), and I looked over at him for a long time, and got the most intense feelings of deep and pure love, respect, admiration, giving.  I loved him so much in this dream.  And I was able, or allowed, to love him so much here."
"081"	"n/a"	"(05/??/1995 (#2)) Some people and I and my middle sister were cutting down a palm tree.  All of us knew that when you cut a palm tree, the inside starts to burn and smolder and gets very hot.  All of us except my middle sister.  After we cut the tree, she reached inside and took out its heart.  It looked like an artichoke heart (hearts of palm).  She was holding it, and she suddenly got a look of panic and pain on her face.  The heart was burning her hands.  She dropped it.  I cried out to her, went and got her, took her inside and wrapped her hands with wet toilet paper strips."
"082"	"n/a"	"(05/??/1995 (#3)) I was in my family's house, but it was bigger, more rooms, wealthier, more decorated, older.  We knew it was going to burn down, and we had to decide what items to save.  I took some things out, can't remember now what.  I was standing outside and I realized that all of my and my family's possessions would be destroyed and gone forever.  This caused me great anxiety.  Then I was in another house.  I was older.  This house was three or more stories tall.  I and some people were touring it like it was a historic landmark.  It had been my childhood house.  I told people I used to live here as a child.  I went to the top floor, then out on the roof there were two more rooms up there alone.  They were separate, they were not another floor, they were two rooms on the roof.  They had many windows, like sun rooms, but the windows and the rooms were dirty with age, not clear.  I went inside these rooms. Inside I could still see all the windows, the dirty concrete floor of the roof of the house.  There were benches along the walls and old little child's chairs, other various items around, some play items.  I told people this is where my middle sister and I used to play together.  I remembered exactly how and what we used to play there, I could see us as children.  I got sentimental and wistful about my childhood."
"083"	"n/a"	"(05/??/1995 (#4)) Either I or Mom had a baby.  I was there at the birth.  Right after the baby was born, I brought it up and put it on Mom's chest.  It began to sing ""Away In A Manger"".  It knew all the words.  I leaned very close to the baby to hear it.  It was singing very softly, I could barely make it out.  I was totally amazed that it knew all the words to this song already, right after it was born.  I said to Mom: ""Mom, how could this baby know this song already?""  I thought maybe it had heard it through her body."

"085"	"(06/??/1995)"	"I was working on my computer.  I was writing lots of business letters.  After I was finished writing, my computer started running this program on its own.  It showed a map of lower North America.  It started with Louisiana, and went across each state and way into Mexico, too.  My screen seemed much bigger, because I could see whole states and parts of whole countries sometimes.  I realized it was checking each of the addresses and phone numbers I had entered into each letter, verifying my addresses for correctness.  It would show a layout of a state, with major rivers and cities indicated.  Then it would show a black and white layout of a particular city in that state, and it would adjust, or re-picture the map, to adjust the correct telephone and/or addresses I had entered against correct data it was receiving from current phone or address directories.  I realized it must be hooked up to some phone or address database by modem.  As it updated each of my addresses in the letters, it would re-picture the map it showed.  It moved methodically across the states and Mexico.  As I wondered about this, I realized that some of my letters had been to addresses in Mexico; that's why it was showing Mexico too.  I felt that this was a great computer program.  It was beautiful to watch as well as accurate.  Also I realized that this computer program did not yet exist but that it was a great technological breakthrough and I was part of this breakthrough.  Then the dream changed and I was standing beside a huge raised relief map of all of the southern part of the United States.  The whole map was hundreds of feet big.  I was leaning over Arizona.  I could see major rivers and mountains.  I wanted to find the Colorado River, and trace it through its course to Baja.  I needed to step further into the map to see better, and I was worried about puncturing it, but I realized the map had places to step into so you could walk around inside the map and see closer.  There were foot holes to step into."
"086"	"(06/09/1995)"	"I had another dream about technological developments.  I had planned a hike or outing with some people I met.  The day after making plans with them, I was waiting in a nice hotel room in the morning, waiting for them to tell me exactly what time to meet them.  Then on a little machine that looked like a plain-paper fax, out came a piece of paper.  I read it and it was a note from them on where and when to meet.  But it was not a fax.  I thought to myself ""this is what they mean by electronic mail.""  But then I realized that this paper was an original.  It had original ink or signature, and I then realized that the paper had actually been transmitted by them across town into the receiving machine in my hotel room, by some route built for paper transmissions.  I was amazed.  In another part of this dream, I told a nice man I had met recently that I was feeling a little sick lately.  There were a few other friends around too.  He knew homeopathic remedies and he started giving me some pellets or herbs for various things.  He diagnosed by my symptoms, and by looking at me could see what I needed.  Then he wanted to give me a homeopathic herbal suppository, because he believed I just needed to take a good shit.  He started to place it toward the back of my pants, so I could take over and insert it.  I was so emphatic about not wanting it.  I kept refusing and refusing, even though he said it was mild and ok for me.  He said, ""oh, have you ever taken two of these"" and laughed like he knew the result was too strong.  I told him, ""I can't mess with that, or I'll never take a shit.  I make sure I take good shits by relaxing, eating healthy food, and herbs, but if I start messing with putting things there, it stresses me out and I won't ever go."""
"087"	"(06/24/1996)"	"I dreamed I was supposed to meet Norm [I dated him for a short time] at 6:15 for a party, and I false awakened (dreamed that I woke up) and realized it was 6:00 and I would be late.  So I called Norm to tell him I would be late.  Norm was saying some unusual things on the phone.  He would begin a normal sentence, then interject words which sounded like he was tripping or not altogether there.  I asked him something.  He started to breathe really hard, hyperventilate, like he had taken too much speed.  He could no longer talk.  Alarmed, I asked him ""Are you okay?''  He kept breathing fast and hard, like he was panicking.  I asked him over and over ""Do you want me to come over?""  He couldn't answer, so I said ""If you want me to come over, give me a vocal sound.""  He managed the barest vocal sound along with his next hard breathing.  So I moved fast to get over to his house.  I thought I should bring someone with me, and picked Art, as he is a doctor (a vet), and has also some experience with drugs.  I went out to the living room to call Art, and the room was completely different.  Paula [my housemate] and RB [a short-term housemate, same house] had knocked out a wall or two, knocked out or moved the wood divider in the kitchen, and extended the kitchen all the way back to the end of Paula's room.  I was surprised and liked the new room, and told them so.  I went to call Art, but couldn't remember his number and looked for an Advertiser or the phone book.  Then it seemed my phone line was tied up.  Then Marten [park ranger friend] called.  I told him urgently to get off the phone, I had to go somewhere on an emergency.  He kept talking to me real mellow and unconcerned.  I told him again to get off the phone.  Then I started thinking that maybe I was the one who was fucked up, maybe I had just dreamed all this and Norm was not really in trouble.  I then realized that I had been dreaming, and that the phone call to Norm had been a dream.  I woke up and thought about all parts of the dream for a long time.  While I was recalling some of the images, an image of one or more wild horses quite suddenly appeared to me; they were moving excitedly, uncontrolled, tossing their heads.  Then just as suddenly that horse image vanished."
"088"	"(08/10/1995)"	"Rikki [a visitor at the time, a friend of Paula's] gave me some large tablets, they looked like vitamins, and he said I seemed stressed out or unhealthy, so I should try these tablets.  I took about 4 or 5. The tablets were really a drug to make me lose consciousness or control over my actions.  Rikki was trying to drug me.  After I took them, we were preparing to go to sleep;  Paula, RB, Rikki and I all slept in one large room, each on our own cot, like we were camping out or in a dorm.  I said goodnight to Rikki, his cot was next to mine.  He turned to me and said, no darling, you're not going to sleep alone.  I'm coming in.  He was planning to rape me or take advantage of me, so as soon as he touched me, I screamed as loud as I could.  I was able to really scream in this dream.  By screaming several times before he hurt me, I turned him in to the cops.  He was arrested and/or jailed.  Later, RB and I were joking around.  RB said something like, ""I better be careful, you might take this the wrong way and turn me in too.""  I said, ""No, RB, I would never do that to you or Paula.  It was just Rikki.  I knew the tablets were drugs and that he was planning to set me up to rape me.  That's why I let it go to that point.  I had to make sure he got arrested or jailed, got put away.  But you and Paula are different; I would never do that to you.""  For a minute I wondered whether I had set him up, like entrapment, for a bogus charge, just because I was mad at him and sick of him.  I think I had this doubt because of RB's comment.  But then I remembered that he had really attempted to rape me, had said he would, and had started to touch me.  So I was justified in turning him in."
"089"	"(08/29/1995)"	"[We got engaged 8-17-95.] Dream:  Jeff and I had our wedding.  About a half-hour before the wedding, I was trying to decide whether to wear the white wedding dress Jeff's mom gave me, or the flowered dress I bought in New Mexico this spring.  My middle sister brought me baby's breath to put in my hair.  I remembered Jeff would be wearing his new blue suit and flowered tie, so I decided to wear the white wedding dress, to be as formal as possible.  I went to the wedding.  It was so beautiful.  Not many more details, but a general feeling of fulfillment, beauty, and hope for our wonderful life together.  I was so glad I get to be with Jeff.  It seemed we were near the coast in California at the wedding.  There was a pier or board walkway nearby, near the ocean.  Later in the dream, Jeff and I had a baby girl.  We played with her as she crawled around, and both picked her up and held her. I held her close to my chest and loved her.  I was so glad Jeff and I had this pretty baby girl.  Later in the dream, I was on an airplane flying.  I was changing clothes in my seat or fixing my dress, trying to get my bra straight."
"090"	"(11/??/1995)"	"[Lynn was my boyfriend for one horrible year. It turned out he was abusive and a scammer, also bi-polar. Later, I realized I chose him because he was completely different from any guy I had ever dated before, so I felt that he was opening me to experiences with men that I had previously, and repeatedly, avoided. After a year, this relationship precipitated a crisis where I had to leave my home town and my career. I went into therapy for 8 months, and then started on a completely new path in life.] Dream:  Lynn and I lived way out in the country, in the mountains or foothills.  One day we drove into town.  It was a long way.  As we drove I tried to memorize the road signs and the way, so I could find my way back.  We got to town and ran errands.  We were driving an antique car, very bright yellow, re-done, a convertible.  It was a neat car.  Lynn left to go in a store, and I drove to park the car.  As I was waiting to turn, a van ran into the side of our car.  It wasn't a bad hit, I didn't think there would be much damage.  I was mad, pulled over to look at the damage.  The van pulled over too.  There were a lot of people in the van, and I didn't trust them.  I felt like they were connected to the derelicts who screwed Lynn over.  They were disorganized and shifty.  We got out, there was some damage to the car - a hole right through the door.  I was just starting to talk to them.  First they acted like they weren't going to take responsibility for it, trying to evade me, then one man came over and said he wanted to pay a cash settlement right there, to avoid insurance claims.  I was happy, knowing I could get a lot for it, in exchange for them avoiding insurance.  Just then Lynn walked up.  He was dressed in a full dress tuxedo, black and white, really nice, he looked incredible.  He asked me to marry him right there.  I was shocked, and was just about to tell him the car was hit and this man would pay us cash right now, but when I turned back around to the man, all the people had left in the van during our distraction.  Then I was really mad, they had gotten away, without giving us any I.D. at all.  Lynn and I drove to try to find them.  We drove around for a while, then went back to the same parking lot.  The van was back!  We stopped, and I made them give me I.D. and insurance info right there.  Later Lynn and I were home.  We kept finding things were missing, every few days, an item would be gone from the house, even when we were there.  We kept wondering what was going on.  One day, I walked into our bedroom and caught two women going through my closet, taking out clothes and picking the ones they were going to steal.    I knew right then that these women had been in the van that hit us.  We apprehended them, to keep them there til the cops could come and arrest them.  But we found two men in the living room stealing, and it got all disorganized and I think they got away.  It made me wonder if the van hitting our car was intentional, these people seemed to know us or to know Lynn.  I was really personally offended and mad about my clothes being gone through, although the other items didn't bother me as much."
"091"	"(11/23/1995)"	"I was at a small gathering.  Mom had given me a baby girl to keep, I had to take care of it, I was getting used to it.  It was to be my baby, like she had adopted it for me.  I think its name was Lilianne or Lily.  I enjoyed picking it up on my hip, holding it, feeling it on my body, and feeling I was taking care of it.  This baby was not perfect.  It was not attractive, a little sickly, I think it was a baby from a third world country, unwanted, and Mom had adopted it that way.  It may have had physical problems.  I felt honorable taking care of a baby no one wanted.  Steve [another attorney in Moab, wanted to date me but we never did; I chose Lynn] came to the gathering.  At one point, I picked up the baby in front of him.  He noticed and said, ""Oh, you have a baby.  From the way you picked it up, I take it you're not just babysitting it.""  I admitted I now had a baby.  I had thought Steve didn't want any children, and believed now he would think less of me.  But after watching me, Steve went and asked Mom how he could get a baby to adopt.  He looked like he was about to cry, he wanted a child so bad.  I was totally surprised - I thought he didn't like kids.  It made me think of him different.  Later, I was watching over the baby, and it started to change into an animal, like a rodent.  Maybe it was just the way it behaved, running away, hiding, not listening, but it also seemed to have fur and an animal body and head.  It became smaller, I had trouble keeping track of it and worried how I could watch it properly if it was always running under furniture.  I felt apologetic to Steve and the people there, like I had an imperfect baby, part animal and part baby.  It was grossing me out, too.  Mom came over and said, ""You don't have to keep it Tara, you can give it back, I thought you might like to try it, but you don't have to.""  I said, ""No, I want this, I need this to learn from this.  I'll keep it and take care of it.""  I was thinking how I was just getting used to it, how I needed to go through this now in my life, I needed to learn this.  It still felt like a baby even though it was starting to look and act like an animal.  At some point, I almost forgot about it, then remembered to look for it, to watch over it.  I asked someone if they had seen the baby, if it was still okay.  It felt like lately with Risk, when I neglect her because of work, and don't spend as much time with her, then I remember how close we used to be and feel really guilty.  There was some feeling that Lynn had something to do with this, the wildness, the strangeness, animal-ness of the baby.  Like he had provided some contribution to this animal-baby. [He is very animal-like, wild, as I had told him earlier that day.  Also, he adopted a baby from Korea.  Also, I had just listened to a radio program with him on animal rights, and the host was describing in detail the 'furry bodies' and that fish don't have fur.] Later I was alone in a big house with the baby, trying to take care of it.  The rooms were dark, and I was overwhelmed, felt unsafe or unable to take care of everything."
"092"	"(12/09/1995)"	"I went to a little party at some girls' house;  it was just two girls and me.  These girls were on the trashy side, and I did not know them very well.  We were partying.  They were expecting a man to come over.  It was decided that we or I would sleep with him.  At some point I questioned myself, ""what if I don't like this man, or don't think he is attractive?""  and I answered myself that I would have to anyway, no matter what he looked like, I had already committed myself.  The man came over.  At one point I did look at him and think, he is not attractive, but it's too late, it's been decided, or, it's out of my control.  I think I did sleep with him, no details, not sure.  There was some sexual flirtation.  Afterward, the girls left the apartment.  I was alone.  The man turned into a spider.  I knew that the man had turned into a spider.  I saw the spider crawling on the floor, out from under something.  It was a big spider.  I followed it, and when I got the chance, I killed it.  I killed it on a paper or napkin.  Then I realized his remains could be discovered on the paper, and wondered how to get rid of the paper so no evidence of my killing could be discovered.  I knew he could be identified as that man, even though he was a spider, and that I would be implicated in his killing.  A little later, there was another man, a brother of one of the girls or something.  He had been there too.  He turned into a spider.  I got that spider into a trashcan, and I shook it to kill him.  I  looked in the trashcan.  His head was separated from his body, but his body was still moving, the legs.  I thought about killing him further, so he would not writhe around like that, but then I thought, he's obviously dead, his head is separated from his body, he'll die.  I was really concerned about the discovery of these girls' brother's deaths, and how it could be connected to me.  For a long time in the dream I thought about my moral responsibility for the men's deaths.  Thought, if I am not found or caught, what responsibility do I have?  Do I really need to feel bad about these killings if I am not found out?  I thought about how long it would take for the men's families or friends to realize they were missing or dead, would I ever be implicated?  Would it matter if I were never implicated?  I thought about how these men had raped or taken advantage of me, how they made me have sex when I didn't want to, or they had mistreated me, how I hated them, how they deserved to die for treating me or for treating women so bad.  Later, the girls and I decided to go out to party.  We were driving in a van.  I was still thinking about whether I would be caught and how long it would take them to discover their brother had been killed.  Later, I went alone to an upscale store, to shop.  I took the elevator up to the top floor.  I was still thinking about the men's deaths, how I had killed them.  The elevator had part of the floor missing, on purpose, it was the design.  I thought how dangerous it was to have part of the elevator floor missing, you could fall all the way to the bottom, thirteen floors.  I looked down through all the floors on the elevator, the liability.  It was precarious riding on that elevator.  I got out on the top floor.  I looked at the merchandise.  I found on a sale table a really nice slip or lingerie that I liked, I wanted to buy it.  Then I was hungry and wanted a cookie.  In the next  room they had all these cookies lined up on tables, tons of them, with labels for what kind they were.  I was looking for an oatmeal cookie.  I found one and inspected it really closely to see what kind of oatmeal cookie it was."
"093"	"(01/11/1996)"	"I was preparing to take the California Bar, right before the test.  Other examinees with me.  We were all nervous.  We discussed the hoops we'd had to jump through, what to expect, how hard it was.  At one point I said, ""Well I'm already an attorney in Utah.""  Either meaning it wouldn't matter if I didn't pass, or I'd already know what to expect on a certain part of the test.  I surprised some of the examinees with this information.  I felt like they looked up to me after that.  They were all the law school type, friendly, jock-type, mid-to-late 20's.  There was camaraderie there."
"094"	"(01/??/1996)"	"I was at a CLE (Continuing Legal Education).  Maybe in California.  I was looking for a seat, did not want to sit right up front, but didn't want to sit by myself either.  I found a seat I liked, or thought someone I knew was saving a seat for me beside them.  But when I approached it, someone else took it or it had been saved for someone else.  I was a little put off by this, I told that person I thought it was saved for me, but they could have it.  I looked for another seat.  The only seat left was one of those school desks, with the desk attached.  It was way over on the side, by itself, near the front.  I sat there although I did not want to, and resented it.  Steve B (an attorney I clerked for briefly) was there."
"095"	"(02/22/1996)"	"An angel came to tell me it was time for me to die.  This angel appeared as a young man but it was obvious that he was a supernatural being.  He said that my life here must now end, and he said I would be wearing my Chico State T-shirt when I died, and showed me a vision or picture.  It was a vision of the T-shirt, in an evidence bag, labeled ""EVIDENCE"".  I say vision because he showed me an aerial view of the shirt in the evidence bag as if it were already the period after I had died and I was able to look back on earth at my death and what had happened shortly after my death.  I took this to mean that my death would be caused by a criminal act which would require prosecution or investigation, or else it was a DUI accident, which might also require evidence.  At first I was very upset.  I felt too young or not ready to die yet.  I had not had enough life.  The angel was very understanding and patient, and let me cry and feel sad.  He knew that telling me it was time for me to die would cause me sorrow, and he talked me through it.  After talking with him a while, I realized I was actually excited about it, looking forward to it, wondering how soon it would happen, almost impatient.  I had heard it was great after you die, or maybe the angel and I discussed what happens and how wonderful it is.  It occurred to me that I was being taken so young because I had achieved already everything I needed to learn in this life, that I had made such great progress in my soul's journey and conscious realizations and enlightenment in this  lifetime, that I did not need to spend any more time as a human, and that I would most likely be allowed to progress on to a higher form of being.  That this would be my last incarnation as a physical being.  I was very happy and relieved about this.  Some time later I was anticipating it, looking forward to it, wondering why it had not happened yet.  I wanted to die very much and go where the angel was, and on to the next journeys.  I thought maybe if I just put that shirt on, that would make it happen.  Then I realized that Lynn has that shirt in Thompson Springs, and I probably could not get it.  Then the angel was telling me to come on, or taking me.  And I was telling him I needed to write to my middle sister first.  The only unfinished business I could think of that needed to be done before I died was to write to my middle sister and tell her I hope she has a beautiful wedding and that I am happy for her and sorry I died and missed her wedding.  Toward the end of the dream I was drafting the letter to my middle sister, and I remembered specific sentences upon waking. I think in the dream I also thought of my will and that it has not been signed yet."
"096"	"(03/13/1996)"	"It was like a story of all my time and history with Lynn.  The dream went on for a long time, with me at Lynn's, dealing with Lynn and his friends and family, different scenarios, happenings, going places.  Lynn was building a big house.  It was beautiful.  Throughout the dream, the house was being constructed.  Some of his friends and family became concerned about him, because it seemed he frequently got out of touch with reality, and said bizarre and insane things.  Beverly and Joyce [elderly sisters living in Thompson Springs] were there, but in the dream they were his mothers.  Also, Lynn's grandmother was there, tiny and smiling.  And all of Lynn's gross friends.  The dream went through several phases and places of my time with Lynn, and dealing and trouble with him.  Later as I began to pull away from the life with Lynn, my family sort of intervened, they did not like him and had always wanted me away from him.  There was a period where I was torn between deciding whether to try further with Lynn or go with my parents.  My family was telling me to get away.  At one point, some of Lynn's family were in a big van, I could see through the front windshield.  His grandmother was kissing some man, very sensually.  She finished and looked at me grinning.  She was really old and impish.  Then, I was getting in a car with my family, they were going to take me away.  Driving past the house he had built, I saw a side-front view of the house.  And there was this amazing row of about nine huge transparent salmon/orange-colored stone slabs lined up across the roof on their ends.  You could see the sunlight through the slabs, they let the light through.  It reminded me of the slow glass story.  He had put them there.  They reflected his and our whole life together in a way, with that late-day sunlight streaming through them.  They were incredibly gorgeous.  I was admiring the transparent stone slabs.    Then, I could see that he had carved away and destroyed parts of the roof.  In his anger about his life and demise, over a period of time, he had carved several huge round circles out of the roof, which looked like stone or adobe mud, also slickrock colored.  The parts he had carved away looked liked the cactus stalk ends, which he severed at my house, that shape.  I knew that he had done this impulsively out of anger, as he does so many things.  It was destructive, ruining his own things, the beautiful things (house, life) he himself had built up.  A little later, I looked and that roof became an actual mountain, and Lynn had carved and destroyed those circular pieces out of the mountain itself.  I remember feeling awed that he had enough power to change a mountain's shape.  I was still torn in decision, thinking about Lynn.  And I realized that Lynn and I had been through so much together, so many trials and hardships and troubles, that I really cared about him and whether he was okay, and I said stop, I need to go see him one more time, or say goodbye or something.  I got out of the car or away from my parents.  I went inside to where Lynn was.  Some of his family was around him.  I went to him, and he was slowly going insane, as he had been throughout the whole dream.  But before in the dream, he had been able to hide it or cover it later with some explanation.  Now it was quite apparent he was obviously insane, and his family was in shock and did not know what to do.    I knelt beside Lynn who was seated in a chair in the middle of a big empty room.  First he started to speak.  The words made no sense, they were nonsense, jumbled, not forming thoughts.  Then he tried to speak again and could not make any intelligible sounds.  I put my arms around him and held his head into my chest.  He had his head down in despondence, as if he were crying.  I was shaken, disturbed and upset, so much of our life, now gone or impossible.  And I said over and over into him, ""Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Oh my god."""
"097"	"(03/16/1996)"	"I was waitressing at a nice restaurant.  A group came in and sat at my table.  Everything was going wrong, I could not get anything out fast enough, it was taking forever to do anything.  The party asked for things, appetizers, soup, etc., and it seemed nothing they wanted was in the kitchen, and I spent all this time hunting for things, dishes, spoons, saucers.  By the time I brought them anything, the evening had pretty much passed.  Anthony was there as restaurant manager.  I asked him where things were, and he'd tell me.  It seemed I did not know my way around, like it was my first day on the job.  I couldn't find anything, and when the party asked questions about the menu, I didn't know the answers.  The soup was memorable.  The party asked what soups were being served.  I told them we had two, one was onion, and one was an unusual creation by the chef.  The main woman at my table was very outspoken.  She said, I thought it was a carrot soup, and I came here just for that carrot soup.  I said, well the two soups right now are the onion and this creation one, but he's still supposed to make the carrot soup at 8:00 tonight.  It was not yet 8:00.  Then I told her kind of snotty:  What does it matter, if the carrot soup is not ready.  We have these other two soups.  It's not like you knew beforehand that it would be carrot, you came here wanting soup, and we have soup.  Who cares if it is not carrot.  Then I realized maybe she had called beforehand, and found out about the carrot soup.  I was embarrassed.  I asked if they'd like to sample a bit of the unusual soup.  I told them the soup had mushrooms, some other unusual vegetables, fresh thyme and herbs, and a layer of toasted bread in it.  They said yes.  I went to the kitchen.  This was when I couldn't find, cups, saucers, spoons.  None of the dishes matched each other, although they were nice dishes.  It was taking forever just to get three samples of soup out.    I finally got three small beautiful cups, like teacups, and went to fill them.  The soup was truly weird.  One cup I filled actually had a whole blackberry in it.  I made sure that blackberry was laying on top of the soup, in view.  The others I filled had big clumps of herbs in them.  They looked really wild, with nature things throughout them, almost like sticks and leaves, dark fruits, and vegetables.  The bread in the soup I had to cut up and put into the cups.  When I finished, I realized I had used up all the soup just with these samples, so they couldn't order full cups anyway.  When I brought it to the table, I realized it was now past 8:00 by this time.  I realized they could have had the carrot soup after all, it had taken me so long just to get organized, oriented, even though I seemed to have no other tables.   After they had the soup, I asked if they'd like to order anything else, expecting them to be totally pissed off about how long it took.  They decided not to order entrees, but two wanted dessert:  a chocolate cheesecake, and the main woman wanted a plum cake.  I was amazed.  I thought they were going to leave.  I commented to Anthony in back about them ordering dessert straight after soup with no dinner.  It was pretty late by now, however.  I also dreamed that I called the movie theater and asked what was playing.  There were three movies on, but they were all kids movies, like disney.  I told the theater, how can all of your movies be kids movies, don't you show anything for adults?"
"098"	"(03/23/1996)"	"I was hiking alone down a canyon, it was steep and rocky, far from society.  I was following a trail of water, through the rocks.  I came to a spot where rocks blocked the path.  Around to the right side, I saw the jump was too steep to continue down the canyon.  I realized, though (before I saw it), that around to the left side of the rocks, it was possible to jump.  At this point there were many other people hiking in the canyon, it was a regular recreation spot, when previously I had been all alone.  It came to me that this was how all the other people were continuing down the canyon, the jump to the left.  Then Ro (housemate from Tucson) was there hiking with me.  She wanted to continue and take the jump to the left of the rocks.  She went first.  From the view looking around the rocks, it still looked too steep for me to jump, and I was scared.  I kept telling her I couldn't do it.  She went ahead.  Then coming upon the view over the actual jump myself, I saw that it was not that steep.  I wondered why I had been so scared, before I had actually seen how it wasn't that steep.    I paused at the ledge, and thought about my shoes being ruined in the jump.  They were my rose suede flats.  So I took my shoes off, and jumped and landed easily in the sand.  Then I remembered I had left my shoes up on the ledge, and I called to someone to throw them down.  Someone did, and then they were my black flats.  I wondered about the appropriateness of these shoes for a hike.  Throughout the rest of the dream, I was continually leaving my shoes behind, forgetting them and remembering to get them.  It seemed I couldn't keep them on my feet.  There were many people, almost partying there in the canyon water and rocks.  Ro and I went ahead, hiked through the canyon, and then we were in Mexico, in a town, and other people joined us.  We went to a bar.  We ordered beer or drinks, and there was a menu of specialty drinks.  I thought about ordering one, and chose a tropical mixed drink.  It had some exotic fruit juice or coconut juice, I thought it might be good, and different from anything I'd ever had.  But Ro and the other people were not happy there, they were thinking about leaving.  So I never ordered one.  We decided to leave, they wanted to go to another bar.  I did not really like who I was with.  They were negative or surly, not happy anywhere, restless, college-types.  At one point, I noticed Ro had really long hair.  Much longer than when we lived together.  I said to myself, how could her hair have gotten so much longer than mine, I have been letting mine grow out all year now, and it's not as long as hers, in the same time.  Then I realized it had been years since I'd seen her, not the short amount of time I had at first thought, of course her hair could have gotten that long over the years.  Later in the dream, her hair was very short, then later it looked short but I realized it was pinned up in back; I could never decide whether it was short or long.  We left the bar.  We were walking through this Mexico town.  I decided to go off on my own for a while, and meet up with them later.  I walked through the town, which was more like a city now.  I misplaced my shoes a few times, and retrieved them.  Now it was night.  It was a little unsafe where I was walking.  I went in some buildings, it was a business district, I went up some stairs in some buildings.  It was poor in a Mexico way.  Then Ro found me, they had been worried about me, but not in a concerned way, more in a hassled way."
"099"	"(04/26/1996)"	"Erik told me had split with his wife.  He said that two years ago, she either made him lose his house through foreclosure, or else she had divorced him, and she was awarded the house.  Not clear in the dream.  He described this house as: two story, the 'warehouse laundry basement.""  He had really liked that house and was sad to have to give it up.  Also he was slightly dis-ing his wife, which truthfully, made me feel better.  Erik in this dream was beautiful.  I saw his features clearly, vividly, in color.  I saw the shape of his torso, stomach, arms, eyebrows, cheekbones.  I was drinking in all the details of his features since it has been so long.  I remember my parents' presence in this dream, how they loved Erik, really thought highly of him."
"100"	"(06/03/1996)"	"Lynn and I went to Linda S's house.  I was working on motions there, I had my printer and computer.  Linda sat across from Lynn and I.  She looked just like that Moon Lady we had when we were kids, the stick-on toy set.  Her face was really broad and moon-like.  Her hair was cut funny, a bowl shape, but in back the left side was curved around and cut two inches higher than the right side curved around.  Linda brought out a whole ton of cocaine and Lynn was doing it.  It was really bad, like sawdust, and had no effect.  She dumped it out on the table in a big pile.  I was working right on top of it, my printer and files were on it.  Lynn and I left it there because it was so bad, and left the house.  I went to my home, not recognizable.  I heard Linda's house had caught fire, the firemen came, and I worried about all the cocaine laying out.  I went to the back of my house, and a housemate was in a small room there with two friends.  I told them I like how they had fixed up the room.  But it was so hot in there.  One of them was drinking a big cup of ice water, and it was empty, I heard the ice clinking in the empty cup.  I went to work out and swim at a gym.  Lynn was there in the pool with me.  He took my bathing suits off me somehow, there were two, a one-piece and a bikini.  He was playing with them with a little kid, and he wouldn't give them back.  I got angry at him.  I was nude in the pool and felt exposed and unprotected, and also like he was making fun of my nudeness.  Some baby in the pool tried to breast-feed on me.  I pushed him away, and I said to Lynn, look what happens when you take my bathing suit away.  I realized I just wanted to lift weights or do push-ups, something strenuous but not aerobic, to exert my muscles.  I got the handles to do push-ups on.  I wanted to start, but Lynn was watching me, and I felt like if I did push-ups in front of him, it would be like working for him, slaving again for him, having to put out work and effort for him, like always before.  I didn't start."
"101"	"(09/15/1996)"	"I lived in a big long rectangular house with Lynn.  Disorder everywhere, and people coming in and out all the time, sometimes living there.  Hardly any furniture, just a big empty two-story house, long and rectangular.  I never knew just what was going on, what the plan was.  Lynn was flying at this time, king of the gang, he had power, and the people coming and going followed his orders.  Then we started getting low on money, and Lynn decided we needed to get more money.  It was like he ran everything, I followed, did what he planned, and I did not have a say in those decisions.  That was okay, but I was in the dark about the full extent of what was going on.  He brought several beautiful women to the house.  I liked them, sometimes we hung out, but clearly I was Lynn's girl, and they were not.  They were there for pleasure, sex, beauty, the other guys in the house, or working for Lynn, I was not too sure at this point.  But Lynn had brought them in, so I went along.  One day I was downstairs near the big front doors, and a big white new Suburban came crashing right through the doors, into the house, turning left inside the big rectangle of the house.  I was startled and scared.  I was going to protest, I knew it was one of Lynn's male friends.  Then another came in, they came one after another.  All of them were white, new, clean.  It was getting dangerous and the house was filling with trucks, so I climbed on the roof of one Suburban with Risk to get out of the way, and rode on top.  At the end of the left side of the house, I could see it was going to crash through the far wall and keep going.  I did not want Risk carried off, and I thought I might not be able to get back, so as it slowed down before it hit the wall, I pushed Risk over the back end to the ground.  I think I jumped off after her, but my main concern was saving her and keeping her there.  I was mad now.  All this disorder, mess, out of control.  People taking advantage of us, scaring me, endangering Risk.  I went upstairs to find Lynn and tell him I was mad.  I talked alone with one of the women.  Somehow she got a point across to me that I really wasn't in a position to complain, either because Lynn was paying for everything, or because Lynn was just the king.  She was kind and laughing about it with me, but she was also hinting at my naiveté about the situation.  She said, ""why do you think we are here?""  I answered something, for sex or for the guys or something.  She said, no he is making us prostitute, and then he takes the money we make.  I sort of knew he was pimping them out, but I was upset that he took everything they made, not just a cut.  I thought or commented that, well, he wasn't doing that to me.  She gave me this knowing look, and said, he will, you just wait.  You know he will soon, make you do it too for the money.  I was denying this, over and over, I knew I was Lynn's girl, and he wouldn't make me do that.  I wasn't in that same category as them, his beautiful whores, but still always whores and they could never be more.  I wanted to keep believing I wasn't in that category, that I was more to him.  But already, just before I woke up, I was remembering that he called me cunt, whore, bitch, slut, and then, that he had made me work, had made me take cases I didn't want to take, pushed me to work for him.  I never really saw Lynn in this dream.  I knew he was around, but he did not appear.  It was just known that he was there and KING."
"102"	"(09/16/1996)"	"I was in a house with many rooms, like Disch's Funeral Home, but an older house.  Felt a little like Indiana area.  It was a little get together with about 5 or 6 people, it was night.  Nell [a good friend from undergraduate days, she was a mime] was there, in the lead as usual, sometimes performing.  The house had older darker furniture, some antiques, and low lighting.  Wood floors with rugs.  Later the house filled with water and when it was about 2 feet deep, I had sex with a man I liked there.  Earlier in the party I knew I liked him a great deal.  By then the other people were gone or elsewhere.  It was spontaneous, sensual, fun sex with him, in the water inside a house.  We enjoyed each other, looked in each other's faces.  It was unusual, but we were not worried about the water, although we did acknowledge that it was out of the ordinary for a house to fill with water.  We just saw it as fun, part of the party.  Afterward he went to the door to leave.  I had assumed from our fun that we would spend time together, or be together as a couple, but now I realized I was mistaken, my expectations had been too high, and didn't match his.  I was greatly saddened by this but did not want to show it.  As he was leaving, I remember hoping he had not given me a disease, since we'd fucked so spontaneously.  I had not thought about it before, because I had assumed we would be together as a couple so there would be a level of responsibility.  As soon as I woke up I knew the man was Rob, from his face, voice, eyes, body.  But in the dream I did not call him Rob, I sort of knew it was him from that old longing, thinking that finally the long-held dream for him was fulfilled - that's how I recognized it was Rob."
"103"	"(09/17/1996)"	"Not too much detail in this dream, just the scheming, Lynn's friends, plots, fear of spies and plots, also an alley and apartment near here, going back and forth, trying to find people or accuse people.  It was night."
"104"	"(09/21/1996)"	"I dreamed I was putting my contacts in.  But they were four times their regular size, about an inch and a half across.  One side was fuzzy textured, like a peach, that's how I knew which side to put them in.  I also checked one in the crease of my palm to see if it was inside out.  I think it was.  You could not see through this fuzzy texture."
"105"	"(09/24/1996)"	"I had to pass by a house, back and forth, in the grass, cutting a corner.  Each time I had to pass, Lynn was spraying me with a hose.  He was acting like he was being nice, only for show for others, because really he was turning the water on scalding hot on me.  He was totally pretending, for others, making them think he was so nice to me.  It was really painful, the hot and cold water sprayed on me, but also painful knowing Lynn was dissing me so much and had so little respect for me that he only cared about others' opinion, not me.  At one point, it seemed the house was Sue D's house I had to pass. [Sue D was Lynn's separated wife.] I felt way too close/near to her house [i.e. acting way too much like Sue.]"
"106"	"(10/05/1996)"	"I am at the farm with Dad, my oldest sister, and my middle sister.  We are walking up the hill that goes to the shed.  My middle sister is behind Dad, and I am in front, but I am looking behind me, watching them.  It is dark out, late night.  I see my middle sister pick up a folding chair, raise it up over her head, as if to hit Dad.  I am not sure what she is doing, so I hesitate.  Then it becomes clearer she is moving to hit Dad with the chair, and then she actually does pretend to hit Dad with it, swinging it by his head.  I think she even made some sound effects or a face in her pretend hit.  I lunge for the chair in defense.  I say to her, ""that was a really stupid thing to do.  If someone thought you were serious, they'd hurt you back.""  Also earlier this night I dreamed I needed a place to live, looking for a house.  I see a room in a house - it has no windows, none.  I am reminded of Tony C's room in Moab.  It would be like a prison cell in that room, but, after much stewing and hesitation, I decide to live there in that room.  It is not even a whole house."
"107"	"n/a"	"(10/09/1996 (#1)) [Before I went to bed, the neighbors' security/motion-activated lights kept going on and off, on both sides of our house.  I heard sounds outside too, leaves rustling, while on the porch and also later in bed, and the Burbeys' dog barked at 6 a.m.  Right afterward, I heard a police siren come near our street.  I had this feeling Lynn had come to Texas, had found me.  I knew even in the dark I would know his walk, his body, and know it was him.] I dreamed Lynn did come to the neighborhood.  He drove a new white Jeep CJ-7 with no top. [In previous dream of 9/15/96, Lynn's vehicles were all white 4WD's.] I was glad he was here.  I had been almost watching for him it seemed, or glimpsing him pass back and forth on the streets, and we both knew we were watching for a time when I could go out to the street unnoticed.  It was night.  He was driving fast and recklessly.  I saw my chance when both Mom and Dad were gone.  I ran out in front of Gretchen's house (my best friend in childhood) as he drove that way and waved him down.  He got out of the jeep and we talked but we knew we didn't have much time and we were rushed and didn't get to say the things we wanted.  Then I saw Mom and Dad return to the house, in the spaces between the houses.  I said I have to get back now, before they know.  We went between the Davitt's house and the McGowan's.  There was a black iron gate there. Lynn opened it for me or helped me open it.  I was touched somehow by his helping me with this.  I ran between the houses."
"108"	"n/a"	"(10/09/1996 (#2)) I dreamed I made love to myself.  There were two of me - me, and the me I was making love to.  I saw my face and myself very close up.  I saw myself smiling very close up.  I realized I could finally know what it was like for someone to make love to me if I did it to myself.  I kissed my face, then my own lips, I touched the skin on my face and neck, touched the genitals on the me that I saw next to me.  I wetted my fingers and touched me.  The other me responded just as I would.  And I was fascinated knowing, finally, what it was like for a man when he made love to me.  The man I had in my mind, as I imagined what it was like for a man with me, was Lynn, and the cabin feeling was in the background.  I came in my sleep and it woke me up.  As I awakened, my hand was moving on the pillow as if touching me but I was coming without direct stimulation.]"
"109"	"n/a"	"(10/09/1996 (#3)) My oldest sister had an inflammation or swelling in her genitals.  She and I and Mom and Dad were sitting in the hallway by the atrium here [in my childhood home, to which I have come back to live in reality] , at the corner between the playroom and the master bedroom.  Her clitoris and labia were so swollen it looked like she had a penis, and it changed in size often as we looked.  She was holding it or touching it, saying she had this bad swelling and did not know what to do and wished it would go away.  It showed from beneath the hem of her shirt.  Dad looked quickly and agreed it was bad, but looked away quickly too, he was very embarrassed.  We were not too concerned with how weird this was (her showing us), more with how to make it better."
"110"	"n/a"	"(10/09/1996 (#4)) I was in one of two couples, we were all playing sexually for a while, playing around the house, talking too.  Then I had to leave, either I got disturbed by it or mad or tired, not an altogether happy departure.  I had brought many small objects and items of jewelry with me to this house, and in our play the whole evening they had gotten moved and scattered.  I was trying to get my stuff together to leave, trying to separate my stuff from theirs, but there were so many tiny things, I got to a point where I didn't care if I left my stuff and they got my things.  I left a lot of things, but before I left, the other female picked up a small pink elephant's head trying to decide whose it was.  I knew it was mine, but she said it wasn't, that I hadn't brought it.  I knew I had brought it and thought of detailed evidence to tell her how I knew it was mine, how I had brought it.  All the other things I didn't care if I left, but this elephant head I really wanted, I didn't want anyone else to have it.  I was adamant and worried I wouldn't be able to win it back.  The elephant head was a soft material, sort of pliable, like gummy bear or rubber ball material."
"111"	"(10/19/1996)"	"I was back hiking in the canyons in Utah, somewhere near Moab.  It was beautiful and wild.  Just red rock, river, cliffs, and winding canyons.  I had to climb up a rock overhang.  There was some problem or danger in the climb.  One or two other people were with me, but we were the only people out there.  I was exhilarated and energized, being back in the desert, in the canyons, touching rocks.  We had a long hike.  Later in the dream I was at a party.  There were drugs.  There was that drug-feeling among the people: over-focused, over-talking, jazzed with detail and heightened meaning.  Small hallways with wood walls or cupboards.  And some danger there, about being caught or some conspiracy between the people there, not too sure now what the exact danger was."
"112"	"(10/23/1996)"	"I went back to the cabin in Castle Valley, Utah [where I lived with Lynn just before it all ended] .  I don't remember any details, just I was back.  I think I was excited, happy, or anxious about being back.  I only remembered this dream later because during the dream I remembered that Mom had recently had a dream about going back to that cabin."
"113"	"(10/26/1996)"	"I was going back to Utah to live, to Salt Lake City or somewhere north in Utah.  I decided to stop in Moab on my way north, either to see some old friends, reminisce, or pick up things from storage.  After I came to town, things started to get bad.  It did not look like Moab.  Things were stolen from me, or missing, and I just felt trapped again.  I was having trouble getting out of town, it was cold, and I was either $ broke or my car was broken, or I was mad about my stuff getting stolen.  It was getting worse, and I felt desperate, like I couldn't make anything work, I couldn't get on with my plans.  I went to my storage locker, and it had been gone through, pillaged.  It seemed like I had backed my truck up to the open storage door, it was bigger, and things were gone.  Then a woman prosecutor or woman law enforcement came on the scene.  She was young, and shorter than me.  I had to make a choice.  Whether to turn in the people I knew were stealing and doing drugs, or not.  I was desperate and pissed.  I made the choice.  I went to her, and turned them in, told her everything.  I needed her help to get out of there.  I remember giving her conditions after I helped her with her bust, like, I need twenty bucks for gas, and I asked her for some food or something.  She was willing to help me for my assistance in the bust.  I was glad I had made the decision to finally bust those in Moab who had wronged me and others.  Although it was a hard decision to make.  After we helped each other, I turned to leave.  A van had pulled up.  I knew Lynn was inside.  But he was just piled in the van with a whole ton of other crap, odds and ends of stuff.  The van was packed full of stuff, and I knew Lynn was in there, curled up fetal and stuffed in a box with the rest of the stuff.  I crawled in through the back of the van, and in the middle of the van I found him stuffed in there.  It was so cold out.  I think it was snowing or icing out.  He was dying, and they had just left him to die in a box in this van with all this stuff.  He was barely conscious.  He too was extremely cold, his extremities were frozen.  I or someone started pulling the box with him in it out of the van, real slow.  I was cradling his head and shoulders, screaming in despair, and crying to him because I knew he would die.  At this point I started waking up, but not quite.  Still asleep, I dreamed of a tall, not-quite-real woman who was very slowly spreading a gelatinous brown matter in wide strips across Lynn's head.  Not his actual head, but more spreading this brown gelatin stuff across the picture or vision of Lynn, then across the whole picture of everything I was seeing.  She was slowly spreading it, strip after strip.  I woke a little more.  I had the feeling this was heroin or morphine, not cocaine as was the drug subject of the earlier part of the dream.  I realized I had been mistaken, I had been dreaming about cocaine as the drug, earlier, but now it was being shown to me that it was really heroin or morphine that was causing all this trouble, and which had caused Lynn to die.  I knew this because of the very slow manner in which she moved, and the brown and the texture.  I knew Lynn had died of a heroin or morphine overdose, as well as being left out in the cold, and I remembered the day when I found him in the motel room [he owned the motel] , od'd from shooting some heinous mixture of it, how he was totally out of it, how that had scared me, and I had stayed with him.  Now it was like nobody had given a shit about him, they'd left him od'd on drugs in this van in a box.  I woke a little more, and opened my eyes a little, still part of the dream.  And I saw, moving down the ceiling, then down the wall, through half-closed eyes, a UFO.  It had red, green and blue lights which were moving in a triangle shape as it traveled down against the wall.  The green and blue lights moved the fastest in the triangle shape, in a pattern, while the red light moved slower in the triangle shape or stayed in the center of the moving lights.  It was dynamic, alive.  It was coming to take Lynn at his death.  The UFO was going to take Lynn with them.  I had the feeling the UFO had been a part of all this all along, that it had caused the entire sequence of events, from the beginning of the dream.  It wanted Lynn dead so it could take him.  I felt a new understanding.  I also realized that those lights and colors are incredibly similar to the colored lights I've seen since I was a child, behind my eyelids when I rub my eyes too hard or get dizzy.  But those colors are unformed, a random mixture of colored lights.  This was a ship, with organized spinning lights with a pattern, and moving down to get Lynn."
"114"	"(11/01/1996)"	"I was in Utah.  I was working at Lynn's on my computer, on a lot of cases.  It seemed like at the motel (Thompson Springs), it had that old feeling (coal smell, old metal furniture, poor lighting, a little cold), but it looked different.  Lynn was in and out while I worked, some other people occasionally too.  I was feeling okay about work and Lynn.  Then I went out.  I was out for a while, and while away, I somehow knew that things had gone bad with Lynn, that he had gotten into one of his moods/phases/tirades, out to get me.  He was pissed at me.  I got worried about the stuff I had left there at Lynn's.  I drove up to a building.  I was driving someone else's truck or van, it was older and bigger than mine, dirty, unorganized, maybe Lynn's Suburban or truck.  Lynn was driving my truck.  This building reminded me of the Thompson motel, it was about ten rooms lined up each with a door out front and a sidewalk.  But it was a dormitory or frat house of a college.  There was something in front of the rooms, a swimming pool or cars or a fenced area, not just the parking lot.    Some young men were making a banner for the roof or writing words up on the roof across all the middle rooms.  I realized it was the last day of school or after the last day, and everyone was moving out, and this was some kind of celebratory or goodbye college banner.  I read it in the dream;  I can't remember what it said now, but I remember it was kind of funny.  I went in two of the rooms.  I was looking for my things, my purse mainly.  Because when I realized that Lynn was on one of his tirades against me, I also realized that he had my truck, and the keys to my truck were in my purse, and he had access to my purse since I had left it at the motel.  I was worried he would take my purse, and I was worried about getting my truck back.  The rooms, as I peeked in, were disheveled, dirty, stuff left everywhere, sheets, cups and trash, stuff like that, half-broken furniture.  It looked pretty dilapidated.  I picked up a bag or box from one of the rooms, without even looking into it, just hoping my stuff was in there.  I got to the van I was driving.  I remember wanting my own truck back as I got into that old van.  But an older witchy woman stopped me and asked why I was taking that bag or box.  I said oh, I left my purse here, I thought it might be in this bag.  I started pulling things out of the bag and it was a white paper on top, like a folded map, and below that about four blankets, old yellow colored.  So my purse was not in there.  I was upset.  I went back to where I had been working at Lynn's.  I sat down at the desk and started working again.  But something was different.  The machine I was now working on didn't seem the same, it was an older model, it didn't do the things the former one could do, like it had no memory.  This one just looked like a mere typewriter, not a computer, and an old crummy typewriter at that.  It had one of those old typewriter balls that spins around for the letters.  I got scared about all the work I had done before:  was it saved, or had Lynn taken it?  (At this point it seemed even the former computer I had been working on was also a loaner from Lynn, or in any case, not mine anymore.  So it wasn't like he took MY computer, at this point, more like he had substituted an older one in place of the earlier one, thinking maybe I wouldn't notice.)  I started looking for the work I had done previously, was it saved here?  Just then Lynn and Leah sat down on either side of me.  They were both acting cruel and controlling, scheming, closing in on me.  Leah was working for Lynn, doing what he said.  I questioned Lynn, and it came out that he had taken all of my work, all the casework I had already completed, on purpose.  He had my files on disk.  All of my work, it was gone, and he wasn't going to tell me where it was.  He said something about taking it because of any possible things in there about him.  I was really mad, frustrated, upset at him.  I realized this was worse than him taking my truck or purse, my earlier fears had not even been as terrible as what he really did here.  Also either this night or the night before I dreamed I was kissing and making out with Erik.  We were a couple, in love, happy, together, partners.  I really enjoyed kissing him and could see his face, lips and body close to me.  There was a feeling that he was mine."
"115"	"(11/03/1996)"	"I dreamed I was giving Lynn head.  It went on a long time, the whole act.  First we were on our knees, and I started to give him head.  We were kneeling in front of a window, and I think we even commented that we didn't care who saw us.  We kept going.  Then I took off my clothes.  I saw myself nude with him.  He was nude too.  Then I pulled him down, to lay down.  I got on top of him and stretched out full length on him, to rub my breasts and body and skin over his front.  I saw my breasts lightly rubbing down his front.  I did my special blow job on him.  It was very wet.  It seemed like I got his stomach wet.  I started slow and teasing the tip with my mouth, and went through the whole thing.  Also I dreamed I was on a cruise ship.  It did not feel like in this country.  There were a lot of people on the cruise.  And it seemed like we were Nazi prisoners, Jews being taken as prisoners.  What was weird was that while we had some idea we were Nazi prisoners, we were all acting so privileged, as if we had rights on this ship, like tourists.  For instance, everyone became hungry, and one of the passengers went to complain and ask that they put some food out for us, appetizers.  I remember waiting for others to eat and then filling a small paper plate for myself.  It was like party food though.  I couldn't reconcile this difference between knowing we were war prisoners and the decadence they were allowing to go on.  It was like the ship crew was reluctant to treat us as anything but prisoners, I think they even scoffed at the request for food, but they did it anyway, treated us like we were just normal passengers.  At one point I went in search of food, I think, but came upon some books in a small back room, and I spent some time looking at and picking out some of the books to read.  I.e. I changed my quest mid-stream when I saw the books in this room.  The day before, we had Barbara and Doug out to the farm, and watched the football game with them there.  Items in the dream are like that day.  Doug and I talked about his upcoming cruise in Norway.  I got a similar plate of appetizers at our little party.  And I went running into the back fields at the farm to pick persimmons, and while walking back there, I remembered playing Nazi prisoner escapee back there when I was young.  Also I do feel like a prisoner living here, with Mom and Dad, and hating Texas, and feeling few options for how to get out."
"116"	"n/a"	"(11/04/1996 (#1)) I was at the cabin [in Utah] again.  I don't know who else was there, maybe Mom and Dad, maybe Lynn.  It seemed like we were moving things around.  Then we left.  Then we had to drive back to the cabin.  There was some urgency.  Mom was driving my truck.  We came up a road, and there was some obstruction or delay.  I must have gotten out to walk or solve the problem.  I decided to walk or run by another route, and Mom kept going the regular road.  It seemed as she drove off, she gave me a disgusted look, like she was frustrated with the traffic or obstruction.  I took a higher path, it was rockier, big boulders, and it went uphill and wound around.  I knew where I was going, I thought I would meet Mom when the forks came together again, or meet her at the place we had been going to.  It was just a different way to get there, rockier.  I ran on this path.  I came to an overlook, above a valley.  It dropped off really steep and high.  It looked like Spanish Bottom in The Maze.  I stopped at the rocks at the edge, looking for the path.  I had been here before and I knew the path went under an overhang, but I couldn't remember exactly where.  I bent a little to look for where the path came out under the overhang.  Then about three guys came up behind me.  One said, ""When we get here, what do we do?  We go over the cliff like this!""  And he picked me up and held me out over the cliff.  I was really scared, I did not know if he was going to drop me the few feet down to the path below or what.  Then he threw me out off the cliff.  I was hundreds of feet above the ground, like at Spanish Bottom.  I soared through the air and got that sick feeling of dropping hundreds of feet.  I knew there must be a river here below me.  In mid-air, I looked at the landscape below, searching for the river.  And then I saw the Colorado River, very dark, below me.  I hoped I would hit it.  But I knew from this height I would probably die even if I hit the river.  And I wasn't sure how to steer myself to hit the river.  The Colorado was almost black, so dark colored.  It looked like the Colorado river area just before Castle Valley area.  I woke up before I hit, still in mid-air."
"117"	"n/a"	"(11/04/1996 (#2)) My Uluri [a sex toy I invented while with Lynn] was in production.  I had gotten it on the market and some sales, and now many were being produced.  I went to see production.  I watched a young woman making one.  But they were making them without my ok on some details.  Like they had started too early before I got to specify and design certain features.  For instance, they were just gluing the ends of the cord to the main cord with cheap glue, and I had always wanted some kind of snap or fastener.  I knew it wouldn't hold up, and that wasn't the way I wanted it.  Other things were just being decided by the people making them, instead of by me.  They had skipped a step in the design process and were just going ahead.  They were cheaper than I wanted them.  I went to complain to the production manager.  He was male, and as I talked I could tell he wasn't listening and didn't care about my ideas and my design rights, he just wanted to get on with it.  I knew he wasn't acknowledging my rights as designer because he was male.  I got fed up.  I then went to a woman to complain, and it was Oprah Winfrey.  She was much more understanding, almost comforting, because by this time I was getting pretty emotional about it and almost crying about how they were making them wrong.  But I felt in the dream that neither of these types had the right response to my complaint.  One was too harsh and dismissive, the other too feminine.  Neither would help right the wrong."
"118"	"n/a"	"(11/06/1996 (#1)) I was walking just inside the border at Canada, north of Seattle, on the U.S. side.  I saw the line of the border on the ground.  It was night, very dark.  I wondered if I could just walk over the line into Canada, if I would be apprehended or shot.  I didn't know how easy you could cross into Canada.  I got to the coast.  I thought I should be smelling peat moss.  I looked out, from what seemed like slitted windows, like a ship or plane or UFO would have.  It was hard to see.  Next to whatever I was on, out in the ocean, I saw a big rolling old ship or something.  It would roll way over on its side, out with the wave, then it would roll in to the other side and nearly hit us.  It did this very slowly, over and over.  I was astounded, entranced, it was so big.  It came so dangerously close to hitting us.  I wondered if we or it was rigged just so precisely with measurements to keep either ship from hitting each other.  Then I wondered if it was the ship I was on that was rolling side to side, not the one I watched.  It was hard to tell if we were rolling or the other ship.  And it was hard to look out those slitted windows."
"119"	"n/a"	"(11/06/1996 (#2)) I had my own Uluri on, and I was experimenting with it.  First wearing both cords on top of my clitoris, pressing (like how Lynn and I started it that night when we invented it.).  Then open beside the clitoris in various beaded and corded positions, for stimulation.  Then I was practicing and experimenting reaching orgasm with it.  (Explicit sex with Lynn described here, which I have deleted in this copy.)  There was a sense throughout the dream that I was experimenting for marketing and production, and for the text to go on the insert pamphlet that will go inside the Uluri box.  So I was searching for ways to describe these techniques to customers as I was doing them."
"120"	"(11/07/1996)"	"Something about strands of dark curly long hair.  It looked almost wet.  It was like those locks of corkscrew curls that Robert P said he liked.  He told me once his former girlfriend had immediately gone out and got that type of perm, just for him, after he told her he liked that type of hair.  The dream was like I was going to get a perm and have dark curly long hair, or I was looking at it, admiring it, imagining it on me."
"121"	"(11/09/1996)"	"Tess [my best friend at UCSC] and I were in a living room, on the floor between some furniture or bookcase, a little hidden.  We started to make out.  She touched her own genitals like an invitation or to show me, and then I took over.  I stroked her clitoris, and she put her head back and groaned with pleasure, smiling.  I was so glad that she liked it.  I asked her questions about how to do it just like she liked, ""on the underside?""  I recalled my wish (in waking life) for her to feel orgasm, since she never has.  Her clitoris was the type in a previous dream about my oldest sister, more like a penis than female.  It stuck out a lot, like the kind Lynn has told me some women have that he has been with.  We started going further.  Then I became anxious or hesitant.  I wasn't sure I wanted this with her.  I told her I didn't think I wanted to actually make love with her, because I really love men, I really love fucking men, and I am not attracted to women in that way, although I love their beauty.  When it comes to sex, I really want men.  Also I said something about how I couldn't even picture actual intercourse with a woman, I wanted a man to fuck me, and a woman wasn't going to satisfy the things I needed to feel in sex.  I was imagining her body pressed next to mine in intercourse, how it wasn't going to do to me what a man could.  There was also some feeling of ruining our friendship if we went further.  She just stared at me, with a look like massive disappointment or disbelief, almost like I was betraying her.  She just kept looking straight at me, not saying anything.  There were other things we had to do.  We had been interrupted from these things.  When we started making out it was like we were playing hooky from some job we had to do there, sneaking off and hoping no one saw we were not working.  But we were obviously attracted to each other, so we almost couldn't help ourselves, making out like that.  But now it seemed our other duties there were surfacing, interrupting us from going further.  It seemed like it was winter, cold out, that's why we had come inside."
"122"	"(11/22/1996)"	"[I was sleeping with Risk in the garage.] I dreamed Jennifer was sitting beside me and telling me that I was being negligent in my duties taking care of Risk.  Then she said that I had never taken care of any of my animals adequately, that they had all suffered under my care, that's why they had died.  That Risk was sick because I had not done things I should have done.  And that Risk was going to die because of my fault.  I was really upset about her telling me this.  I did not want to believe it, I fought it internally, trying to determine her authority for saying this, and I woke feeling uncomfortable, sad, and guilty."
"123"	"(11/24/1996)"	"More dreams about Lynn:  traveling, schemes and dealing with him.  More dreams about Uluri.  An involved dream about my young niece I can't remember, but involved picking her up, holding her, helping her, and/or carrying her."
"124"	"n/a"	"(11/29/1996 (#1)) I was driving in an area much like that between Monticello and Moab.  Big cut canyons, red and bluff rocks, crevices, desert.  It was beautiful and wild, no other people around.  It seemed more off the main road than Highway 191.  I passed a special place, and I said, this is where I am going to build a house, right in this canyon mouth, up against these rocks.  I picked the exact spot I wanted my house."
"125"	"n/a"	"(11/29/1996 (#2)) Another dream - I was standing with a tall muscular man, holding on to him.  I was facing him.  I saw my hands grip his shoulders, his shirt on his shoulders, he was my man, and I wanted him.  I knew we were about to make love.  I knew he was mine.  I noticed very much his muscular shoulders, his masculinity.  I did not see his face, although we talked together and I knew we were going to make love."
"126"	"(12/02/1996)"	"My middle sister was picking on me, over and over.  I was getting really sick of it.  She was wearing my clothes (in particular the blue long dress she gave me), getting them dirty, teasing me, saying mean things to me, doing things to me.  She did these things even when we were out with other people.  Finally one night I asked my oldest sister if I could sleep in another bed than on the top bunk above my middle sister, like if she would trade beds with me.  Apparently in this dream we all three slept in the same big room, my middle sister and me in the bunkbed like when we were little, and my oldest sister in a separate bed.  My oldest sister asked why.  With my middle sister in the room, I started describing all the mean things she was doing to me.  It was like no one had noticed, this was the first time it had come out, that I had let anyone know about it.  To make it really dramatic, I then said, ""And when I'm in the top bunk, she reaches up and PINCHES my breasts like this!""  My middle sister made some exclamation of denial, but I was really upset and fed up with her.  I turned to my middle sister and said, ""Can't you see what those kinds of inappropriateness can do to a child?""  It was as if I was remembering all the manipulative, neurotic, mean things she had done when we were little, and I was bringing it all out now, as an adult."
"127"	"(12/13/1996)"	"I rode a moped home each day.  Each day I took the same route.  It was winter but not cold.  I had Risk set up on the back of the moped.  Usually each day, I liked to go up this little hill when I got to Hillcrest, there was a little church-type building that I liked to go inside and look around, then I would get to ride downhill real fast on the bike.  It was relaxing to see the church-building, artistic and quiet and beautiful in there, it was sort of like a museum or art gallery too, and exhilarating fun to go down the hill.  One day when I got to Hillcrest, I thought maybe I should just go straight home.  I was tired.  But then I thought, no, I'll go up the little hill, I didn't want to break my daily practice since it was about the only fun thing I did all day and it centered and relaxed me.  Somehow Risk had fallen off the back of the moped.  In lifting her back on and arranging her, I realized it was probably a pretty bumpy ride for her and she must be uncomfortable back there each day.  On this day, there was some function at the church, a lot of people.  I got stuck in there and couldn't interrupt the proceedings to get out.  Mom was there.  It was like a fashion show or meeting or presentation.  I talked with Mom, but we decided mutually that she would go on ahead of me.  I knew I wanted her to go on partly so I could have my daily routine in peace without her watching.  There were people in all the little rooms and I was a little confused and stuck, but I finally saw my chance to get away.  I went out toward the door but in the hall, I took off all my clothes.  I felt carefree.  I wanted to se myself nude in the reflection of the glass or mirror, and I half-ran/danced toward the glass door, watching myself.  Then I realized with humor that I couldn't go out in the street that way, nude.  I turned back to get clothes, ran by a mirror in the hall to see myself again.  I liked seeing my nude body, I liked how I looked.  It was erotic and sensual, playing with my reflection.  I must have gotten clothes, because I was back out on the moped and about to start down the little curvy hill on it.  I liked riding this hill each day.  I played with the pedals, still figuring them out, a combination of bicycle and motorcycle.  I saw the dirt road under my feet. I went down the hill, conscious of and wondering the whole time about my daily habits and the few things I find fun in life now.  Also in this dream, Mom was showing a demonstration of the water purifier, and she had me test drink the two waters, one tap, and one purified, for the other people.  I drank the tap water first, then the Neo-Life water, and told the people watching how much better the purified water was.  But I had noticed lint and dirt and dog hair in the cups like they had been sitting out a while, and privately told Mom that she'd better change the water in the cups before someone else drank it.  I myself just drank it with the lint floating in it."
"128"	"(12/??/1996)"	"I went to the Bay Area, Marin or Santa Cruz area.  When I woke up, I felt like I always do when I dream about living there, a message like I should be there."
"129"	"(12/20/1996)"	"I was on a path, seemed like Utah in the outback.  I came to parts that were so narrow they were dangerous.  You had to duck and crawl under overhangs in the path, and you could easily fall off the ledges in these parts.  I stopped or went back to think over going any further.  I wondered or said aloud how do horses make it through these paths without falling, and I imagined what horses would do here, imagined them climbing under the overhangs or going over the ledges and climbing up the rocks."
"130"	"(12/21/1996)"	"I was in the pool here at the house (my parents' house, where I grew up).  I think I was on a float.  There was a big mermaid or some fish-being below me in the deep part.  It talked to me and helped me.  Sometimes it was gone.  Then there would be another fish, just a regular fish, but very big, not swimming as deep, and not right underneath me.  This fish didn't connect with me, it was just a fish in the pool.  I spent a while out there, maybe the dream covered several days.  The mermaid-fish would sometimes appear for me, and we would talk.  It was an extraordinary being - it wasn't really a mermaid, that didn't occur to me in the dream, only after I woke up it was the only way to describe it.  It was bigger than me.  Sometimes it came up higher or out of the water by me, but always swam right underneath me.  Sometimes it was hard to make out, hidden.  Next my oldest sister came in the pool, by the steps.  I told her about the mermaid-fish.  I was looking for it, trying to show it to her.  She asked me what do you talk about, or what does it tell you.  I told her it helps me, it tells me which way my hair looks good, tells me about myself, makes me feel better about myself.  Although I knew the fish and I talked about a lot more than my hair, this was what I told my oldest sister.  I looked through the water for it, but it wasn't there.  I told my oldest sister ""I know this fish is there.""  I really wanted this big fish-being to come back and connect with me again.  I think this fish was my guide, the being who appeared with me in Tucson in that incredible trance.  It was a similar feeling, love and assistance and connection.  Underwater could be my subconscious.  Risk died the next day, Sunday morning.  I am hoping my guide appeared in this dream to assist me with my difficulty believing that Risk made it to the light and is living in love.  I have asked my guides to find Risk, help her to the light, and surround her with love.  I don't want her to be alone.  She deserves to be surrounded with all the love in the universe.  They will take care of you sweetheart, since I can't be there with you."
"131"	"(12/23/1996)"	"I went into a light trance.  I wanted to feel the presence of Risk, she feels so far away.  I saw a glowing orange red circle of light, not very bright.  I spoke to Risk, my sweet baby girl.  I miss her and told her and reached out to her with my hands.  As she started to fade, I needed to know if she made it to the light, is she living in the light of love.  The light got brighter, white, bigger, like a sunrise."
"132"	"(12/25/1996)"	"I was with Lynn, we did a lot of things.  Sometimes outside, or in stores, it seemed like we were working with big appliances, washers or refrigerators.  Then we were four-wheeling in Dad's van.  It was hard to four-wheel the van, and it was the rockiest four-wheeling I've ever done.  Sand and big drop-offs, steep hills.  We came to a big drop-off.  I could see over it and eased the van, and it was going straight down.  I could look straight down to the path below.  The van went down rocky and hard, but made it.  I looked up the road, it went uphill, like we were going through a gulley or ravine, and Lynn was somehow already out of the van and walking up ahead of me.  I was surprised he was up there already.  Felt like - he is always one step ahead of me."
"133"	"(12/26/1996)"	"I half-woke, just before I had to get up.  Still sort of dreaming.  I saw Risk's face, she came right up to my face, and snuffed at me or kissed my face.  I could feel her presence, her closeness, the way she moves and looks, just the way Risk approaches me and kisses my face.  I was looking at her face straight-on, I could see both her eyes looking at me.  I felt her all day close to me."
"134"	"(01/01/1997)"	"I was doing many things in the house here.  I think we were getting ready for an open house (the house is for sale), straightening up.  I had conversations with various people, important conversations.  I had a piece of Lynn's dead body with me, just the thighs, lower back and penis.  I had cut him up myself.  I took it into the other bathroom, the one I used as a child here.  I put lots of vaseline on the penis and had anal sex with it.  I thought, this is not so bad, if you get it lubricated really well.  It feels kind of neat.  I was remembering how much I'd disliked it before, and how this was different.  I could see myself in the bathroom mirror.  I watched the whole thing.  Some close up views of it going in and out.  Then Dad was in by the bedroom hallway.  Getting the house ready to show.  I thought, I do not want him to find this piece of corpse, but I had lost it myself.  I couldn't remember where I'd put it, and I looked in the closets, the bedroom, under the bed.  Trying hard to remember where I put it.  Only then did it occur to me how bizarre it was that I had a piece of Lynn's body, cut apart, dead.  How bizarre it would be if Dad found it.  I myself did not seem to care too much that I had Lynn's cut up corpse.  Later, I was speaking with a middle-age to older woman with short hair about her job.  Her features were very distinctive.  I had been trying to find work and had no luck.  She was telling me how I could become a site inspector like her.  She showed me the forms she filled out, showing me how easy her job was.  It was like a County Health Inspector job.  It was almost like I was already hired, or if I wanted this job I could have it.  I was happy at first about finding a job, but then began reflecting on how boring or ill-suited the job would be for me.  That maybe I shouldn't do it."
"135"	"(01/05/1997)"	"I was camping or outdoors with Risk.  It was not a secure or comfortable feeling, maybe Lynn or his friends were around, there was some anxiety.  We were talking, doing things.  There was an impression of an old shed or ruins of some buildings, old.  Then I looked at Risk's leg, where the lump was.  There was a cut all the way around the lump, like a slice.  It was bleeding.  I took Risk into the lake to wash it off.  She came in with me.  I was really worried about her."
"136"	"(01/07/1997)"	"I was scared.  I was in some temporary dwelling or place under construction.  There was a light pole in the dream near me.  It was trashy around."
"137"	"(01/23/1997)"	"I was at Jeff's house on Seabright in Santa Cruz.  At the back of the house, the floor was gone.  He had redone the kitchen, widened it, and put more appliances in there, all lined up along the back wall.  But I was worried about the landlord and the back door being gone, and the floor being up (gone).  It was kind of dangerous with no floor boards.  You had to jump off the roof on to the ground out back, to get outside the back door.  The steps were gone.  Another part of the dream, I was at a school very much like Sarah Lawrence.  There were a lot of women, very smart women, a lot of expectations.  I let one of the girls' (something) almost float down the sink, through the top overflow drain.  It was like a small piece of leather, or something that floats.  I stopped it before it went through the drain."
"138"	"(02/06/1997)"	"I was out there in the field again.  It was the spot I'd seen earlier tonight (in waking reality), driving back home.  I really felt in the surroundings I'd so intensely noticed earlier (in waking reality), but I knew it was really a symbol of being back in the oil field, in Utah. [Lynn owned several oil wells in Utah, and we worked them together.] It was night, very dark, and I was alone.  I was kneeling by the side of a dirt road, by a gulley or culvert.  It was rainy, and the ground was runny like I'd seen and noticed earlier out here.  I was just out there, without a car, existing outside, noticing my surroundings and the ground.  I was close to the ground.  I was glad to be there.  I felt proud somehow, or privileged, almost like when firefighting, a privileged position about being there that provides much satisfaction.  I noticed to my right there was a black car on a smaller side road.  It was behaving strangely or surreptitiously.  It would back up slowly and then stop.  It was kind of hiding behind some small trees or branches, not letting itself be seen.  And it was way too late for it to be out there for any good reason.  At first I thought I might get its attention.  I was thinking somehow I could share or show my pride or happiness at being out there.  I felt I belonged there or had a right to be there, so if the person in that car noticed me, it was okay.  I even thought I might get a ride or meet the person or something, or we would share some connection to the field.  Then it hit me how dangerous it was.  That car was hiding out or running from something or just up to no good.  And it was so late.  I was a woman alone way out here without a car.  Then I got the feeling the person in the car was actually looking for me, to harm me.  I realized how naive and stupid and dangerous it was for me to think it was okay if they saw me, that they'd just pass.  I was sure now, convinced, that the man in that car would rape me if he saw me out here alone.  I stayed still, but then tried to hide myself so he wouldn't see me.  I didn't think he'd seen me yet.  I was a little hidden already, being so low to the ground, and it was so dark.  I tried to or thought about getting lower, into the culvert below me.  If I could just get down there, I felt I could hide.  I was in that process when I saw his car move quickly, toward the dirt road I was on.  I was by then terrified, I knew he would rape me, and probably kill me out here.  I had worked myself into a panic of fear.  I woke up, feeling like it was Lynn in the car, but also a stranger."
"139"	"n/a"	"(02/14/1997 (#1)) I went in water with Risk.  It seemed like Utah, not here.  It was like a lake, I submersed both of us.  She was in my lap, like I was holding her up in front of me on my legs.  When she came up, she was faded, her color, and her eyes were a much lighter brown, like gold or bleached out.  She was just looking blankly.  I got the feeling she had gone blind.  I was terrified for her.  Someone nearby saw her, and said she would die soon."
"140"	"n/a"	"(02/14/1997 (#2)) Next dream:  I was approaching or in front of Disch's garage door in a small car.  It didn't look like his house, it had a long driveway and seemed to be out in the country, but I knew it was his place.  I paused very near the garage door, but I knew I would block his hearse in if I parked there, and he might have to get to a funeral, so I did a U-turn in the driveway, went back out the driveway, looking for a place to park, and went to his other garage area and parked.  Then a few people and I were in this other garage, it seemed like Lynn and his friends.  We were taking things or doing things to his stuff in there, things we wouldn't have wanted Disch to know about.  Then Disch, and I think Penny too, came out in the garage, but they either didn't notice or didn't care that we were in there or what we were doing."
"141"	"(02/15/1997)"	"I was with Rhythm Box and John M in Santa Cruz.  We had just gotten fired from a gig, they didn't want us to play there anymore.  Actually it felt like I was not in the band anymore at the time, but they had gotten fired.  I felt sympathy for them.  Then I was with John M and some of his friends or the band members at a house in Santa Cruz.  It had very high ceilings, a two-story house, older.  We were hanging out, there was some friendly attraction between me and John.  I flopped down on this neat couch and called Jeff.  There was something disapproving about this, it felt like maybe I was on the phone too long or something and some other guy there wanted to use the phone.  But it also felt like I had hurt someone's feelings by calling Jeff from there, in front of someone.  We hung out some more.  Then I felt like I had been there way too long, I had to get going, felt like I had to move, like I feel now, this hurry to get out of Texas and get on with my life.  A sort of exhausted impatience.  But they were my current gang, so I was reluctant to leave, I was comfortable and knew them and liked this house, and I liked John.  But I felt like I really needed to move and leave there, and it felt like I would be leaving for good, or for a long time.  Someone proposed going camping, one last trip, and they asked me along.  I agreed to go with them, just for three days, then I gotta go.  I left first, they were to meet me there.  I drove and got to the camp spot before them.  It turned off the highway, and there was a path going downhill through low bushes or trees.  I had been there before, we all had.  I got out and went down the path, passing a big circular open field to my right, lower down.  It seemed like that field was the normal place people camped there, but we all had a special place we liked, further back in the woods.  I went back toward our spot, downhill.  Then it was night.  As I neared our spot, I noticed for the first time a huge wealthy house set back in the trees, with party lights on.  I was surprised, in all the times we'd come there, I had never known there was a house back there.  I saw through the trees a young woman in a white flowing dress, she was elegant, her hair done beautifully, like a long french braid.  I knew she was rich, I figured she was the daughter there, and it was apparent they were having a big party.  She went inside.  I watched the party through their windows.  The trees were very tall.  Then a man came out and said we must leave.  I'm not sure if my gang had caught up yet.  I or we protested, said we always camped there, but he said no, you can't now.  I thought of the field where everybody else camps, the ordinary place, and figured we'd have to go there, and I was not happy about it."
"142"	"n/a"	"(02/16/1997 (#1)) I was at Arches National Park with my family.  My family was mistreating me, ignoring me, not caring when they did things that hurt me physically, rushing me, paying no attention to my thoughts or feelings, just dissing me in general.  I was getting sick of them.  I felt hurt and lost, like giving up.  We went in a mine cart on some tour.  I was sitting next to my middle sister in front.  We sat in this mine cart and it went slow down some tracks.  But there was some construction or the tracks were broken, we were having difficulty getting through.  There were boards across the tracks, it was messy and unfinished, and then we came to a big drop off.  There was no way the cart could continue.  There was a man there, some Park employee, telling us to back up, and moving boards off the tracks.  My middle sister started to back the cart up and I was helping push us back with a walking stick thing, but she was moving too quick, and my arm was stuck on the stick I was holding, so it almost tore my arm off and it hurt.  My middle sister paid no attention to my pleas to slow down, hold off.  I was by this time thoroughly sick of my family and what I perceived as a total lack of attention for my being.  We got back to the Visitor Center, and I thought, this would be a good place to buy drugs, here at night at the Arches Visitor Center  I was planning on doing so."
"143"	"n/a"	"(02/16/1997 (#2)) Next dream:  I saw a scene of a hippie family.  They had a child, and they treated their little girl the way I would have wanted to treat kids, back when I wanted them - with respect for her, real unconditional love and support, attention to the child's being.  The little girl was sitting in a window of a stone tunnel, like the tunnel at Zion N. P. that has a window overlooking the canyon.  Her Dad, Mom and family was there.  The Dad was listening to her.  Then there was a shot of Viktoras Kulvinskas' face (vegetarian food writer), a feeling of that hippie life.  He was showing sprouts or fruit or something, how it enhanced the quality of your life.  And I knew then that it was not really possible, that life I had once wanted, that it wouldn't really work like that.  I was sad about this.  I felt like maybe that kind of life was possible for some in Moab, but not possible for me.  I felt how truly and drastically far I had gone from that life.  "
"144"	"n/a"	"(02/22/1997 (#1)) I was with Lynn, felt like Utah.  We were together as a couple.  We had our little projects going, fixing things, ideas, fun times, etc.  There were bad times and good times, I think it was slowly getting worse, more fighting, more depressing.  But there were still things we wanted to do with each other.  So we stayed together.  We heard about this seminar on a new business you could run from your home.  We either went or thought about going, but it was not as good a business as we thought it might be.  Then we decided to go anyway to see what we could get from them, knowing we were not really going to try this business.  That was manipulative.  BUT what struck me was the positive, excited feeling in that class.  The other attendees, the whole feeling surrounding it was so positive about the future.  They were so mentally healthy.  And Lynn and I were being that way too, really excited (for once) about the possibilities and opportunities, doing this together, believing in ourselves and our future.  That feeling shocked me because it is so opposite from how we were.  The other thing that was significant was there was a definite message about Lynn and I running this business as a couple, that we would work closely together, that it would be OURS together.  And I remember really feeling him physically beside me in the seminar, knowing we were running a business together, and that's one of the things that was visibly exciting both of us.  There was this recurring thought of a job for TWO, or TWO projects, for a couple.  Also, an image of two little projects on my bed, waiting to be done.  Then there was the usual Lynn-type upset in plans.  Lynn and I fought or he lost his temper, and he went into hiding.  It seemed like my stuff was missing, he had stolen it, or broken it all or sold it.  I asked his family member (maybe his sister), where he was, and what he was living on.  She said he had ""sold all his assets"".  I know she meant little personal items, not the oil field.   So he had a little cash and had gone hiding.  But I knew he didn't have anything to sell, so I was mad that he had probably stolen my stuff or someone else's.  There was a recurring image of my house in Utah, just the bedroom, it had the two walls missing on either side of the bed, they were open, and I kept walking up there, and feeling exposed and unsafe, not protected.  It was at this point that I realized I really missed Lynn, bad.  I had been telling people how I want all ties severed, didn't care that he was gone, but really, that positive feeling and togetherness and love were still haunting me, and each time I neared my bedroom in the dream, I missed him bad.  I thought upon waking: even in conscious reality I am kidding myself about this.  I still miss him and I should admit it.  There was some other character in the dream, a Lynn friend, some undesirable character, he kept coming around by the driveway, working and projects, but nothing really getting done.  It seems like I kept backing out of the driveway and every single time, my truck would get caught on his truck or some project of his, and pull it apart, and everything would crash down and break.  I was getting sick of it.  Dad was present in this part.  Then there was a shift in the dream.  I was standing with Dad and Mom and other friends, some strangers, on a plaza thing, or near buildings.  I looked up and there was an enormous marbled-red moon in the horizon.  It blocked the entire sky, it was so close to Earth.  It was fantastically beautiful, the red and cream colored marbling was shifting, getting more beautiful.  I said, wow look at the moon.  It did not seem odd that it was so close to us, so huge.  It was just unusually beautiful.  Then later I said it again, as if I forgot that I had already pointed it out."
"145"	"n/a"	"(02/22/1997 (#2)) Next dream, I was trying out in A Chorus Line.  Same music and everything.  There was a lot of pressure, and I felt like I didn't really fit in.  I was trying to get the routines, the steps, asking others to clarify them.  I left and came back to an area, and overheard one of the girls telling the producer:  ""Don't mind her, she's not very well-lightened.""  Sort of like well- liked, but I knew she meant en-lightened, like I didn't know the steps, so it wasn't as much of a cut as not being well-liked."
"146"	"(03/05/1997)"	"Upon waking, I realized I had been dreaming vaguely about what it would be like if I took that job offer and moved out near L.A., dreams about a new, healthier life, with the actual, unbelievable prospect of some happiness and healthy independence involved."
"147"	"(03/26/1997)"	"I was at Sarah Lawrence College, at like a ten year reunion, and it went on for days.  At the end, someone was making it difficult for me to leave.  I had set my briefcase and purse and all sorts of things up on top of a car, and they started to drive away and I was on the car or in the car and I was telling them, stop, stop, and the people in the car too were telling the driver to stop.   My stuff was falling off and it all just kind of got lost all over the street, and she (the driver) started going toward New York really fast.  I made it back somehow to Sarah Lawrence and I stayed in a room in a part of campus I didn't know real well.  I started to look for my stuff.  My briefcase with the computer was gone, and I found in a stairwell in another building on campus my guitar picks, my metal finger picks, they had fallen out of my purse so I knew my purse was around somewhere but I couldn't find it.  And some other things from my purse were there too in the stairwell.  So I went back to that room I was staying in and I knew I was a squatter there.  There was really nowhere to sleep or shower or eat, and the reunion was over, everyone had left.  There was a little goodbye ceremony at the end, and it was OVER, and I was staying on after that although I knew I needed to leave.  So I decided to go find help, try to get my stuff back, maybe someone had found it.  I found an administrative person, and I recognized her, and I said I was here ten years ago, maybe you remember me, and I came to the reunion, and my stuff fell off the car, and it's all over.  There was something about finally asking for help that was significant, like I was trying to do this all alone, and I finally asked this woman older than me for help, and it felt good.  I don't know if I ever found all my stuff, but it felt like some saving at that point when I asked for help.  Also I think I dreamed about Richard B [my boss in the new lawyer job I took near L.A.] , because I was thinking about him in the morning when I woke up, maybe something sexual.  Also I dreamed about having abortions, there were so many of them and the doctor or nurse or person helping me, instead of just bringing like one maxi pad in for the process or the bleeding, she brought a whole stack of what looked like blue jeans, and there was just going to be one after another after another after another abortions, and I just felt like I was going to have way way too many of them."
"148"	"n/a"	"(04/??/1997 (#1)) [Just before going to Utah with Dave - April 19] , after our weekend in Encinitas April 13.]  I dreamed I got up from bed with him, nude, I was standing in front of a mirror, like my full-length mirror.  Dave looked at me, or at me looking at my reflection in the mirror, and said, you don't have that great of a figure."
"149"	"n/a"	"(04/??/1997 (#2)) [After Utah trip, I think the next weekend - April 26.] I was in my truck and Dave was driving.  We were traveling, like in Utah, but it was off the highway, felt like outside of Las Vegas.  It was late night, after midnight.  We stopped for gas or something, and afterward, we were backing up or going out, and some thieves or criminals were approaching or threatening, like they were going to mug us, or carjack.  We were in a bad area, we knew already it was unsafe, and I really just wanted to leave, get far away.  Dave got real aggressive, wanted to confront them.  He got out and had a gun, approached them.  I was watching through the windshield.  I saw him go up to them, he said something aggressive to them, and pulled his gun on them.  They pulled out guns too.  I thought, well this is it, we're both going to get shot.  This is where I will die, right now.  I was anticipating getting shot.  I didn't want to watch.  I put a pillow up in front of my whole face and body so I wouldn't have to see it happening.  I was also thinking about how I'd picked the wrong guy to be with, how Dave was being so violent, controlling, angry and aggressive [although he is the opposite in reality] , and I didn't want him, I was sick of him."
"150"	"(04/26/1997)"	"I was with Jeff near a state border.  Not an international border, but like between Arizona and California.  It was night.  I had asked him to hold, carry, or get me some drugs.  He was holding a large quantity on him.  We were in my truck, approaching the border.  We decided he should walk this part, or get out.  I drove through the border checkpoint, and I saw him trying to walk through, to find a way.  There was a big sign that said ""Hey walking guy, go through here"" or something obvious.  So he went through that way and immediately the cops swooped on him.  They searched him and found the drugs and held the bag up in a big bright flood light for everyone and all the drivers to see.  It was their big score, and there was the thought that they caught many people this way, making them think that was the way through, when it was really a trap.  They handcuffed him and I could tell they were asking him who he was traveling with, they were looking for me.  I knew I could slip through unknown if I didn't reveal myself.  He started to look toward me, but he didn't want to give me away.  He was trying to protect me.  I was about to abandon him and save myself, but then I knew I couldn't leave him in that bind, when he was in trouble doing my deeds for me, they weren't even his drugs.  So I gave myself up to the cops and we went to jail.  We got long sentences, I remember one jailer telling us we'd gotten ten years.  But Lynn was in there too with us.  I don't know why he was in jail.  They let us all three stay together in jail for some reason.  It was weird being in jail with both Jeff and Lynn. [I had chosen Lynn over marrying Jeff in 95.] That combination and those surroundings, it didn't fit somehow, didn't make sense, why we were all three together there.  Somewhere in here, either before the border part, or as an interlude, there was a segment about being with Lynn in Thompson Utah at the motel.  It was the usual motel thing, doing things, meaningless busy projects and undesirable people (his friends) coming around, feeling buzzed and high but sort of frustrated and angry and hopeless, busy but accomplishing nothing, and everything we built getting ruined after all.  It seemed long, like a representation of our whole time together.  Many days and things happening, and everything slowly falling apart in every way.  Mostly here, there was the feeling of people coming and going, scenes of the sidewalk in front of the motel, and inside the rooms, and me wondering why I was hanging out with people like this who were so much unlike me and what I wanted in my life.  So by the time we three got in jail, it was like I had just left that long part of my life with Lynn at the motel, and all those people he knew there.  That was what was present in my life when we got to jail.  Like the border incident was just the reason or incident why I was in jail, but my being and presence had just left that long segment of living with Lynn at the motel in Thompson, and it was still present with us.  We served some time, and then the opportunity arose for us to escape.  We did not want to be in jail, and our sentences were so long.  We were shocked when we found out it was ten years.  We were landscaping or maintaining the lawn or grounds, there was a steep downhill behind the prison fence, with heavy dense brush outside the fence.  We planned our escape, scoping it out.  Then we were on the other side of the prison, another steep downhill on that side, more brush but not as dense.  We saw our opportunity, and started to escape.  The guards caught Jeff and Lynn, but didn't see me.  I knew I could still escape as planned, or I could stay and give myself up with them, and this time, instead of sticking with them and getting caught and taking the rap with them, I went ahead and got free.  I knew the guys been caught, I knew they weren't going to make the escape, and I went anyway.  Either before our escape, or right after my escape, I somehow got back to speak secretly with Lynn.  There were scenes of the prison grounds and the fields outside I would have to cross on foot, power lines.  I told him, I made it out, I'm going to escape, but I need clothes and a vehicle and probably a place to stay for my escape.  I had nothing, I felt totally stripped of all my possessions, they were all gone or stolen or missing forever, and I knew I would need a place to stay and food and clothes, a hiding place or some means or help for my escape.  I asked Lynn, can I stay at the motel on my way out in my escape, can I use the motel?  I was picturing the rooms at the motel when I asked him, but my picture of it was more like a small house by a railroad tracks or a dirt road, like a run-down house, dreary weather, with unknown people coming and going.  I pictured myself hiding out there, at night or early morning, not really telling people who I was, and being scared, but knowing I had Lynn's permission to stay, his assistance and protection, or that I could use his name in a bind, that I had a right to stay there.  I pictured myself using his clothes there, a big coat or dark shirt, maybe his vehicle, and kitchen there.  It was funny, planning all this in my mind while I asked him, it was like planning to get back to our life there somehow.  I had detailed plans in my head, I was really running away with the little details and remembering Thompson and what life was like there for us and how it would be there for me alone now, knowing it was nuts, that everything was changed, he was in jail now, with little chance of getting out, and our life and plans together couldn't possibly happen now.  Anyway, later in the dream, it didn't work out they way I pictured at all.  I thought it was interesting how I asked him and pictured it all, but then didn't do any of it anyway.  I started my escape.  It was days, and I walked.  I went by highways, overpasses, and neighborhood streets, parking lots, I went by convenience stores.  I was always looking over my shoulder.  I traveled a lot at night.  I never went to the motel or to Thompson.  It was more like a big city with neighborhoods.  A couple of times, cops came close or looked at me and I was scared.  I walked fast.  I came to a truck in a parking garage, I thought it was Lynn's and I could take it, but there was some problem unlocking it or starting it, and it was too conspicuous.  So I kept walking.  I went between some houses.  I was resourceful, I looked for food and made up stories to tell people to hide my escape.  Then I got to my house here in Chatsworth.  I think my oldest sister was there, and some other people I knew who liked me.  They knew about my escape and they helped to keep me hidden.  We kept quiet and kept the house dark.  One day we saw a cop come walking around, out the window.  I hid, and he knocked on a window or came right up next to the house.  I was sitting on the tile floor.  I saw Risk, looking huge, get up and bark this ferocious bark at him through the window.  I said to her, ""Good girl, good girl"" in a whisper.  The cop came in and found me and started to tell everyone, now look, cooperate and come with me.  But I got away somehow, out of the house, and ran up in the hills and paths behind the house.  I ran fast and followed paths between the rocks and brush.  I looked quick, and made quick decisions how to escape.  I was already more experienced at escaping.  I went way up the hill.  Two women were sitting in front of a boulder reading, I asked for their help and they hid me behind them and the rock and kept reading.  I could see my house down below and cops coming up the paths after me.  They didn't find me.  I waited for a good chance, thanked the women, and ran away down the paths.  I was feeling good about evading the cops.  I ran a long way, into town.  It looked like here in Woodland Hills or Canoga Park.  I saw a little car being driven by a young couple and asked them, and jumped on, it seemed like I jumped on the outside of their car, hanging on.  The cops were looking for me.  They came up, and I couldn't believe they couldn't see me, I was so obvious.  They stopped the car with the couple, but I had jumped off and ran toward a field.  At the back of the field there was a high fence and concrete drainage or aqueduct or stream.  On the other side was a building that seemed like a YMCA or public recreational building or gym.  At this point there was a small man with me.  He reminded me of Shane (friend from Thompson).  He was helping me escape, and he was becoming a good friend.  He showed me how to get over or through the fence and across the water or drainage.  We went through together, we wanted to get to that building to hide.  We got in the building.  There was a long series of hiding in different rooms and corridors, and mixing with people there to hide.  This small man was really helping me.  There was an attraction growing between us, we were in this together, he was escaping or hiding too.  We got separated at one point, I think he went to pee, and when we connected back together, we were so glad to see each other, I think we hugged each other.  The cops were there.  They kept passing me, and looking at me, I was disguised in some other clothes, but slowly they knew I was the one they were looking for.  Something about my clothes or a label or sign on my coat gave me away.  This man did everything he could to keep me hidden, but the cops finally got me, and I think him too.  It was a real adventure/ experience with him there.  We felt like we'd been through a lot together.\"
"151"	"(05/09/1997)"	"I was in a cheap seedy motel room with Lynn.  It looked different than Thompson [Lynn owned the motel there] , but the feelings were similar.  This room was darker, more dark red and burgundy colors, and there was a restaurant or tavern attached through one door.  It was kind of trashed, or had miscellaneous or broken furnishings in there.  I remember the bathroom, and it was that same feeling as the bathroom in Room 7 in Thompson, no water pressure or shower or something.  We were there for a while.  We laid down together, and Lynn started touching my breasts.  It felt so good when he touched my breasts, it was really turning me on, I asked him, don't they feel huge, or bigger?  They did to me.  I really liked what he was doing, he was stroking them and squeezing them really nice.  I was getting really aroused.  Then he got up.  I didn't want to stop.  He went into the next room, but there was a window or opening between where he was and where I was still in the bed.  I said don't you want to get undressed?  He said take off your clothes, then I'll come back in, maybe.  I asked him if he wanted to take off my clothes, or take off his clothes.  Then I recognized that feeling of trying to have sex while on drugs, when you can't keep on track with the activity, or connect with your partner, because you're both thinking about doing different things, or really wanting to maybe do something else other than sex, and it's hard to actually get started.  I got sad."
"152"	"(05/10/1997)"	"I saw Risk, her big Dane dog body, she was sitting upright in front of me.  She slowly turned her head to look straight at me intensely, right into my eyes, and the side of her face was wrinkled up like she'd just woken up.  I felt like she'd been sleeping, like I'd woken her or disturbed her, but it was nice to see her.  I was struck by the memory of how Dane-like she could look, the particular way she moved her body and her head.  That has been missing from my thoughts of her, but now I have it back."
"153"	"(05/22/1997)"	"I dreamed I was asleep in my house, and I heard sounds, or woke up and noticed things had been moved in the house. [Lately I have had little dreams of my things being taken or stolen from this house.  For instance the dream this or last week about finding my antique hats (the pink one, that I have had since high school) stolen and for sale in a store.  I was furious and took them back.  It is disturbing, feeling this threat to my safety.] I got up from bed and looked over the bedroom half-wall, expecting to see someone coming in the house, and feeling apprehension.  Instead I saw Jean (the landlord), he was putting in three new windows in the front wall, where you cannot see out at all unless the front door is open.  I was so glad for these windows, they were beautiful, three different shapes and sizes, nicely placed, and now I could see out front and not feel so cut off and hidden from the world.  I was really happy about them.  Also I noticed he had put in a front closet in the wall by the bedroom half-wall.  I was glad for this too, I needed another closet to be organized, without my clothes out in the open, to feel really whole and moved into this house.  I woke up feeling like I need to get out more, to open myself up more to the outside world, like those three new windows, to be part of the world here.  I went hiking the next day."
"154"	"(05/24/1997)"	"I was supposed to make lunch for several friends or co-workers.  We had been working or moving or talking or something that day.  They had all arrived, except Lynn.  We were in my house, it seemed a lot like my Chatsworth house.  Something about it reminded me of the day of tearing the movie set down on the ranch by the Needles N.P. - working together and then having lunch.  Lynn arrived, we were all looking up at him from my living room.  We were looking up these stairs outside the front door of my house, like the entrance was below where he came up, he was at the top of the stairs outside.  He was with a petite woman who looked a lot like that young woman who works at Amwest on the third floor.  She is very slim with long dark blond hair.  I always see men around her.  I was watching him and he turned toward the woman he was with.  I started to get disbelieving or upset, and someone asked me how I knew they were seeing each other, because before apparently it had been a secret, and it was still hard to really tell for sure.  I said, because of the way he turns toward her, or the way he responds to her every question or request.  By the way he does that, I know he likes her or they are seeing each other.  He wouldn't turn with quite that attention unless they were seeing each other.  We were still watching him and he kissed or embraced the woman.  I then moved over to where I was standing right in front of their entrance.  I looked up the stairs outside at him and gave him this look, like, my god, I can't believe you did that right in front of me, you kissed her like that, don't you know I saw the whole thing?  They did not come into the house after that.  They were both too embarrassed.  We talked about it among us, everyone.  Someone mentioned how Lynn goes through women quickly, how he uses them and then dumps them and never cares.  Someone else then said, yeah, but this woman he'll have a hard time doing that with.  This woman will make it really hard for him to get away that easily.  Meaning, she is the type that will hang on to him with various tactics, who will make it impossible for him to break away.\"
"155"	"(05/26/1997)"	"Mom was helping me do the lottery.  I had a ticket and she was matching up the winning numbers.  She had these silver stars to put in the numbers I had picked if they were winning numbers.  They were three-dimensional stars you put on the numbers on your ticket, and she matched all of the stars, I think it was 15, it was more than the normal 6 numbers.  I realized I had won.  I thought I had won the whole jackpot, which was 15 million dollars.  But later I realized I couldn't have won the whole thing.  I don't remember why I couldn't have won the whole $15 million, there was already a main winner, or maybe from my particular numbers.  The next morning I went to work at Amwest, in the trillium building, into the lobby/elevators.  I was wondering if I should tell anyone yet.  I was so happy I could quit work there, move away to Colorado or Utah, do what I wanted and be set for life.  I was ecstatic, so fucking happy, I needed and wanted that win so bad, to save myself, my humanity, to be able to do what makes me human and content, to be able to quit this job.  I found out what I had won, it was $400,000.  Still a good win, although not millions.  That $400,000 could still keep me pretty free and happy for life.  I started planning what to do with it.  I talked with Dad about investing it, buying stock, opening a CD.  I asked him if he would invest it for me.  He advised against investing it, which surprised me.  I started telling a few people at work I had won.  I was planning on quitting and leaving pretty soon."
"156"	"(06/02/1997)"	"I dreamed Mike D was looking in my ear.  Maybe it means I am not listening enough, or listening closely enough to him."
"157"	"(06/04/1997)"	"It was night, and I let some people in my house here in Chatsworth.  My house was bigger, longer, it had a long outdoor porch or long living room, kind of like the cabin in Castle Valley.  I thought they came to party with us, but then they started wrecking things, stealing things, destroying and changing things, and I realized they had come to take advantage of me.  I knew I had dreamed of these same people, this same situation before, on another night.  I recognized this same scenario.  And in this dream, it was like it happened twice.  They came again at a later date, I let them in again, and again they took advantage of me, took things and wrecked my things.  There was a scene of the street outside my house, where I was trying to get them out, get my life and my stuff back together.  I couldn't trust them.  I got anxious and scared for my house, my life and belongings, the things I've built up since leaving Lynn.  There was one main woman, a strong crass woman in her 40's, who was heading it all.  I knew I had dreamed of her and this situation before.  And she had these other people with her who all conspired and slowly took advantage of me opening up to them, and ruined my life.  It was a scary dream, with anger and frustration.  I felt overwhelmed and out of control, I couldn't get rid of them."
"158"	"n/a"	"(06/12/1997 (#1)) I dreamed that Mom died.  Dad and me and one sister were in the front seat of a car, looking through the windshield, into the windows of a restaurant, and Mom had slumped over in the restaurant.  We knew that she had died.  We were all upset looking at her.  A little later this doctor came and he said he had to cut Mom's stomach out, like a liposuction or something, because she was too heavy to bury.  And I was looking at him start to cut into her, and I was thinking, ""She's not that heavy!"" and it certainly didn't warrant surgery or anything."
"159"	"n/a"	"(06/12/1997 (#2)) Second dream that night was about Utah and Thompson.  Old dilapidated buildings, grey weather, sad, wood stairs like up the back of the whorehouse ruin up in Thompson Canyon.  Felt like the whorehouse area, buildings falling apart.  We did things around there, can't remember."
"160"	"n/a"	"(06/12/1997 (#3)) Third dream - I asked Lynn if he was going to come out here to visit me and he said yes."
"161"	"(06/13/1997)"	"We were going through the move to the new office building with Amwest.  We all went to the new building, but actually many of the offices seemed like they were outside or in open air.  They were more separated office spaces, with wall or empty space in between, and uphills and downhills in between.  I had just hired Maria [as I did yesterday] , and I.S. (Information Services) had put my old computer in her space.  I went to her space, thinking it was mine, because my computer was there, but then realized it was Maria's office.  I found my new office space.  The new computer I.S. had put there had a huge monitor, huge screen, it was almost too big, more like a big TV.  It wasn't hooked up yet.  I realized I really wanted the space I had thought was mine (Maria's), down the hill, then I further realized that I would rather have Maria's job as well, instead of mine - less stress and responsibility.  All the employees were checking out the new space / building - we went into hallways and storage areas, I was looking for storage cupboards, and didn't really find any suitable.  It was still half-finished - insulation and dust and boards still around.  We checked out the bathrooms and showers, all the different rooms and meeting areas, a big amphitheater.  Then some of us were going up in this attic area.  There was an enormous waterbed up there, we knew it was Richard S's, the president's space, it was all set up like a big lounge or bedroom, nice furnishings and lighting.  This waterbed took up the size of a warehouse floor, it had to be 50 feet wide and long.  The waterbed was rolling up like waves and then rolling out like a big wave coming toward us at the wall.  Dad was there too, checking out this room.  We got smushed against the waterbed as it rolled into us, then it rolled back up again, then the next time it rolled to smush us, I ducked under it to avoid getting smushed, and went back downstairs.  We were shown to our new offices and then I had a different new office, not the private office I had earlier.  I was put in an upstairs office with no windows, there were 8 or 9 other employees and small desks in there too, and they were grouped in fours facing each other.  Mine was at the end by the wall.  I noticed I was working in bright fluorescent lights.  In fact it seemed extraordinarily, annoyingly bright and detailed.  I hated this but no one else seemed to mind.  We started working, and because of the desk setup, everyone was talking constantly to each other over the desks.  They were all loud and obnoxious.  The woman across from me in our group of four said something to all four of us, (the other two were men).  She was totally weird, the way she talked and the subject matter was inappropriate or too personal or insecure.  I was giving looks to the two other guys like, whoa, what is her deal, she was so weird, she made us all uncomfortable.  I couldn't work and was so annoyed, and felt betrayed because I had thought the other office was mine, by myself.  I realized I was in exactly the situation I had refused to be in.  I realized I had been promised and shown a private office, but then not gotten one.  At 12:00 lunch time or 5:00 quitting time, everyone got up at once and crowded together to get to the door or lunch.  I was amazed at how sheep-like they all were, and I just sat looking at them, at their backs crowding together, in amazement.  I could not work this way.  I went to the manager or boss, it looked like Nadine at FelCor (my previous law job for 8 months while in Texas).  But I knew that Barbara L (my awesome boss at FelCor) was the real boss over her, expecting Nadine would tell or call Barbara and get me moved.  I told her the work environment made it hard for me to work, and said everyone talks the whole time, I can't work in there.  She looked at me and said something like, yeah everyone has complaints, it's just like breathing.  I answered, well, breathe this: I quit.  Iwas quitting the job, but expected Barbara or someone to come and ask me to stay.  I went back to the upstairs office and waited for a bit.  No one came to talk about me staying, so I quit."
"162"	"(06/19/1997)"	"I was in a house with some other people.  It was better than that Utah drug feeling, but a little similar.  It was like that feeling before things got really bad with Disch and Dennis and Leah and Jerry and those guys, before we got out of hand.  It was like, before that, when we were still getting our work done, when people were still a little responsible.  At this house, everyone had their own projects, things going on they wanted to get done.  We liked being there.  There were three bathrooms in this house, it was really large, and there were different sections coming off.  It was a nice house, it was nicer than Disch's house, it was summery, we enjoyed being there.  We felt some freedom, from schedules.  We had our own things going, like we did in Utah.  I went to take a shower, or somebody was using the shower in one bathroom, I could hear the shower running standing outside the door, I stood there for some time trying to figure out what that sound was, so I went to use the other shower in the middle bathroom, in the very middle of the house, it seemed like it was right near the front entrance area.  Somewhere in the dream, there was something about me wearing my Utah ball cap, taking it off, and then deciding to put it back on, and wondering whether that was appropriate.  Also something about Jim L (co-worker, lawyer) and what an idiot he is, how he doesn't know how to do his work, how he gives us bad information.  Also something about some guy was asking me to do things, like sign things, papers and notes, it was like an assistant feeling, and it kind of felt like Richard B (my boss), although it wasn't really clear that it was him, it was just sort of that Richard B feeling.  And I liked assisting him and finding things for him, I knew where things were.  But something about after that shower, I was nude, and he'd ask me to do things, and I'd just go into the area with the desk, the room used as an office area, nude, and I'd find things for him, and I'd look up, and he'd seem kind of embarrassed, and I'd say - this doesn't bother you that I have no shirt on, does it?  My breasts were right there.  He kind of said no, but not really ""no"" (that sounds like Richard).  But I liked my body, and I liked sitting around nude in front of him, so I decided to go ahead, and besides I wasn't embarrassed at all, I'm not that modest.  When I woke up, I was thinking about getting in that shower, and there was this definite memory feeling of how irresponsible we were in Utah, Lynn and I, how with Lynn in my life, we just blew everything off.  We were so irresponsible, that real irresponsible feeling, blowing things off.  And I didn't like it, I really didn't like that feeling.  Because it was really a body memory, it wasn't like, oh remember how with Lynn you used to blow everything off, it was a cellular feeling of that memory, deep in me, and that it happened a lot, and got worse as time went on."
"163"	"n/a"	"(06/20/1997 (#1)) I dreamed of Julie F (one of my clients when I practiced law in Moab) and her youngest daughter.  I was looking at her and talking to her, telling her she looked just like Julie.  She did, only with a young, round chubby face.  Then I dreamed I knew how to fly a plane, and there was a small plane I took out and flew over fields.  The fields were grey or dead brown, like winter, it looked like Utah, near Cisco or Thompson, but didn't really feel like that.  Something about flying to Julie's house, hovering over her house, going inside for documents or something for our case, then going out and flying again.  I enjoyed flying a plane, I could be alone.  There was some freedom knowing I could go out to this plane, get in it, and fly it.  I think I wanted to take Lynn out flying in it.  I asked Dad if he minded that I was flying, and he did, it worried him."
"164"	"n/a"	"(06/20/1997 (#1)) I was in my house in Chatsworth.  It looked a little different, bigger, and two-story.  First someone had Risk come over to me and she asked Risk or showed Risk to kiss me.  Risk was so happy to see me.  She kissed my face greedily, licking me and then almost eating my face, biting my face with her whole mouth and licking me.  She missed me a lot, and kissed me like she couldn't get enough of me.  I was happy and it was wet and she kept kissing and noshing at my face.  I was kneeling down in front of her.  Then my middle sister interrupted us or wanted me to do something, and I was really pissed at her for interrupting and making Risk stop kissing me.  I told my middle sister to fuck off or something. [Interesting that Risk had to have permission to see me or be shown to me, it wasn't like Risk just came up to me on her own.]"
"165"	"n/a"	"(06/20/1997 (#2)) I was in my house doing things, seemed like unpacking or just being here.  Then I came home and Mike D (short-term boyfriend) had arranged a surprise party for me, and people were already arriving.  This house had more stories, it had staircases and other floors, more balconies or patio areas.  I was upset.  The house is still unpacked, there are boxes everywhere.  It's a mess, and besides, I thought I told Mike I do not like surprises.  Mike had cleaned up for hours before I got there.  He had just stuffed piles and boxes of stuff in closets or places, so it would be cleared out.  He did a good job, it did look better, but I was still upset, my stuff was all in different places.  I felt like I wanted to hide.  In fact, I did not even go to him or be with him during the whole party.  I went and hid in an upstairs bedroom, looking at all my stuff.  Some woman came in and was pulling out a drawer of my stuff, she was still cleaning and preparing for the party.  But the drawer just kept coming out and coming out, section after section, it made turns all the way out of the room, one big long drawer.  I told her to stop, put it back.  It seemed endless, hopeless, all the things I need to get in order.  Then there was a long involved series of being at different places, motel rooms, motel bathrooms, talking with others, walking on the street at night.  Going back and forth to different places, night.  Some guy was going to visit someone in prison or jail, and I wanted to go see him too.  The guy was discouraging it, he felt the jail would be rough, dangerous or upsetting to me, not a good place for me to visit.  I still wanted to go.  I was trying to put my hair up, I kept trying over and over to get it in a french twist that starts from the bottom, nape of neck, with the front part downward.  I wasn't happy with it every time I got it up, and took it out and started over, conscious that we needed to go, that the guy was waiting impatiently for me.  I realized I hadn't washed my hair, that if I went to jail with the guy we'd probably be there all day and it would just look gross by the end of the day.  I was in a large motel bathroom putting up my hair, and a couple came in like it was a public or lobby bathroom.  They noticed my personal items on a shelf and said, who's bathroom is this, or isn't this the lobby bathroom.  I said no, it's my room.]"
"166"	"(06/21/1997)"	"I am in an elevator, and realize it is broken and falling downward fast.  It goes past so many floors.  It is lit up inside.  I have time on the downfall to realize it will hit the bottom and I will die.  I am okay with this.  Partly it's knowing ahead of time, no surprises, that makes it okay with me.  Partly I am just okay with it, I've had enough life.  I am wondering when it will hit, it should be pretty soon.  I think about that kind of death, I'll get pretty smushed, but dead, so who cares.  Then I feel warmth, hot at the bottom and lower sides of the elevator.  It is a fire outside the box, the friction of the fall caused the fire, and I realize I will die by fire.  That is even better, it is humorous to me, after all the fires I was in while firefighting, to die by fire.  I like that better.  I am sort of waiting for death, the fire, to take me.  Then the elevator is pulled back up, or out.  I am saved, and not too happy about it.  I wait for whoever pulled it up to get me out, the elevator is glass or see-through now, they are taking so long, I see a girl through the glass and tell her please hurry, I'm getting claustrophobic in here.  And I am, the walls are right against me like a coffin, I feel like I am in a coffin standing upright, I am getting panicky feeling those walls around me, feel a need to get out quick."
"167"	"n/a"	"(06/27/1997 (#1)) I went on a retreat or to camp with others, seemed like Amwest employees.  Maria, the clerk I just hired, was there.  We got off a bus and were at this camp, for a couple weeks.  I was feeling good that there was other Latinos at this camp, so maybe Maria would meet someone.  It didn't happen, I felt like it was because she was too shy, but it was interesting I was trying to find her someone.  When we got back, I was inside the bus, and Jeff was outside, I could see him through the bus window.  It seemed like we were on a street in my childhood neighborhood, in Richardson.  Some big guy came over and picked Jeff up and made some comment about him being short or small, some dwarf reference, or some midget saying or voice.  I was incensed, so mad the guy would do this to Jeff.  Jeff gave the rest of us a look like, what the hell, why do guys do this to me, why all through my life do people have to make fun of me being short?  I felt really bad for him, but felt like there was little I could do."
"168"	"n/a"	"(06/27/1997 (#2)) Something about Mike (short-term boyfriend), configurations of being with him, something related to files, filing organization.  A comparison being made between being with Mike, how Mike is, and how files are organized, or how I do my filing, or the files at Amwest."
"169"	"n/a"	"(06/27/1997 (#3)) Later dream - Mike and I went up to a lookout above here, in the rocks.  We met two girls and I realized they were doing drugs.  I thought, now I can recognize if someone is on drugs.  It is easy to hide, but I could see a few signs that they were.  I thought, now I can tell, but I could see how you could conceal it, and no one could tell.  We talked with them about why they did drugs.  They gave many reasons.  We were on the rocks or walking about on the rocks."
"170"	"(07/03/1997)"	"I went with my oldest sister and a man, who felt like a new lover of mine, like Mike, that new.  And we went to a hotel, not to stay, we were doing something else there.  Something happened before we went to the hotel, or the motel, that prompted it, that made me need to do something at the motel.  So I went there with my oldest sister and this guy, and he looked kind of like Rick C (short-term housemate in Moab), but it was a new love, like Mike.  And I started getting really sick of them, I started not wanting to be around the guy.  It just wasn't right, it wasn't feeling matched up.  And then my oldest sister started being rude to me, she'd be snotty rude, and so when I got the chance I left them, and ditched them, went my own way.  I didn't tell them where I was going, I just ditched them.  And I went on these stairs, and so I was looking at my feet on the stairs, at that moment, going up the stairs.  And then I got myself into the end of the hallway stairwell, so that I was really hidden and I could get away from them, and they'd never find me, for a long time.  The motel was about five or six stories high and I was going to walk all the way up to the top.  So I was walking up this stairwell.  It was kind of an old motel, it wasn't all run down and gross, but it wasn't new or anything.  It had kind of a big feeling but it was kind of run down.  And so the stairs were concrete or metal, concrete, yeah concrete.  I got to a landing up near the top, near where they put stuff that's been . . . like a lost and found.  Or just, they put stuff that's been left there, forgotten. [I did go Wednesday to Thompson, and all the stuff I left in my cabin in Castle Valley was in that little wood house next to Lynn's motel.  it was really weird to see my stuff, my bath powder, lotion, very feminine stuff, my cactus.  It's been sitting in there over the WHOLE WINTER.] Anyway, I came to this landing, and there was stuff on a table, like an old table, it was all just sort of left there.  Part of it was employee stuff, for the motel.  Part of it was just stuff that had been left there.  And there were letters from Lynn, on the table.  Some of them were like the letters that he wrote about the oil field, to Spear and the sheriffs, those really rant and rave, you done me wrong and you'll pay, kind of letters.  And some of them had sweet things about me in them.  I mean, my name was in them, and I was reading them - realizing that information about me and my name, was out here, for anyone to see, it had been sitting out in this motel, and anybody could read about it.  It made me feel weird, sad, about the broken dreams.  Because there were sweet things in those letters.  And it was even more clear to me, or it is now, that it's not black and white, it never will be, I can't . . . .  I would love to be able to say he's an asshole, I'm glad I'm gone.  But it's not that black and white, and it never will be.  Then there were also these horrible letters on the table.  The lighting in this stairwell was kind of, it was like light from a high window coming through frosted glass.  Kind of like morning light.  And the feeling was that, there was something about this being the employee area, that I was going up to hide out with the employees."
"171"	"(07/08/1997)"	"I felt like someone was touching me, stroking parts of my body, and stroking my hair all night.  Felt like someone was in the room, walking, at one point.  I felt two women, one on either side of me in bed.  One was younger, one was older.  They were there to give me support and love and wisdom.  There was also a male in the room, further away, and shy or reluctant to come closer.  I felt this stroking all night, different parts of me, mostly my hair.  I kept wanting to wake up fully or discover what it was, but I also didn't want it to stop, it was so unusual."
"172"	"(07/09/1997)"	"I met up with Lynn again, way out in the country, down a bunch of switchbacks, in an old house.  There was the usual running around, nothing getting done, where is he, where are you, meeting up, trying to make things happen and they won't.  But at one point, Lynn and I were in a room, with another older man, and we were talking, and someone came to the window, he was looking in the window, and all of a sudden I felt this really sharp paralyzing pain hit me, as if from an invisible arrow.  And it was from the guy at the window.  I found out the older man in the room had also been hit, he had the exact same reaction I did, which was, you stiffen up, your knees bent, and you kind of half crumble.  The same thing happened to him.  It didn't happen to Lynn, though.  And I either felt resentful that I and the old man were the only ones hit, and Lynn, once again, got off scott-free.  Or I felt like Lynn was part of the scheme and he had ordered it or okayed it.  It was very desolate out there, it was like Utah, kind of sagebrushy and mountainy.  Not mountainy but hills and dirt roads.  And we were hiding out or running away, it was some plot thing, again. [God, I thought I was done with those.]"
"173"	"(07/11/1997)"	"I am in this house, a program for retarded people, and I go through the rooms, and all of them are doing drugs.  They have Downs syndrome, all ages, and the program has them doing drugs.  I think how weird, what kind of program is this.  Part of me thinks: that's what you turn into when you do drugs.  Then I am leaving California.  Like I had gotten Mondo [a coffee shop in Moab that I wanted to buy] , I'm packed and leaving.  I'm on the interstate, leaving town, I stop in a coffee shop, and some friends here come in to say goodbye.  I kind of wonder how they knew I would be here.  The coffee shop was really bright and happy, sunlight through the window, a 50's feeling about it, hopeful feelings, motivated and confident and happy about my future."
"174"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1997 (#1)) I have been recruited for some job.  I am walking with a general and another tall man.  First it seems like in a culvert  I know that Jeff is involved too.  I ask the general, ""do you know Jeff, the short man?"", and hold up my hand to my neck.  ""He is my ex-fiancé.""  The general says, ""well, you two will be living and working together on this project we're putting you on.""  I say, ""you're having us live together?  What if we have sex, how could we help it, as close as we are.  Aren't you concerned about that on the job?""  Then the general says to me, ""And the next time you talk about someone else, why don't you just look inside yourself, do some introspection, instead of comparing yourself to others, or comparing other people.""  He was chastising me.  Then we are all three in my kitchen here.  I go up beside the tall man, he is really tall, big, and bald, but nice.  I sort of jump up to him, his side, and he picks me up and swings me around playfully.  I realize how much I liked discovering I liked a tall, big man in Lynn.  How Lynn got me to really like that, not short men anymore, how he totally changed my desires in that area.  And got me over hangups in that area, expanded my likes, so that I loved his bigness, his maleness."
"175"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1997 (#2)) I am working with others at a job.  I recognize things from Amwest, but we are working in a big warehouse or blue collar surroundings, dirty, garage-like.  At one point I am thinking about stealing from them, there is money sitting out, but I don't want to right away.  I think, maybe later.  There is something about the computer drives, the g drive, I am telling someone the different drives.  I am not too happy here, frustrated or disgusted with the way things are run.  At the very end of the dream, I see this guy sitting at a table by a window, and a troll-like monster behind him is pulling his face around to the side with its claws.  It's really tearing into the flesh and pulling hard.  The skin is tearing away and blood is coming out.  The guy can't get away.  I'm looking and thinking the monster will just snap his head completely to the side and break the guy's neck.  I have no feelings about this except the monster should just finish it off."
"176"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1997 (#3)) I am at a fair booth, it is kind of a crummy fair.  The booth with the covering is empty, but to the side is a big old ship, or the front part of a ship.  I go in to see it, and start to get ideas about how to make this a business, how we could use the ship as a ride or attraction or something.  I walk back in to the booth part, and am looking around planning how to set it up and market it.  Then I look up to the top boards of the booth (they are decrepit) and wonder how much money I could make here.  I realize not very much, based on the fact that fair booth people I know about do not have very much money."
"177"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1997 (#4)) I am at a party or gathering of relatives and family friends.  It seems like I am a child.  It is an interesting party, I seem to remember being dressed up, or much planning beforehand, but I am not sure the purpose of the party, it doesn't seem too organized.  I am not familiar with the place, the house.  There are stairs, rooms.  There is some issue of flirtation or sex with a dark-haired man there.  I like him a lot, but there's something improper about it, either he is related to me, or because I am a child and he is an adult, or else he is already involved with someone.  I think he propositions me.  There was more.  Somewhere in here, I see a small ship, like the ship I saw at the fair booth, and I take it and hide it beside me or behind me, in a coat, on the car seat.  I want it and take it.  I want to play with it later, and I knew that I wanted to act out scenes, like with dolls and playthings, I feel a need to fantasize and act out these fantasies with dolls and items.  I am thinking about bondage, how I really liked that with Lynn, how when he did it he looked so intensely at my nude body, and I want to not only fantasize it, but act things out with toys, to see the whole thing from above."
"178"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1997 (#5)) Mom and I are out on a road in the country, there are big fields and cliffs around.  She is showing me the land she is going to buy.  It is attached to land they already have.  It is a big parcel, over a hundred acres I think.  We look at it, sort of sideways.  It has bright green grass, and a big drop-off or cliff.  It's in Texas, but much more cliffy than the farm.  I am not sure how I feel about this, either - why, you already have land, or envious, or just that there's something wrong about it, like where is dad, is he dead and that's why you're buying land.  I feel weird about it too because I am looking at it with my head sideways or maybe upside down, a strange perspective, not quite real.  And aware that we are on the road.  Some thought about that road, thinking Lynn is driving down it or something, because next I am in Utah.  I wonder how I got from Texas to Utah."
"179"	"n/a"	"(07/12/1997 (#6)) I go back to my room in the house on Park Road in Moab.  As I walk up the front step, I look down and remember Risk coming in the house this way, up this step, every day.  I miss her, and am sad.  I go in the house and straight back to my room.  Paula and someone are sitting in the living room, and I give them this little ""hi"" and keep going, I don't look directly at them.  I have some permission to go back there and get my stuff or clean it or something, so I don't worry about being allowed there.  I go in the room.  It is a little dark.  Same blue carpet and pink walls.  At first, it is empty.  The south (back) wall has no window in this dream, and there is writing on the wall.  I go read it.  At the top is written ""About Tara Collins"", in pencil and black marker or paint.  To the left and below this is a pencil drawing of my face, smiling.  I know it was drawn from a picture, I recognize the stance.  It is well-done.  There is another drawing of my face further left, not smiling.  Below that there are two photos of Lynn I have never seen before, pinned to the wall.  It is apparent to me that Lynn had been coming in there, or living in there after I left, and he had done this wall of me and us, like he missed me and was putting things up to remind him.  I look on the back of the pictures of him, and there is a sticker from a Colorado photo lab.  He was in Colorado after I left, I think to myself.  I look at his pictures.  They are of him outside, some activity or driving, spontaneous shots.  He looks happy in them.  I am entranced.  I miss him, looking at those photos.  The whole thing is weird, coming back in here and finding this recording and memorabilia of me and us, realizing he has been in here a lot after I left.  I am startled by it, but fascinated too.  This part is very vivid, highly focused, on the pictures.  I go to the closet and there are all these clothes of mine still in there.  The closet is on the east wall in this dream, like in the room next door, and it's a long closet.  I am a little shocked that this stuff was left, and start going through them, a sheepskin jacket, shorts, shirts.  I start pulling them out, I need to clear this room out, get all my stuff back.  Now there is a bed in the room, but it's head is on the north wall.  It is a big bed, nicer than the one I had.  I start putting clothes on the bed.  I feel how big a job I have, clearing out and cleaning this room.  I think maybe some of the clothes must be Lynn's.  The drawings and photos are still on the wall throughout the dream.  I have some of the same feelings I had (in reality) in that room, the room was very recognizable not only for how it looked but how I felt in there."
"180"	"(07/13/1997)"	"I am camping with my oldest sister, I think my middle sister, and Dad, in an area like Utah.  We have a big Winnebago-type trailer.  We are stopped for a rest or to camp.  My oldest sister and I go walking and pass back and forth beside this little lake, some people there.  Then we're back at the Winnebago.  There is nothing going on, or I am frustrated at the lack of activity.  I want to go running, and swimming in that lake, even though it was kind of dirty, I don't even care, I want to exert myself, do some physical activity.  There is some issue with locking the doors of the Winnebago.  I know Dad will want them locked, but he is inside a store or gas station.  I try to lock the big sliding door on the side and it won't stay locked.  I have the keys with me.  I tell my oldest sister I can't lock the side door.  I lock the front doors and go anyway, to run and swim.  I have on my firefighting clothes, and I am carrying things, the rest of my firefighting outfit, straps, and parcels, I am hoping to drop off on the way.  They are kind of bulky but I am determined that I can run with them anyway.  I come to a steep uphill, and I really push myself up it, running up it carrying all this stuff.  I am aware that people can see me, and that they recognize my fire clothes.  Near the top I am using my hands to pull myself up over the top.  I feel accomplishment pushing myself to run up it.  I can see the top edge of this hill/cliff close up, as I pull myself over it.  I come to a little house or restaurant.  There are people who know me here, from firefighting.  I go in to finish dressing, rearrange things, or drop off some of this stuff.  People recognize me and welcome me in, they remember me from firefighting, they say hey Tara the firefighter, it's you, how are you?  It is a good feeling, like in Moab, where people knew me for my accomplishments.  I go in a back bedroom to dress or change, so I can run better.  I'm going to run to that lake and swim.  This man who knows me from before sees me, he says hi, nice to see you again.  He lives there.  He now has two kids, one a baby, and he's looking after the baby.  He says I'm going to sing you a song, to welcome you back.  He starts to sing and play guitar in another bedroom, while watching the baby boy on the bed.  Their door is open.  I remember this man, before when I knew him when I lived there, he had liked me or had a crush on me.  So I'm thinking, whatever, and I keep on dressing and arranging my clothes.  I'm a little put off by his acts because tho he used to like me, now he's got kids and a wife, so why is he paying me any attention.  I think he shouldn't.  I just ignore him.  He sees I'm not paying attention, so he comes in the room where I am, and lays down on the bed.  He is watching something on TV.  On TV is a guy who throws out the food his wife has prepared for him in this creative way, where the food runs down little tracks to the dogs outside the door.  The guy beside me comments on it, something like, yeah I did that too, isn't that clever.  At the same time I'm thinking 'what a jerk' about the guy on TV.  I don't say anything.  I am now adjusting straps on my clothes, my fire clothes, around my waist and hips, and I am tucking in shirt ends.  I am laying down.  I am pulling the straps, and tugging them tighter around my hips, pulling the catches.  It reminds me of climbing straps, but also of the Uluri, the way it tugs around my waist.  I am hot and thinking about running, getting high on endorphins, and then swimming in that Utah lake.  Something about tugging those straps and thinking about swimming in water gets me really turned on, I get close to orgasm.  Maybe something also about this guy laying next to me in bed, even tho I don't care about him, still it's a guy in bed next to me, and it's turning me on.  I want to come, the orgasm is close, I feel it, but I don't want to with this guy there."
"181"	"(07/14/1997)"	"[Visions while going to sleep.  Before going to sleep, had been reading Seth, and I had asked for a past-life regression or past-life vision.] First - I saw two big elephants coming toward me, at night, along a pathway.  It was as if I was crouched down in the jungle, watching the elephants come toward me, and their eyes were tiny green lights.  Second - I knew I was in South America.  I was a South American Indian, with the black hair, with the bowl cut, and I was holding a young South American Indian child, with my arms around its torso.  The child was about eight, and I felt, something felt like it was dying, it was about to die."
"182"	"(07/23/1997)"	"I am being told about a trail that leads out of Moab, north of town.  I am being shown this trail, from the air.  I can see the cliffs around town, and there is a trail that everyone takes and knows about north of town that I see below me.  But I am being told about another trail, a really cool trail, that it is called Water Canyon, that is less known.  Someone and I are talking about it, how to get there, how to find the trailhead.  I am given directions to it, and then shown it from the air, high above Moab.  It does lead out north of town, but where the main trail goes to the right, this Water Canyon trail goes off to the left, and then straight up a very steep hill, over the top edge of the cliff.  I can see the whole trail from the air.  I am most fascinated with the part that leads over that lip edge at the top.  I follow it with my eyes, over that edge.  I can feel what it would feel like to get up over that edge.  I also dreamed of a mountain lion, I could see his mouth, and face, close up."
"183"	"n/a"	"(07/24/1997 (#1)) Not a very clear dream.  I was at a conference with two bosses and other people, co-workers.  Felt like a hotel or a boat.  I was not happy, there was some issue of hierarchy that was bugging me, or people were dissing me or leaving me out.  I felt out of place.  But when I thought of my own individuality, apart from them, I still saw humor and playfulness.  I was sitting at a table with the two bosses, and trying to rearrange my chair or the chairs at the table.  I felt like they disapproved of me or thought a woman shouldn't be there.  I bumped my head on the umbrella or the pole in the middle of the table, trying to rearrange it.  I moved the umbrella up or expanded it outward and tilted it to get it out of the way, I was frustrated and feeling self-conscious, not wanting to be there.  Also in this dream I craved chocolate."
"184"	"n/a"	"(07/24/1997 (#2)) Another dream was a man with a swimsuit, speedo type, and the crotch had a hole cut out of it, with rib supports to keep it in place there.  He had no genitals, he was sexless, and it made me think a woman's swimsuit could be made with a hole cut out like that.  I reviewed the marketing potential, let my mind play around with the concept, the design and target buyers.  The hole was oval shaped, for sex.  Upon waking I realized it was a totally unmarketable idea.  There is already lingerie like that, and who would want a swimsuit like that?  But interesting that I was marketing in my sleep, going over the marketing possibilities."
"185"	"(07/27/1997)"	"Dreams about controlling things too much, taking on responsibilities, stressful.  Trying to control the outcomes of things, I should just trust that the universe provides and let go control.  I was grinding my teeth all night.  Then - parking at the street of my childhood home.  I was supposed to park down the alley at the neighbors', but they were full. I was in the Bronco (my parents' vehicle).  Jack Nicholson was there.  So I went to our house, frustrated, and told Dad I really wanted a doughnut, could I go get one.  He agreed, I think he wanted one too.  I went to get some, and Jennifer was there at the store/cafe.  But she was choosing a bagel with onions and cream cheese, and I thought that would be better.  We were spending so much time picking the ingredients and critiquing the bread and choices, it was way too self absorbed and picky, I thought, just order something, does it really matter this much?  If only I gave this much attention to my other big choices in life.  Something about choosing not-sweet food instead of sweet, but the dairy was an issue."
"186"	"(07/31/1997)"	"I dreamed I got a dog.  And I loved getting that dog.  I was really glad about that.  And I was at like a family reunion, Uncle Larry was there, and my cousin Amy, and Dad and my sisters.  There was something about cleaning the house, and I opened up my little vacuum cleaner that I have, and inside were these big beetles, like big ball-shaped Utah-type beetles, like the ones that roll the poop around, inside, and they were still even a little alive.  And I remembered vacuuming them up in Utah, and I talked with Dad about doing that.  We were both surprised that they were still alive.  This dog was white or light-colored, smaller than Risk, and more curly-haired, younger."
"187"	"(08/06/1997)"	"Driving, traveling across country, in a desert area.  Felt like I was moving, but I didn't have much in the truck.  Felt like near El Paso or Carlsbad.  Then I passed out or blanked out and my truck was taken.  All my stuff was put into another vehicle.  When I became aware, I was in the back of another truck with two guys,  someone else was driving, and all my stuff was there like it had been in my truck, set up the same way.  The guys were leaning against thin mattresses propped up against the side just like I had them in my truck.  It was okay.  But I was pissed my truck had been taken.  I was just trying to figure out where we were, a way to solve this.  Then the two guys were gone.  I went up front, made the driver tell me where we were.  I think I looked at a map.  I asked him or told him to get out and he did, kind of sheepish.  It was kind of accepted that I was entitled to take over this vehicle since my truck was taken, or they had taken my truck.  I was then pedaling this vehicle, it was a struggle, hard work, and I was thinking how could I ever get across this whole area by pedaling.  I missed my truck.  I stopped or slowed down to let Risk out.  A Latino guy came beside the vehicle, put his hand on my breast.  He was nice, he said ""perro"" to Risk, and a whole sentence in Spanish.  I stopped.  I let Risk out.  I found an old, sort of antique cello in the back of the vehicle.  I talked with the guy about selling it for cash, we sort of hooked up together in some manner to make cash.  He understood pawning, and knew how to make quick cash.  He told me the cello's value, what we could probably get for it.  A partnership was possible with him, traveling and making cash."
"188"	"(08/10/1997)"	"[The night before my middle sister called and wanted to come stay with me for a while. Also, although I was in a relationship with Mark, I had been getting to know another guy, Scott, online.] I was preparing for Barbara M's wedding (my best friend in early childhood).  So much to do, clean.  I wasn't ready.  It was at my parents' country property, in a long meadow.  It felt like Risk was nearby.  My middle sister or someone said, wow, it's about to start, how exciting.  I'm like - no, I'm still not ready, not set up yet.  But we started anyway, time to start.  I was to accompany Barbara down the aisle.  Not like giving her away, but like maid of honor.  I was chewing gum and just before I went to walk down the aisle, I threw it at my middle sister's feet, smiling at her like joking:  I had to put it somewhere, couldn't go down the aisle chewing gum.  Barbara was so nonchalant.  Like this was her second marriage.  The first wedding she tried too hard, fancy stuff, image was important, so this one was more real, and more casual.  She was wearing a hippie-bandanna, an old worn print wrap skirt, totally slobbed out, but really happy, chattery.  She talks to me all the way down the aisle, which feels weird during her wedding.  She tells a long involved story about Popeye and Olive Oil and tenant/landlord problems.  I am aware of people watching us talking, a long walk at the property down this meadow.  I realize this is a really long story she will tell, will it end before we get to the end of the aisle?  "
"189"	"n/a"	"(08/16/1997 (#1)) I was trying to do a raven call laying down.  It was harder that way.  I felt like if I could do it, I would be rewarded.  I laid down and tried it in different positions."
"190"	"n/a"	"(08/16/1997 (#2)) Driving home from work late.  There was a side road into a tunnel, a place I always almost miss, or always take the wrong turn.  I start to lose control, trying to turn too late, went up the left side of the road or tunnel, overcompensated, went up the right side.  Through this I thought, I might die now.  I didn't want to die but wondered about it, making the choice at that point about whether I wanted to die, or had survival instinct."
"191"	"(08/17/1997)"	"I was in a group setting, a dorm or crew or extended seminar, big dorm-like building.  I was working on my computer, and I didn't want to stop.  I was enjoying myself.  Later - Bill M was there [another lawyer at work, not a love interest] I thought I saw him with another girl.  We'd been together earlier in the dream.  But no, he wasn't.  Us being together was kind of a secret.  I went up a hill to a main area to do something quick, I didn't want to eat dinner yet like everyone else was, it was crowded, and I wanted my computer.  I went back down, then I was jumping going downhill, jumping up high, using my body, I did a flip, and a roll, playful and talented.  I was remembering meals, like with the fire crew.  I wanted to get back to my computer.  I went all the way down the hill, to a basement, like that was the way back to my room.  It was very dark, I could barely see.  I knew there was a sliding glass door, I put my hands out in front of me to feel it coming up since I couldn't see it.  It was so dark, but not scary.  I found it and went in, up some stairs.  It felt like that Lynn-feeling, Thompson, Utah, the empty house he wanted to buy, that he took me to in Grand Junction."
"192"	"(08/23/1997)"	"I escaped from being detained somewhere, people trying to hold me captive, not clear.  I ran away when I got the opportunity, and they gave chase.  But they were not prepared, and scrambled to get up and chase.  I was quick, and found ways around and through halls, shiny metal, and outside, and ducked them.  I ran across streets, and saw a health club.  I went in there.  It was a really ritzy health club, very nice.  I went in the women's dressing/shower room, and figured I could stay there, that they would not find me there.  Plus it had showers and beds, everything I would need to stay for a while.  This dressing room had beds, and at the back different rooms with doors, very fixed up and nice.  There were people in there socializing, men too, like it was a coed dressing room.  I decided to stay in one of the back rooms for a while, there were two or three beds and people there.  After a while I knew some of the people, and we would talk.  One night, I was with them, and among them was with a man who was my friend.  A girl came over to us, a very mean girl, she had high heels on, and she did something to this man who was my friend.  I couldn't see exactly what she was doing, but the man was obviously being hurt, he was like paralyzed or convulsing, but rather still, and it looked like she was stepping on his throat with her high heel.  She left, uncaring.  I immediately went to him, and looked at his throat.  I had to part the black hair of his beard to see, and there was blood slowly coming out his throat.  I couldn't really see what she had done, but I figured it was bad.  I took his face in my hands, held his head, and looked in his eyes, almost panicked now, saying his name -""Gabe, Gabe"", over and over.  I was really scared he would die.  I asked him, should I call 911, and his eyes said yes.  What struck me at this point was that the man and I had been friends, but the way I felt about him now was more.  I realized I had been saying we were friends, but that there was much more to it, that I was not admitting to myself or to him how much I really loved him.  I mean I really loved him, wanted him to be mine, and would despair if he died or was really hurt.  It was such a change from what I had believed we were - just friends, this tragedy was like showing me that I wanted more, that I loved him, and I should stop kidding myself about it, go for it all the way, allow myself to feel all those feelings fully.  The man was Jewish, very small.  He had qualities like all the men I've ever been with.  He was like a combination of all my past men.  I rushed to get to a phone.  At this point, we were in a house, but not our house, a friend's house, other people were there, a big house.  Kind of like where people came and went, gathered to meet and party.  I was not familiar with it, did not know where the phones or light switches were.  I finally found a phone, but it was like a little credit card, and I couldn't figure out how it worked.  I was frustrated and struggling to get it to dial.  It had no keypad, no numbers.  Everything in this house was new technology.  I went looking for another phone.  When I couldn't figure out the first phone, I went back and got Gabe and put him on my back, so I could keep watch over him and care for him while I got help.  He was so small that he could fit and ride on my back easily.  I wanted him close to me.  His head was slumped on my neck, and I walked stooped over, to keep him comfortable there.  I was very conscious of standing up straight, because he was there on my back and it would change his position.  I thought him being face-down might be bad, that I should turn him over to help stop the blood, but I really wanted him with me so I could watch over him all the while.  Every once in a while, I would call his name, ask if he was okay.  He would answer a little mmm hmm, or a soft word back.  He was almost unconscious.  I really wanted to care for him, like that feeling with Risk, taking care of someone.  I checked on him and kept him close to me.  I couldn't find any phones in this house.  I asked another woman there, and she was so unconcerned, like ""whatever"", she wouldn't tell me.  I found another phone, it was a card like the first.  But somehow I called, and right after that, the emergency people came for Gabe.  I was relieved when they walked in so quick.  They all wore different colored uniforms.  It was pitch dark in the house.  They walked in, surprised it was dark.  I was right there with Gabe on my back, he was almost passed out by now, and I said, ""I'm right here.  I don't live here, I don't know where the lights are.""  First they were surprised and cautious, it was so dark in there.  They took Gabe and checked him.  It was serious but he would be okay, they said.  Then I left.  I was going home in the Jeep, with two other women with me up front.  I drove up a windy mountain road.  The accelerator stuck on the jeep, like it used to, and I braked, but it still stuck.  I reached down to unstick it like I used to, punched it, nothing worked.  It was accelerating on its own, and braking wasn't slowing it down.  I kept hitting the brakes.  I started to go off to the right, almost hit a sign, and swerved to the left, overcompensating.  It was getting more out of control.  I said to my passengers, ""I should just stop"", and right then, we swerved off the road on the left.  We went over the side of the road.  I looked to see if it was just a ditch, what was ahead, and as the jeep went over, I saw the huge bottomless canyon below us, and the Jeep drove off into it.  It was thousands of feet deep, a narrow deep gorge, the walls smooth Utah rock.  I knew I would die.  Although shocked, I was okay with that.  I just figured I would die now.  I felt bad for my passengers, though, since they probably did not want to die.  I knew the impact would be horrible, but figured I would die now, before we hit bottom.  I started to die, I felt myself slipping from this world, blacking out and moving on to something else.  I looked for the light, to go toward it, and there were some faint white lights in front of me.  I wondered which one to go toward.  I told myself to just go toward the light, and just then, the whole scene in front of me turned into millions of colored lights, bright, intense, and all different colors.  It filled my whole vision, infinity.  I woke up.  Also either before or after this dream, was a dream about pink sunsets and clouds, the pink light going behind clouds, lighting up a cloud from behind, and watching it do that several times."
"193"	"(08/24/1997)"	"I was saying things or hearing sentences, and after each one, I heard Scott's voice answering back, calming and slow.  It was nice to hear."
"194"	"(08/27/1997)"	"I was working as a new employee in a convenience store.  I was to get a raise, $900, this info came from one boss at a little party or meeting late at night.  I offered them all four water or beverages.  Undressed?  Flirting?  But the other boss had not intended to offer me that much, he offered $700, he was mad about the first giving me a raise.  I went to clean up spills, to make the place neat and clean."
"195"	"(09/01/1997)"	"I have to go somewhere, school.  Putting together furniture - an old familiar piece, little drawers, an antique, with my middle sister and Dad.  We knew this piece from long ago.  I'm running late, but I want to take the furniture with us.  It was like I discovered it up in an upstairs room, rediscovered it.  I went to the ocean with Risk.  I knew she was sick or would die soon.  I knew she had already died in this dream, but in the dream, she had come back to life.  We went swimming in the ocean.  I looked over and she was passing out and sinking in the ocean, her head going under.  I swam over and got her, picked her up, and carried her out onto the beach.  I was worried, I wanted to resuscitate her, but didn't know how, just kept wishing and telling her to breathe again.  I thought wishing and telling her, the power of my love and want, would bring her back.  About then I was wondering about how she'd already died in December and that she was back, how odd that was.  Like: then how do we ever know if anyone is dead, if they can come back to life.  I was holding her in my arms walking up the beach.  A boy came over, bugging me.  I told him meanly twice - ""go away.""  I wanted to be alone with her.  She was heavy.  I wanted to sit down with her in my lap on the sand, try to get her back to life, but I knew it was too late.  It had been too long since she stopped breathing.  I sank to the sand with her, held her close.  I loved holding her close, her body.  The love I felt between us, even with that pain, absolute fulfilling love for her, was almost sweet.  Although I was heartbroken and distraught about her death, there was something calm and sweet about the fullness and intensity of love I could feel for her.  The capacity of it even in this sad time, was incredible and I loved loving her and caring for her.   I thought about the wiseness of taking her swimming when she was sick.  But I knew she'd want to go to the limit with me, just like in Utah, no matter what.  Large feelings of taking care of her, she was my child, her depending on me.  Nice burden.  A welcome burden."
"196"	"n/a"	"(09/26/1997 (#1)) I was at a legal conference with people from my law firm.  I was getting increasingly uncaring about my role and obligations there.  I was late one day, like an hour or two, really late.  Just didn't care.  Was more concerned about being happy, carefree, or feeling joy.  We met in a large conference room, like at a hotel.  I'd play around getting ready in the hotel room, and be late, but I also felt increasingly free from it all.  At one point, I was in a conference room as everyone was leaving and clearing out.  Mom was there, and I had a desire to go to the piano and play it.  Started toward it, but decided against it, too many people still watching.  I was interested in how they cleared out this room, for the next function or something."
"197"	"n/a"	"(09/26/1997 (#2)) Several ongoing things about Mondo [the coffee house I wanted to buy in Moab] .  I was there, and it was an older and poorer place than it really is, more run-down and yucky.  I met with the owners, talked about the place.  I was looking at the lighting, to figure out how to change it, it was fluorescent.  And there was a whole back area, with wood tables, an extra room, which I hadn't known about.  At one point I was late for something there, stressed about getting there, also trying to find Mondo in the car with my middle sister, but we were on highways like in Dallas.  Also looking for something in my purse which was messy. "
"198"	"n/a"	"(09/27/1997 (#1)) I dreamed I fell asleep at my desk at my office, although it looked different, more home-like.  I was partly nude, and I knew my underwear and leg was showing, but I kind of wanted that.  I felt bold and teasing.  I knew someone might come in and see me, although it was night in the office.  I was half-asleep, wanting a sexual fantasy.  I imagined part of it, even felt my sheet being pulled slowly off me.  I was surprised, and even woke up a little, because my hand had not moved to do that.  "
"199"	"n/a"	"(09/27/1997 (#2)) I was in a downtown area, a little lost.  I wanted to see homeless living areas or abandoned buildings.  I got on a downtown bus, not knowing where I was going, went to the bus depot or turnaround.  It was also a Goodwill center.   I was walking away then, and a man asked me for assistance.  I told him the Goodwill center is right there, just up ahead.  He seemed glad for the direction.  I kept walking.  I passed an out-of-business restaurant, for sale.  It was pretty cool, a garden patio area entrance, an upstairs, wood, quaint.  There was a sign there about the windows, the garden patio.  I was interested and wanted to check it out, it was empty and sort of abandoned, but I didn't want Mondo people to know I was showing interest in another place.  They might think I had given up on their place.  I went to the place I was buying, another restaurant type place, but doing business.  People (women) were there to pick up surfing equipment, booties, and the owner was there helping hand them out.  I think - what a good idea.  It was part of the purchase, to get a day's rental of surfing equipment, people knew this.  I get more acquainted with the place, the people, the stream and flow there.  I was content with this place, looking forward to having it be mine."
"200"	"n/a"	"(09/27/1997 (#3)) I knew a waiter guy, he was really cute, handsome.  I was attracted to him, quite a bit, like I felt with Richard or Rob.  I wanted him to be mine, but was so attracted I was a bit self-conscious or insecure, or felt like I would never get him.  He was very appealing, in looks and personality, someone everyone would get a crush on.  He was a little older than me.  He seemed not to be making it, overloaded with work, or frustrated at his position or making no progress or something.  Or like he was capable of so much more.  I really wanted him, wanted to make him happy.  I was wondering what kind of block or limitation makes such a great guy lose out on life.  I was at his work, and some girl mentioned he had six tables, like that was a lot.  I wanted to help him with that, or get him out of this work.  Then he and I had a date, I was happy sitting beside him in a nice restaurant.  Then he was hiking through deep snow in the winter with another guy.  He said ""I am so fucking cold.""  I came to him and said,  ""I have your cups and your gloves, right here.  Here let me put the cups in your pack.""  (They were plastic.)  I did.  Then I asked if he wanted his gloves, and I slid them on his hands, one at a time.  I loved helping him out, getting him the thing he needed most right then, making him warmer.  He was really appreciative of the gloves, that I had them for him.  Then he was a teacher.  I think he had us write essays."
"201"	"(10/02/1997)"	"[I stepped on a scorpion in my house a few nights earlier. It did not sting me, but I killed it when I stepped on it, and I felt really bad about that.] Dream:  I was shown the scorpion I stepped on, up closer.  I could see exactly where I had stepped on it, it's body, where the poison came out, more detail  There was more explanation about how it died.  I was with some people.  Something about the place reminded me of the Escalante River Canyons and Mondo.  We were showing each other things.  One person had a large shirt on, and on the back was stuff about Ed Abbey, maybe even his actual signature.  Some slight feeling about selling these shirts at Mondo."
"202"	"(10/02/1997)"	"I went to the Ralph's on Topanga, because I like that store better.  And I left my purse in the grocery basket.  I was looking for something, and I remembered my purse was there unprotected, so I went back, and it was gone, and I looked up and this guy was walking off with it, quickly.  So I said stop, that's my purse, and it was like I couldn't yell loud enough, I was blocked or inhibited from yelling as loud as I needed to.  A male guard (round, heavy) saw me, and shouted to another guard up toward the front, because the guy was already running out the door.  And a few minutes later they brought the guy back in with my purse, actually they brought him in by dragging him in with my purse strap around his neck.  I thought at first the front guard who had caught the guy was male, but it was a female, I found out later.  This was revealed to me later slowly and gradually, by little clues.  She was just a really large female who looked like a male, and she kept having to lay down or sit down against a back wall by the back stairs leading down, like she was pregnant or sick or something.  She'd comment on her condition, kind of laughing.  The other guards already knew she was pregnant or sick.  I was embarrassed for having assumed she was male at first, but I didn't ever let her know.  It was only a surprise to me.  Then they asked me if I could appear in court, did I want the fast track or a full trial, and I said well, the fast track I guess (since I'm moving).  They were explaining some procedures or paperwork or the court system.  I said I am an attorney, and that didn't seem to make any impression on them, almost like they didn't hear me.  When I told them that, I was standing looking down at the female guard as she was laying down against the wall, so I was almost leaning over her, or talking to her from above.  Then they wanted to give me gifts, for going through this theft, and to celebrate having caught the guy.  It was like their store procedure, when this happened.  And what they had to choose from, they brought out 2 big firefighter shirts, and asked did I want one.  I said, wow I used to be a firefighter, I'd love one of those.  They had the old kind and the new kind, and I picked the new kind because it's a better material.  It was all stained and messy, but clean.  Way too big for me.  Then they cleaned off my purse, because the guy had bled from a cut on his throat on the strap.  I think they took it downstairs to clean it off.  And I was really grateful they had caught him."
"203"	"(10/03/1997)"	"I had moved back to Moab.  As I drove and walked around the streets I knew so well, people came up to me and greeted me and welcomed me back.  Even people whom I could not remember their names, knew my name.  I was surprised people remembered who I was.  It was a good feeling, feeling missed and welcomed back, familiar, a homecoming.  I recognized the streets.  I remember going to a convenience store, parking, going inside, getting things.  I knew this place, it was familiar, even where I parked."
"204"	"(10/04/1997)"	"I was in my office at Amwest, almost like living in there.  It was bigger, I spent a lot of time there, nights and days, I knew it well.  Sometimes it was bedroom-like.  I knew it was part of a bigger place, but it was my room.  I went over the dimensions, comparing it to some room that Lynn and I had, or my house outside of Tucson, like measuring it visually, then saying, yes, it's the same size, or smaller in width, as my bedroom in Tucson.  When I measured it, it had a bed.  Most of the time it had my desk.  Something about a closet in there too, or a dress, can't remember now.  Main thing was I really checked it out, was aware of every part of it, including how it made me feel.  I liked it, I was comfortable and felt good in there.  It was my place in a part of a bigger place, and something about that feeling reminded me of Lynn.  Although I was comfortable and liked it, there was something weird about it.  I felt almost hidden back in there, my little world, knowing and understanding it well, all it meant to me, but not venturing out to the rest of the bigger place.  Or feeling not allowed to venture out of that place, like I was supposed to stay in there.  Diane (a legal secretary there) came in and said, you have to pick what hours you will be working, 7:30 to 4:30, or 8 to 5, or 8:30 to 5:30.  I was like, what the fuck, I'm leaving (quitting), what does it matter now?  I told her this.  She understood, but it was policy, she had to get my hours.  I picked 8:30 to 5:30, knowing how utterly ridiculous that was, and that I wouldn't stick to set hours anyway.  I felt a little invaded, it was my room, now there were restrictions coming in.  I wanted her to leave because her presence ruined what the room was to me, the feelings I had developed in there.  I knew I had to leave soon and I think I was sad or upset about having to move, not about leaving Amwest, but just moving again in general, that upset to my life and what I've built up, although this was not clear.  Diane was explaining something about policy or me leaving, getting me to understand something, and she uncovered the desk top, and drew a large figure on there, seemed like a woman, across the whole width of the desk.  At first I was shocked and mad, like, don't draw on the desk wood, but then I realized there were already drawings all over it, she was just adding to or drawing over the existing ones, so it didn't matter.  It seemed, or was suggested, that the prior drawings were done by Jim L (an attorney there).  It was humorous that I felt so much propriety toward my desk at Amwest.  Then something she said further about the drawing, or I realizing that I was leaving, made it really not matter.  There was some transition to the my childhood home.  My family was there, we were in the kitchen by the door and formica table.  Mom had said casually, there is some cake if anyone wants some.  They were two sponge cakes on the table, loaf type, one was lemon, and one darker, maybe chocolate or raisin.  I took a piece of the lemon and it started dissolving right in the bowl.  Like it had no substance at all.  As soon as you cut a piece, it dissolved away, disappeared.  The darker one did too, but much slower.  I thought this was strange and alarming.  You couldn't keep it material, and you certainly couldn't eat it.  At another point, I went to investigate the reasons for this dissolving, I wanted to get to the bottom of this.  I went to the side of the table near the tall windows, there was a cake there.  I tried to take a piece of the lemon cake real quick, to catch it before it dissolved, but it dissolved too, as soon as I cut it, separated it from the cake, and put it on a fork, although not as fast as the first one.  It seemed defective.  I never did figure it out, but I think I told Mom.  Also, there was some feeling when I took the piece real quick about compulsiveness about eating, especially with unhealthy foods.  The way I took it, was almost secretive or compulsive.  Then Thor (our dog in my childhood) came to me so I got down in front of him on his level on the floor.  There was something Dad and I couldn't quite decide:  if this was Thor or Risk, but it seemed like Thor.  His beautiful black lab head and ears were right there.  He was really happy to see me and we hugged each other back and forth.  He hugged me too.  I would reach out and hug him, and he'd reach back and hug me.  I almost felt like I was back with Risk and I loved it.  As we hugged, I was getting thoughts from him telepathically.  Then slowly they turned into a voice speaking to me.  I suddenly realized my dog was actually speaking to me.  No one else could hear it, but it was Thor speaking to me, in my head, more than just the thoughts as I'd felt earlier.  They were reassuring, comforting sentences, telling me things were okay, and what to do at this time.  He'd look at me between hugs as he spoke to me in my head.  I felt really good, really cared for, loved.  When I realized he was speaking to me, I started responding out loud, with Yes, All right, sure, Okay, after his sentences.  I was vaguely aware that my family was observing and that they thought it was odd, but I knew they could tell I was hearing him speak, and that I was answering him.  Then I realized Thor's voice was Scott's voice.  The tone and accent were unmistakably Scott.  I woke up with Scott's voice in my head, not able to decide if the words were from Thor using Scott's voice, or from Scott using the body of Thor."
"205"	"(10/04/1997)"	"I was camping or on an outing with my oldest sister and Dad.  We were in a big flat field, and had a van or Volkswagen bus.  There were high mountains to the left.  Dad left.  My oldest sister and I were in the van.  It was getting near night and we were going to sleep there.  I looked outside to the left and from over the mountains it looked like a storm was coming in, clouds were there, we felt it was a big snowstorm.  I thought it was pretty, that scene of the mountains, sky and clouds at sundown.  Then as we watched, a huge glob of snow came out of the sky from the left and splattered right on the van.  It hit really hard, we could feel and hear the impact.  We got a little anxious.  Then another bigger glob came hurling out of the sky.  We could watch these globs come right at us, the rest of the sky was empty.  They each fell right on the van and around us.  The big snow globs came hurling all the way across the sky to hit, splatter and cover us, like they had us as a target.  I never saw one hit anywhere else.  It wasn't like a snowstorm, with snow everywhere.  It was individual, separate globs of snow that you could watch.  Then one big one came, accompanied by wind or such huge force that it knocked the van over, so that it was half way on its side, leaning diagonally, not completely on its side, but enough for us now to be really worried.  We kind of knew, watching that one coming, that it was stronger and would probably knock the van over, we weren't sure how far it would go.  I think it stopped falling over halfway because of the snow holding it up on the other side.  At this point I had an aerial view of the van tilted over in the field, being covered by snow.  I felt like I needed a better view, because the windows were covered with snow so I couldn't see outside.  From the outside it looked like a van, from the inside it looked like a Volkswagen bus.  Another big glob of snow was hurled, it hit with impact and covered us.  Now inside the van, I showed my oldest sister how we could open the windows and kick or hit the screens to pop the snow off, like you would do inside a tent.  I wanted to keep at least a little tunnel out.  We were becoming completely covered.  Since the windows faced up now, I was trying to pop off the snow upwards.  My oldest sister was trying to figure out some other way to get us uncovered.  We did not want to get out of the van, it would have been more dangerous to be exposed to that force.  And it was obviously incredibly cold out now.  But the van was becoming buried, we were feeling claustrophobia creeping in.  I had a thought that Dad was supposed to come back in the morning, or that he knew where we were, so he could always get us uncovered somehow.  There were feelings that maybe we were stuck and would be buried alive, but also feelings that it was temporary and we would get out.  There was a feeling that the snow had a  force or will of its own, like an intelligent force of nature, targeting us, and hurling like that.  I was in Wisconsin with Rob at his house.  Rob had finally decided he wanted to be with me, and I had gone up there.  I was glad about this.  His house was different, more small rooms, more domestic, not so wide open (as it really is).  Rob himself was a lot more domestic.  He was doing dishes and stuff, I think he said to help me out.  Or he asked me what else can I do to help you out.  This surprised me, I think I said, nothing, you don't need to help me out.  There were views of cups, Rob doing things, and the house, Rob and I there together.  I was glad to be with Rob, but still had nagging insecurities about it and us.  I was not secure in our love.  Then it came near night and I realized we were both staying up later and later simply because I didn't know where I was supposed to sleep.  He hadn't told me, and I was just waiting for some direction.  But it was late, so finally I asked him, somewhat embarrassed, where would you like me to sleep?  Then I said, I can sleep out here in the back yard, camp out, because it's nice out tonight, even though last night there was a huge snowstorm on the van.  He said, well I only have a single bed, we wouldn't both fit in it.  I saw his bed.  Then he either left it up to me, or showed me another bed in another room or another house where I could sleep.  I think the other room seemed scrappy or older, unfinished, or stuff around, not clear.  This perplexed me.  If Rob and I were now together as a couple, why was I sleeping in another area from him?  Almost like he wasn't sincere about us as a couple, or he still had some doubts about it.  And I wondered why we couldn't share the single bed anyway, even though it would be tight."
"206"	"(10/09/1997)"	"I was staying in Scott's house, it was empty.  He had left, and I was staying there.  I knew someone had come in, there were sounds.  This frightened me.  I looked out the window, close up to the glass.  It was dark night out.  The next night, a guy came in the window.  Then more came in.  They were going to be squatters in this abandoned house.  I told them to get out, they just smiled.  The guys were like Lynn's drug friends, they looked scrungy.  Risk was there.  I petted her a certain way, she really liked it, she sank down slowly into my lap.  I held her there in my lap, petting her.  Her face looked different, much smaller, whiter, grey hairs.  I kept looking more and more at her face.  I wondered if it was really Risk my dog or some imposter."
"207"	"(10/10/1997)"	"First, I was laying by a cliff or slot canyon with a guy, maybe Scott, we were making out on a rock, laying down with our feet toward the drop-off.  It looked just like the Moab area.  A mountain biker rode up toward us on the other side of the chasm.  I think he had sunglasses on.  He motioned to us or spoke to us, about how he was going to jump across it, or should he jump across it.  He was bugging us, and a little obnoxious, I just wanted him to leave us alone.  Then he tried to jump across the slot canyon.  I saw him jump, and I heard his feet hit the lip edge of our side as they scraped past it, he missed the edge, he didn't make it, and fell in.  I was looking up a little, so I heard it and saw it, but my guy did not see it.  However, he could tell from my expression that the biker guy had not made it.  We just kept making out and playing around, we didn't even want to tell anyone or help the guy or anything.  And I pretty much knew he was dead.  So later on I got up to look in, to see the biker guy, and he was laying down there at the bottom of the slot canyon.  But he was still attached to a seat that had pegs in it, like an airline seat, as if he had been ejected off the bike too early.  I thought he had wanted to jump across it, because he had said, how about if I jump this cliff, but when I looked into the canyon, it looked almost like, and I got the feeling like, he had been ejected by some other force, before trying to jump, with the seat still attached to him.  Next I was at work, and it was just a big empty white room with just a chair, with a harder, barer look and feel than my office, but still nice.  People were coming in to talk to me in private, and the HR woman came in to ask about my hours, and I went and got my raw billing sheet with the post-its on it.  From the day she asked about, which was August 8, to the present, all the post-its were black and you couldn't read them. [August 8 is the day I met Scott.] Also there was a clique there of certain guys and girls that would hang out there together and do things together, joke with each other, and as the dream went on, I was becoming less and less a part of the clique, and sort of being outcast.  They wouldn't joke with me anymore.  At some point in that empty room, with another woman there, there was a clipboard or a sheet of paper, and at the top were two dead baby geckos, and they had obviously been cooked in an oven, shriveled up and kind of curled in a circle, and dead.  I asked the HR woman something about it, like, did you need this kind of species of gecko, and she said no.  Next part - Scott and I were camping, and we were laying in the back of the truck.  He wanted to drive down the road backwards, like facing out the back.  He could maneuver the car somehow while sitting in the back, almost telepathically.  And he was doing a really good job, but it was still scaring me.  So I asked him to pull over and stop, so we did.  Some image of a parking garage.  We ended up going to this little festival thing, it had booths and stuff, one of the booths was selling Moab 'pink things' (like the popsicles at Six Flags, but with Moab motif).  Also there was a booth with earrings.  We walked around.  And I got mad at him because I had wanted to keep camping and not go in a city, and now we were in a city."
"208"	"(10/11/1997)"	"Wendy G (childhood friend) was in a swimming pool, as a young girl, cleaning the leaves out of the pool, and she got in trouble.  I think I was a young girl in this part too, and others, maybe my sisters.  We were all swimming at different points, or by the pool.  Some focus on what it's like to get in trouble as a child.  It hit Wendy hard, getting in trouble.  Then buying a sweater with Erin P (current co-worker), she tried it on, it was striped and had green in it.  It didn't look good on her.  But some focus about her figure, very womanly, large breasts, how they look in a sweater.  And there was a guy in the store, or from the store, paying attention or flirting with us, finding us in different departments.  Later we were at an IMAX theater, and that guy wanted to meet up with me later.  At some point I was in my black long dress too.  Either in this dream or on 10/9, I dreamed of Allen (high school friend), we went to meet his new lover, and Allen lived in a really wealthy house, brand new, we were impressed."
"209"	"n/a"	"(10/18/1997 (#1)) I went into the back of my truck, I remember looking at the ceiling of the camper top, how it angles up.  Then I saw an opening or realized there was another room above it.  I climbed up into it.  First it looked like an attic, with A-frame ceiling, I thought, ""an attic on the camper shell?"" then as I looked around, I realized it was quite a large space.  I crawled in, it was dark at first, careful of the floor as if the slats might break through.  Then I stood up, it became different, and I realized this was a whole house, the upper floor of a house, it was not the top part of my truck any longer.  Somewhere in here, Lynn appeared in the dream with me.  We decided to explore this house.  We walked around.  We knew we were on the second floor.  It was a large house with many large rooms, and looked newly built.  There was a new feeling about it, like it had not been lived in yet.   It had a light, open, white, new feeling.  Some parts were not quite finished, but most of it was really nicely done, details in design and construction that impressed us.  I remember seeing the bathroom vanity.  It was sort of out in the open, not an enclosed bathroom, in the opening between two bedroom doors at an angle, as if these two bedrooms would share this bathroom vanity.  The cupboard beneath this bathroom sink was a glass figure of a woman in a negligee.  It was very pale green glass, frosted, so you couldn't really see through it but it gave an open glass feel.  I thought this was fascinating, to make the bathroom vanity under-sink cupboard the shape of a woman in a negligee, in beautiful pale green glass.  It was beautiful, I looked at it a while and passed it several times in our exploration of the house.  I enjoyed looking around the house, and maybe some enjoyment of looking through it with Lynn, getting ideas with him from the plans and layout of the house.  There was a definite feeling about that house, about how neat and cool it was, how we liked it.  We checked out the rooms, I wanted to see the one bedroom up some stairs behind the bathroom vanity area, then there was some hurry, or I half woke up, but it had dark wood beams, a single bedroom up some stairs.  I think Lynn's friends also appeared somewhere in here.  They and Lynn got the idea of taking over this house and living here.  They were already fixing it up, working on things, changing things, moving in.  I was not happy about this, it wasn't our house, I was mad that they would just take over someone's house and live in it.  We went outside at some point and looked around.  I couldn't tell the area.  The outside was more rustic, a barn or wood or shacks or something.  It didn't fit in with the new artsy modern feeling of the house.  In the last half of the dream there was some feeling of hurry or secretiveness, probably connected with Lynn's friends being there, and them all deciding to take over this house that wasn't theirs.  I was not too happy.  While there was some familiar satisfying feeling of fixing up a house with Lynn, making plans, like we were doing at the cabin, mostly I was sad and upset at the circumstances of them just taking it over when it wasn't theirs."
"210"	"n/a"	"(10/18/1997 (#2)) I was taking a bath with Rob, Rob's girlfriend, and me.  First Rob got in the bathtub on the bottom, then Heidi was in the middle, and I got on top.  Each of us were on our backs on top of the other one.  It was sensual but not sexual at all.  It was more playful.  There was a bit of talk about crushing each other, but we didn't worry about it, no one was uncomfortable.  I remember pulling up the lower half of my body to see a full view of my body out of the water, breasts to waist to hips.  Like I was almost positioned upside down, maybe I put my feet way up on the wall. Heidi was done first, she got out, and went into another room.  I was glad about this because then I got the bath all to Rob and myself.  We bathed more, now sitting up some.  We pointed out how much dirt came off in the bath, there were circular swirls of dirt floating in the water from our bath."
"211"	"n/a"	"(10/18/1997 (#3)) I had a marriage arranged for me.  The feeling was that I had had such poor luck getting married, and I was 32, so it was decided I should just have one arranged.  That it wasn't working the normal way, me trying to meet someone and get married, so we had one arranged.  Everyone was in on it, the whole family.  I did not know the guy, did not even know who they had picked out when the wedding came.  It was a big wedding, outside, very festive, lots of people there, kids, people I didn't know.  I was helping set up and prepare, greeting guests.  Then I realized I better go get dressed for the wedding.  I had no idea what to wear.  I thought of the buff-colored filmy vintage dress, but it was too ridiculous, to costumey, plus, someone said he would be dressed rather casual.  I went up to a high room, almost castle-like, that overlooked all the wedding festivities going on below and started trying on dresses.  I pulled out dress after dress and tried them on, I was getting anxious, feeling I would be late. I thought, 'just pick one', but I wanted to look great for the wedding.  I felt like I had gotten lost in time deciding on a dress, and forgetting about the wedding.  I had almost decided on a dark purple shift that set off my figure nicely, one of the first ones I picked out.  Then Mom and others or a sister came in to help, and I kept trying on more.  I tried on an outfit Mom had given me, it was a real groovy sixties gold shiny pants and a top, totally weird.  I decided against it.  I thought about borrowing either of my sisters' wedding dress, but they were too formal.  Finally I realized I was just spending way too much time deciding on a dress, that the ceremony needed to go, and that was the most important thing.  I think I decided on the purple shift, but walking out the door I remembered the fuschia short tank dress I had wanted to wear for my wedding with Jeff, but it was too late, and it needed to be ironed, so I went on.  I don't remember the ceremony.  But afterward I got to meet my new husband.  He was Latino, good-looking in a cute way, very nice smile, mustache I think.  He had that compact small body to which I used to be very attracted, like David M's.  I was quite happy with him, and he liked me.  His name was Ramon Santiago I think.  The way we finally met was some custom in this type of wedding.  It was the wedding night, and I came to his bed which was a single bed, to join him.  But everyone else's beds were all lined up in one big room, all the families and guests, all in one room, so it wasn't private with him.  I laid down beside him.  I liked his smile, his body.  I was very happy with this marriage.  I was thinking how wonderful this was turning out.  We kissed, and he got so turned on when we kissed and I touched him, like I was driving him crazy and he couldn't wait to make love.  He showed me that I was driving him crazy and really turning him on, he didn't hide it, and he smiled at me a lot.  He was like a kid almost, really wanting it.  I realized I loved that from a man, that kind of reaction, going crazy for sex, getting really turned on anticipating sex, really wanting me.  I also realized I have really been missing that reaction with men, that lately I don't get that reaction, of really wanting sex and showing it, like he can't wait, the anticipation making him crazy.  I thought what a good choice was made, that we really liked each other, and as the dream went on, how well we got along.  I was happy about this marriage and the choice made for me.  But I was curious too, how I could fail to get along with men I myself had picked out, but could hit it off so well with an arranged marriage.  I don't think we made love that first night.  The next day there was some conversation with sisters or women in a nearby room, near a couch, don't remember.  I couldn't quite remember his name, and didn't want to ask him, as that would be embarrassing.  The women said:  just ask him, he probably doesn't remember yours either.  But I couldn't, and I tried to think up some way to find out his name again.   The next night I went to his bed again, the single bed.  I laid down with him, we were still so happy.  I asked him about his last name, trying to get him to say his whole name.  He pronounced it for me, with Spanish accent, I repeated it, and he said, yes, right.  An understanding that our two cultures and languages could come together.  Then these five little girls came running up, jumped on the bed, and in some custom in this type of marriage, they all stood up and peed naked straight at us, as a joke on the new married couple in bed.  We laughed and tried to duck under the covers from the pee.  But then one of them also shitted on us, Ramon reacted to it with some disgust, my head was under the cover so I didn't see the shit but I heard his reaction.  I felt close to him knowing I could tell what had happened just from his reaction.  Then some other adult came and threw more little shits on us from the side of the bed.  It was all a joke, but went a little far.  We weren't angry.  But I looked over to the beds beside us and I thought, those are double beds, why can't we have a double bed for a couple, not this silly single bed.  So I suggested to Ramon that we go to a motel somewhere else since this bed was now dirty, as a way of getting us some privacy and a double bed, without directly asking for those things.  It was a sense of satisfaction to me to be able to suggest getting what I wanted (double bed, privacy), using these circumstances (pee and shit on this bed), without telling my husband what to do.  It was a couple/relationship satisfaction.  In other words, I was glad there would be no fuss resulting from the fact that I wanted something different from his custom; I just used the other circumstances to prompt it.  Ramon agreed, and I felt great at how well we got along and made decisions easily together. [Note Feb. 2012:  Wow, that sounds so manipulative. Why didn't I just ask for what I wanted directly, instead of playing this game?] Ramon got up, and wrote a little maid service-needed note about the bed, we started walking to the elevator to leave, and he gave it to a maid we passed, who read it and grimaced but smiled too at the married couple.  I was feeling so glad that Ramon could take care of this, could take charge of the situation, do what needed to be done, lead the way, make decisions and follow through on them.  I was feeling glad for the help in taking charge of things, relieved I do not have to take care of everything myself anymore.  We drove in separate cars, which now seems funny.  I was following his van, down a highway, under a highway.  We came to a motel and decided to eat dinner first.  There was a feeling of caring, a new-couple feeling, where we cared about what the other wanted.  There was a feeling of getting to know each other, and that togetherness came slowly but surely (driving in separate cars).  There was a feeling of communication and understanding growing between us (suggesting leaving the wedding room).  I wanted broccoli and it was late so the waitress had to bring it out again, as stuff was already put away.  Then Ramon said he wasn't hungry.  We felt close.  The dream ended, but I am positive we got a double bed there."
"212"	"(10/19/1997)"	"There was a cop or guard situation, or a crime had just happened.  There was a long road at night, with a square building by it, up a slight incline.  I was heavily involved in the situation.  Two kids had been left outside, on a blanket or something, across from the building.  I was mad about it, when I saw them, because they were not being watched.  I was more mad because they could have escaped since they weren't watched, than because something bad could happen to them.  I was in the woods with someone.  It was near night.  I saw a deer peeking out from a half-hidden hole or trap in the ground.  It moved a little, and I noticed it.  It was shot but not dead, and I was surprised, I thought it would be dead.  I told my male companion - shoot it so it won't suffer any more.  He did.  Then he said - this was one I shot earlier, not the later deer I told you about that I shot.  I then realized - ""He hunts for fun, and does not eat the animals he kills.""  Because he had left this deer behind, and it wasn't even the one I had been told about, meaning there were maybe even more than I thought, out here suffering.  He had given me the impression that he hunted only what he ate.  I was not happy about discovering this, like it was a lie."
"213"	"(10/23/1997)"	"I dreamed I was putting my contacts in, and the contacts were big, stiff, rectangles.  I had to fit them in my eyes, two corners on the bottom first, then the top corners.  I got them in, but they were really big and cumbersome, like an inch or two high.  I had many small dreams this night, can't remember now, but I woke up feeling like I had overcome a lot, and figured out a lot, and was much stronger, mentally healthy, and able to get things done.  It was a breakthrough feeling."
"214"	"n/a"	"(10/27/1997 (#1)) Houses - 3 progressions.  Started in one, pretty normal.  Then to a second one, a real tiny house, crammed together with many other tiny houses, barely room to sit up inside.  Leonard G (fire crew boss, we were lovers) was there.  I was comparing it to another tiny house I knew.  There were planks and walkways among the houses, a bad area or poor area.  I really thought about the lifestyle there, how it would be to live there.  Then to the most unusual one.  Feeling of a large weedy back yard, more open space, more isolated.  It was a newer house, and feeling like I had moved on or progressed to live there.  Almost a drug feeling, but not bad.  Like we used drugs in a good, constructive way, to gain talents or understanding.  I was down there with others of unusual or strange talents.  It was kind of empty or bare, and an unstructured feeling.  Seemed like concrete blocks.  Compared to the tiny house, which was very structured in lifestyle, people knew their role and their place and standing there, and everyone else's, it being so poor, this place was very unstructured and we had more limitless possibilities in our roles and activities.  There was a feeling of coolness or a basement, and while inside, I was aware of the outside, out the windows.  Whereas in the tiny house I felt closed in, no awareness of the outside.  I felt I was there for some unusual reason or to develop unusual talents, or to be with or meet these people.  A little sad or strange feeling.  Feeling of progression, or moving.'"
"215"	"n/a"	"(10/27/1997 (#2)) Back at FelCor, to visit.  I was in the big hallway where I used to sit, it was different, more cluttered or not as beautiful.  Bill S and another guy were there.  They asked me does it look different, I said yes and explained, pointed out the changes.  Then there was a piano in that area, I played it for Bill, jazz, kind of wistful, remembering how much I liked working there and the people.  I went back to the kitchen area, putting on deodorant as I walked, and Barbara L was there, coming out of the file room I think.  I felt that old anxiety about wanting her to like me, in this case: running into her when I'm not quite prepared.  We talked in the kitchen.  She had brought me a whole smoked turkey or chicken.  It was huge, long in shape, we ate some.  I had brought her a fried chicken or something lame, and I felt bad about it, because I always felt like she gave me more than I could return, and I knew she'd be able to tell it was picked up quick from Kentucky Fried Chicken.  I felt inadequate, or my actions not up to par.  It was a good reunion with all there.  I was walking out of the FelCor kitchen, and I wondered and asked Barbara if Bill S was there (apparently forgetting that I had already seen him.)  Intense anticipation that I might see Bill.  He was walking by then, but passing us dressed in a motorcycle helmet and suit, it looked more like a Martian suit, silver, totally hiding him like a costume.  He stopped dead still when he saw me, surprised, glad, and took off his helmet.  Old feeling of intense attraction.  There was something about a girl with a ball cap on, I couldn't see her face, just her lower jaw and cheek as she talked.  Then switch to a very fancy restaurant.  I contemplated working there as a server.  Then I wanted a seat.  I took off my pants (as if this was procedure), wondered where the hostess station was, how to get a seat, it was like I was at the back of the restaurant.  I ended up looking for bathroom signs instead.  Here: theme of wealthy, upscale.  Overall in the dream: theme of things not as nice as they used to be, or as they should be (FelCor hall different;  at restaurant, not feeling dressed up enough for it.)"
"216"	"(10/28/1997)"	"I stop at a diner while traveling.  I stopped there many times in the dream, first by myself, then later with my oldest sister, maybe others.  It was a large poduncky and kind of redneck place, wood planks.  The time I was there alone, I figured out things or was introduced to things there, so that when I went back, I knew the place, and felt I could show them to my oldest sister.  Like where the bathrooms were, the procedure there, and I met the waitress.  Even though it was just a place on the road.  The time alone, I was going to the bathroom, and passed a sign or something on the wall, maybe a moving or changing sign?  I wondered about it, what it meant, maybe it was like a private joke, and figured it out myself, and asked the waitress about it or we laughed about it together.  The time with my oldest sister, I was going to the bathroom, and prematurely took a shit en route.  I reached in my long skirt, to hold the shit in my hand so it wouldn't slip out, it was long and formed.  I wanted to go take care of it and clean up.  But my oldest sister followed me in there, and kept stopping me and talking to me while going into the stall, and I kept trying to break off the conversation and get in the stall.  Almost wanted to tell her I had an accident, but it was too embarrassing, although in this dream it seemed like a common occurrence for people.  I was hiding my hand holding the shit in my skirt the whole time, hoping I could just take care of it.  Interspersed in this dream, there were scenes of traveling.  I was near some tourist or natural park place.  It was wilderness, not touristy.  Where people stopped on the road, there was an overlook of the gorgeous view of an area of canyons and buttes.  There were trailheads and trails leading into this area, and stop points on the road.  In the center of the view from the overlook was a very tall completely transparent slab of rock, flat, thin, and smooth like glass.  Although trails led to there, they did not start from the road in front of it and lead directly there, you had to start from the side, or further down the road.  You could see the trails, but they didn't automatically look like they led from the road to that rock.  The route was a V-shape, including a center canyon or wash, how the trails came from the road and eventually led to the rock, but you could figure it out, if you had any outdoor experience.  I remember thinking the trails were intentionally like that, not starting directly in front of the rock, but by some knowledge or experience you had to know or figure out that the side trails led there.  I think I took one of these trails, or several times, there was a feeling of going back later and recognizing the trail within the dream.  However, an actual trip down the trail was not part of the dream, just a later understanding or recognizing of it.  You could see the tall rock from far off, and I got a close-up view too, almost hovering over it or near it.  It was transparent and lit up from the inside, by a natural white light.  I thought about the light inside that slab of rock, where it might originate from, how it could be natural. [I had been thinking before sleep about how dark a woman's vagina is, how the man enters and brings light (energy) in.] At one point it felt like near darkness outside, because the tall rock was lit up white and was the only focal point.  There were daytime scenes of it also, with buff and Utah canyon colors.  It was really spectacular.  During the close-up view, I could see that in front of the rock there was a sculpture or silhouette of something, it seems now like a Native American Indian on a horse with a spear, or something Native American.  The black outline of this figure was brought out by the white luminescent rock slab background.  I could not decide if the figure was natural, part of the rock/landscape, or had been built and put there.  Same with the light, although the light I accepted more readily as natural.  I was shown this figure in front of the rock, and allowed to view it until it sank in and I understood.  Later in the dream, I passed by this overlook again and saw this tall flat transparent rock again from far off, recognized the black silhouette in front of it, from having seen it close-up, recognized the trail, recognized it but with a new insight, like it then became real or part of the whole landscape for me, or I could place it geographically and know it then, or I had a new understanding of its meaning and why the park was there, why that silhouette was there, why I was there looking at the rock and the trail.  There was some understanding being given to me, by being shown the rock and silhouette in different ways and different light, and repeatedly at different times, so I could understand it better each time I saw it and recognized it.  Almost a feeling like you are not alone, and there is reason to live, if you have familiar places and things to go back to, that give you new understanding each time.  It was inspiring, beautiful.  It had a quality of a fantasy world, one I could or might create.  Reminded me of the rock (flat stalagmite) in Carlsbad Caverns with the light shining through it.  The figure in front reminds me now of those metal sculptures made from pictographs, how that woke me up and inspired me when I read about them and saw them, a 2-dimensional art form transformed to 3-dimensional, so many centuries after they were thought up and drawn.  Like fantasy images finally made part of the material world, centuries later, the power of creativity and transformation, creating reality from thoughts.\"
"217"	"n/a"	"(11/01/1997 (#1)) Dream:  I was driving in Tucson.  There was stuff about being held back, having to do with my license being expired, I was anxious about being stopped by law enforcement.  At one point, at a place like a toll booth or checkpoint, a woman checked my license, and let me go anyway, with a sly look I took to mean, just get out of the state as soon as possible, we'll let this expired license slide for now.  I went on, up through a tunnel or something, glad to escape, but knowing there might be further trouble before I could leave.  I think I was thinking about getting to the Utah border, how far it was.  I was in the Jeep.  Also trouble with the highways or finding certain roads.  It seemed like I was on the east side of Tucson.  There were lots of driving scenes and sequences in and around Tucson.  Then I was with Kevin M (boss at my first lawyer job), and his wife too I think.  I was staying in their guest room or something.  I did not feel real comfortable here, had been away too long, felt like I was imposing, and felt like I couldn't get the polite niceties down or I was missing something.  But I also felt like I was traveling and had nowhere else to stay unless I camped out, so I wanted this room.  At one point, they and another couple were having dinner out back, on a sort of wooden swinging bridge, right in the middle of the bridge.  I came up from the back side, from a trail.  I wasn't invited, and felt a third wheel, since there were two couples.  One of the women, I think Kevin's wife, asked about the room I was staying in, and about my deposit or some payment for it.  I was confused about what to pay and that I was supposed to pay at all.  I went around them, and inside the house, and decided to leave right then impulsively, without telling them.  I was looking for my stuff and gathering it up.  I felt alone or lonely.  Then I was hiking with Risk.  It was a wooded area with trails.  Risk was rolling on her back and playful.  She started rolling on her back, and caught the top of a narrow trail, then she was sliding down it, downhill, head first, on her back.  It was smooth and slippery, almost like a shallow narrow chute, and I was scared for her, because she slid a long long way all the way down the trail.  It went through trees.  I watched her slide all the way down.  But at the bottom, she seemed fine.  She got up and went to the rock wall on the right side of the trail, and dug out a little shelf in a small hollow that was already there, so she could lay in the cool dirt there.  The rock wall was white, yellow, buff colored.  When I caught up to her, I was saying good dog, good girl, for her digging out a little cool place for herself to lay.  It seemed she was looking at me with a satisfied or clever look.  I remember her head was up in the hollow, in the long space she'd dug out for herself.  I knelt and looked closer at the hollow she'd picked.  There were pictographs there, Barrier type, of human shape.  There were lots, red and black.  I hoped she hadn't ruined any pictographs with her digging.  Although I was a little surprised to see the pictographs, I didn't pay much attention to them.  I was more interested in Risk and her actions.  Seems like I was still worried about her sliding down that trail.  Maybe I was surprised she had picked out that particular hollow, since it turned out to have pictographs.  Then I was in a cave underground, with a woman and man.  The woman was taking us through and explaining how she'd discovered the connection between an entrance to this cave and a pool of water or whirlpool which was another entrance.  It was some big scientific discovery which solved a mystery about that cave.  She told us that someone she knew had put their feet in the pool or whirlpool, and fell through, or their legs went in further, and that's how she discovered it and the connection.  There was water or a waterfall in the cave.  I looked around and saw a door with a doorknob nearby, underground.  I said to her, then what about this door?  Meaning, obviously someone has already seen or discovered this, and built a door; it was no mystery.  They kind of ignored my observation.  I can't remember if this next was in the same dream, or before or after.  I was here in my house in Chatsworth, and Risk was here.  She was sick, with her front leg swollen.  There was another woman with me here too.  I was worried about Risk, and taking care of her.  I patted the bed for her to jump up.  She had trouble getting up, being sick.  I tried again, she jumped half up on the bed, then fell backward off it.  Her head landed in the bathroom here.  I picked her up in the doorway, looked up, and the woman had pulled out the box springs or the frame under the bed, to make it low to the floor, so Risk could get up.  We tried again, and Risk got up fine.  I felt guilty about her falling backwards off the bed, about trying to get her to jump up on the bed."
"218"	"n/a"	"(11/01/1997 (#2)) I arrived late at a party in what seemed like a community center of an apartment complex.  Seemed like there was a live band there.  I was dressed up, high heels.  I went to get my lunch, everyone was making sandwiches.  I built my sandwich, and the lettuce leaves were huge, unwieldy, awkward to handle.  I was trying to fold one over while holding my plate.  I was aware of men looking at me.  I knew my figure looked nice, and thought they might be wondering how I could eat so much and stay thin.  I finally got the lettuce handled and folded over, and took my plate to an area I wanted to sit.  The particular place I chose was not meant for a chair, it was a small formica counter by a wall, so I moved one over there and sat, or maybe someone helped me get a chair there.  I did not want to sit toward the front or out in the middle."
"219"	"(11/08/1997)"	"I was with Lynn in a house or room, it was that drug feeling.  We'd get into something or a conversation, and then someone would come walking in.  A couple times he or I would get up from the couch to shut or lock the door, stop the intrusions, to get back to each other and the activity or conversation.  There were two doors, a front and back, the people intruding came from the door leading to the rest of the house, the back door.  There were shutters on the windows, wood kind.  Definitely that drug feeling, overly absorbed in each other and our activity, conversation.  Then Lynn undressed or I undressed him to make love, and he had no penis or balls.  I felt I didn't care, I still loved him, it didn't matter, although it surprised me.  I communicated this to him somehow, that I didn't mind or care that he now had no penis or balls, I still wanted him and wanted to make love.  There was some acknowledgment that they had done this as part of his colostomy surgery, removed his penis and balls.  He could still make love or have an orgasm, although in a different way.  I started to touch him where his penis had been.  There was a small round or oval shape there, in the flat smooth skin area that it now was, almost like an undeveloped woman would look, just the oval outline, no opening.  I started touching this oval outline, trying to get him off, but I was doing it too slow.  Maybe he told me this, or I just could tell I was moving  my hand too slow, but then another woman came in to show me or tell me how I needed to move my hand faster, or in a circular movement, just like you would touch a woman to get her off.  She had an oval shape too, and showed me on herself I think.  I did not mind that there was another woman in the room taking part in our sex, I almost welcomed it.  I felt some embarrassment at my lack of the initial technique, but felt like I could understand and get it right, since it was the same way I would like to be touched.  There was a feeling that this woman was Lynn, a second Lynn as a woman, in the same room and time as the male Lynn.  Like Lynn as two people, a male and female.  Also in this dream were scenes of a storage room, the kind you would rent, or a garage, and going through stuff, or moving it out, over a long period of time, or days.  It was kind of cold or dismal or gloomy, windy or dark out at times.  There were other people there, in and out.  At one point it was like my house here, with the four steps up and a raised area like my bedroom, and I was looking over the half-wall but it was a storage or garage.  I found, or it blew at me in the wind, something written on paper that I recognized immediately when I read it.  But I knew when I read it that I had read it before a long time ago, years ago.  Something in it reminded me of Moab or Utah, some paper I had read or written or saved there, and I felt amazed that it had made it intact through so many moves across states, and that I still recognized it, and that it had found it's way back to me."
"220"	"(11/08/1997)"	"I was at the Center Cafe in Moab at a table with some people.  Robert B came in and sat near the table but not part of the group.  Then I saw Allison D (high school friend, she went on to be an actress on TV), in front of Robert.  But I was totally fixated on Allison and her effect on Robert, not Allison as a person present with us.  I saw Allison's face close up just as Robert would be looking at it, from his seat.  Robert moved closer or looked closer at Allison, they talked a bit, it was clear he was attracted to her.  Then Allison started becoming more and more figurized, or like a painting, each time she responded to him.  My perspective was as though I were Robert looking at her.  And with each of her moves, she became more just an object or image, as he looked at her.  She moved her hands up to smooth her hair or move it, and her hands came down in a wave-like motion, down her hair, creating waves in it.  It was stiff and not even very human, how her hands moved, more like graphic art.  She was smiling at this point.  Then her face became disembodied, with dark background around it framing it, just her face, like a still life or stylized photograph, as he watched.  She was not smiling at this still-life point.  It was not clear if this meant how Robert, or men, view and objectify pretty women.  I was fascinated, and a little jealous of the attention she was getting, but disturbed at how she became less of a human, and more of an object or piece of art.  I remember questioning just how some women can capture a man, get all his attention and devotion, put him in a spell.  Because Robert here was not really aware of how she became less human, it seemed he was not interested in her as a woman, but more interested in his attraction for her.  It was as if his attraction blinded him to her transformation, and he kept on loving her thinking it was a woman when really she was becoming an object.  Or that his type of attraction for her was actually the thing that was turning her into an object before his eyes.  Then there was a scene of Allison riding in a carriage, maybe horse drawn, and Robert either moving beside her or in another carriage beside her (not clear), but he was able to still watch her face intently and close up even as she moved down a road.  And with each move she made or answer she gave or look she gave him, she became more and more Swedish, traditional old-fashioned Swedish, more and more foreign, and less able to relate to him in his position as a modern American.  Her hair and clothes and look and language became more like 19th century Swedish.  Next I was in a city, with Risk not on a leash.  There was another woman my age with me.  Risk was young and black, puppy-like with lots of energy.  Risk would run into the street, and I would hurry after her to catch her, or usually I was calling her desperately to stay with me.  It was like the times early on when I was teaching her to stay in front of a store and wait for me, or to stay with me without a leash.  It was not like I was angry at her for running off, but more like I was training her.  Except every time I called her in the street, I was calling her ""Richard"" to get her to come back.  I think at one point I stopped and questioned myself why was I calling Risk ""Richard"", although the two names are similar.  Some flash of Richard D when I realized that in the dream.  At one point on the street we were near a backstage area, with scenery being prepared, black pieces of cardboard or staging stuff.  It was an area we knew or had been to before.  The last scene was me looking at a small Airedale dog going down the street, with a person, not clear if Risk became this dog.  I think I was questioning whether that was now Risk, although it was a different breed.  And there was an adult Airedale dog there too."
"221"	"(12/08/1997)"	"I was in a house and I was busy doing things, busy with my life.  And then I came into the kitchen / utility room area, and Risk came into the room, it seems like from the utility room or the back door.  And she looked at me, with a look that said:  You've been so sure that I would die that you took it for granted.  You're all positive that I'm gonna die, but I'm still here.  In your minds I'm already dead, but I'm still here.  I need some attention.  And I knelt down with her, she had that pony smile.  And I knelt down in front of her, and she sat down by me, and she put her head near mine, and she started snuggling up with me.  And then I sat down on the floor, and she laid down in my lap, like kind of heavy.  Almost fell in my lap, across my leg, my bent leg.  I had both arms around her, one, my right arm, down her back, and my left arm around her neck and her shoulders.  And I started scratching her tail bone like she likes.  And her tail wagged a little bit.  So I said, ""You want me to do that some more?"""
"222"	"(01/25/1998)"	"John F (an ex-boyfriend) and Sandy (his ex-wife) were in church with me.  I saw John go up a side aisle, either he was called, or he just went.  As he came back, he pulled out his cock and waved it all around.  It was long and naked.  The congregation was shocked, but John didn't care.  He waved it at individuals, at Sandy.  Sandy was laughing.  Sandy in this dream was heavy, dowdy.  Later it seemed we met in a house, Sandy, John and I, and it was trashy or below standard, just a gross life, I didn't want to live that way.  It made me sad and want to get out of there."
"223"	"(01/28/1998)"	"Many little dreams.  I was moving in Chatsworth, moving out, it was toward the end of my stay in L.A.  It was hilly, narrow streets, tall houses, looked like Chatsworth, my street.  John F was there, helping me move.  I ran errands and wrapped things up.  Still couldn't find my way around too well, too new there still.  Madison (my second dog) was also present, as a responsibility only, I didn't really see her, but there was a need to take consideration for her needs during my move errands and work.  At one point, John was driving me on an errand.  He went a new way home, in the hilly area like Chatsworth, it was a way I had never known about, didn't know I could go that way home, so I was glad he found it, because I was a little lost.  But when we got back home, I realized that he had made a figure 8 around town and back to the house, it seemed more confusing than a shortcut then, like inefficient, or just surprising, a waste of time after all, when I thought it was a shortcut.  I didn't say anything to him."
"224"	"(01/31/1998)"	"First I was with Lynn, and things started to go bad, fighting, and I got fed up with him and scared of him.  Things got so bad I decided to leave one night quickly.  Then I was homeless.  Madison was with me.  We went to a place with many other homeless people, it was also like a reggae concert outdoors.  It was very late night, other homeless people were there, trying to make sleeping areas for their little groups, and listening to the reggae band.  There were wet paths among trees and small knolls in the dark.  I had some anxiety about not having warm enough clothes with me, not having brought the right things, especially with Madison there, I worried about her staying warm at night without my sleeping bag.  I started making mental lists of the things I would need to get from my stuff, like my sleeping bag, maybe my tent, warmer clothes.  Then I realized I couldn't go back home, and I realized I would probably never see my stuff again.  There was anxiety about the loss of my stuff.  One of the reggae band guys, or maybe just a man there, was laying near me.  At one point he kind of rolled over on his back with his head sideways, looked at me and said, ""We're gonna have some ROAST BEEF!  You like that, Roast Beef ""  His point was that everyone would assume all these reggae/hippie people were vegetarians, but he was proclaiming that he was not.  At another point a man, maybe one of the reggae guys, was fishing around near my purse, which was on the ground.  I saw him pick it up, and start to carry it off, though he didn't see me watching him.  He was going to steal it.  It was the purse I carry now, exactly.  I went over to him, and sort of reached for it, to show him it was mine.  He immediately went to where he had picked it up off the ground and put it back.  There was no fuss, and he seemed embarrassed."
"225"	"(02/01/1998)"	"I dreamed Madison opened the telephone answer machine and took the mini-cassette out.  I discovered it was gone later, the little door still open.  I did not see her actually do it."
"226"	"(02/27/1998)"	"First I was at a house that was Ray W's, though it did not look at all like his present one.  It was space age in design, truly eccentric, with many rooms, walkways, cool parts to it.  And empty, I felt empty there.  It seemed like I was always wandering around looking for people there, and not finding them.  Or I could hear them or half-see them, through something like plastic tarp, but they were not with me.  And I was not all that interested in being with them anyway.  I explored the house a little.  I remember a walkway outside, like a long porch, it was Utah and deserted out.  I remember feeling other people would come over later that day, but right then, I was there alone.  I said something with the word ""playing"" to Ray around the corner, he was in front, I think with other people.  I meant it as a funny passing statement.  Then I went in Ray's bedroom, it was round and had an odd ceiling, plastic tarp or substance or something.  It was not regular.  I felt his bedroom was whimsical and fun, irregular.  And there was a waterbed.  I got on it and remembered one could pee right on the waterbed and it would go through and be flushed away somehow, through the water.  I remembered Ray or someone had done it that way and showed me, so I thought it would be okay.  I squatted on the waterbed and almost started to pee, then thought I heard or saw people out through the wall, I thought they might see me.  Also I thought maybe this really isn't how you're supposed to pee, what if it doesn't go down.  So I went in search of a bathroom.  I was going to pee for lack of something better to do.  It felt like we were waiting around with nothing to do, and not even talking or playing with each other.  I went down the hall and found another bedroom, this one larger, more regular in shape, rectangular, long.  There were toys in it, and I realized it was Dakotah's (Ray's friend's little boy) room here at Ray's.  Then I went to find the bathroom, found it, it was so cramped and seemed still under construction, like you only had a tarp or sheet to pull across the front for privacy.  It too was rectangular.  I peed, feeling a lack of privacy, and then Ray came in and yelled at me while I was on the toilet because he thought I was hiding from him intentionally, avoiding him.  And he brought up the statement I had said to him earlier from the porch, he was angry about it.  I told him I wasn't hiding, but trying to pee, and I told him I had meant it as funny, a meaningless passing quip.  And I thought to myself how he takes what I say and do a different way than I meant, how we really do not communicate well.  Then I was at a formal function in a big old auditorium, but it was beside and connected to Ray's house.  People were dressed up, socializing.  A girl I knew came in, dark short hair.  She came to us over by the stage and was showing off her outfit, she got halfway up on a ladder, turned around.  Her top was made of white fur with black and brown fur strips, daringly cut, and her black skirt had a slit in back all the way up to where her butt crack started.  I was impressed, I loved her outfit, and we told her she looked great.  She was a little drunk, and she started to do a strip on the stage to the music, commanding the tune to change with her motions.  Ray was playing piano, there were other musicians, and they all changed their song so she could strip to the music she wanted.  Breathless, she quickly handed me her teeth and some other little things so she could do the strip.  The teeth were more like part of her costume than false teeth she needed.  I went to the bartender to ask him to rinse them off, or keep them there for her, he looked disgusted and said in all his years bartending he'd never had to do anything like that.  I watched her strip.  She had small breasts like mine, I remember thinking they were like mine.  Although, her left one was a little bigger than the right.  In her alcohol state she was stripping deliberately and slowly, watching the audience.  It was not something she normally did.  I thought she looked gorgeous, but was embarrassed for her, since I knew her.  The musicians kept playing.  I looked at Ray, and he was getting increasingly incensed.  He kept saying that it was totally inappropriate for this function, that she should stop and get off the stage.  Then he refused to play any more piano, he got up, and went with a tall blond woman toward his house (connected to where we were), then they went up into an attic together.  He took her hand and led her.  I followed them with my eyes, then I followed them up the hole in the ceiling.  It wasn't like I was really there with them, just that I could view them.  I was jealous.  As I followed them up into the attic and down the attic hall, there was a smoky, orange light around them, around everything, unearthly and fantastic, and obscuring a clear view.  I thought he liked her much more than he liked me."
"227"	"(03/03/1998)"	"I had become famous and I went to retreat, to hide really, from all the attention, to take a break from life.  I went far away to someone's house I knew, a relaxing house away from things.  I lay down on a bench that seemed hammock-like.  The telephone rang and my host said it was for me.  We were both surprised because no one was supposed to know I was there.  I was wondering how they'd found me.  Someone important called me because I was famous, he wanted me to give advice to the President.  First he asked, how is your arm doing? [In my sleep I was laying on one side and crushing my arm and the shoulder hurt, it really felt crushed.] He had meant that they knew about some accident in which my arm was supposedly hurt.  I answered, well you know I seem to have crushed it by thinking that it would happen, or making it happen psychically (some physical manifestation of thoughts).  Then he asked did I know the current Secretary of Health, he said you know the guy who used to be President of France.  I answered, oh you mean Mitterand? and I pronounced it as in French, like Mih-teh-hhran with the guttural R.  And he thought this very funny, that I would pronounce it in correct French, he even laughed at me, and repeated it back the way I had pronounced it, saying, ""oh you say it: Mih-teh-hhran"".  I was somewhat annoyed, here they were calling me for advice, and laughing at me."
"228"	"(03/04/1998)"	"I went to visit Sue in Massachusetts (someone I met online).  At first it seemed she lived in a normal middle-class home, with an upstairs.  We talked and it was good to see her, I asked her all the questions I could think of to make conversation, conscientious because it was our first visit.  I think I met her children, or we talked about them, for instance, I asked why didn't she name them Ernest and Mariel.  But then later it became apparent that she lived in an incredibly wealthy house.  I was down a hall, by myself, I looked up, and realized the hall was long and ornately decorated, white and gold, and around the corner there was an actual ballroom.  This was a surprise to me, because it was different than my first impression, and also I thought: was I just not paying attention, or did it change, or do I know Sue that little?  There was to be a party that night, the preparations were tremendous, I watched, Sue seemed gone, but I watched the house and ballroom being made ready.  I pointed out to Mom how wealthy this house was.  There was one of those cast iron benches there.  I felt a little forgotten by Sue, like she had more important things to do.  Then I was at the other end of the ballroom.  And it was really an ice-skating rink, right in the house.  The guests began skating elegantly.  I was really amazed at this."
"229"	"(03/22/1998)"	"In this dream, I had to pick a partner, and I was with an older woman, she was over 50, maybe even 60.  She was my partner.  I didn't realize until the end of the dream that I was the male in this relationship.  At the end of the dream, I suddenly looked at myself, and I was my present age, and I was a woman, and I thought - ""What am I doing with an older female as a partner? I'm a woman, but in this relationship I'm supposed to be male.""  And it disturbed me.  Also in this dream, where people lived was a series of rooms all connected together.  It wasn't like separate houses, in a village, or a town or a city.  It was all squashed together. [I have been thinking lately about how people would live in the future, some of the sci-fi stories I've read, where rooms are all just connected, maybe even underground.] Well in this dream, there weren't houses, there were just rooms that went into other rooms, that went into other rooms.  And I was going through these rooms looking for someone or something.  And not finding it.  I was looking for someone specific, asking where they were, and going through these rooms, and thinking, what a terrible way to live, in a city like this, where all the rooms are just all connected.  You don't have any space that's really your own anymore.  This was concurrent with my realizing that I was a male in this relationship.  And I didn't like it, when it finally dawned on me that I was 32 and a female, but that I was supposed to be a male partner with this 60-year old female  It was this really old disturbance, like, god I thought I worked through that, you know, I thought I found out what it was like to be the woman. [I had just had a talk about this with Ken that day, walking to his truck, I told him about how I grew up a tomboy, and idolizing males, and then found out what it meant, how it felt, to be a woman (from Richard and Lynn), and what that meant in a relationship for me now.] So to have this dream was like an old bad reminder of everything I've already learned, and like a trap, almost, it was a trap, to find myself there trying to be the male again in the relationship."
"230"	"(04/01/1998)"	"I was at my middle sister's and her husband's in Monterrey, in an upstairs apartment, or upstairs part of the house.  Her husband was being violent, he was abusing my sister, or had been, and it was not safe for her.  We were there to intervene or help her, and it was a really bad situation.  It was time to go, and there was another girl there who looked a lot like Laura, Ray's friend.  She needed a ride, so I said I'll give you a ride home.  And Mom and this girl and I got in my truck, and I started driving them home, and I got lost or turned around, it seemed like we were in Dallas then, and I was really embarrassed in front of Mom that I couldn't get us home and get this girl home.  At one point it was like a one-way street or a roadblock, or something, we couldn't go any further, and so I said here we can go around this way.  And I turned off and parked the car and for some reason I thought we had to walk around that way and then keep going.  And I was just telling them what to do, I was so embarrassed, I was trying to maintain control of the situation still, but doing so irrationally.  So we got out of the car, and we walked several blocks, and started up this big hill toward a tunnel.  Before we went in the tunnel, I suddenly realized we could have stayed in the car and just driven around this spot and kept going, because I realized when we got to the top of this thing that I was going to have to get the car.  It was this block that we had to get around.  And I had made everybody walk around this block, and then suddenly realized that someone would have to get the car at the other side of the blockade, to keep driving.  So then I was really embarrassed, because I knew they were probably thinking: why didn't we just stay in the car.  So I said you guys wait here and I'll go back and get the car and pick you up, and we'll keep going.  It looked a lot like downtown Dallas, in fact I was looking for Dallas landmarks while we walked.  Just outside of downtown, it felt like we were near Arts Magnet (my high school).  When that realization hit me that we could have stayed in the car, and here I was walking these two women up these city streets, I felt so out of it, like I wasn't thinking at all, or my brain had shut down.]"
"231"	"(04/02/1998)"	"I was in a big house with my family, a two story brick house, huge.  It was a long dream but this is the part I remember.  At one point we were checking the locks on the windows and doors, to make sure they were locked against Mark H coming in [Of all people. I mean Mark is incredibly gentle, but I was thinking last night about how I had analyzed his car, facial hair, etc., when I first met him in the desert, for safety] .  We were going around checking the locks because we were going to have a party that night, we were getting ready for this big party.  And either Mom or my oldest sister had invited all the people, so I didn't really know who was coming.  Then I was in a car, getting ready, or not quite put together or dressed.  We drove around the side of this house, and I think my oldest sister was driving, someone else was driving.  Anyway, the girl driving stopped or paused at a ground floor window, and said something really raunchy or just about sex or guys coming over, to whoever was inside the window.  And a person or couple peeked out to answer, they were in bed and obviously fucking, and didn't mind at all that we were all four half-dressed, but in any case, they were pretty trashy or dressed like whores.  I just felt like, wow I've become part of the whores, I'm hanging out with whores.  Back in the big house.  Then we had this party.  When people started coming in, Dad and my oldest sister and I were walking around checking the party things, checking the house.  And we kept kind of annoying each other, and being slightly annoyed with each other.  We came into the front hallway and lots of people were coming in just then, they were all trying to come in the door, and I was trying to get out of the way, and my oldest sister bumped into me from behind, and I gave her this really nasty look.  We finally got into the foyer, and I saw that she had invited Erik, Erik was there, with a blond woman who looked very Norwegian, very Scandinavian.  And I knew it was his wife and I didn't care.  He didn't see me yet.  I went to the foot of the stairs, and I turned around, and I said ""Erik"", and he recognized me.  I gave him this big hug, a long, long hug, and I didn't let go.  I felt joy and love and gratefulness.  While we were hugging he told me, ""I've been four years with this company now, four years I've been working with this company.""  He told me some things about his life, and I said ""That's great Erik, that's really great.""  I wanted him badly."
"232"	"n/a"	"(04/07/1998 (#1)) I was swimming to Canada, up this narrow channel.  It took me two and a half days each time.  I did this over and over it seems like.  I don't really remember the purpose of swimming to Canada, but it was kind of like a project or a courier job almost, I'd get sent or I'd go every few months or something.  At one point I stopped and I couldn't believe it only took me two and a half days to do this, but I had it down.  I know I slept out two nights during the trip, and was there by noon on the next day, the third day, each time.  It was always kind of a hard, harrowing, treacherous trip.  Not incredible danger, or I wouldn't have been in the water, but, it was like swimming a slot canyon, it looked exactly like that.  Not a very hard slot canyon, almost just like a Utah Canyon, but I'd come up against boulder pile-ups.  I was swimming along, and I can see downtown Dallas, on my right, and it's supposed to be there, I know I'm supposed to pass it on my route, but . . (?) . . so apparently I'm swimming from Texas to Canada.  I see Reunion Tower, as I'm coming up out of water.  I see it through the water, so it's wavy, and it's oval instead of round, more like the space needle in Seattle, and I thought it was a UFO at first, and then I come out of the water and realize:  I'm passing Dallas, and that I'm way behind on schedule, it's already becoming night and I'm only passing Dallas by now.  I realize I've been delaying, got a late start, or piddling around, or just not making the progress I thought I would on this trip.  But it doesn't worry me because it always takes me two and a half days to get there.  The weather was kind of gloomy, dark and cloudy and about to rain.  I come up against a pour-off.  And I have some kind of little tool to help me over these pour-offs, but it's not anything substantial, it's not like a rope or a bridge or anything, it's just like this little cord or something on a broken popsicle stick.  Somehow I use that to get over to rocks on the other side, across really deep stretches.  I don't know why I don't just swim across.  But something about that deep water scares me, and on this crossing, up the pile-up of rocks, I drop the popsicle stick tool and it doesn't float, it sinks, right to the bottom, and I'm amazed, I guess I've never dropped it before. I'm considering going on without it, but then I think, I really want it.  So I'm going to go reach down and retrieve it but I can't see that far into the water because it's kind of a murky river.  So, before I reach down I set something up on the rock, kind of behind me to the right.  It's like a wooden box, but later it seems like it's a book or something I need to keep clean and dry, all the way to Canada.  And I do this every time, I keep this clean and dry all the way to Canada, and that amazes me too, that I can keep something outside of a dry-bag clean and dry while swimming all the way to Canada.  I reach down, and, actually I reached in with my foot, I decided to get it with my foot instead of my hand, in case there's something biting down there.  So I reach down and pick it up and retrieve it, but then I think I get out of the water right there, I don't keep going up the river.  I get out of the water, and Danielle (co-worker at Amwest) is there talking to me, small talk, like, something about how some guy she knows named Tom should have waited for some girl, he went on ahead of her, and she was saying, ""I think he should have waited for her, don't you?"" - just girl talk, like we used to do at Amwest, chatting.  I was kind of annoyed with her, because I wanted to keep going, I knew I was by Dallas and I was way behind, and I was annoyed with her stopping and chatting with me at this time."
"233"	"n/a"	"(04/07/1998 (#2)) In an earlier dream that same night I was in Bloomington (where I went to college), and it had fallen into incredible disrepair.  I was walking very fast or running by these buildings.  One of them was that dorm-like building just for women, that apartment house that (in reality) Mom and Dad and I had looked at, and that I had rejected even though they liked it and wanted me to live there.  And the roof had fallen in, from rain and snow, it looked like it was made of cardboard, it was so poorly constructed, I couldn't believe it.  Then I ran down beside another one which was supposedly the second-choice place to live among people in town.  And it looked okay.  It seemed like there were different colored houses and windowsills, in a row.    And then I went down to what was supposed to be the first-choice place to live in Bloomington.  I ran down, past the second choice street, and around the corner of the first house.  And I had heard that it was falling over or the roof was falling in.  I looked up, it was a pretty tall building, and the side and the top of the building were made of thatch hut, grass material, it was like pampas grass or bamboo or something.  Primitive.  And it was kind of leaning, it didn't look very safe to live in.  There was some rumor about them not letting people live there, at least in the top floors anymore.  I went around the front of it.  Something about this dream reminded me of the earlier dream, where I had to drive Mom and that girl home and I took the Jeep . . . or my vehicle . . . up that wrong turn and got out and walked in the industrial part of the city.  It was like being back in a city, because that was Dallas, that other dream, but it was like being back in a city that was rather empty, and I wasn't lost geographically, but sort of a searching feeling or looking without being productive, traveling, moving without being productive, in both of these, there was that feeling, although in this present dream in Bloomington, I wasn't necessarily unproductive, I was just looking.  I had another recent dream, a few months ago, about Bloomington and the houses there, going into the houses and seeing how people lived there, I can't remember when that was.  In both of these dreams, the weather was kind of gloomy, dark and cloudy and about to rain."
"234"	"(05/10/1998)"	"I dreamed I was spending time with Mom, over days, socializing, and I felt after a while like I needed to be away from her.  I was more than annoyed, I really felt I needed to be away from her.  Also dreamed about living at the top of a steep hill, and trying to maneuver a U-Haul truck up there and into the driveway and garage.  Dreamed about the roads around this place, steep, back country, pine trees, and some of the people around there."
"235"	"(05/??/1998)"	"Had another dream about Erik, a follow-up to the dream of meeting him at the party.  It was more involved, spending time with him."
"236"	"(05/14/1998)"	"I was in Muleshoe Canyon, the left fork.  As I walked in the canyon, to the east I saw a side fork slot canyon that I had not noticed before.  It was more like a tunnel or cave with a high ceiling, closed in at the top.  But it went back a long way, curving.  I went in a ways, a little hesitantly.  I had never noticed this side canyon before, which I wondered at and was amazed at.  Was it here all the time?  It was like those dreams where you find a room in your house that you never knew was there.  In the side canyon it was dark and hard to see, my eyes had to adjust.  It seemed like there were people living in there, pockets of groups of people and children, maybe even dogs too, who had made the side slot-tunnel their home and now lived in there.  They seemed poor or unfortunate, they were living on the dirt floor.  I came upon them in little groups, and didn't want to alarm or disturb them, it seemed they felt they had found a hiding-place from the world, and now I had opened it up - hikers! tourists!  I didn't want to bum them out.  Also in this dream a group and I had to go do something, we went alternately from Muleshoe Canyon area to some city, motel, or office/bank building.  I remember the ceiling in a motel or office building, a stifling claustrophobic feeling, and looking at the rectangular windows right under the ceiling.  There was waiting time with them while we scheduled our obligations.  Then back to the canyon.  So there was a contrast of living in a canyon and living in a city."
"237"	"(05/15/1998)"	"I dreamed I was a dog.  I was on a trail behind some person, my master, and sniffing around the trail, and nosing my nose up to the person's hand.  I think I was a male dog.  I felt completely like a dog, not like a human feeling like a dog.  All the dog feelings came in, present sense impressions, and very present desires.  There was no future or past wondering.  After a while on the trail, I wanted to mate a female dog soon, I was anticipating that."
"238"	"(05/31/1998)"	"I was in a country setting, in a room or house.  I had been left to take care of another dog along with Maddie, someone else's dog.  I took them out somehow to another house down a country road, but when I decided to come back, I couldn't maneuver whether to tie one up, walk one back down the road, go back for the first one later, or take both or what.  Or I had to go get a car for someone or do some errand, I think someone called while I was watching the dogs and I had to go do something for them, that's how I found myself out with the dogs but perplexed how to come back with them.  In this dream my truck was broken down and unavailable.  I felt frustrated and a little unable to handle both dogs without a car, and resentful of being left to deal with all this.  But then the solution came serenely to me, I thought, ""Oh I can just do it this way, why didn't I realize that."";  I think I just took both dogs with me, though I don't remember the final decision.  It felt like my friends or my people had all gone somewhere together, and had not included me.  That's why I was left with the friend's dog.  But I wanted to be with them.  I felt left out.  I went to a house I knew they'd show up at, still in the country.  It had feelings of my house at the Maze, but did not look like it, it was bigger.  The people I had anticipated started arriving.  It was like a party or gathering starting.  Everyone was in a party mood, opening beers, laughing.  I started to participate, got party-feeling, talked with people.  The guys all seemed very attractive and cool, almost too cool and good-looking for me.  I felt like I didn't really fit in, or like they hadn't invited me, so why was I there.  At one point, one of the guy's dogs came into the house, and he had little roller skates on his paws, and he could skate pretty well and turn corners.  More reinforcement that these were cool people, they even had cool pets.  At another point, I started changing clothes right in front of people, of guys.  I'd take off my clothes and then walk quickly to the next room, like I was going to change, flirting.  And I was not even that skinny in the dream, I was heavier than what I'd be for doing something like that, but I told myself it didn't matter, that my body was beautiful anyway.  Then I started feeling like I was not really wanted there, a misfit.  I had not been invited, I just came there, and because I'd been feeling like they left me on purpose in the first place, now I started feeling like secretly they were wondering why I was there, or wishing I was not part of the group.  My flirting and taking off my clothes seemed inappropriate to me, and I was embarrassed for myself.  Then I dreamed I felt too deeply asleep, and needed to come out of it a little.  I felt groggy and way under.  I tried to wake myself up.  I woke up, I felt myself come up one level of consciousness, and found myself waking up in the north side Circle K (a convenience store) here in Moab.  I asked myself if I had really woken up, or if this was just a false awakening.  I kind of pinched my arm and looked down at myself, did I really wake up? [Actually, no I was still dreaming, but I thought I had really woken up.] First I was alarmed at having woken up in Circle K.  It was morning and the store was opening.  How had I fallen asleep there, why had they let me sleep there in the middle of the floor?  Apparently they let me know they had let me sleep there overnight while the store was closed, because I had fallen asleep right there and they didn't want to wake me, apparently it was something they did for customers who fell asleep there.  Unlikely, yes, but I did not catch the illogicalness, I still thought I had really woken up.  I was deathly thirsty, I wanted a Diet Coke real bad.  I tried to get one from the fountain.  I couldn't find a decent cup of a size I wanted.  They were all monstrously huge, like small plastic barrels.  I kept pulling them out and looking at them.  Finally I found one and wandered around looking for the fountain.  The ceilings were really high, and the store was much nicer, like oak paneled walls and cathedral ceilings.  This surprised me.  I went to get ice.  First, I couldn't get in to the ice machine.  Then I couldn't get enough ice from the water it was floating in, though I was scooping, it was too scant of ice.  Then some woman was letting her baby swim in the water catcher under the ice, right by me, which is also where one scooped up the ice, from the water.  I was annoyed that she was doing this.  I scooped up ice, but then thought, that baby had probably peed in the water, so I threw that cup out.  I really needed a drink.  I went to get ice at the next ice machine, and I realized this was a more complete store than before.  There was a bar there.  I went to pull back one of the horizontal panels, thinking there might be ice under it, and was intimidated by the bartender, a woman.  I walked slowly along the wall, and pulled back a little curtain.  Behind, there were two bathtubs, ready if some customer wanted to buy a bathing, like a truck stop.  I was surprised, I had thought this was just a convenience store.  Then I realized that that baby had been swimming where you were allowed to swim, that I had been harsh and critical and that woman had been in the right to let her baby swim there.  Then I got worried about Maddie, I called to her, and she came in the store door right away.  I was relieved, I realized the highway was just out front, I was glad she had stayed near, and reproached myself for not securing her immediately upon waking there.  I took her outside to tie her up to a bench, so I could go back in and again try to get a drink.  I took a long time picking out a perfect spot to tie her up.  Part of the ground in front of the benches was sunny and part was in the shade, I wanted shade for her.  I chose a spot, but the leash didn't reach too well, so I picked another place to tie it.  At this point it didn't feel like Moab - too many trees, more garden-like.  It seems like a person or couple was watching me do this, noting how much time and care I took just to pick a spot to tie her."
"239"	"(06/23/1998)"	"First I was biking at night with someone else, to a job or something, along a complicated series of concrete ramps and corridors.  We had to know where the unlocked door was and how to get past a guard.  Then I was at an auditorium with other people where Shawn Colvin was preparing to perform that night.  I talked with her close up.  I asked her if she personally received any of the letters people sent her.  She smiled and said no, did you send me one?  I said yes.  I thought of getting it for her on my computer, but realized I didn't have my computer with me.  I told her I was a lawyer, but I was so nervous speaking to her, my words came out kind of mispronounced.  The next sentence too was mispronounced, as if I was slurring the words or over-pronouncing the vowels.  She looked different than I thought she would.  Her hair was the same, short and stylish, but her skin was darker and she looked older than I thought she would.  She spoke animatedly, with a lot of personality, and moved her eyes expressively.  I liked looking at her face and knowing I finally got to meet her.  I was awed and happy being by her, but felt just like all the other ordinary peons there, especially without my computer, and I wanted her to remember me and to stand out, that's why I told her I was a lawyer.  She asked for my business card.  I tipped my briefcase on the table to look inside, and it was so empty.  I realized I am hardly being a lawyer any more with that empty briefcase. [In reality I did give up practicing law for good when I left L.A.] I couldn't find any cards in my briefcase so I looked in my purse, in that little black vinyl card pack.  But the cards I pulled out had yellow spots on them as if food had dried on them, all of them, and they were old.  I was chagrined and looked for others, in my purse and briefcase.  I pulled out these cards that were more recent, but they had little tags on them to hang on a shirt, like ID tags for an employee, the tags looked like those twist ties on produce bags.  And I realized they were for my identity in a much less glamorous capacity (like being a waitress), not as a lawyer.  I thought of getting an old card out, like an Amwest card, crossing out the old phone number and writing in my current one.  But I ended up not giving her a card.  Then her son came up from the seat area and asked her something, and she talked to him.  He was about 7 or 8.  I was so surprised that she had a son.  I had always thought from her songs that she was a loner like me, independent, or even unable to find a relationship.  But here she had a happy son whom she loved.  I thought, then that song she wrote about ""would I be saved if I were brave and had a baby"" was not even true, because she already had one.  I felt like she'd lied, almost, and felt abandoned, because I continue to live this life alone and listen to her songs and relate to them, and here she was not even that person like me."
"240"	"(07/10/1998)"	"I was in a home that was beautiful, peaceful.  There were gardens and elegance, and an atmosphere of quiet luxury and peace.  I enjoyed my time there, it seemed I did really nothing but my own little projects or enlightening my mind.  I lived alone.  I didn't really feel I fitted in with the home yet, given my lifestyle and homes the past few years, but it was more like the home that I could see myself in the future, only I was experiencing it right now.  One evening I looked out the window, and at an angle, near the front yard, I could see a family starting to camp out on my lawn.  They just parked themselves there, by a creek or something.  It annoyed me, apparently in the past other people had mistaken my home for a national park and tried to do the same.  Then it seemed like this family had been camping there several days already, and I was now sick of it and going to speak to them.  I asked the mother to come into the house.  She was actually really well-dressed for camping, well-groomed and almost dressed up. I faced her, and told her, look, this is my home, and you have camped with your family on my lawn.  Then I added, if you had been a dirty or scruffy type of people, I would have asked you to move it when you first got here, it's only because you look nice that I have tolerated it all these days and not said anything til now.  I thought she would get the message and leave.  But apparently, my last statement was taken the opposite way.  She took it that their presence was okay since they were clean and well-groomed.  Before I knew it, they had all come inside and prepared to stay in the house with me from then on.  They made themselves right at home, choosing bedrooms and washing up.  I felt invaded and taken advantage of.  It was similar to those old dreams I had after Lynn.  I didn't know how to get them out.  Then I was in another house, not mine, with several people.  Dad was there, and we all took mushrooms and tripped.  I couldn't believe Dad was tripping with us, but as it got more comfortable, it was really fun.  I felt I was close enough with Dad to do this with him, but also felt guilt at introducing him to tripping.  It was a very mild trip, several times I questioned whether I was even tripping, it was so light.  At one point, Dad and I were talking, and I admitted that some people had invaded my house and were staying there without my permission.  I told him what I had done to solve it, but I can't remember now what that was.  There was some big feeling about admitting this to him, similar to the feeling I had when I thought 'what if my parents knew Lynn had called this last Wednesday and said he was in town' [although he wasn't; he had made it up] - I was going to keep it from them.  Dad offered no advice or assistance about the people in my house.  Later, Dad and I discovered we could fly, because of the mushrooms.  Little flights - you had to start walking, and think about flying, focusing, believe you could fly, and then we would take off and fly.  It was never far from the ground.  We experimented with it all over.  There was a beach outside the house, and we both flew out to that and were amazed.  It felt fantastic, so freeing, such mind power.  I got better at it, and could fly down the hallways in the house.  Out on the beach, I discovered Dad and I had flown out there with these huge tubular balloons.  They were two or three times our height, and we were playing with them.  Then the one I had brought out there disappeared, and I found out the woman who had invaded my house earlier had taken it, because she believed the balloon was the key to be able to fly.  I was mad about that, her greediness, taking mine without asking because of her erroneous belief, but it was humorous too, her human nature.  Again I was reminded that people had taken advantage of me.  It didn't matter, I could fly anyway, and kept flying little spurts all over.  I flew through the house hallways, I remember the process, looking down and believing over and over I could fly, and then the lift-off, so exhilarating each time it worked.  Then I went outside and flew up a little steep path through close trees, and emerged on top, like at a road.  "
"241"	"(07/11/1998)"	"I had bought a big house, somewhat impulsively.  I think my parents helped me out with the loan, but they had not seen the house.  It was a house I had always wanted.  I'd been there before, and when it came up for sale, I bought it quickly.  I wanted it so much I didn't really think about whether it was really a good house for me.  I went through the rooms after it was mine, exploring it all.  There were about four bedrooms and four baths, the whole place was huge.  There were some cool things, one of the baths had a huge rectangular shower, as big as a room, and it was connected to a dance studio, where the previous owners had had their kids taught ballet at home.  There were many other cool things about the house, I think I was entranced mostly with the bathrooms, and the master bedroom.  And it was located in the desert, remote from everything else. [I knew when I woke up that I have dreamed about this house in detail before.] I knew all about it in this dream, every room and quirk, and felt I had been there a lot.  But as I walked through, I began to get uneasy and realize this house was way too big for me alone, and that I had made a mistake in buying it.  I remember the mortgage was $725 a month.  The house was weird too, it really had some funky things to it, I felt I had made a mistake, that I hadn't thought it through.  Once I even thought, wow I wish I had stayed at that last house I was renting out in the desert instead of buying this huge place.  My family was due to arrive for a visit, and I was worried about what they would think of this place.  When they came I showed them around, showed my middle sister that big shower and the dance studio door, and I felt increasingly like they thought I had gone nuts and should never have bought it, like it was a bad idea.  My family was outside.  There was some big party going on there on the grounds, like a carnival.  I was inside, still exploring the house's weird points, and my niece was with me.  She was a bit younger than now, maybe three.  I noticed an odd window, sort of like a dog door high up on the wall, it had a flap on it.  I wanted to go through it, I saw there was a tall ladder leading from it outside down to the grass.  I knew my family was out there, with the crowd of people.  I climbed up to the window with my niece and asked her, do you think you can go through this with me?  She said yes, so I climbed through the flap, and turned around on the ladder to help her.  She climbed through, and I told her to grab on to my neck, which she did.  She was on the underside of the ladder or something, or backwards, so I talked her through each step to get her turned around right and hold on to me, and she followed every step as I said it.  It was satisfying having it work out, with her.  And so detailed.  I'd say, ""now take your left hand and put it there,"" and she would.  Then I had to climb down with her holding on.  I started to climb down and the ladder swayed away from the wall, it was not falling, but swaying balanced, almost at the torque where it would sway backward.  I knew we could still get down okay.  But then two young men came from the party to the foot of the ladder and held it while we climbed down.  I was very grateful to them for helping, because with my niece I had an extra risk.  But when I thanked them they just turned away and ignored me like they didn't care.  Their faces showed no emotion at all.  On the ground my oldest sister (my niece's mom) came up, and I saw Mom and Dad there near the party.  I still felt embarrassed about buying the house, it was hard to face them."
"242"	"(02/??/1999)"	"I dreamed that I was having a drug trip.  It was kind of like a mushroom trip, it felt like that.  Some of the details were, I was outside, and I definitely knew I was tripping on a drug.  At one point I was in a cave, a cave like you would find cliff dwellings in.  I was in the back of the cave, crouched down, looking for something or crawling back further.  And a person or a voice said to me:  How many people do you have left to meet?  121, 122, 123.  And it repeated this over and over, sort of in a joking way, in that cosmic joking way.  How many people have you left to meet?  That's how it was worded.  And then counting, 121, 122.  I understood that to mean how many people I had left to meet in my life, of consequence to me.  It disturbed me a little in the dream, because I kind of thought it was telling me that this being knew when I was going to die, and through the drug trip I had opened up some communication with that knowledge.  At the end of the dream, I was running down a road, it was night, I was running after something or someone.  And I started to change into a mountain lion, or a large cat.  My body changed in sections, starting from the back, until I was a cat or a mountain lion."
"243"	"(03/31/1999)"	"I was with Terri G, (a client from work), and she had her daughter with her. [She has one daughter in waking life.  Emmy, a blond girl, and I really love Emmy.] But in this dream she had another daughter, a little older than Emmy, with dark hair.  And it came to be known to me, that this other dark haired daughter, was probably really mine.  It wasn't like: this is your daughter.  It was like: there's a great possibility, coming close to a probability, that this girl is your daughter Tara.  I looked at her in the dream and I thought, ""How can this be possible.  How can it be that I don't even know I have a daughter. I mean, a guy might not know.  But a woman would know if she had a baby.""  And I remember thinking, sitting with Terri, that I was feeling really bad about not taking care of this daughter.  Not realizing I had one and taking care of her all those years.  Also in this dream, I dreamed at a different point that I was making a birthday cake, either with my middle sister or for her, but I think she was there making it with me.  It was this really huge birthday cake in sections, it had half-circle sections and square sections and you had to put them together and sort of construct this cake.  And by the time we were done it was so messy, so unruly, it really looked like hell.  And then we had to get it downstairs from where we had made it.  And by the time we got it downstairs in all these pieces, trying to keep it together, it really was just about falling apart.  Disappointing.  But there was some sense of celebration or happiness for my sister."
"244"	"(04/01/1999)"	"I was in a neighborhood, a street that I knew well.  As if I worked there and lived there and walked up and down the street there and knew all the people in that place.  Sounds kinda like Moab.  I was familiar there, I felt comfortable there, like it was my home.  I went into a nightclub, and there was a girl that I knew there, she was about my age, and she worked there, and maybe I worked there too with her, but I met up with her in there and we talked.  Then I started to go home.  I walked back down the street.  It was night, and I was telling someone, I'm buying a house here, it's on this street, and they said ""Which one?""  And I looked across the street, along all the houses, and I couldn't really remember which one I was buying.  It's not that they looked all the same, it's just that it was too unfamiliar to me, it wasn't my house yet, so it was hard for me to pick it out and say that's the one.  But then I realized that, oh it's probably this one right across the street from me and then one house down.  Then there was a little segue where I was inside the house eating soup or something from a bowl at the table.  I was all alone.  It's like I had just stopped in there to use my new house for dinner and then I was gonna leave again.  When I came back out this segue merged with the part where I was telling someone I was buying a house, and I realized I had been in the wrong house.  And the person I was with was laughing at me, saying ""you don't even know what house you're buying, you can't remember?""  They thought that was so humorous.  And then I looked at this house again and I went: no, it must be a house further down the block, that's right.  I started to remember better.  And then details of this house that I was gonna buy came to mind.  And it was set up totally different than the house I really am buying [in reality] .  It had a front patio area or garden area that had a wooden fence.  A tall wooden fence, which I don't have at my house.  And it had a swimming pool sort of on the front and side of the house.  And then I saw myself coming out of the house by the swimming pool and I remember thinking ""Lynn will really like this.""  Not Lynn ""would"" like this.  But that when he sees it, he'll like this, the way this is set up, with the swimming pool.  Next in the dream, I'm with this woman that I had seen earlier at the club, and we apparently live together, in another place, that's kind of small and old and kind of run down, a rental home.  And she's come home and we're doing our things in the evening in this house.  I have somehow acquired a child, it's a little boy, he's blond, and he has some problems, like behavioral problems.  I'm not sure how I acquired this kid.  I think he was abandoned or someone asked me to take him, take care of him, and so I have been taking care of him in this little house.  This girl I live with is very supportive of me taking on this kid.  She wants me to.  She thinks it's a good thing.  And she may even have a child of her own there, taking care of it, so she wants us both to be doing that.  But there comes a point where someone outside our circle protests the fact that I have this child.  He comes and he's talking to the girl I live with, saying, how can she just take this kid, what if it's someone else's, what if someone else has rights to this kid, can claim it, she has no standing.  And the girl is sticking up for me, saying, she's been taking care of it, it is hers.    And while they're having this conversation in another room, I go to look in on the little boy, and I look through a window and a doorway into a room in our house.  And I see him, he thinks he's alone, and he's pacing slowly toward the wall, and on purpose he'll let his head hit the wall, bounce back, and then back up backwards, pacing to the other wall, hit the other wall with his back, and then pace forward to the first wall and hit his head, just back and forth.  Like autism.  ""He's in bad shape,"" I think; he's not acting very normal.  And then he hears me or I open the door and he sees me, and he turns around and I see his face and it's this very wide, young, chubby face, blond hair that's long and needs a haircut, and he smiles at me, and his cheeks and eyes are sort of wide-set.  I mean he looks nothing like me.  I feel very distant from him, very much like a stranger to him.  I really have no place taking care of this child, first of all, because he feels like a stranger.  I don't feel close to him, I feel weird about him, and second of all because he's obviously got some major problems that I'm really not equipped or experienced to handle.  And third of all, it occurs to me that I've just left him alone practically all day, and what the hell kind of parent am I making, that I leave him for such long periods of time with no supervision at all.  And I feel like I could never make his problems better, I would only make it worse.  I don't really take care of him correctly.  I'm not really there for him.  Somehow I overhear the conversation that the guy is having with my roommate.  They must have been on the phone, and I come into the room.  He's not there but he's talking to her, and I say to her, you know, wait, no, don't stick up for me.  Because if that guy is meant to have this child, and I'm not meant to really take care of it, then I trust in the powers of the universe to let the right thing happen.  And if I'm not meant to do this, then it won't happen, and that's fine with me.  She's looking at me incredulously, like how could you give this up.  And I just feel like, I'd almost rather the guy take this child off my hands.  All of a sudden I just don't feel up to it.  I don't want to fight that fight.  And I feel like, if someone's coming to claim this child, I could very easily back out of this, and feel like it wasn't the right thing for me anyway.  I did feel strongly convinced in this dream as I was telling her this, that the universe does provide everything we need.  I've seen it over and over in my life, when we think we're being denied something, or we're not getting something, we're really getting something else, i.e. the thing we actually need for growth or evolving.  I said that with conviction to her."
"245"	"(04/02/1999)"	"This was a really beautiful dream, in a lot of ways.  It was full of hope, and beauty, and excellent plans for the future.  In the dream I knew I was buying a house, and I went to go see it one day.  I came upon the house I thought I was buying, and it didn't look anything like the house I'm really buying.  It was larger for one thing, 2 story, and 3 bedrooms and 2 baths.  I was walking through it, looking through the rooms.  2 of the bedrooms were downstairs.  I was picturing the floor plan in my head.  One master bedroom was upstairs and I was picturing how my furniture would look in there, which room I would like my bedroom to be.  And I thought, why not make the bedroom in the back family room, because the back family room had these sliding glass doors that look out onto a wooded back lot, it was very private, it was out in the country, it had land and space around it, and a lot of trees right outside the house.  And I thought, how cool, I'm not going to use the bedrooms for bedrooms at all, I'm going to put my bedroom in the back family room, because it has high vaulted ceilings, and it opens up totally to this back yard area, and it seemed like the windows were 2 stories tall too, like in that part of the house, the second story was open.  Also out back there was a barbeque grill area.  It was a stone fireplace setup, just out back on this concrete patio.  And I also thought that was very cool, I really liked that, and at one point in the dream there was a little gathering there, and somebody was actually grilling meat over a little fire they'd made in this stone fireplace.  But at some point in there, as I was thinking about the floor plan of this house, I realized, this is not at all like the house I'm actually buying.  This house is much bigger, and it has more bedrooms, and a LOT more space, and more rooms overall, and the option of using the back family room for my bedroom, that's not even possible.   I was thinking, this is not the house I'm buying, what is the house I'm buying?  For a long time, I couldn't bring it up from memory, I couldn't remember what the house looked like.  But after a while, I suddenly remembered the house that I am buying.  I got a picture of it in my head, and I realized again with a shock, this house that I'm in is not the house I'm buying.  And I was a little bummed out about that, because I realized that, with the house I'm buying, there aren't the same kind of options, I can't make any room I want into the bedroom.  There's only one living room, and I can't make it the bedroom.  But, despite that realization, the dream continued, and now this house that I was in, looking at, thinking I was buying, became (it just sort of merged, segued into) an even larger house, and this place was really unusual.  It was three stories tall.  And it had this central or main living area, a long cylindrical column done in white stucco, that was all open, going up all three stories, and then there were ledges and jumps around the edge, also white stucco, that got you to different rooms, like the bedroom.  I went up these ledges thinking HOW incredibly cool this place was.  I loved the setup of it, I loved that you had to kind of climb to get to your bedroom.  All the ceilings were high, I remember looking at all the ceilings.  The bedroom ceiling was high, even though it was up on the third floor.  By the ledge that went into the bedroom, was another ledge that I hadn't looked in, I hadn't gotten on it when I first looked at the house, so this was a surprise.  I got on that ledge, and went into the room that it led to, and it was a bathroom. It was the master bath but it was like the whole room was the shower.  It was huge, very very tall, tiled room, with what looked like a bowl-shaped floor.  It sort of sloped down, the floor wasn't just flat, it saucered down to a place where you stand, and there must have been a drain on there, and the whole room was the shower, like you just stepped into this tile room to bathe.  It was a really neat shape, it was really up high, on the third floor, you could look out into the whole rest of the house while you were taking a shower.  And it was so cool.  At one point, I was up on those ledges looking into that cool bathroom.  And Maddie came up to join me.  I told her to go back down, and I watched her leaping from ledge to ledge to get back down to the ground floor.  It was really cool.  After the house became the largest version, the three story one, there was a party in the house and a lot of people were there.  It was already set up for living.  And a guy came in that I knew and liked.  He was kind of like John N, one of those big good-looking, strapping fellows.  He came in and I said ""Would you like to see my rock frame?"" [In reality I had constructed a picture frame out of slickrock, an idea I thought up while driving to move back to Moab.] And he said ""Yeah.""  Dad was in the room, and I was aware that Dad was watching me and that I was showing off the frame I made, but I thought, fuck I deserve to show off this frame, it's gorgeous and unique, and it was hard work to make it.  So I went to where I thought the frame had been set up, and it wasn't there, someone had pushed it back further, behind sort of a curtain.  It was back further than where I thought it should be displayed.  But I saw it immediately, I mean I picked it out, even though it was dark, with the party and the people and everything.  I went and got it, and I showed the guy my frame.  And Dad came up and he took the frame out of my hand, and he said ""Now how did you do this color, right here?""  At that point the frame became different, it had some rocks inset into the bottom slab of rock, and it was more artsy, like I had done colors or sand or rocks, glued them in to the slab.  I thought he was pointing to the glue, and I thought to myself, It's JB Weld, Dad.  But then I realized he was pointing to the rocks that were inset in there, and I told him, ""Well that's mud or ashes (or something),"" and he took it and he like, hit one of the rocks that was inset to point out to me what he meant, and the rock fell out, it broke off and fell out.   He didn't even care.  It fell out, and he didn't even look for it on the ground.  He started to give the frame back to me and walk away, and I said, ""Dad wait, you knocked this rock out, and we need to find it so I can put it back in.""  And I started looking around the ground for the rock.  For some reason, although we were inside the house, the ground was covered with rocks, as if we were outside, there was gravel and sand, rocks all around, and I couldn't find the rock that had fallen out.  I wanted him to help me because he was the one who had seen the rock before he hit it, and I wasn't really sure what it had looked like, the one he knocked out.  And I got this impression that he didn't care about my frames (my creative work or my ideas), he wasn't impressed, he didn't think it was much of a business, or that it would ever do anything for me, it would never go anywhere for me, that it wasn't a worthwhile endeavor."
"246"	"(06/12/2000)"	"I lived in another place, maybe even another country.  It was night and there were other people there.  I could see between tall structures, but I did not know if they were haystacks or adobe buildings.  It started to feel like Mexico.  We were up high, like on a plateau or high desert, in a little town.  I asked one Mexican man if he wanted to become foreman or manager of our farm.  I looked over beyond him and there was some smoke.  But it looked too far off.  The other people were not concerned and we kept talking.  Then suddenly it was clear that that fire was bigger and moving quickly toward us.  We all started moving between the haystacks or adobe structures to run from the fire.  Either I had trouble running, like it was like swimming, hard to get moving fast, or else I felt like I was moving fast but upon looking around saw that everyone else was barely poking along.  I got more scared, and turned off on a side street, to find these tanks or barrels of water.  I was going to get in them and hide from the fire.  Later I came out and asked if anyone knew where a lake was near there, in case I ever needed to jump in it to get away from a fire.  Yes, they said, there's a lake up at the cemetery.  I felt funny that I did not know about this lake, like I should have known.  I pictured the lake in the cemetery in my mind.  I did know about it, I think, and had just forgotten in the scare.  But right then the place felt the most foreign to me, like another country, like Mexico.  It was more humid than Utah, greener, higher.  I was conflicted about whether or not I should have known about the lake.  Like how new was I to this place?  I was reminded of how [in reality] me and Jaroslav wanted to move to Valparaiso, Mexico."
"247"	"(??/??/2008)"	"I dreamed I was hiking. I came to a wide open place, maybe beside a lake, or maybe beside a large meadow.  There were rocks all around the edge of this open place. I looked up, and the whole sky was made of rock! It was arced, or curved, so that it was high overhead, but appeared to curve down and maybe connect with the horizon or edge of the earth. The rock sky was made of plates of rock, very large, and the hue was white to light yellow to dark yellow, almost yellow-orange. It was not one solid rock, but overlapping plates of rock.  The amazing sight filled me with euphoria and love for the canyon country I live in.  As if the thing I love the most became my whole world, completely surrounding me."
"248"	"(01/??/2009)"	"I was at work at Buck's Grill House, and the homemade ice cream flavor that night was:  dried fig, cherry, and parachute cord.  (!)  And I looked in the big bucket of ice cream that Tim had made, and there were actually small pieces of parachute cord in it (along with cherries and figs). Even in the dream I thought this was odd."
"249"	"(??/??/2009)"	"I was in Mexico, some border town, like Nogales I think. The streets were dark. It felt dangerous. I knew that drug runners and gangsters were near and running around, and I was a little scared. I saw Tania (from Pasta Jay's), and went to her. The area was a street, but there was construction or ruin around. There were big blocks of concrete, barbed wire fencing, and concertina wire.  When I was near Tania, I felt less scared. Tania pointed to an opening between or above some blocks of concrete, and I saw a huge bluebird looking at us. He was enormous, like twice the size of me. And he was looking straight at us and conscious of us. His expression was quizzical. Tania said ""he wants to kiss you."" And I jumped up, climbed on a piece of concrete, went toward him, and said ""I want to kiss the bluebird!""  I was eager to, I felt like this was a really unusual occurrence, so magical, mystical even, and that the connection would change me forever. I put my face close to his and his huge eye was looking at me as I kissed him."
