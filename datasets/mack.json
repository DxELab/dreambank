    "description": "In the late 1990s, Mack was a 21-year-old college student who almost never remembered dreams.  However, he was an open and inquiring student who hoped to go to graduate school in experimental psychology, so he made a strong effort to write down every dream he could recall for a two-month period as part of an exercise in a psychology class.  The result is a series of 38 dreams that he found to reflect many of his waking interests and concerns.  He reported that his dream recall disappeared again when the study was over, which fits with studies showing how important motivation is for dream recall for many people."
