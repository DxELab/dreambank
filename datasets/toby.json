    "description": "Toby is a young man in his early 20s who attends college in a beach town. He is the ultimate party animal in his dreams. Plenty of drugs (usually marijuana), drinks, and women who like him.  In real life he seems to be a happy-go-lucky kind of guy who is very easy going and usually smiling. It could well be that women like him as much in real life as he thinks they do in his dreams -- not that he is without qualms and tensions as he parties along.  This is the most recent series we have, from early 2006."
