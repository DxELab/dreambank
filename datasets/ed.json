    "description": "Ed was 57 when his wife Mary died of cancer after 32 years of marriage.  When he dreamed about her shortly after her death in June of 1980, he experienced it as a precious moment of being with her, and wrote it down.  Two months later, he dreamed about her again, and wrote that one down too.  Soon he found himself writing down every dream in which she appeared.  In the first 22 years after her death, he wrote down 143 dreams -- as few as two in one year, as many as 14 in another.  The dreams have much in common with other dreams of deceased loved ones.  In a few early dreams she comes back to life or provides him with reassurance that she is doing well.  Many dreams are about the time of her final illness, but others are  about their earlier  life together,  providing a portrait of a marriage.  For the dreamer's reflections (written in 1996) on his feelings toward Mary, his thoughts about their marriage,  and the cast of characters in the dreams (all names are fictional), click here."
