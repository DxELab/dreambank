"104-01"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-01 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-18] Dreamed I was in my computer room in the basement, trying to write a letter, to my friend H, trying to decide whether to put it in Braille or on tape. Then was sitting in front of the window, opening the curtains to feel how warm the sun was then turned back to the computer and could hear opera music from a radio station coming through the computer speaker."
"104-02"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-02 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-18] I dreamed I was riding on a bus, thinking we were on the same route that my brother had taken me to get to his boat along a river and we were going around a sharp curve and almost overturned. Also dreamed of being in my attic, moving around up there then trying to find my way back to the steps that come down from the attic. Also dreamt about going up in an elevator, trying to get up to someone's apartment and feeling the elevator for Braille and finding, no I was feeling for room numbers and finding several room numbers on each plaque instead of just one and was confused and didn't know where to go."
"104-03"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-03 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-19] I was doing the dinner dishes, my daughter and her boyfriend called to say that they had left a pitcher of milk on the drainer and for me to put it away. Then there was breakfast that I was cleaning up after and my wife had made me 2 cups of tea and I had just, I remember taking the teabags out of both cups and dumping them in the sink and then putting sugar in the tea from the sugarbowl and the spoon I was using was bent so that the spoon part was bent downward and I had to tilt the spoon way back to keep the sugar from running out."
"104-04"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-04 (M-C-T-45/45) I dreamed I was in a room, I think it was a livingroom, talking to a woman, maybe somebody from church, about classical music, and I was walking across the room carrying a big pop bottle, like a 2 liter bottle only bigger, quite a bit bigger, I was carrying it vertically in front of me, walking across, and she was telling me that her husband likes classical music and I said ""I love classical music, especially music that's soft and seductive, and I used to hate classical music"" and then we named a couple of programs and she said he liked ""The Black Jar"" and I had never heard of that program, but in the dream I said ""oh yeah, I like that program too"" and I started to tell her that I liked a program, I said ""Hearts in Space"" but that wasn't the name of it5/20/97."
"104-05"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-05 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-22] The only dream I remember is a very explicit sexual dream. I was with my wife, and I won't go into detail, but we were talking, and somebody knocked on the door and I went to open the door and I turned sideways so that whoever it was wouldn't see me completely, that's it. We were in the bedroom, making love, doing a lot of things. I was involved in some oral activity and we were talking about trying a different position, she was going to get on top of me which would be highly unusual for us. There was a knock on the door and it was my daughter saying that it was time to go to the hospital to deliver her baby, which in real life, she since has. When I opened the door and realized that I was standing there in my underwear with an erection, I turned aside so that she would be unable to see me."
"104-06"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-06 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-24] I was coming out of the subway and I met somebody, a man who knew me and he said, ""come on, I'll walk with you through the subway, and somebody else came up and they said hello to each other and he said ""kiss me on both cheeks, a brassa"" and they kissed. I laughed and made a comment about it being strange, 2 guys kissing, and then I thought, that was funny, I shouldn't have said that because one of them is not a guy, one of them is S, a friend of mine from Delaware. The next thing I knew, I was walking with her and I said I had just come from the airport and asked her what she was doing and she said that she wasn't going home until tomorrow so I said ""lets go to lunch."" Then we were at this school for blind children and I thought we would just go downstairs to the snackbar and have lunch, and we decided not to do that, and I said that there was a pizza shop down the street and she said ""well I saw a McDonalds down there"" so we started walking and immediately we were at the McDonalds and we went in and somebody was frying doughnuts and I could hear someone saying that they were using all this grease to fry the doughnuts and you could hear them sizzling because of the cheap grease they were using, the donuts weren't good for you to eat, and then the lady said something about the food that was ready and I thought it was mine and I hadn't even ordered yet and finally I did order and that was the end of the dream."
"104-07"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-07 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-25] Just came home from the grocery store and was picking up different bottles of aftershave I had bought and was putting them away. I could smell the Old Spice and wondered why I had bought it because I was tired of it and I already had some but I bought it anyway. I had also bought 2 other kinds of aftershave and I remember smelling them and putting them away."
"104-08"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-08 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-26] We were on vacation with my cousin G, I haven't seen him in years, we went mountain climbing and went up a very rigorous climb that was almost too much for me. We made it to the top, to a little precarious ledge, we were sitting on this thing and all I had to hold onto was a plastic pole, stuck down into this soft, earthy ground, and one little place to put one foot to keep me from falling back down the mountain. I was sitting there thinking how difficult it was and I was scared up there and then my wife was beside me and she said that my twin brother T was down at the bottom, in tears, he was lying down, he just couldn't make it and he was upset and it was just too much for him, and my cousin came up, just walked right up and was having a good time and was talking to us and we told him, we admitted it was just too much for us and he apologized and said he was really sorry and that he just hadn't realized. Then, I remember I had a big 2 liter pop bottle and I was telling my wife some sort of story, explaining to her how much the bottle cost... ""it was $1.29"" or something like that and here's what happened to it I just threw it off the mountain and it went crashing down to the bottom somewhere. Then we talked for a while. Then there was someone else there, I don't know who it was, but when we were talking about how difficult it was he said, ""well I believe in giving it the old Marine try, that means you ask God for help 101 times and usually that works."" I was thinking about that. Then we decided to go back down and in going back down, I found that there was a paved way that we could make it, very easily, it was just like a steep slope going down, like a sidewalk. So we went back down, and we were in a house and my cousin was still there and I found this old knife that I wanted to have sharpened. And the blade was split at the tip so it had 2 points, like a fork almost, it was split right in the middle and my cousin showed me, he said ""come right on down this other little slope to this ledge"", this was still in the house though. He had somehow used the computer to create a vibration so that when I took this knife and held it against the flat surface of the cement, it was vibrating like crazy, and I was able to sharpen the blade by holding it for quite a long while, like 5 minutes on each side, flipping it over, feeling the edge to make sure it was getting sharp and then E, my wife, was lying down right next to us on the couch, trying to sleep and she began to complain about the noise it was making and how it would wake up the neighbors and she said ""you know how these people around here swear!"" And I said ""I don't care, its not making that much noise and they were going to have to put up with it or I might just have to stab somebody! Once I had this thing sharpened"" And we all had a good laugh at that. I remember thinking that I've got to get my cousin to explain to me how he did that, how he was able top do that with the computers, setting up that field that would make this knife vibrate."
"104-09"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-09 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-27] A friend of my daughters came to visit and I said hello to her and I gave her a great big hug which I have never done in my life and probably never will."
"104-10"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-10 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-28] I was in a mobile home, decided to go have a cup of tea, on the way into the kitchen, I got deluged with some water or something and I stepped in it and it sprayed almost up to my face and I remember thinking that I had almost hit my eye with it. I thought, did the dog wet on the floor, or, I couldn't figure out what it was, and then I walked into the kitchen, and I was in bare feet and didn't have any clothes on and I was walking around in there, touching the refrigerator, and the sink and I was thinking, ""boy, I hope there's nothing faulty in here, nothing electrical or I'm going to get shocked because I was in bare feet and it was a tile floor, water on the floor. I walked over too the stove and put the tea kettle on and the electric stove on and was heating up the tea, and went back into the other room and all of a sudden heard this really loud noise, super loud, vibrating noise and at first I thought it was an airplane, I couldn't figure out what it was but it was shaking the whole house, and then it subsided and we never did figure out what it was."
"104-11"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-11 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-29] I was at the Pittsburgh Blind Association I think it was, and was sitting beside a man, a friend of mine who was being forced out of his job, he used to be the assistant manager there and he was just sitting there biding his time because there was no work for him to do, he was ready to retire and had been waiting for that to happen, he was on the telephone, talking to somebody, then he got off and then I was on the phone talking to somebody, was talking to him about cassette recorders and he was saying to me that the only problem with this cassette recorder is that you can only put ""one resistor battery"" in it, whatever that means. Then I remember that my son was supposed to come pick me up but he was out running around. Then I was on a bus, talking to this woman who was a friend of mine but who is dead, and she wasn't dead at that point, I was talking to her about nothing in particular. Then I got off the bus and was walking, holding on to the bus driver's arm with one hand, somebody else with the other and they were both going in different directions, trying to pull me in different directions and I was laughing and said to the bus driver ""hey, you guys know you're pulling me in 2 different directions?"" So I let go of one of them and walked with him. The next thing I knew there was a cab that I was in with a friend of mine, and we were supposed to get dropped off on the south side but he accidentally dropped us off on the north side. The driver got out and was walking with us, realized we were on the north side. The cabby apologized and we got back in the cab and the driver told us he would take us where we wanted to go."
"104-12"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-12 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-30] I was looking for books from a Braille Bible and I had to give some kind of report or do something in church, was looking for a particular book and was having trouble finding it. My friend S was there and while I was feeling around on the shelves trying to find the books I happened to notice there was a nice bugle on the floor. It seemed to have 2 bells on it instead of just one. I thought to myself, ""Ooh, as soon as I'm done finding these books I've got to ask S about playing that bugle, see what it sounds like."""
"104-13"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-13 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-30] Then I dreamed I was sitting in front of my wife who was in a reclining chair and we were talking and started kissing and my son was supposed to be going to an amusement park later that morning ands I was asking her how he was going to get there. She said she was not riding him and we began to make plans for the rest of the day. I was thinking that we would be alone later and that it would be a good time to get some lovemaking in."
"104-14"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-14 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-01] I was walking with my cane and I started to cross the street and a man and a lady started to help me, seemed like one was holding onto each of my arms and as we crossed I kept thinking that the man was getting too close to me, I could feel the front of him bump against me and I thought he's closer than he should be and it kind of repulsed me and I wanted to get away from him. Then, we got across the street and there was some sort of barrier where they were doing some kind of work. There was a wooden plank there and the people who were doing the work said that they had just finished and that they would open it up so I could walk across. They removed the barrier but left the wooden plank there. I walked across, actually along it, it was following a sidewalk. Then I found myself in someone's house who lives in an alley near us, I have no idea who she was. I found myself sitting at her table and I had a bag with me that had 3 peaches in it. I was sitting at her table, eating her peaches and I couldn't believe the size of the seeds in those peaches, they were just huge! I thought; ""these can't be peaches, these have to be some other kind of fruit, because the seeds are just way bigger than they should be."" And they didn't even taste like peaches, they were more like figs or some other kind of fruit."
"104-15"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-15 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-06] I was with my brother, most of the time, sometimes it may have been my so in, I was walking down this path and I came to this wooden bridge and I walked to the end but was afraid to go any further because I thought that it might go into the water. My brother called me back and said ""come on, you've got to come back this other way. There was a shed there, a really small, wooden house of a thing, and I could get into it but there was no opening to get out of the other side to get out. He kept calling me and saying ""you've got to come through here, this is the only way to get through here to get back."" I said ""Well, I didn't have to come through here going down, why do I have to go through here going back?"" and he said, ""well, you just have to. Its too far to go around it."" He insisted that I try to get out of this thing and the wood in it was all old and rotted, so I started ripping pieces of it off, until I made room for me to get out. And I kept tearing at it and finally managed to make a space big enough for me to crawl out and drop down to the ground on the other side if it. I felt really guilty about it, thinking ""boy, I'm really tearing this place up"" and I asked my brother if he thought anybody saw me and he said ""yeah! A lot of people did."" And I asked him what that shed was for and he said ""That's where they do people's taxes."" And I felt bad about this and I thought I should really find out who owns this and pay them for ripping it up even though it was in bad shape. Then we were on a bicycle and we were going really fast along these roads, I was riding on the back of it, leaning back on what I remember used to be called a sissy bar. My brother was peddling and we were going so fast it was almost as if we were on a motorcycle. It was a bike though, it was so quiet and he just seemed to be peddling it effortlessly. I remember saying to him ""Let's stop at Butler's store on the way home and get something to drink, like a pop or something."" The next thing I knew we were in some doctor's office and it had something to do with taxes but they were doing a kind of cursory examination of people and there was a couple across from us we were talking to. A woman came out of the inner office and called me instead of my brother but it was my brother that was supposed to be examined. She called J but I said, ""no, its T that you want, his name is T"" so he went in with her and I was talking to the couple and I was explaining to them how my brother and I used to go for a few beers when we were young and how we used to drink it by the quart sometimes and all this stuff. And then the man and the woman started to say that they were going to go to a restaurant and get something to eat. He said ""Honey, if there was a restaurant near here I would go right now and get us something to eat."
"104-16"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-16 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-07] I dreamed that I was thinking about how I am different at work because of my blindness and how I'll never be like other people. The next thing I know, I was standing at the kitchen sink eating out of the sink with a fork and I knew exactly what I was eating, I could taste it even. We have some noodles with vegetables, like a pasta salad, that you just put in a microwave and mix with water and heat up. I was eating that out of the sink and I was thinking to myself I shouldn't be eating out of the sink, that's not very sanitary, I should be using a plate, but then I thought, well, I'm blind and that's why I'm eating out of the sink."
"104-17"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-17 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-08] I was in a meeting with a bunch of blind people, all friends of mine, and I said to one of them ""I forgot to bring my slate and stylus,"" which is what we write with, and the person next to me said that I could borrow hers and asked if I would take the notes from the meeting with it. I agreed to. The slate was really unusual, it had an extra metal piece in it and the stylus had a plastic flange coming out of both sides of it, and I thought ""Boy that's really ingenious, that way if you drop it it won't roll away"". So I began to take notes and I could feel the heaviness of the Braille paper, heavier than what I normally use, and I thought ""well, I guess I can do it this one time"" and I wrote a few things down. Then a male friend, J from [Piedmont] came in, and although I didn't hear his voice, I could hear people greeting him and I got the feeling that he wasn't feeling real well. Then I was outside walking in front of the AT&T building with my new graphite cane which I recently got, and it kept pulling to the left toward the building, almost as if it were a divining rod or something, and I thought that was really strange and I got back in the meeting and I started telling everybody ""boy, you know, this new graphite cane really wanted to come into this building, I could feel it pulling towards the left as I walked across in front of the building."""
"104-18"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-18 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-09] All I could remember was 2 women walking with me somewhere and giving me some assistance and then we were in a car, I was in the front seat with them, there were four people in the front seat, 1 person to my left and 2 women to my right. I remember thinking ""that's odd, there's 4 people in the front seat and there seems to be room for all of us."""
"104-19"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-19 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-11] We were on a trip somewhere and we made a stop to go to the restrooms. I went into this huge place and was trying to find the urinals and I was having trouble finding them and I think that at one point I had no clothes on, and I didn't quite understand that. I was wandering around in this big square room. At one point my wife came to the door and asked if I was ready to go and I said ""I'd be another minute"" and I went back in and tried to find a urinal, and I couldn't, and finally some man inside there helped me find it and I went to the bathroom and went back out and got in the car and we went back on our way to wherever we were going. And then I remember the reason we were at this place was to take a urine specimen which I was supposed to bring with me and didn't. So I tried to make a joke I kept calling ""I forgot my pee! I forgot my pee!"" and everyone was laughing but they weren't going to go back there for it and I thought it was really bad that I'd left it there."
"104-20"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-20 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-11] Another sexual dream. I dreamed that I was lying in bed and was touching my wife, and she was getting excited, actually came to climax and I said ""we have to get up and go to the bathroom before we continue."" Apparently I must have had to go pretty badly, with those 2 dreams but I could remember it very clearly, how I was touching her, her breathing and all that."
"104-21"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-21 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-12] I was at a Council of the Blind meeting and I realized I had been sleeping and I realized that I was secretary and should have been taking notes. I didn't know what to do, I didn't have a tape recorder with me, I hadn't been paying attention, and I didn't even have a slate and stylus. I thought, ""should I borrow one from somebody?"" ^Then T, one of the other members told me that he wanted me to remind him of something, because he had to do it and I thought I didn't know how I was going to do this. I was just appalled that I had been sitting there sleeping in the meeting."
"104-22"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-22 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-12] I tried to check the time on my talking clock (and, by the way I have had this dream numerous times over the past few years) but the clock malfunctioned, either the battery was going dead or something, and when I pressed the button for the time it started to say a bunch of things about the computer keyboard, and it was just not acting the way it should at all. I knew there was something wrong with it and I was afraid I had slept in and missed my wake-up time for work."
"104-23"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-23 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-13] I was in the rearmost seat of a station wagon, where the seat faces back out of the rear of the car. I was sitting on the driver's side and sitting to my left was my Brother in law D from Kentucky. He was driving the vehicle and I remember thinking ""boy, I wonder how he's driving this thing from all the way over here in the back."" I could tell by his voice that he was turning his head around to look forward to see what's going on but he was talking to me. For the most part we were just riding along and he was looking at me mostly and yet he was able to control the car."
"104-24"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-24 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-13] Something vague about a 12 gauge shotgun. Either I or somebody else was holding it straight up in the air and had fired it. I wasn't shooting at anybody, I was just shooting it."
"104-25"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-25 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-13] I went into this nut shop I used to go into to buy peanuts and cashews and things and I went in and thought, ""boy this place is really small, they must have changed it around"" which was really weird because they had just taken up half the space that used to belong to Wiener World [which in reality is about a half block away on the other side of an alley] and made the nut shop really big, but now its small again. I went in and talked to the person, trying to decide what kind of nuts I wanted and I couldn't think of anything that sounded good because it was early in the morning and I didn't want peanuts and I didn't want any other kind, but I asked him though, if they had anything they could mix with chocolate covered raisins and they said they didn't have anymore chocolate covered raisins."
"104-26"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-26 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-16] I had to cross an intersection, turn left and cross the other way and instead of walking, I got down on my knees and was crawling across and I was thinking ""boy, I can hear the traffic better this way than if I was standing up, but it's really hard to go fast enough to make it across before the light changes."" I got across and began to turn left and my friend M was there, who is also blind in reality, and he started to tell me ""you're going the wrong way, we're going the wrong way."" And I said, ""This is 4th avenue here isn't it?"" and I insisted on going that way and I knew I was right but he kept trying to get me to go the other way."
"104-27"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-27 (M-C-T-45/45) Another sexual dream. I was with my wife in my room, having some foreplay, and I can remember what she felt like and smelled like. Then somehow we got interrupted by someone or something and I had to get up again and go to the door or something. I remember getting up and then getting back in bed and trying to pick up where we left off."
"104-28"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-28 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-19] I am with my son at some school activity and we were supposed to meet with some important person, maybe the principal, I'm not sure who, but she wanted to meet with us in 5 minutes and she said it was very important that we be on time, but I had to stop and go to the bathroom, and my son wanted to stop and do a few other things, and I kept thinking we've got to hurry up."
"104-29"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-29 (M-C-T-45/45) I dreamt about smoking a cigar and what a bad taste it left in my mouth. I thought that I shouldn't even be smoking it because it didn't taste good, and I wasn't enjoying it."
"104-30"	"(M-C-T-45/45)"	"#104-30 (M-C-T-45/45) [1997-05-20] I had to go for a physical and I remember getting there, my wife drove us up, I was supposed to be there at 1:00 and it was 2 minutes to 1:00 when we got there. I checked my watch and said ""this is great, we're right on time, its a good thing we left when we did."" We got in there and the nurse took me and had me step up on a scale, was weighing me. Then I got up on the table and the doctor came in, he had a deep voice. I remember the sound of his shoes walking, he had a nice firm walk He came in and started talking to me and gave me a shot I asked him what kind of shot it was and he said ""It's an ACD shot."" My wife is a nurse (in reality) and we were trying to figure out what kind of shot that was. She said she didn't know. He gave me the shot in the upper part of my left arm and it was somewhat painful and I sort of winced a little bit, but I said it didn't hurt that badly. I asked him what it was and he said it was a cardiac shot, maybe hepatitis, I asked what the A was for and he said that was a shot for marijuana. I asked what he meant, and he said ""it lessens the effect of marijuana if you smoke it."" I laughed and said ""Oh great! Now I'll have to smoke twice as much marijuana."" And he laughed and I said ""no, I don't smoke marijuana"" [in reality, not for the last 25 years] . Then, while I was still on the table, there was a loud buzz, a doorbell, but the person rang it excessively long and it was excessively loud, and the doctor groaned ""oh boy"" but he went to the door and opened it. Then this man with a very effeminate voice came in and said he had flowers to deliver and the doctor said ""Oh gosh! Those weren't supposed to be delivered here!"" Then he called to his nurse ""Bevvv! Come in here and take care of this, these are supposed to be delivered (I think he said) to my wife."" So she came in and took care of the man with the flowers. The next thing I remember I was out in my backyard sitting at a picnic table eating dinner with my mother and some other people. My mother was sitting right to my right. I don't remember what we were eating, but the yard was kind of sloped down and we were back towards the end of it and we were sitting there eating and talking. I mentioned to my mother that I had had a shot and said ""I bet I could probably drink beer now and I bet I could have a few now."" [Reality, I have been a recovering and sober alcoholic for 14 years] And my mother said ""Oh, I don't know what I would do if I started to find beer bottles and found out that you were drinking again."" I started to laugh and said ""well, you know there have been a number of times when I've had a few! It doesn't really bother me if I just drink beer and don't drink too much."" She didn't sound too believing but said ""oh, that's interesting."" My thoughts and been that maybe if this shot for marijuana was effective, it might allow me to drink like a regular drinker without having any bad effects from it. My mother left. They had all left and gone somewhere. I was by myself, and I thought I had better start cleaning up the dishes and I picked up my plate and I had a glass which I left there, and started to walk. I heard a splash and realized that I was right along side of a river and I didn't want to fall in the river, and I couldn't exactly remember which way I had to go to get up to my house. I was pretty sure I could feel that the land sloped a little bit, and I thought I was okay and so I started to walk in generally the right direction, but I sort of veered off to the side of my yard and got tangled up in some bushes that are there. I kept walking and at one point I brushed against a wire antenna that I have in my back yard in reality and I remember thinking ""boy this thing is really hanging too low. I should get a pole to prop up the middle with"" I kept walking and got myself straightened out and got up to the top near my house, where a patio is and a dishwasher was there, and I started to put my plate inside the dishwasher, and I was going to go back and get some more when I started to hear all these voices from inside my basement. It was my neighbor E from across the street, with a bunch of people and they were talking, it was as if she was giving them a tour of my house. Then she came out and started thanking me and then my mother came out and she thanked us both for being such nice people and being such good help. I remember saying ""E you're always welcome."" Then she was leaving."

There seemed to be many familiar people in the class with me and the instructor was very friendly and it seemed as if I was sitting in the front of the room and he was sitting in the back, and he came up to me and said ""I was going to buy you an ""Opticon"" but the administration wouldn't let me, they cost $6000 but I brought you a Braille writer and I bought you all this other stuff and I just wondered if you were familiar with it because you are going to need them in this class."" I remember thinking ""I'm glad he didn't buy an Opticon because I don't remember how to use one. So I began to unpack the box he gave me, and there did appear to be an Opticon and had a little hand held camera with it. A little box that had something similar to a little Braille display, maybe a one line Braille display, maybe an Opticon. I started taking out this thing and all the accessories that came with it and I was amazed at the different plugs and cords and there were adapters like standard serial port adapters for computers, there were some that were offset between the male and female end of it. There were some wires with like plastic keys hanging off of them. My co-worker, M happened to be there then and she said ""Oh, this is interesting, you could probably stick this in a car's ignition to start it if you happened to lose your key."" We had a laugh about that. I just kept looking at these different pieces. There was one piece that I fitted onto the back of the machine with a little flange, it was some sort of little plug. Throughout the dream everything seemed pretty familiar to me and I seemed to know what everything was for. Then M said she had to go and do an interview and I said ""where's everybody else?"" and she said ""I have no idea, they all left at 8:00 and they just left at 8:00 and I'm left with the work to do."" [An Opticon is a device which converts printed material into tactile images that actually feel like the printed letters. It has largely gone out of vogue for the last 15 or 20 years.]"

And we were talking about Q&A and WordPerfect and I forgot to run my speech program and was having trouble figuring out where I was and she was kind of helping me. In the dream his daughter, who in reality is 40 sounded like she was 20. Next I remember being at the Guild for the Blind in Hingeville. I was walking through there smoking a pipe and the tobacco smelled really good, like cinnamon [I haven't smoked a pipe in 10 years in reality] . I was walking through there talking to some people and all of a sudden I could hear all these little kids coming in and somebody came over to me and said ""do you hear the fire?"" At first I said no, but then I heard some sirens off in the distance. They said it was next door at a restaurant which I remember having been in before. Then my wife was there and she was looking and I asked ""How bad does it look?"" and she said ""Oh, it's really a bad fire! A good one, really ablaze."" Then she took me over there and we walked into the driveway and we could hear the men up above, working away on the roof. One of the firefighters yelled down ""What are you doing here? Get out of here now!"" And I responded ""I'm just glad I had a chance to hear this."" I asked my wife again how it looked and she still said that it looked pretty bad. Then rain started to fall on us but it may have been water from the hose. I said, lets get out of this or we'll have to go home and take a bath. I also remember at some point, being able to smell the smoke, it had a rather acrid smell typical of house fires."

Some kid was lost and they were looking for his mother. But the kid was speaking Spanish, not English. I heard a woman say something to the kid which I understood to mean ""Can I pick you up?""

Then someone came into our room and was talking about coffee. We said that we'd like to go get a cup and she said ""well, I already made it for you, it's right here."" She handed me a cup and it was hot and the top felt like the bottom and so I turned it upside down and that top felt like the bottom too, and I thought I was going to spill it, that there must have been a lid on it so I turned it over again and felt it and there was this flat disc that was there instead of the top. I asked what it was there for, ""to keep the heat in?"" And she said, ""no, it's to muddy it up a little bit."" I tasted it and it was okay but there were some coffee grinds in it. Then there was no longer a woman there but a man and he said ""well we put onion in the coffee and it makes it taste better."" And I was tasting it and it did taste pretty good. Then I thought, I should turn on my radio and tune across the FM band and see what the local stations and programs are like. Then we were thinking about going on a tour somewhere and we asked the woman if there were any tourist attractions that we can walk to from here.

I was feeling all the different coats, even reached into the pocket of one of them which felt similar to mine, and I found a bunch of balled up papers and different things and I realized that it wasn't my coat. I had to go through the whole coat rack one coat after another until I found mine. They all seemed to feel the same and I had a cab waiting for me so I was really in a hurry to go. I finally did find it, it was way over on the right hand end of the coat rack, probably took five minutes to go through all of the coats [That has never happened to me, I can usually reach right over and feel the texture of my coat.] So I went downstairs and I remember thinking ""Oh, at least the cab is coming right here for me I don't have to walk a couple blocks to meet it."" The next thing I knew, I was at the Blind Association and I walked in. I couldn't remember exactly which way to go. The more I thought about it the more it seemed like the school for blind children that I went to as a kid, than the blind association. But I got there and was walking and one of the women who worked there was kind of helping me and she said ""now we turn to the right here"" then she grabbed me and said ""its very narrow here"" she thought I was going to bump into something. Then we ended up in a big open reception area in the front and again I was waiting for this cab. I don't know how I got to the Blind association but she said, I was right next to this big window in the front of the place, she said ""sit here in this prom chair"" and I said ""boy, I bet I'm less nervous today then when I went to the prom."" Then we started talking about the prom and I said that neither of my kids had ever gone to the prom. I remember going to the bath room and then coming out and they said, ""Your cab was here but he didn't want to wait so he went to have lunch at the restaurant next door and he'll be back to pick you up.""

Part of this whole process was they insisted, that I have to have a drink, and I said ""I don't drink, I'll have a Coke"" and the guy at the bar said here, I'll give you just what they ordered for you and I tasted it and it was just straight whiskey on the rocks and I thought ""Boy, this really tastes good, and I don't care if I don't drink or if 'm an alcoholic, I'm going to drink this stuff anyway.

I didn't know if he had died or if the police had picked him up or what happened. Then for some reason I went in to take a shower and the place was really a pit. The tub was small, and instead of being rectangular the way they usually are, it was really high but it was square. It wasn't very big, I remember climbing up to get into it and the tub kind of moved and I thought ""Man, this place just isn't put together very well. I had a hard time getting the curtain closed, and I got shampoo all over my head and the water pressure was so minimal, I could hardly rinse out the shampoo or get my head washed. I was in a hurry and this KH's dad, who I remember as a kid as a real pervert came in and was talking to me and I thought ""This guy's going to rape me or something, I've got to get out of here."" And he said something like ""there's water coming out, you better turn the shower off."" And I did, I got out and the next thing I knew, I was outside walking with my son and we had a summons that we had to appear in court that afternoon. I'm not sure what it was for, it had something to do with this incident from the night before I think. It was on really slimy paper, slimy and greasy, like it had Crisco or something all over it.

My brother in law Moe, who doesn't live with his wife anymore, in fact lives in another town, was there and he was directing me, telling me where to put my feet without trampling the hedges to get the garbage cans out of there and I ended up spilling all of the garbage out of the full one and I knew that I would have to ask him to help me pick up the garbage."

There were a whole bunch of books in there...This book had something to do with health and I also think it had something to do with life in general, politics, whatever, the more I think about it , the more I think it might have been ""The way things ought to be"" by Rush Limbaugh and I remember taking it out and the weirdest thing was that parts of it was in Braille and parts of it were on tape.

I remember picking up the stones and just hurling them violently at these dogs, making every attempt to kill them and feeling very good about it and the dogs were barking. I cannot remember them trying to come after me. Especially this one dog, and from his bark it seemed like a very big dog, a big bark, but it stayed its distance and I must have hit it which I could do only with luck in real life. They didn't run away from the stones that I was pelting them with. I'm not particularly a dog lover but I certainly wouldn't want to harm the animal."

It seemed as if I was the only one among these strangers. Mary wasn't here and it seems no matter how hard I try I couldn't find any familiar people on the plane. There we were flying along, way up there at 30 or 40,000 feet wherever they fly and I knew that plane was going down. I felt the plane lurch and there were strange noises and the plane tipped at about a 60 degree angle down into the earth, I could feel the pressure on my head and neck and the pressure of my head just being pushed into my body, and my body being pressed forward against the seat belt. And I could remember saying ""I guess we'll see you later! See you in the next world!"" and that was the end of it. The reality of that dream lives with me today and I get little shivers when I think about that dream I could hear the people's voices and screams when the plane tipped up that way."

I remember being around where there was a lot of dirt, we were outside and why I knew that it was going to explode, I don't know. It was warm outside and I felt the dirt.

A tornado was coming. I said ""oh boy!"" And we just drive right into it and all of a sudden we're picked up and we're driving and we're spinning around in the air.

I dreamed that the walls of the cabin were falling in on us. I was screaming in my sleep (according to witnesses) for everyone to get up and wake up and get out of the cabin because the walls were falling in. And no one wanted to go out in the rain. I remember trying to hold up the walls with my hands, but it was only the thunder making me dream that way I guess."

You need room to fly to move a plane around and so the pilot just took it outside and landed it but I don't know where it landed. It tried to land somewhere downstairs (in the living room)."

It seems as if the forms were something which we should have filled out before we got there. Apparently everyone there had to fill out these forms and before we could get there to this place, it might have been summer, it was warm out, may have had something to do with camp.

I knew if anyone fell it would be dangerous because the stairs were very onerous. I went down into what seemed like a sub basement, the railings were rough and loose, and there was a lady there who used to help us her name was V. She was with me in the dream, helping us as she always did. It seemed that we looked at a lot of clothes, a lot of different things. I'm thinking that it might have been an old Sears store, of yesteryear. Nothing looked new. The clothes were on these racks that felt wooden, everything was an old style store. And then we walked up and out and when we got up these winding stairs on the street level, the dream just faded away...I don't remember buying anything. It seemed we were there for a very long time.
