    "description": "\"The Physiologist,\" whose real name was Percy G. Stiles (1875-1936) was a 22-year-old graduate student at Boston Tech (later known as MIT), when he decided to write down all the dreams he could remember (out of scientific curiosity) between October 24, 1897, and January 9, 1898, a total of 46 dreams, and then 40 more that he deemed noteworthy for one reason or another from 1898 to 1918, a total of 86 dreams in all. It is the earliest carefully kept dream journal we have. At the least, this is one set of dreams that no one can say was influenced by the theories of Freud or Jung.
