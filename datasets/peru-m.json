    "description": "These dreams were collected from 48 male and 48 female college students (ages 18 to 20) in Lima, Peru, in 1970 by Susana Urbina as part of her work toward a Ph.D. in psychology from Fordham University in 1972. Each student turned in eight dream reports over a period of two weeks to three months.  Urbina, now a professor of psychology at the University of Northern Florida, translated the dreams into English. The findings from her work can be found in the following article: Urbina, S. P., & Grey, A. (1975). Cultural and Sex Differences in the Sex Distribution of Dream Characters. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 6, 358-364."
