"0024"	"(2003-03-15 (12)) I went to Farrah's new house. Someone said something about a Neopets march, so we went in the car to find it, but we got lost. I met Billy Boyd. The end of the line was really far and was in the street. We got Pocket Neopets."
"0025"	"(2003-04-22 (12)) I was friends with Eric Christian Olsen and a boy and a girl. I was going out with Eric, but the girl didn't know. We were on this small island with about 20 houses. We were standing in a driveway. The girl left and Eric said to the boy ""She doesn't know me and Izzy are going out"". Ezra was flying a plane and dropping bombs that were exploding about 2-3m away. He was trying to bomb us."
"0026"	"(2003-04-26 (12)) There was a prom. We were at West Whitehall and I was going out with Eric Christian Olsen. Sometimes everyone was called to my block and we had to stand in two lines with our prom partner and me and Eric had to say something. No-one knew we were going out and we stayed away from each other during school. I sat with Farrah and some of her friends near her block. There was a spooky thing happening in the block. We couldn't go in or we would die. I looked because I heard someone crying. I ran away and this thing came out. Charlene and I ran near our block. Charlene, Eric and I were in some water."
"0027"	"(2003-04-26 (12)) We were at a haunted house. I got separated from Eric Christian Olsen and I was really upset. This thing kept killing people and they melted into a white blob thing."
"0028"	"(2003-04-26 (12)) Dinosaurs were alive and were killing everyone. We were at Mom's house and this guy who made the dinosaurs told me and Eric Christian Olsen to call for pizza. We rang people to get rid of the dinosaurs. Then we were somewhere else, outside, throwing flares at the dinosaurs, and we ran out of them so we threw nuggets at a plateosaurus -- which was actually a good dinosaur and helped us get rid of the rest of the dinosaurs."
"0029"	"(2003-05-23 (12)) I was in the future and the world was really weird. I got out of some thing in the ground. I became friends with this popular girl. She liked boys with big lips. We were at a shop. She said ""when our lips met"" and I thought she was talking about Aron, but she was talking about Gavin. He said something and I was really angry."
"0030"	"(2003-07-16 (12)) I was at home out the back, around the side of the house. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) had to go somewhere and he went down a toilet. I was really upset. A little while later, I was in the big shed and I was doing a spell to get him back. He came back and looked pretty annoyed. But it wasn't because of me because we started making out near the wall across from the shed."
"0031"	"(2003-07-16 (12)) Dad had all the Children of the Corn movies on DVD and a Vault of Horror movie. Farrah, Ramona and I went to some old lady's house, I can't remember what we did, but we then pretended to be asleep. They believed that I was asleep but Ramona and Farrah said that we weren't asleep."
"0032"	"(2003-07-16 (12)) I was in some caravan and everyone was in groups which were parts of the body. Charlene and Farrah were staying there too. I didn't have any clothes on but they were wrapped around me. This lady came up to me and two boys and said that we should join the vagina group. You have to touch the part they say to join. We got in trouble for saying no. These little beds were in one corner and there were lots of blankets. Under my breath, I said ""Stupid cow"". As I was getting dressed (I covered myself) I heard someone say ""Look what that kid's wearing!"" and I looked up and saw Eli (Children of the Corn 3)."
"0033"	"(2003-07-17 (12)) We were at a hotel thing for school races. I was sharing a room with Tatu (the band) and Katherine Heigl. School races were on bikes or foot. It was really hot. Outside there were these rock things and a little tower. I won each time (3). Tatu, Katherine Heigl and I snuck into some guy's bedroom (I think it was Brendan Fehr's) to find something for Katherine. I got bored and left. Tatu hid under the bed. I left and saw Brendan coming so I knocked on the door. Katherine got caught. Tatu got out after he left. Tatu and I got an ice-cream and we were riding our bikes. The next races were at some lady's house. They were water ones. We had water masks on. I won again. She had a blowup pool and on the second race I got stuck with someone and so we could move I said something about pools and slid into the pool and everyone clapped."
"0034"	"(2003-07-17 (12)) I was near the beach with Dad. A guy came up and asked me to be in the next Charlie's Angels movie and then the three actresses came out of a caravan, so I said ok. I was in the car with the three angels, but then Lucy Liu left. I went to the shop with Drew Barrymore and I was looking for a pocket knife, but I couldn't find one. As the shop was about to close, some old man found them."
"0035"	"(2003-07-18 (12)) I was friends with some popular girls and Farrah. We were somewhere weird, which had tunnels and you had to go into rooms and find clues. Everyone hides at some point and then this ""monster"" thing comes in and picks a hiding place. Whoever was hiding there leaves. They left me behind at the last room, but I was the one with the clue so I won."
"0036"	"(2003-07-18 (12)) I was at a party-like premiere type thing. I went up to Daniel Cerny, who was sitting at a table, and put my hand out and we walked off hand in hand."
"0037"	"(2003-07-19 (12)) I was at home, except I didn't live there, and it was extremely different. Out the back there was a huge tower (where the big shed is supposed to be). The house was huge and really high. I was in the pool room and Eli (Children of the Corn 3) and I were trying to get the ceiling to fall to kill the people in there. It did, but the people playing pool lived without injuries. We jumped down into this big pool thing. We went up to the top of the tower, and were talking about how to kill everyone. Some girls were in the room next to us, so Eli sent the floor up and it killed one of them. Eli went to kill some more people and I went up to the tower. When I went back down I went to put my shoes on and someone was asking me why I wasn't with Eli. Eli then walked past with a bag and went to the tower. I went to go up but he had blocked the stairs with a small bomb. I ran out and he came out after me, throwing them everywhere, some people were dead, but everyone else was inside. We ran to the front of the house. The house was burning and Eli and I were holding hands. We then went to a big fancy house, that had this little room that was open with a small TV on inside. We watched it until we saw someone in the bushes, so we ran out the other door, but there were lots more people. Some lady shot us with these magnet things that slow down your heart rate and makes you pass out. Eli's heart wasn't slowing, and he was breathing normally. I couldn't breathe properly and the lady was saying, about Eli, that it wasn't normal/human. I grabbed Eli's hand which gave me a boost. They took us to this lab where we passed out for about 5 seconds. It gave us a boost. We were throwing sharp things at them. I killed 6 people. I got some pins and was sticking them into people's hearts. I said to someone ""I wanna be your friend, do you like this friendship badge?"" and then as I was shoving it into them I said ""How do you like this?!"" There were screw things in some people's heads. I saw Dad (and he was being all zombie like) and we didn't hurt him. We smashed some motherboard."
"0038"	"(2003-07-19 (12)) I was pregnant and I didn't want the baby, but no-one would let me get rid of it. I had a rare disease thing which would make me get pregnant. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) and I smashed down a house and everyone in there died. We ran off."
"0039"	"(2003-07-24 (12)) I was in the car, going home from school. Eli was a new kid in the class."
"0040"	"(2003-08-10 (12)) Mathias and I sat next to each other in class. Then we went to this camp thing. Mathias and two girls went into this house and this man said something about angry school teachers. He shouted ""Eli!"" like that bloke in Children of the Corn 3. He let me stay in the house, but I had to sleep in the same bed as Mathias. We covered ourselves with raw meat to keep away wolves or something."
"0041"	"(2003-08-19 (12)) Ramona had been hanging around Gavin and while he was on the computer and I was at the listening post [Year 7 class] , she was being a cow and said to Gavin ""and I've been ruining your life too""."
"0042"	"(2003-08-20 (12)) Gavin was staying at Mom's. We got to Mom's, but Mom had to drop me off at school (it was during school) to get something. Teacher-F-04 was there and then she wouldn't let me leave. I found Gavin and we got Mom to get us (I didn't have my phone with me). We went for a walk and something happened with these kids, but I can't remember."
"0043"	"(2003-08-21 (12)) Gavin and I ran off and there was a building on fire and we kept running off together to get away from these men, but I can't remember why."
"0044"	"(2003-08-22 (12)) I was at school, and I had weird lolly/chocolate things. I was sharing them with Cedric, who was sitting next to me. I went to walk out and Gavin was acting weird, and I thought he was going to ask me out. I went into these woods and Cedric and Mathias were there chanting something. The only way to get out was by going through these puzzle rooms. I finally got out."
"0045"	"(2003-08-27 (12)) Gavin, Terrence, Tiana and some other kids were at the beach with me which was next to my house and a big shop. I went to the shop and took a big whiff of this ugly green and white nighty (which I could smell, and it smelt like this disgusting green sauce that was on some octopus that I had). It was disgusting. We were all hanging around near a stage. There was a competition going on, on the stage and Gavin kept staring at me. This thing was trying to kill us. Ezra came and followed me out of the house, so the thing saw us and we went next door to call someone."
"0046"	"(2003-08-28 (12)) We were in the library at school. Terrence said ""You like Izzy?"" to Gavin. I was right next to them with Tiana. He looked at me and said it was true. He kept staring at me."
"0047"	"(2003-09-11 (12)) Ramona and I were trying to get Gavin and Terrence to hide because these people were trying to get them. Ramona went after Terrence, so I went after Gavin. I grabbed his arm and got him down the ladder (of this playground), but then he disappeared. So did Terrence. Then we went looking for them."
"0048"	"(2003-09-11 (12)) I met up with Tiana, at this shop, who was lying on a lounge with the green blanket (from Mom's house). I went to a clothes shop (which was across from Tiana) with Mom. Classmate-F-11 was there and we were laughing about Dodo Derrick."
"0049"	"(2003-09-11 (12)) Me and Ezra had books and had to get down a weird waterslide. I got stuck in a flat bit because Ezra was sticking a book up to do something."
"0050"	"(2003-09-12 (12)) I was in the back of the car and Gavin and some mates were walking but staying right behind the car. I looked at him and he saw me. We went to a video shop and he stayed at the car. I went out to the car because I was hot. He left a note in my book about drama and how Classmate-M-13 (guy at school) had tripped someone over and some other stuff."
"0051"	"(2003-09-16 (12)) I was at some school carnival. We had a race. Gavin was sitting with me and talking to me. I saved some little kids from the big waves."
"0052"	"(2003-09-17 (12)) Cedric, Ramona, Classmate-F-10 and I were standing outside our classroom. Cedric and Ramona were doing some crime scene acting. Cedric said ""I'm home, honey!"" and leaned over and pretended to kiss Ramona, but Teacher-F-06 walked passed and he kissed her on the cheek. Cedric and Teacher-F-06 were a bit shocked, but the rest of us found it hilarious."
"0053"	"(2003-10-03 (12)) I was in an episode of Taken [I had never seen it at this point] . I was at school but it was different and these bomb things kept going off."
"0054"	"(2003-10-03 (12)) I went to the dentist and I started screaming (I don't know why) and I think I passed out because I woke up and my mouth felt funny. I told Mom I knew what she did -- while I was passed out, she had got my tooth done."
"0055"	"(2003-10-04 (12)) We were in groups (our class, different school) and I sat next to Gavin. Cedric and Mathias were also at our group. He started singing one my songs ""but everyone thinks you're straight"" (it's called 'Gay' and no-one has heard it). I started joining in as well. He kept following me around."
"0056"	"(2003-10-04 (12)) I was walking with Ramona and Tiana at some place. I told them I had a dream about some fancy king and queen and I was in a dirty singlet and it was to help some group. Tiana's brothers -- she had an older and a younger brother [she doesn't have an older brother in real life] - started jumping around singing with their shirts off."
"0057"	"(2003-10-09 (12)) I was at some weird place and I won a children's Music Idol. I bought heaps of Goosebumps books. There were lots of library things. This scarecrow man out the back had a little kitten."
"0058"	"(2003-10-10 (12)) I got bitten by a vampire and I got Mom in the car and then I flew to the car. Her window was broken. I saved her from the others. We went to a hospital and got Tim (Final Destination 2) and we had met him before. We kept running away from vampires. We went to some place and a vampire threw a needle at me, so I said that I was a vampire and showed him the bite. I got Mom out of there. A chemist blew up. We got out of the state and stayed at someone's house. These vampires could be in the light."
"0059"	"(2003-??-?? (12)) [On holiday] I was somewhere with the people from Music Idol -- I was talking with Cosima DeVito, Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll. I was in a spa with Cosima and some girl called Rosa. We were then running and hiding from some killer."
"0060"	"(2003-??-?? (12)) [On holiday] There was a chairlift, in a snowy place, and I went on it. I was with Mom and I was hanging with Guy Sebastian."
"0061"	"(2003-11-02 (12)) A few kids from my class, some I don't know and I were on a boat and it sank, but we got out. There were big waves, I got out first and helped the others. Then we were in some room with curly stairs and we were running away from someone. We tried to get on another boat."
"0062"	"(2003-11-03 (12)) Me, Ramona, Tiana and some other people were at a toy shop. I went to the back aisle and Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street) was there. I was teasing him and I did three times, then he tried to shoot me with lasers from his eyes. I ran out with Ramona and the rest following. I got out and Terrence got a hose ready and Freddy was still inside trying to shoot me. I got sick of dodging the lasers, so I screamed out in pain, and he stopped, thinking I was dead. Terrence got the hose on him and he melted, which I thought was strange since his weakness is fire."
"0063"	"(2003-11-03 (12)) I was in some weird jungle. I left a towel and water bottle there. I went back to get them. Something started chasing me."
"0064"	"(2003-11-04 (12)) I was at 'Ramona's house'. Her room had a little door that you had to slide into. I was staying over, as were Ezra, Charlene, Tiana, Gavin, Terrence and Cedric. When Charlene got there I told her that she was sharing a room with Ezra. I went to the toilet and Ariana opened the door and I started hitting her. Ramona was hiding from her father and I snuck into her room and we climbed out the window and jumped some fences and got to the gate. Her father saw us, and I couldn't get the gate open and I realized it was a dream. Ramona couldn't open the gate so we went back to her room. I was kissing someone earlier but I can't remember who."
"0065"	"(2003-11-10 (12)) I found out Eli's (Children of the Corn 3) birthday was May 23rd."
"0066"	"(2003-11-15 (12)) I was at some waterslide place with Mom, Ezra, Tiana and some guy. We went through heaps of places. When we went through a second time, I realized the guy was evil. I went through a door with Tiana and we got trapped, then we found a special door and we were free."
"0067"	"(2003-12-22 (12)) I was in high school and I went to some waterslide place with Ramona and Tiana and there was a big monster."

"0069"	"(2003-12-23 (12)) I got lost at a carnival and I was in a big lolly place and evil people were chasing me. I went into some building place, which had lots of aisles and was full of show bags and stuff."
"0070"	"(2003-12-24 (12)) I was friends with this 'special' girl who could change her appearance. Some evil gnomes trapped us but we escaped. I went back to get my pencil case."

A house burnt down and I was running away from some people. [That night I had used one of those patches people use to get off smoking; it was already used though, as Dad said it had given him very vivid dreams] ."
