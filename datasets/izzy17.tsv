"1876"	"(2008-01-25 (17)) I was at a place. I don't remember it properly, but there was this game where you drag a barrel to this thing over the water and create points. It was then a Runescape skill and you could have different pets. I left there and we needed to pick something up. Someone called Ari (Entourage) to ask where he was (he was dropping something off) and he was driving. He said ""Yeah, I'm on the runway!"" (a joke). I was going somewhere and Mom was picking up the thing. I was almost home when I realized that I was driving alone. I had been going 120km/h as well. I called Mom but she was just like ""it doesn't matter"". When I turned onto our street I was walking. There was a really big truck on the street. This lady said it was nuclear. This fat guy was walking with me. I got home and these two guys were standing out the front. One of them was Christian Camargo. They had been there earlier that day too. I said ""you guys are still here!"" and unlocked the doors and went inside.  They came in too and the fat guy was following me around. Christian asked if he was supposed to still be around and I said no, so this guy there shouted ""Austin! Go away!"". Ezra was somewhere too. This guy had a board of who he was interested in lately. It said ""Fergie, blood period"" and Rihanna was there too, but she looked like Emilie de Ravin."
"1877"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was watching an early season of 24. Jack was looking for information. This money had been passed down for 200 odd years. Someone told him something about his son and it looked like he was going to steal it. People started shooting at Jack. Then Jack was driving a car down a road that was 'cliff-like'. This girl he worked with was driving behind him, guiding him. Then this guy, that girl and I were at this forest thing. They were bad guys. Jack was hiding somewhere. There was a thick bushy area a thin area. The girl downloaded a map and told us to take the thin area. I figured she was going to kill us and walked slowly. She was pointing a gun at us and I yelled out ""Kiefer!"" and she looked shocked. I managed to get out of sight and was making my way around this fence. She was like ""I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!"" and I was waiting for her to point the gun at me. Then she did and I woke up."
"1878"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was watching an episode of The Outer Limits. Frank Whaley was in it. He and this guy were friends and he always took this bus. He was worried about a white light. These people were after him and to go to him, I had to go through the aisles of a video shop. One of the times I grabbed some movies and one of them was Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland. This guy said something and I said ""Yeah, it's the remake"". One day we were riding the bus and it was weird. I tried to get over to Frank, but I fell into a seat nearby. This guy was talking to him across the bus. I went into the seat next to him and he held my hand. An impression of a monkey's face appeared in the seat in front of him. We looked at each other worried and then there was a bright light and then he was gone. It had happened to someone before. The other guy got off and was in a crowded area. His face turned monkey-like and people started screaming. Then I was watching this other episode and this girl and some other people were jumping off this bridge, but they didn't get hit by cars and landed in this gymnastic area. Her sister was naked and kept having hallucinations."
"1879"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was driving by myself. There was a red light. I didn't slow down in time and pushed the car in front of me. We both ended up having to go through the red light."
"1880"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was at a school. Tiana there and I think we were friends or I was friends with a loner. I went to a bench and sat at the edge because it was the only dry spot. I saw Evelyn there too. Jillian was there and got up and complained that I was sitting next to her. I called a retard and she was circling me and I complained. She was touching me lightly and then grabbed my shoulders so I kicked her in the face."
"1881"	"(2008-01-28 (17)) We went to Nana's. I was at the table doing a 1000 piece puzzle. I had almost finished it and then realized that it had pieces that weren't in the puzzle and I'd just had extremely good luck picking the right pieces. Calvin, Ezra, and Emery, I think were there. They were mucking around and Nana was a bit annoyed."
"1882"	"(2008-01-28 (17)) Someone jumped over a sand pile and they fell and hurt something. Liz (Roswell) was hiding out with someone and their fathers. There was a CD and a phone on the floor. She had to prove something and went to give them the CD but it was gone. She went into a bedroom with a bunk bed to have a shower (she thought the shower was under the top bunk, but it wasn't). She found something that said ""only Jason Lee!"". It was from some colourful video game. Then Liz was in a car at a shop. She was trying to put L plates on while she was parked in the car park. She saw these two girls and she thought they were going to steal the plates so she locked the doors and took them off. She had to go inside and took the car with her (it was small and she was holding it in her arms). This lady gave her car stuff. She went down these escalators that had been stopped and was in the main part of the shop, which was a clothes shop. Someone thought that she was with ""Tess, not Tuck"". Tuck was Tess' father. Isobel and Michael (Roswell) were there trying to get the car and kill her. She whacked Isobel with something and she passed out. Eugene went after her and he got hit too. Max (Roswell) appeared and Liz had short blonde hair. Max said ""Liz? You're behind 'Runaway'?"". They ran out and this black guard stopped Eugene from following them. Liz was saying that the keys were in the car and it was locked."
"1883"	"(2008-01-29 (17)) I was at home and it was the first day of school. I was getting ready and realized that my hair hadn't been straightened so I called Mom. She said that the hair straightener had been ""nicked"" but she was just about to come over. I was shaving my legs. I realized that I had no school bag or anything. I woke Dad up and Ezra was in his bed. Mom said Ezra had seen this dude who had said that Ezra's stress was due to being left home alone so this woman would randomly check to make sure someone was with him. I thought it was 6pm but I checked the time and it was 11am. I said we should go shopping for school stuff instead of going to school. Later I was at home and this creepy dude, who looked like the driver guy in Superbad, was outside so I got in the car and drove to Mom's. But I couldn't control the car and Ezra was making me drive erratically. We went to Midvale shops. Some people had been to a Britney Spears concert. Sean Astin (as Harrison Bergeron) had rebelled and was going to be killed. They trapped his head between two fridges and let this blue stuff out. He died. Then it was the future and there were other planets we lived on. There were some bugs and snakes somewhere and I screamed and ran."
"1884"	"(2008-01-29 (17)) I was playing a game, I think. This 'God' guy was making things hard for us. One of his obstacles were these tornados in a desert place. One was useful, the others were bad. The last person standing won and that was me. The God guy and I went to this water and had to swim over these waves. At the end there were two 'roll-y' waves on top of each other. The God guy told me to swim under but I was worried. Then I saw Dad through this window next to me. I had let him use my computer to play a Powerpuff Girls game. I told him that I was ok. Then I got the God guy to help me go over the sides. The first time I tried I almost drowned myself. I told him if I did a hand motion it meant I needed air. We got over it and then I was moving fast underwater. I hit the guy and he came up for air. He said he'd gone fast so we didn't have to swim. Then it was Runescape and the world had really pretty houses. He asked if I was going to ask Jagex to keep this and I said ""no, I want to do everything myself"". Ezra and Dad were then outside somewhere and we were getting hot dogs."
"1885"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was at a shop and getting food and snacks. They kept disappearing and I thought it must be because I kept forgetting them. I put them in a bag. I was in the electronics section and this guy was there and he was checking this girl's bag and they were giggling. As I was leaving, there was someone from school I didn't like and she was surrounded by her friends. She called me and I kept walking. Then she said ""fine"". She gave me this purple watch. I was then at this men's wear section and there were lots of girls there. Then I went to this food hall part. There was a guy nearby doing these family tree things. I had bought two books earlier and they were in a shopping bag."
"1886"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was watching something with Ezra. Xander Berkeley was in it and I said ""he looks young"" and Ezra said ""he looks old""."
"1887"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was at 'school'. We had to watch Juno. I said ""I just watched this!"". The teacher was saying that some phonics band was the last band in the movie and I said they suck."
"1888"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was at a shop. Ari (Entourage) was talking and I took his head 'off' and put it face down to shut him up and we were all laughing."
"1889"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) Liz, Max, Isobel and Michael (all from Roswell) and I had been chased by some people. Isobel was pregnant and this blue stuff fell out of her and I said something like ""an alien inside of you and the like"". She had had sex with two guys. One was the Miko Hughes character in Roswell and this random guy called Scott Speedman. The baby was born and it had Miko's nose. I said to Miko that he was a bad guy. Then it turned out it was his baby. We were watching it on Maury Povich."
"1890"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) I watched this movie and I found this snake lolly thing in the dining room. It was supposed to be 'dangerous' to put on but I did anyway. I was then in my bed. Tigger and Mittens were cuddling. I fed Tigger the snake lolly and then she was vomiting it under the table."
"1891"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) Clayton was riding a bike with me. Sometimes it was a car. He couldn't drive very well and I said ""you should let me drive"". We had to look for some stuff at this place. There was something about Roswell there."
"1892"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) Mom and I went to a shop and were looking at school bags, but I didn't like any of them. These people would go out and find an 'interesting' male and female to turn into a ghost along with their family. I ended up at this shop where the people and ghosts had been. They wanted the people working at the checkouts. The girl at the checkout and I had these red cards which meant that no-one could ask us questions or arrest us. Two cars crashed into the shop. William Sadler as the sheriff in Roswell came. The girl and I ran to the back of the shop to get out of the way. We went forward a bit and the sheriff told us to run and we all ran. He got shot and I was thinking 'What the hell? He doesn't die, he's in all the episodes!'. The bad guys were coming to kill us for insurance. The girl ran in the toilet to hide and I accidentally ran into the fridge next to it. I quickly ran into the toilet and tried to lock the first door but couldn't. I was thinking 'why do these doors never lock?'. I ran into the toilet cubicle. They were shooting at us from above but missed us. I ripped the toilet seat off and was hitting this guy over the head. They left and just one guy was left. The girl I was with was going to slice his throat but backed out. But then he left. A guy knocked on this glass door from outside and we went out and followed him, running. We got to this carpark and I saw this white car's door open. We ran up these stairs and I said ""isn't this wrong way?"". The bad guys threw a bomb. We got into the car and the girl got shot and died. We were driving off and I said the sheriff was dead."
"1893"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) I was about to leave home with Mom. I had just locked up and started walking towards the car, when these two black guys drove past then pulled up in the driveway. They were trying to get my keys off me. Mom came up and distracted them and I unlocked the door and went inside. I called Dad. When I got back to the front door, the police were there and the black guys were gone."
"1894"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) I was watching this show with Dad. There was a snake and it wriggled around in water really fast. These bigger creatures tried to get it, but it was too fast."
"1895"	"(2008-02-02 (17)) I was at school. I text the canteen to order my lunch. A teacher saw and asked what I was doing. I said ""Oh, ordering my lunch, I forgot to do it earlier"". She called me a liar. I showed them the message and then they went away a while later. I was then with a friend somewhere and they were buying mini M&M's and I wanted some but realized I had no money. I couldn't get to my phone either. Nana called though, and she gave money to me but it was for Ezra. Outside was really foggy. Something was attacking me."
"1896"	"(2008-02-02 (17)) I was in a building underground. The entrance had glass windows around it and had glass doors. Ezra was there too. I was trying to leave. There were two doors that would take us to the entrance. I went to one, but I saw this freaky lobster/scorpion thing so I left there. I thought I saw a crocodile. A couple and a young girl came in and the baby was near the crocodile, so I called out to the parents and a light turned on. It was just a cat. It looked evil and talked to me. I said that I wanted to get through and it was like ""Ok, go ahead"". I asked it about the lobster thing and it said it didn't know what it was, but ""maybe it is lethal"". Ezra and I went to these stairs to leave and a girl went through some doors and a lobster thing got through. The doors to get out wouldn't open. There were these rope things hanging from the ceiling and I grabbed one and swung away from the stairs. Jude Law (as Jerome Morrow in Gattaca) was there, his name was spelt wrong somewhere. He offered to get bitten by the lobster thing to see what happened. He could then walk, so everyone was like ""Let's go"", but I said that it might still be deadly. Lots of people ended up dying. Some army guys came. Some lady had a card that would allow two people to leave. Someone and I left. We went to this place and they had this machine where you could ask about any one and see who their ""soul mate"" was. When I put in 'Mom', it said Nana and Poppa and they realized that I'd 'stolen' the card. I ended up back underground. Eventually a lady came through the doors and we were allowed out. I hugged a car when we got outside. They blew up the place and it turned out it was our school. I said ""We start school in a few days and now they blew up the school"". Dad said ""only the nice part"". Behind the school there were some big white buildings and I saw Mr Willingham walking on there. Ezra asked who the math teacher was and I said ""Mr Gutenberg""."
"1897"	"(2008-02-03 (17)) I was at home. I was watching something that had Michael Cera in it, and Bryson and another person were watching it too. I went out to see Mom. Ezra went with her and she took off before I could talk. I got prickles in my foot. Bryson closed the front door and I couldn't get back in. I didn't have my phone on me and so I borrowed off someone. The phone was actually a piece of paper so I typed out what I said, but I had actually called Mom and said we needed to go to Dad's work. Mom was there later and saw Kiki and a kitten on the roof of the shed."
"1898"	"(2008-02-03 (17)) I was watching Roswell and Tess said something indicating that she was bad (she said it away from the others). She was telling Max, Liz and the others (but it wasn't them) that she was meant for Max, and they had all been matched up according to their hair colours. They were like transformers and they were going to use their powers to save the world."
"1899"	"(2008-02-04 (17)) I had stayed at Mom's. I got ready for school and drove there. Then I was on a bike and it was raining, but I was still 'driving'. Mom was walking behind me. Lots of people were around upstairs. Ezra was there too. The door names were weird. One of them said 'Smudgy' and I thought the other one said 'Smudgy Pudge', but it said 'McLovin'. My hair was normal and I hadn't had breakfast yet so I said that I wasn't staying here. I ended up at home and Dad was still asleep. It was 8am. Mom said I still had an hour to get ready. Dad asked if we wanted McDonald's for breakfast. I said I was going to eat breakfast at Mom's."
"1900"	"(2008-02-05 (17)) There was this road which I went down on a game -- some of it had no railings. There was a part where you had to jump across this gap. Then it was real and it was my birthday soon. I had made these party invitations to see what they looked like. A friend of mine (Asian from Juno) said she was ""sorta my friend"" and should be invited. I was like ""I'm not having a party!"". I asked some lady to get something."
"1901"	"(2008-02-06 (17)) I was watching some talk show with Heath Ledger on it. His daughter had died and her name was Ella. The host asked him about some wings he was wearing and he said ""Oh, I'll put wings on for Ella"" then he said ""You go Ella!""."
"1902"	"(2008-02-06 (17)) I was watching some movie with Kiefer Sutherland and Tom Cruise. Some woman was in it too. Kiefer and Tom had had a romantic relationship. Tom and the girl had had sex then she pretended to forget about it to embarrass him. Someone planted a bomb somewhere."
"1903"	"(2008-02-07 (17)) It was really cloudy and dark. Calvin was staying at our house on a bed in my room. Soon though, he didn't. Anyway, we went to this place and we realized a tornado was coming. I was freaking and asking this girl if she had a basement or something. Everyone ran out and we were running too. The tornado kept 'following' us. We got to the car and then it was right behind us. Other people were driving away too. Some guy went on a boat because he thought that he could escape if he went on the water. The tornado was coming to him. It went away and Dad and I went home."
"1904"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) Some guy was really old, but no-one had seen what he looked like old."
"1905"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) I was at school. Eugene, Jeremiah and the others were in class."
"1906"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) I was at school. I was with Calvin somewhere. It was home time and the office had a line for Greeks and Macedonians to sign out. We went there one day and you also had to be born in January. We were standing behind Eugene. I read his sheet and it mentioned his father (Abraham) and his mother's last name was Cuthbert, which reminded me of Elisha Cuthbert. His home was called something weird like Bertz. His street was Schub and I asked Mom where it was later and she was like ""why?"". The lady at the desk (where you had to sign out) told Calvin that she would refer us if our birthdays were in January. We told a teacher and they said she had lied. I went to the toilets and some were open. I went into a cubicle and this girl stood outside, asking if I was female. They gave me a dildo. I like ""what the hell are you giving me this for?!"". Then I was watching Entourage and Turtle had a dildo of 'himself' on the bed. It was like rounded at the bottom and went into a point and had a smiley face on it."
"1907"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) Ari (Entourage) was at his office. There were two offices next to each other and one was his wife's. He had some woman in his office and his wife came. He said ""Don't go in there"" and she looked upset. The woman came out and his wife went in. Then the wife left. He wasn't cheating."
"1908"	"(2008-02-09 (17)) We were at Nana's. We had this little room there or something. The backyard was different. Ezra, Dad and Roland were there too. It went a bit funny and sometimes I was me, and sometimes it was these two groups of people (2 boys and 2 girls) and they were coupled up, but were trying to hide it from their family. One had sex with her boyfriend and also had her period another time. Roland was less yuck and we ended up going out. Time passed and we had had sex and stuff. No-one knew. Dad and Ezra were out the back and there was hedgehog slice. Fido had a swollen lip. Then we were at a video shop. I think some bad people came so I decided to take some movies, but I hadn't heard of any. I was looking for Firefly and Entourage. I saw a Goosebumps book and put one in my bag. Then we were doing something there. Someone had attacked these little kids. Devil Fish was there and he went off somewhere. This kid pointed out this alarm device which was a phone. They ordered fish and chips. Kylie Minogue was then there and she ran to Devil Fish through this mirror maze. He shot her boyfriend. Then we were there. Eugene was there and I was wondering why I wasn't going out with him. Devil Fish was going against us. Then we were at this school. These kids were following me and I couldn't eat, so I told this teacher to take care of them or I was going to kill them. Rodney and Daryl were there."
"1909"	"(2008-02-09 (17)) I was driving with Mom. I saw Classmate-F-17 and someone else from my class in 2002, in red dresses. I told Mom I knew them and she wanted to give them a ride and I said no. We were at a shop and Ezra was there. Paulina was there and she came near me."
"1910"	"(2008-02-09 (17)) I was watching Entourage. Drama was calling Ari 'Lala' because it was his ""proper name"" and Ari was like ""Don't call me that!""."
"1911"	"(2008-02-10 (17)) I was at Nana's. She had this swampy fish pond with frogs and she was trying to get them to kill them. She pulled one out and it was covered in seaweed. She was giving it food and water to tempt it over. It jumped on me and was snuggling and then it was a cat. Later, I was driving this thing and was looking out for animals and crashed into this thing and hurt myself. Then it was later and Aunt Sally and Dad were watching this thing where they were acting like mimes. There were three cousins and one was old, and one was a boy, and one was a girl. Dad, Ezra and I drove to this fair and saw a friend or a relative and said ""good luck Eugene"" -- he was going to have photos taken with a retard. Then Ezra and this girl had stuff in common and this guy and I were looking at ""nerdy"" stuff. The girl was making Ezra buy her stuff and asked him to the prom."
"1912"	"(2008-02-11 (17)) I was at school. Calvin was there. I saw some dude with a dark blue, dirty uniform on. Evelyn and Calvin were like ""What's that smell?"" and I was like ""Oh, you think everything smells"". They said it was the guy, but he was pretty far away and I said ""Oh, can you smell him from that far away?"". The guy was kind of hot and he walked past us and went into this cave. An old, ugly guy came out. Calvin and I were talking to him and he said they had an elephant in there. I figured they were zookeepers. We chatted for a while but then we had to go to class. During class, he came in and said ""Don't forget to deliver that note!"" and I was like ""what note?"". I checked my bag and found it. A while later, I told the teacher I needed to deliver it. She gave me a card to sign. I left and was talking to the guy but realized I forgot the card and went back to get it. Calvin was there talking to him when I got back. He said ""Do you want a dog? Do you want a wildfire?"". I said ""Well, I don't want the wildfire!"". He said it was dangerous and said, about fire, ""Oh, well I like them!"". I was going to say 'not over in [where Nana lives] ' because of Nana, but I was eating. I thought he was going to let us work with the elephant. Then Calvin and I were on a platform. There were all these cars and people. A bus left, full of people from a different school. Two girls were talking to us. One said something about wearing the school shirt normally, which she said meant that it was tied up behind you. I said ""No, that's called the bust way"". She said I should fold my shirt up to ""let your hair show"". I was completely confused and asked ""what?"" and she took her pants off. Then she said ""Maybe it's too soon"". Then she was naked and her friend was almost naked. When I complained she attacked us, but then left. Then this guy and I were going out. Sometimes, I wasn't me. We were going to be having sex later. He thought I liked the zookeeper guy (the young one). I said ""Oh, Parker? No!"". These bad guys went after some guy. This woman was pretended to be hanging off a cliff. They were helping her and she had glue on her hands. This guy jumped onto this little bit sticking out of the cliff. Then this guy who looked like Xander Berkeley said he wouldn't do something until they ""put a ring on my finger"". They gave him a silver ring and then he asked for a door handle thing. He put it on and he walked away and didn't do what he said he was going to do."
"1913"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I was watching Entourage. Turtle's girlfriend (Lauren London) was coming over. Ari wanted to see her, so he hid in the apartment and his wife was behind the door. Turtle and his girlfriend were lying in bed. Later, Turtle was saying how all he did was complain about his father. Then this girl was married."
"1914"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I was somewhere in the car with Dad. There were all these llama signs everywhere. There was a costume house. Calvin told me about these green shorts. The shop was gay and people 'jumped' on the car. Ezra was there. We went to a friend for something. We were young and with this girl. I was then not there, and was replaced by Elisha Cuthbert. The friend, who was a guy, did something and told Mom to leave and he said he wasn't going to do anything to me. Later, she met with this girl and got something off her."
"1915"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) The Drifters were on TV. They were singing this weird song, and they sounded weird and they kept repeating ""You know I'll always love you"". I was looking for Ben E. King but I didn't know what he looked like."
"1916"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I was walking down some street with a girl and others. It got dark and we saw someone and it was Jason Lee, so we brought him along for protection. People kept attacking us, but Jason scared them all off. Then I decided we should run down this alley. There were lots of people in the alley. I couldn't punch properly and thought it was a dream, so that I could punch and I hurt my hand. Then it was Max and Liz (both from Roswell) and they were in her father's water bed. This bad guy was sucking them into it. Liz was swimming up and just as her head came out, he pulled her back down and I was annoyed.  Then her father and someone were looking for her. It showed the bed and there was movement under the sheets and they were naked in bed. The father saw them and Liz was like ""Dad! Pops!"" and it was awkward."
"1917"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I saw Mr Gutenberg and he had long hair and it was black."
"1918"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) Calvin was in an accident because of some drunk people. Later, Mom, Ezra and I were driving. Mom was going fast and I said ""slow down"" and she did and then she suddenly went fast again."
"1919"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) Mom said that she thought Spaceman was a girl. Ezra and I were looking but we noticed that he had a bum and a penis, and was definitely a male."
"1920"	"(2008-02-13 (17)) Ezra kept hanging outside a guy up the road's house. He was an old guy and kept getting annoyed at Ezra. Ezra and Mom thought he might also be killing or raping (and killing) kids and burying them in his backyard. Ezra was digging there one night, but he found nothing. Dad told Ezra that the guy was moving soon."
"1921"	"(2008-02-14 (17)) Mom and I went to this house and she waited for a while and called them, but no-one came out so she figured that no-one was home and left. We kept going around this roundabout. Then she remembered that he would sometimes move to this other apartment so the next door neighbours wouldn't get suspicious. We went to the other apartment and Kevin Connolly was there. We were really nervous around each other and I liked him. Then I was watching Entourage and he, Drama and Turtle lived together. I had to 'make' Drama's breakfast, which was this food in a tube. Turtle was asleep in a bath. I had to feed a cat. Later, they were playing poker with an old lady and they won heaps of money. The next door neighbour was listening to them. Then there was a party and I was taking photos. Some people got a photo with Marilyn Manson. I was driving and I was at a roundabout. There was another guy driving and we almost crashed because he didn't indicate properly."
"1922"	"(2008-02-15 (17)) I was at some house and they had something that was like a serial killer (don't remember what it was). Then I was wandering around and I ended up killing someone and their brain was hanging out. I also killed some other person. I grabbed some disc of some science thing and got out of the house through this window. I was walking along the street and this girl followed me for a while. I went into this house and called Mom and told her what I did. She was making swallowing vomit-y sounds. I got a message from Dad saying he was on the way and I was crying because if he had been sooner he could've stopped me. He picked me up and then we went to this meeting that he went to regularly. He had an e-mail from Malcolm McDowell (they were friends). He was also friends with some director guy. People from school were there. Daryl asked me how my job was going and I said ""it isn't"". We were walking together and Mom was walking in front of us. I said that I was quiet so I could ""play more games"" and he laughed. Mom looked around and asked if he was Lumpy and he said his name was Daryl Kemp and I said ""I call him Lumpy"". Then Calvin and I were talking and he said that he heard something about Mr Fantastic (Fantastic Four). I said I already knew he died and he was like ""how?"" and I said that I was there (I had killed him) but I told him not to tell anyone because we were pretending that I wasn't there. I went to some shop with Evelyn, which was where she worked. There were some weird dancing things. Some L plates broke and we got some yellow card to replace them. I was walking with Calvin through the back of the shop. I was singing along to the song on the radio. I heard Dmitri saying that new music was ""rubbish"". Then I was at school and we were in the common room which was bigger and really different. Eugene and someone came in. After heaps of people were in there someone locked the door. Eventually they unlocked it. This teacher gave out ice-creams. They gave a blue one to Eugene, a pink one to Bradley and mixed ones to Darius and Jeremiah. I went into some room and this lady teacher was telling me how she would design it if it were her home. Earlier Mom was in a carpark and she parked smoothly into a spot and this other car drove past the area. Then it reverse parked into the spot behind her car. Lloyd (Entourage) was driving it and Ari (Entourage) was yelling at him."
"1923"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) I was at home. Ezra, Bradley and Dad were in the lounge. We were playing some game on the Wii. Bradley finished and I tried it but I kept moving too fast."
"1924"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) I was watching Alias. Ezra had been watching it all. I didn't recognize what was happening. There was a black guy on the screen and I asked if it was Carl Lumbly. Then someone said something about a virgin and I remembered that I'd seen it."
"1925"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) Mr Reilly was at his house and this guy was harassing him."
"1926"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) I was looking on top of a bookshelf at home. I found some old Christmas presents. One was for Granny. I opened them. I was going to ask Dad what was going on with my car."
"1927"	"(2008-02-18 (17)) I was at 'home'. It was around 9pm and it was creepy and I was worried that someone was going to come in. I was sitting on a lounge watching TV and I called Mom. I told her I was feeling nervous and she asked if I wanted to go back to her place and I said that Dad was going to be home soon. Then the front door opened and was banging."
"1928"	"(2008-02-18 (17)) The world had been separated into cities. They were surrounded by 'bubbles'. A protector would walk around the outside, guarding them. Some guy wandered into this party. It was day time and was outside. Marlon Brando (like in The Godfather) was there and I was like ""Ooh! Marlon Brando's gonna kick your butt!"". I was thinking that I should watch On The Waterfront today. This tiger jumped to get something and then Marlon was petting it. This guy gave this girl an engagement ring and she was like ""What does it mean, anyway?"". Outside the bubble, it looked like Super Mario Galaxy. Someone said ""you sleep at night, and hope you don't get killed""."
"1929"	"(2008-02-19 (17)) I came home and the kettle was on. Mom was there. I watched an episode of The Young Ones. Then I had some notebooks with me and they all had stuff about Eugene in them. People from school were there and we were in the games room. Calvin was there and he kept trying to get my notebooks and then an assembly was called. He asked what letter the person I like's name started with. He said ""Mellena?"" which meant Eugene. I had this ribbon thing and Calvin and I were playing with it. He gave Lucia another end of it and they were pulling on it. I saw some orange scissors so I got them and cut her side and we were then 'fighting', but not really and she said that she doesn't want to come between Calvin and his ""ex-best friend"". I said ""I didn't even know we were best friends, let along ex-best friends!"". Genevieve was also there and she had Breakaway in her pocket. Then Mom, Ezra, Dad and I were at some place. We stopped the car and got out. I tried to ask what was going on, but they just looked at me funny. I realized they were going to the shop. Then I was at some place with the school and there were rabbits. People had had sex with them. I was playing with a black one. Samantha had one and they were selling them but first they were having an auction. Payton was next to Samantha and she let hers go and it went down the side of some stairs. It looked at her and I said ""You gaylord"". Then I was at this other place and Calvin and I decided to wag. We were walking together through these tunnels but we didn't know our way around. Eventually, we didn't recognize the people we were passing. Then we saw Ms Corbett, and then Mr Stevenson. We got past them and then we were walking across this oval full of little kids. They yelled out ""Hagrid August Underground"" (which was a movie made in 1918 and this guy knew where to go if they called it out). The guy came after us and he caught Calvin first. I grabbed this fridge, and it opened and smelled really bad. I hit him and he fainted. I walked back across the oval and Edward Norton was walking up and I kicked him in the head and knocked him out. Then I was at home. I looked out the window and saw 3 cars. I thought this little white one was Darren's. I didn't know who the others were."
"1930"	"(2008-02-20 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom and Ezra went off and I found this Entourage shop. I was thinking of getting an Ari thing. I went back to Mom and told her. Ezra went to get food. He found this place and the guy gave him a free sample and gave me some too. It was really nice, but it was fattening. We got food from somewhere else and I tasted Ezra's chips and they were really nice. There was something about a Top 100 guys list. George Clooney had won from 1986-1996 or something. There was a car with Colin Farrell and some other guy in it. A friend of Mom's said ""thought you weren't eating, that you were on a diet"" and I said ""I am, but these chips are so nice""."
"1931"	"(2008-02-20 (17)) I was at 'school'. Eugene said something to me and I was going to ask him to repeat it but I felt uncomfortable talking to him and I didn't."
"1932"	"(2008-02-21 (17)) I was at school and in a gym. Autumn was there and she was a bit loopy. We got put into groups and Autumn pulled out a gun. She said she'd shoot my group or the other group. I think mine was bigger so she was lining up the other group to shoot them. Daryl was in the other group. I was then thinking ""She'll probably let them go now"" and she did. Someone noticed a scar on the back of her head -- she had a 'lobotomy'. There was food in the gym. I grabbed two of these chocolate things and left. I went to the common room which was bigger and different. Eugene and Darius were sitting in a chair behind ours. Calvin and I were on ours. Eugene was singing Love is All Around and I starting singing a little of it, quietly. Calvin said ""Look around, it's your boyfriend"". I was recording Eugene singing. Then I remembered that Mom was picking me and Ezra up so I left. I had some clothes on a clothes line and took mine off. Ms Pascal came and I asked if I needed help. I went to the car and Ezra was in the backseat, and I was wondering why he wasn't in the front. Then he moved to the front. Later we were in a car accident. The tip of my nose was bleeding. I think someone died and then I was at Mom's and Darren was making jokes and Mom told him who died and Darren decided to kill himself. Later I was playing a game and Darius was watching me and I was like ""Go away""."
"1933"	"(2008-02-21 (17)) I found out that Eugene actually lived at 44 Casserley Ave. I went driving down there with Mom and it was a fancy house. I got out of the car and was going to take photos of it, but I heard someone talking to Eugene, so I stayed back. Somehow I ended up in the house. There was something that said his middle name was Trenton or something. His father was called Eugene as well. His mother said something that implied I'd been noting down all this information on Eugene and she gave me hers, Eugene's and Abraham's (his father's) birth certificate."
"1934"	"(2008-02-22 (17)) I was at school and in Accounting. Autumn was there too and I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was lunch time and Eugene was outside (and he had been there before). I went to the bench but it was in a different spot and we had another bench that we were using. Evelyn was on the old bench. I had to give Darius something of mine and it had my middle name on it. I was thinking that I wanted Eugene's. In English, Ms Madsen said we had an assignment due."
"1935"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I went to Midvale shops. It was dark and raining. We had a 4wd type of car. Mom went into the shop and Ezra and I waited outside. It flooded and there was a deep 'hole' next to the car. It all filled up and it went past my door at the back of the car. It wasn't past the door on Ezra's side (the left side). Mom called Darren to tell him to get something to get us out. Mom came out later to check on us and Darren still hadn't come -- he had seen a friend instead. Then we were somewhere else and this Cloverfield thing happened. The monster was throwing stuff around. It went over a bridge holding 'balls' of people (they were wrapped up in a ball). I was looking up at it. These people had also bought a new home. After the flood and the monster, I was wondering if they would get a new house (the house they had had survived, though). We were hanging around and Thuy and Raquel were there."
"1936"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) I had a school photo and Forrest was in it, but he was young and odd looking. He was called Forrest Pock. My eyes were big in the photos."
"1937"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) I was at home. Ezra and I were looking at the pool. I complained that I ""just filled it up yesterday, now it's going to overflow"". I thought Dad must've cleaned it up because he knew I swept the backyard."
"1938"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) I was in chemistry. Elijah pat me on the back. I wanted to sit next to Elijah and Autumn but Autumn had moved."
"1939"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) We were on a bus. We got called on by our last names. We were young and Calvin was there. The guy said the left side had to be filled first."
"1940"	"(2008-02-24 (17)) Some people and I went back in time to the 80's. Most of it was the same (hair, clothes and DOS), but there was a train which went pretty fast and we had to use it because we couldn't go outside. This lady was on a computer and it was kind of spiffy. We had to sit in the seats. There was a guy outside and the train place's gate. This monster came and ate him. There was an interview with Colin Farrell on the TV and I was thinking that he looked like Tony (24). Then we were sitting at desks. I sat next to Jeremiah. Darius and Eugene were there too.  Something hit me and I squeaked and they thought it was funny."
"1941"	"(2008-02-24 (17)) I was out the back. Clark Kent and Chloe (both Smallville) were in the pool. I asked Mom for some water. She gave me some and I went in the pool. I accidentally swallowed some pool water. I got out and was almost vomiting (it tasted gross). I took a drink and spat some out. There were maggots and these big worms in it. The worms had this metal looking armour on them. I complained to Mom ""There are maggots in the water! That's disgusting!""."
"1942"	"(2008-02-24 (17)) There were these houses. One had bright green on it. Some guy told a cop that he and some others (including some guy called Cooper Anderson) were part of a group. I told him to pretend. I went to the other guy's house and was begging him to let me in and he kept refusing. I gave him $10 and then he let me in. I explained to him that they were in a 'group'."
"1943"	"(2008-02-25 (17)) Ezra and I were at home watching a zombie movie. Some girl in it thought she looked like some snowman thing. We heard a loud thumping noise and we were hiding under the recliners. I went outside and there were people on the roof. I saw a glimpse of some big red thing. They motioned for me not to say anything to Ezra. Eventually they beat the red thing. Dad got home. The door wouldn't lock with a key anymore. Then it had been a game and I had defeated the red thing and I was now level 2."
"1944"	"(2008-02-25 (17)) I was somewhere and I was dying of thirst. I was trying to get in the McDonald's drive thru, but cars kept coming. A lady helped me pull myself behind her. I was then in a car with Mom and we asked for water. The girl was going to give me two cones. One was with chocolate and ice-cream and the other one wasn't. I was like 'what the hell?'. They had this big fancy chocolate thing which was $900. Mom said that there was a gas leak or something. I asked how she knew and she just stared at me. This brother and sister, who liked each other, had died on this evil Ferris wheel thing. I had warned them before they went on it. This lady had kids that looked exactly the same."
"1945"	"(2008-02-25 (17)) I was reading a magazine and it had lots of stuff about Frank Whaley."
"1946"	"(2008-02-26 (17)) I was playing a game and showed Mom, but she just wanted to do some statistics thing and I said ""I'm the one who's suppose to love that!"". The game was a zombie game and you were part of a group and you had to walk around and try to survive. Then there were dogs and some were infected. There were doors which we were told could get knocked down and those that couldn't. But the dogs kept getting through the strong doors. Then it was real and I was with Dad, Ezra and some others. We were hiding out in this home in an apartment building. The room was surrounded by windows and we didn't close the curtains. Outside, there were hands all over the windows and the top half of the windows was all brown and cloudy. The dogs came through and were attacking me and someone shot them. Then they went and Dad was like ""I don't know how they got through"". I was planning to wake up ready to get the gun and shoot. I asked Dad how to get the safety off and then he decided to show me all the features of the gun. He and Ezra were going out for dinner tomorrow night (for Ezra's birthday and my birthday) and I said I might go. He said that celebrities were going to be there, including Kevin Spacey so I thought ok. Eugene was then there with some other people. They shot two zombies and one got hit. I went to go to bed and then the dogs came but only one got in. Then I was at home. Dad woke us up and he went in the pool or something. I had a cold. Ezra and Mom were there too. Mom kept humming Do You Really Want to Hurt Me and she kept calling it Karma Chameleon. I said ""It's only... 28 years ago!"". Ezra threw some food and Dad was like ""you'll attract the dogs"". Kiki was next to a shed having some babies. They all had orange on them. One was kind of nasty and then they turned into cute toddlers. I think one of them was allowed to get a cat called Scotty and people laughed. We were going to watch a zombie movie and I said ""Nah, I dreamt about zombies last night"". Then we were at Nana's. Someone was talking about Victoria Beckham and I said she was ugly. Mom was there and so was Alyssa. I said that you'd have to be desperate to marry David Beckham."
"1947"	"(2008-02-26 (17)) I went to Mom's and I asked her how she was locking up (to prevent the dogs) and she said she wasn't. I was like ok. She kept talking about Spaceman."
"1948"	"(2008-02-27 (17)) I was at home. Dad wanted me to print and scan stuff for him. Then he was going out. It was like 11pm or something and it was creepy so I called Mom and she said she'd be 10 minutes and I asked her to be quick. She also said she looked for season one of 24 and I said ""We've got it"" and I found it and put it aside to give to her. A car pulled up and I looked out the door. It was blue and not Mom's. I got my phone and went to call her but then she pulled up behind them. Some skinny guys got out and I said ""Go away you stupid fat blobs!"" and they laughed. Mom was asking them what they were doing here. They said they had been here last night. One had an accent like in The Green Mile. I made fun of him. I opened the door and found this metal pole thing and hit them over the back and they all fell. One of them was then Ezra and one was Evelyn. Then we had an excursion and we were at a shop. Calvin and I wandered around. We ate lunch and I had a ham sandwich. Eugene and Bradley sat near us. Then the four of us went away from the others. Eugene went over somewhere to pee and Calvin was like ""Look at your boyfriend Eugene"" and I looked over and his bum was showing. I laughed and I took a photo and he was like ""hey!"" and swearing. So I was filming him, but then he was laughing and was ok about it. Then it was dark and I was filming with Calvin's phone because it was better. Mom was then at the shop and she was looking at some fluffy jackets. Tucker walked past and she was like ""What the hell is that?"" and I said he was the one with a dead Mom. Daryl was there too. Then we were at a house. Elijah was there. We were gathering stuff and it was a game. I was getting something past Dad and he asked if I was playing this game called 'Whatever'. Calvin, Elijah, Samantha, others and I put this video camera in water. It exploded."
"1949"	"(2008-02-28 (17)) I was at school, I think. I had this room there. I went in and Darius followed me, so I closed the door and pushed him out. He kept trying to come in. Later, Eugene and others and also Clayton, were coming out of class. All these people came to my room. Silas and Calvin were there. Darius came again and I was thinking of Evelyn. There was music on TV. Electric Avenue was on but I thought it was It's My Life at first. There was also a song by Kevin Connolly but he was called Eric. Everyone loved his song. I was then in class and we were reading out some essay with a spelling mistake. I called the person sitting next to me a retard. It was my essay and I showed the teacher that it wasn't a spelling mistake but a typing error. Dad wasn't allowed to watch 24 because of the error. I was then somehow with these two people who had been handcuffed together. One of them was Jack (24), and he was rogue. They were both good guys though. This plane flew over and I thought they were going to crash into the building. We ran from this car and I stopped thinking that I would get in trouble. The 'police' and Aaron (24) came. Then they went to Christopher Walken's place and asked something and he had changed his name because of Jack (not sure why). Christopher thought that the police were there because of something he had done and refused to talk. Jack was hiding over the fence. I had a puppy. It was really cute and it had big feet. It was black."
"1950"	"(2008-02-29 (17)) We went to some old friend of ours' place. They had dark skin and a son my age. We had been friends when we were younger and he had liked me (at first he was white, and he was really hot). Suddenly we were somewhere and he was touching me. Then Ezra, Mom and I woke up in a field somewhere and this bloke was running to be King (it was the olden days). I was speaking English and he was like ""You shouldn't be speaking English!"" and I said ""I don't know any other languages!"". There was a map of the country there and it was wrong so I drew over it. Then I was at a place with some people and they had TV shows there (including Roswell) and also had Goosebumps books. They also had some other show I used to watch. I commented that I liked Goosebumps books. Then Ezra, Mom and I were doing some exercise thing in a forest place. We had to do it non-stop but we weren't. I had missed calls. Three of them were from some L-plate thing. One was from a guy saying I was scary on the road. Someone else said that my driving sucked."
"1951"	"(2008-03-01 (17)) I was at school. We had an excursion but Autumn and I had finished the work so we got sent next door to this church place which was a big class. I sat next to Autumn who sat in a row with Darius and Jeremiah. Bradley was in the row behind and Eugene was on the side of the class doing private study. The class was all to do with puzzles and stuff. Then it got confusing and Theodore was in a movie called Elijah. The teacher was talking about something and they paired me and Eugene together for a question and everyone thought it was funny. Then it was in a movie and Eugene was going to kiss this other girl so that people would stop saying stuff about us but then he was Theodore again and he kissed some girl. Then Darius was annoying me. I complained and said to someone that they ""should advise them that I'll kill them"". We were then in a little class and we had to sign our names and the teacher said it looked like something. The class was sport but Darius never did it and I didn't either. Then I was at some place with Indians and they were doing a dance or something. I took photos. Then it was lunch and I was late to the common room because my leg was hurting. I asked Evelyn if it looked odd."
"1952"	"(2008-03-02 (17)) I discovered that Leslie had been murdered (stabbed). The night before I dreamt that she died -- her car had flipped over neat the roundabout on Princess Rd and I told Mom later but she already knew (that Leslie was dead). Then I was at some place with a bunch of school people. Some were people I knew and some weren't. There was a killer and we didn't know who he was. Sometimes it went third person and it was my Sim, Alex Goth. Some people saw him and then later, he shaved and looked completely different and escaped with everyone else. Then it was back to my point of view and we discovered that the killer looked like Marcus Alvers (24), but hoter. He had these blood slides and was throwing them at people. I managed to take them off him but he kept getting more. I'm not sure what happened but I think we liked each other and I let him go."
"1953"	"(2008-03-03 (17)) I was at Nana's in a garden. I went behind this shed and there was stuff growing so I went to run but Poppa and Fido came and Poppa was then some shifty person and I called out something. I was then at a table in a room with Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere. They were sitting close together doing some Heroes thing. I was thinking about stuff and Milo and I were having an affair. Dad and I went to go to this place to watch House but we missed it. There was a killer at this place and it was Tony (24). He killed someone then the alarm sounded and he left. Then I was the killer and some psychologist was talking to me in this house about when I killed the person and why."
"1954"	"(2008-03-05 (17)) It was about a year before Mom's birthday. I was planning it and I got all these people from school to do a presentation thing. Everyone had a fish and I had tanks. Calvin, Samantha and others were playing a 'hide-and-seek' computer game. Calvin reminded me that I had 15 seconds left (the game). But it said I had 50 minutes. Mom came and said she wanted to take us shopping for her birthday rather than shop for herself. I was thinking 'Sims 2!'. Clayton did a presentation too. Ezra and Clayton were staying over. Then Dad took them back to Mom's and got dinner. We went to some weird bank building and we left and then we went to this old school of Mom's. It was then her birthday and we brought her to her old house (but it wasn't) and people started coming in and she was like ""Oh this is great, but I have to go"". I was at home and putting the rest of the presentation together. Some evil guy was around and Dad told me to stop all these singing things. The air-con suddenly became stronger and we realized he was here. There were some letters and one had something do with an elephant. There was some Greek thing. The guy came and stole someone's sister. We went to a sewer where he went. He was a Macedonian God. Someone shouted ""I am the werewolf!""."
"1955"	"(2008-03-06 (17)) We had camp and I went to school. We were told to meet somewhere. I saw Evelyn and asked her where to go and she said her house. I went there and was looking for Eugene. I saw Calvin walk past a window and he saw me and was laughing. I reminded Mom that I probably wouldn't like camp and she'd have to pick me up."
"1956"	"(2008-03-06 (17)) I was at school. We were in the common room, which was different. Someone liked this new kid. Scarlett and some others were talking about him and they said he liked someone else. They she asked who and they said ""He likes Izzy Conell"" and I asked who. They said the weird new kid, who likes ""dead things"". He came in later, but I didn't know if it was him or not. Calvin was showing people something and he tried to show Darius but he ignored him."
"1957"	"(2008-03-06 (17)) I was playing a game and I was at a hard bit with ""61mp/h"". I don't remember what you did though. The guy who created some challenge for it came and he was talking to me about it."
"1958"	"(2008-03-07 (17)) Ezra went into this guy's backyard to say a joke to this dog. It got angry and bit my thumb. The owner came out and was like ""What are you doing in my yard!"". The dog kept chasing us and the guy said he couldn't get it and we had to get out ourselves. I was looking for somewhere to hide. I found a big hole in the fence. I continued running from it. Then I was in a building and I swung from this rope and the dog did too. It started watching ballet. It was then a girl and she had to learn ballet. Then it was Sims 2 and the Sim's hobby was music but she liked ballet. I was trying to explain it to Dad."
"1959"	"(2008-03-08 (17)) Ezra and I had an assignment to do. There were two lots of people and we used to have a train to get to work and stuff but in the US, they now had to walk instead. Here, though, we still had the trains. I was watching 24. David Palmer was in a room and he was hiding behind a shelf. Aaron was behind another. They were calling out to each other and they had guns. Then Aaron caught David and it was actually a simulation. David was laughing because it was the only night they did something different or something. Tony had short hair and was now the bad guy. I asked Michelle to do something for Curtis and she got annoyed and lowered his rank thing. He went to go ask someone. Someone was saying that when Michelle was a baby she 'stung' her."
"1960"	"(2008-03-08 (17)) I was going out with Silas for some reason. We were all staying at this big hotel type of place (but it was one storey). I was somewhere near a forest and I saw this purple box. A guy came out of it. He left and I saw someone leaving in a purple box and it reappeared. It turned out he was from another planet. He came back later with some others. One of them and I became friends and liked each other. They looked like humans, except that some had pointy ears. At first, they wanted to take some stuff for their planet, but some came back to stay. We had separate rooms at the hotel place. Mine was across from Dad's and Ezra's was down the hall. Dad had the light off in his room and was watching 24. Ezra, the guy and I went down to this water place and there was a statue of a guy from his planet surrounded by Charmander statues. Then Pokemon were real. One was having a fight with a Dragonair. It was big and scary. I had my phone and the guy and I were trying to move quietly over the water and I trying not to get my phone wet. We went back to the hotel and Ezra was trying to make marshmallows. I had this stick in a cup which I burnt at night for water. He used that one and another one and they had marshmallows on them."
"1961"	"(2008-03-09 (17)) There was some Bonnie and Clyde thing. It wasn't actually them, but they were on the run. They stole a car and some people told the cops the plates on the car so they dumped it and looked for another. They took a van and ended up on a long road and they ended up at this place which was a school. This teacher lady was giving them trouble but eventually realized that they were ok and she let them take her car. The school was spooky and really rundown."
"1962"	"(2008-03-09 (17)) Hal Sparks was at a counter in a lobby. These two girls came up to him. One had short brown hair and she said that she was willing to ""sleep her way to the top. I want a room on the top floor"". Hal yelled at her and this big muscly dude said something about Hal being a man. I was laughing. Later, some guy took a girl and said they could have her back for $400. Then I was with Calvin and I said that Samantha wasn't coming because I traded her for someone. He said ""Who? Eugene?"" Then Lana Lang (Smallville) was there."
"1963"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) I had trouble sleeping because I kept feeling stuff on me. I had fallen asleep between 5-6am and then I woke up, so Mom was going to give me the day off. Ezra was there too. I was trying to think of what to say to Dad about having the day off."
"1964"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) I was at school. I was on a lounge in a room. I had this iPod thing which could take photos and video, so I was recording Eugene sitting next to me."
"1965"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) People had done some stories. One of them had my name in it."
"1966"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) I was watching Skins. I remember Sid and Cassie but nothing else."
"1967"	"(2008-03-11 (17)) I went out the back and there were two frogs in the pool. Dad came out too and there were some lizards. One was this long thing and Dad was like ""You mind if I don't hurt it?"". I said ""That's what I always say!"". I went back inside and there was a little gecko in the games room chasing me around. There was a yellowy lizard in the sink, which had appeared before I went out the back. I was rinsing out a bowl with hot water but changed to cold because I didn't want to hurt the lizard."
"1968"	"(2008-03-13 (17)) For some reason, Ezra and I were staying at Eugene's. Jeremiah, Eugene and I had been hanging out earlier and had been watching music on TV. They had realized that I liked 'different' music and they suddenly liked me. So, we were staying at Eugene's and his brother Rodney and his father Abraham were there. It was time for bed and I was looking around the house at the photos. I was looking at one of Eugene and I turned around and he was behind me. I said ""You're a ninja!"" and he laughed. Someone was getting some paint thing. The people doing it accidentally gave them a pool. They were like ""What do you think all these colours were for?""."
"1969"	"(2008-03-13 (17)) I was at school. I wasn't in uniform, but I don't remember why I was there. I went to leave and called Mom to pick me up. Ms Newberry saw me and told me off for having my phone. I said that I wasn't here today. I came back later and called Mom to pick me up again and she refused so I started walking. Elijah was walking in front of me and I caught up with him. There were these bags of fertilizer or something and we throwing them at each other. This blue stuff got on him. We were laughing and he fell and I got ahead of him. I got home and I called Mom."
"1970"	"(2008-03-15 (17)) Darren and Mom were at some weird guy's house. We ended up at their old house. We were out the back and it was really small. The fence was really low and we could see the neighbour (who was an old lady). I was looking at our old stuff, including a TV and a suitcase. We went inside and our old stuff was still there (no-one had moved in). I said we should go upstairs and check out our old stuff. Then this person dressed in black came down the stairs and Ezra ran out the front door, but I went back to get my stuff and the guy caught me and was hitting me with a baseball bat. This happened a second time, but we had powers. I could put up a force field and could 'shoot' sparks from my hands. Ezra had telekinesis. The guy turned into Chuck (Chuck). Then I wasn't me and he was asking people to sell something for $200 and they were like ""Take it for free"". Then I was sitting on top of a tall bunk bed. Theodore 'fell' out of the wall. He was climbing down and Elijah was coming up and he was like ""Theodore, where did you come from?"" and I said ""Out of the wall"" and Elijah was like ""Oh, he must've been somewhere"". I don't remember where he said he must've been. Then Bradley, Eugene, Ezra and someone else came up. I was waiting for Darius to join but he never showed up. I kept looking at Eugene and he kept looking at me and I felt uncomfortable. Ezra was taking photos and I wanted a photo of Eugene but he didn't take a photo of him. Then we were playing some game. You were given an 'event' and a random date. We were in this hotel looking lobby. This couple went to their room. Someone was saying they were going to have sex. This lady was talking and was on stairs, she sounded like Bette Davis. I worked out that she was a bad guy and went up behind her, but I don't know what happened then. Then we were in a building and there was a security desk. There was a key in it, which meant there were intruders. I was looking in the drawers for a gun, but there wasn't one. I grabbed some scissors and put them in my pocket. Some guy and I went back to the stairs. He went first and he suddenly stumbled back -- he had been shot. I ran. We had a list of all the people in the game and if they were dead, their name went bold. Then I think Eugene died or I couldn't find him so I reset the game. The new date was in some dinosaur time. The terrorists were really crazy in this one. Some people died and then this person and I came across them. This other person died and they were shooting at them. The guy was called Alex Rae. It was in slow motion, so I ran forward and across and they missed, but then there were like 30 bullets and some just scraped past. They set off a nuclear bomb and everyone in the area was dead. I was like ""Oh my God, Eugene!"". Then I was at 'home'. I went in Dad's room and was talking to him. I locked the door because this bad guy was there. Dad told me to open it. It opened a little and the guy was getting his gun out so I shut the door. I called Mom and she was all giggly and weird. I don't know what I said but I decided it was a dream and I woke up. Mom was still giggly and she just got back from seeing some guy. I was talking to her about my dream, omitting the parts with Eugene."
"1971"	"(2008-03-17 (17)) We were at some place. This guy and I were in a cubby house out the back of the place. We decided to bash up this cat to get at the owners. We pretended that it fell off the roof of the cubby, but I had actually kicked it a bunch of times. I was worried that they would notice the marks weren't caused by a fall. They couldn't work out what was wrong with it but suspected that it was us that hurt it. It got better and she made it follow me, by using smell. I could smell too. We were then going to the road (from Nana's) and were trying to hitchhike. A big van stopped and there were two people in the front, but the back of the car wasn't very big. They realized it wouldn't fit people and left. The police kept coming. We started walking down the street towards home. Elijah was then there and he reminded me that Mom had to straighten my hair. There was something about mini golf."
"1972"	"(2008-03-17 (17)) Ezra was watching Entourage. Mom gave a map of their house to Darren. Ezra and I were then on the street and I saw a cockroach and said ""That's the second biggest cockroach I've ever seen!"" (thinking the first was the one on my back the other week). Ezra picked it up and threw it at me and I could feel it crawling on me."
"1973"	"(2008-03-18 (17)) I was at school and I was in physics. The class was different. It was almost home time and Mr Reilly gave me and someone else some extra work to do. I had my iPod on, but it was in my bag. It wasn't loud, but I could hear it properly. I wanted to take a photo of Eugene. He leant over Josephine. Someone came in who had been missing most of the lesson. She said she'd seen an owl and it kept copying what she said and she freaked out and ran a mile and her friend had to go after her. I was then somewhere else in the school. Calvin was there and he pretended there was an emergency (a strike) so we could get our leavers jackets early. In 15 minutes they were all there in wheelbarrows. Ms Olmstead was there and I asked if I could hand them out."
"1974"	"(2008-03-18 (17)) I was at a house. There was a monkey and a crocodile outside. The monkey was big and black. Tigger was outside, so I went out to get her and put her inside. Later, I had trouble with the monkey which kept trying to get inside and I was having trouble keeping it out. Mittens was outside too, but I only got Tigger."
"1975"	"(2008-03-19 (17)) It was going to be cold so I was going to wear pants but I decided to wear a jumper instead. I went to school and I had an English assignment due in. That period, we had to film a music video and we had lunch 1 and 2 to edit it. I storyboarded it and tried to get Calvin, Samantha and the rest of my group to do it, but they wanted to talk instead. I was thinking we should do Maxwell's Silver Hammer again, but with big smiles on their faces. I was asking Ms Solomon about something. Then I was watching something and Betty and Daniel (both from Ugly Betty) kissed because some lady asked them to do something. There was a video camera on a computer."
"1976"	"(2008-03-20 (17)) Mom and Darren were at home. There was a movie competition on the radio. All the prizes had been won. I was reading something about it, and one of the questions was 'how many statues are in the world?', the answer being 350 and 325 were in the US. One was called ""The Water Kicker (?)""."
"1977"	"(2008-03-20 (17)) There were some kittens. Two were white, two were black and I don't know about any others. I saw a light one on a bed and I thought it had died a few minutes ago. I asked where Dad was."
"1978"	"(2008-03-21 (17)) I went on a bus. Calvin went and sat next to Lucia and motioned for me to sit next to him (it was a 3-seater) and I shook my head and sat down a few rows in front. He kept trying to talk to me and then came and sat next to me."
"1979"	"(2008-03-21 (17)) Calvin was staying over. We were sharing a mattress in the lounge room. There were lots of pillows on it. Dad and other people were saying that we got along really well. We were playing Animal Crossing and I was playing some old weird Pokemon game. There were Diglett's and Bullet-o-Bill's (Super Mario). Animal Crossing looked like Pokemon and you could go into mushrooms and then the mushrooms would be bigger than you. The Breakfast Club was on TV and I was making a soup. I was going to watch it, but then decided that I watched some yesterday and couldn't be bothered. Calvin threw pillows at me and then chairs and they were all on top of me. I was then putting the pillows back. This girl came and got him and they went somewhere. I went later and some girl and guy were getting implants. The guy was James Spader's brother -- they had the same chin. Nana came and was like ""I hope you're not going to take your clothes off! There are kids here"". Everyone was like ""What the hell?"". I was watching some movie and aliens accidentally shot a missile at their own planet, it made a noise and I was like ""What the flip? You wouldn't hear that!"". Ezra asked why and I said there isn't any noise in space."
"1980"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I was in this hotel lobby. Calvin, Samantha and others were there too. We were talking about something and Calvin said whenever we do certain things, Eugene is near us. Samantha was like ""Well, at least we know she (me) likes Eugene"". Eventually, I said ""Ok, well he (the person I like) doesn't have an 'I' in is name"". I was thinking of Dmitri and Daryl who were nearby. We were then at school, I think. At first we were in a little room and we had to play this game. This double agent lady unlocked a door and let us through. Each person had to use a different key. The first time I barely made it through because the bad guy came and was shooting. The second time, I got through quickly. Elijah got through as well. We had to run and go through some water and get onto this little raft, then go onto land and run up these stairs. The stairs led up to this weird broken building. The bad guy got in with a hostage. Eric Mabius was there. I said ""What's your name in this, Eric?"" and he said ""What? My middle name?"" and I said no and then he said ""Oh! My name in this is Cockwell"". I explained that the bad guy had infected the hostage guy with a virus. If we had it, he was contagious and we would die. I went looking for medicine. I found a book called ""Stop on Lily"" and I had a random flashback (I'd done it before). You weren't allowed to shoot your enemy once they were on your turf. Someone got autographs and photos with Greg and David from Big Brother 2005."
"1981"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I had a big playground. Mom cleaned some of it and the parts she didn't clean had fossil things everywhere. We were in a shop. It was Easter and I was having one egg a day, which was ""15g of fat in 3 days""."
"1982"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) It was the end of Saw 5 and the guy they played it on got blown up in a car. It zoomed in on the licence plate which was 8ZE-963. This detective dude was in his office and then Frank Whaley (who was the guy that got blown up) came in. Then we were somewhere. I realized they were going to blow up Mom's car. Mom, Ezra and I got all our important stuff out and went inside this house. Ezra was really slow and this guy was putting his hand in his jacket so I was telling Ezra to hurry. There were these cats inside and they kept going outside. One of the cats was that ugly one from Ugly Betty. One of the cats went out and I said ""Not Christopher Gorham!"". The doors were confusing. The car blew up. Someone had orange socks. This girl and I went to a house. It was Eugene's. His father (Abraham) was called Richard but liked being called Dick. I went to Eugene's room, taking note of the house layout. He was in his bed. He motioned for me to go next to him. He was watching TV. I was thinking 'Oh my God, I'm in Eugene's room'. I lay down next to him and he put his arm around me, then we were hugging and kissing. Later, I got up to draw a map of the house. Rodney wasn't in his room and there were school bags in there. His parents were in bed. I heard a noise like someone was trying to get into the house. I told Eugene. We got up and there was a guy in his parent's bedroom (they had a back door in there). They said something and we realized they were bad and we ran out the door. We were running on this roof and swinging from trees. Eugene saved me from the guys at one point, then I ran away when he was in trouble. This lady and another lady (who was a mole) were walking down a dark street. They told me to this old person's house and I had to use a weird hand held console (it was a game, but wasn't). I told Nana that people were coming to kill her, but she didn't believe me."
"1983"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I was watching the TV from the family room. Dad was in the dining room. They had something about Knocked Up and they were talking to Katherine Heigl, then they had Michael Cera on there. They had something about Juno and Ellen Page and Michael Cera. They didn't know who the father of the baby was. There was an interview with Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson and Christopher Ryan but it wasn't him."
"1984"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I went to watch episode 200 of Ugly Betty. It started and then I saw Lee Pace and realized it was Pushing Daisies."
"1985"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I was at a place with Dad and Ezra. We were looking for a toilet. One was outside a caravan and I said ""I wish we were at Seabird"". There was a lady outside her house and her daughter (who was really young) was bruised and dirty and she was holding her by her hair and being really violent. We were going to go and do something, but the lady kept looking at us evilly."
"1986"	"(2008-03-23 (17)) I was in bed and I heard a weird scratching noise, then this grill next to my bed opened and Mittens came on to my bed. I was wondering where the grill came from and I told Dad. He did this spiffy thing to my roller shutters and checked out the front to see if anyone was out there. I went out to the family room and Mom was there. She was going to go outside to clear a table for something she was going to do. I saw a guy in the dining room and he pointed a gun at me, then at Mom. I said ""Why is Aragorn [something I don't remember] ?"". Then Dad came out too. The guy made us put these shirts on, then he was Ezra and it was the future or an alternate universe. He was a bad guy. We were on a space ship. Ezra was watching 24 and I realized that I'd missed two episodes of season four. There were faces of characters on a computer screen. I saw Tony and Barry Landes and was thinking about The Hitcher and ""I can't believe that's creepy dude!"". Dad and I were saying ""Yeah"" like Tony. Then it was third person, and there was this big room. Betty and Daniel (both Ugly Betty) were there and he got shot and all these flower petals were falling from the roof."
"1987"	"(2008-03-23 (17)) I had to do an oral presentation and I quoted from some paper thing and threw fake money in the air. Elijah was there. Then I was at a university and I had a piece of paper which was supposed to be my timetable but it made no sense. There was a room with lots of computers."
"1988"	"(2008-03-24 (17)) I was at 'school'. There was this clothes shop and I was in there. This girl there used to be a guy. Her coat came off and I gave her my coat (which was black and big). I was trying to pick another coat for her. I complained about all the clothes. Darius had met this girl and was looking for her. He was bisexual. He thought he had found her, but it was a guy. Later I had messages from Darius and he wanted to know what his name was. His name was Allan Green. I had a message from Eugene but I don't remember what it said, but it was really funny. A lady saw me using my phone when I was texting Darius and she sent me to the office. At 2.55pm, Ezra got sent there too. I messaged Mom to get her to put $500 towards my car. She was getting a new roof in a few weeks."
"1989"	"(2008-03-25 (17)) On the way to school, I was tired and I fell asleep. When I woke up it was 11am and we were still in the car. Dad explained that Doom 4 had come out and so he bought it. When he got home he was setting up the Xbox 360. Later he said that on Wednesday night, I had to go to school to do my English essay. Then they said it was at 12pm. Then Dad and I were at school and they said it was on Saturday. Then Ms Solomon changed it to the 16 March. Mr Stevenson said I was doing badly at school and had to talk to some teachers. Then I was at Nana's. Ezra was there too. There was a weird insect there; it was like a spider with a shell. It was extremely dangerous (its bite was). Ezra and I were running from it. We went to go inside and it followed us and we climbed up the door. I went up to Granny's and I was doing my essay there. I was sitting at this table outside, but it was too high. Fido had puppies."
"1990"	"(2008-03-25 (17)) I was at 'home'. This guy had been annoying me for a while and it went Ugly Betty like and it showed him going to use me for something. I didn't like him though. Then he had a party and I was wondering what he was doing. Henry (Ugly Betty) came and he was my boyfriend and when I saw him I was like ""Henry!"" and ran to him and hugged him."
"1991"	"(2008-03-26 (17)) The school was having a prom. This rich kid's birthday was on the same day, so his father did the birthday party, which doubled as the prom. The kid was Classmate-M-22. The song Sadie Pritchard Dance was playing. This guy who looked like Christopher Gorham was there and he had an engagement ring on and said some other guy did too. I had been downloading a video of the party before it happened. My hard drive was screwy though and I had to press down on it a bit because it was bent. Darren, Ezra and Mom were at a house because Ezra had to get something. I had this photo from school and Isabel was in it. Gossip Girl got cancelled and it was showing the way the new season would've started and all the characters morphed into the next one and it looked really cool. The only person I recognized was Leighton Meester."
"1992"	"(2008-03-27 (17)) I was at school. I went into the library for form but it was different. Eugene was in my form and he sat in the seat next to me (we were sitting at computers). Calvin saw and pointed. Autumn was there. There was an announcement for physics students to go to the office and get something. Eugene and someone went to get one for everyone. Silas was handing out road map books. He asked me to describe A Clockwork Orange. I was saying that the future was 'bleak' and technology was really good. Then I was thinking about the movie (but it was totally different with different people in it) and the main guy's house had all these moving things in it. I did media. Mr Billings told us to make a movie and I was trying to plan it, but no-one in my group was interested."
"1993"	"(2008-03-27 (17)) Dad was complaining to me about maggots."
"1994"	"(2008-03-28 (17)) I was at school. I was in a classroom and the siren was about to go. The teacher was talking and the class was full but I started walking out. I had to walk past Eugene. I was then at this house with Ezra. It was creepy. The reception was really bad and I kept getting texts from 'Poo'. They were like ""na est lie pa"", which really creeped me out. I showed Ezra. I said they were from Calvin's other phone. We watched this video of this person walking past a hallway and it scared us. They tried to get in the house. I was friends with Eugene's group and I needed Darius for something."
"1995"	"(2008-03-29 (17)) I found all these old video games. Some of them were ones I used to play when I was little. One was a dinosaur game and I was like ""Oh and you can change things into dinosaurs"". They were sorted by console and some were 'paper'. It had that fortune teller paper thing. This other dinosaur game was the ""saddest"" game. It was made in 1972. This other game was this one where you race along a road and pick stuff up and dodge obstacles. I said ""I used to play this with Uncle Vic""."
"1996"	"(2008-03-29 (17)) I don't remember properly, but Eugene was sitting with his friends a while away from me and we were watching something."
"1997"	"(2008-03-29 (17)) Mom and I were at some place getting tickets for something. I don't remember anything else."
"1998"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I was at home. Dad was working late, till midnight or something. I called his work, but he wasn't there. I felt uncomfortable so I called Mom and asked her to pick me up because I felt nervous. She said 'ok, be there in ten'. I was playing music and I heard a baby crying loudly from in the house. I didn't want to get up, so I didn't. I heard people talking and about ten minutes later, some people went into Dad's room. I went in and there was a guy and two girls at his laptop. I was like ""What the hell are you doing?"" and I got the baseball bat and I was hitting them, but it didn't seem to do much. They went back to the games room and there were heaps of other people there. There were some twins who looked like Hilda (Ugly Betty) and they called me ugly and I said ""Look at yourself!"". There was a hole somewhere and a blue block had been put there, but they had pushed it aside and came through. They all went out but I was worried they were going to come back."
"1999"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I had dressed up (but not really) for some thing and Bryson liked the outfit. We were in a car and Nana was saying that Bryson was amazed that I was ""pretty"". Darius was around and was annoyed at something."
"2000"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) We were at a hotel. I went into this guys room to use a ruler to cut out something I had printed (an obituary). Ezra was in this creepy guy's room and he was coming back so I warned Ezra. He managed to get out in time. There was this guy there called Kit who was really hot and we became good friends. He was then Eugene, and I think we got drunk one night and we started making out."
"2001"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) We were outside somewhere and I was driving to get out. Then there were all these dead ends in this carpark, so I drove over some curbs, but I went up this road and it went between these two waterslides (it wasn't actually a road). Then we were walking and the only way to get out was by going down this part of the waterslide. We had to lie down strangely so that it wouldn't hurt. Then this girl and I went into this section of the place to find the president, so we could get home. This guy saw us and started coming after us. Someone said something about David Palmer (24) and one of us were like ""David Palmer is gone"". Then someone said something and realized it was the president. He was black and bald and he turned around and I said ""Oh, Wayne!"". It was Wayne Palmer (24). We were talking to him and the girl said a gigantic thing had eaten her money. He was talking to me about wine and I said ""I only drink water man"". Wayne's assistant said there was ""a bloody bone"" in the boot of this car. Then it was Easter and we were at Nana's. For some reason, Eugene, Darius, Jeremiah and the others were there too. They were sitting at the big table and I was on the computer. They wanted to play Pub Krawl. Eventually Dad, Ezra and I were at the table too. Dad picked the Pub Krawl box up and I said ""We haven't played that in years!"" and I was thinking that we used to play it with Classmate-M-19 (from Coldspring)."
"2002"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I was watching Ugly Betty. Betty got bigger glasses and she smiled. She looked odd."
"2003"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I was watching American Idol. They showed Michael Johns and then they had these African kids dancing. Randy Jackson said ""What is this, So You Think You Can Dance?"". One of the dancers, a little girl, had weird arms and they were wrapped up around her head. She had said something 'sad' to Simon Cowell and it had changed him somehow. She tried to do the same thing to Randy."
"2004"	"(2008-03-31 (17)) I was at school and I went to this place which would bring people back to life or fix them up (like an emergency room). I had brought in Will Arnett ages ago and I hadn't heard anything from them. As I walked to it, I was reminded of Ugly Betty and how Hilda was when Santos died and I was talking like Hilda and saying ""Oh my gawd!"". The place was full of people and I waited patiently, and finally I asked the girl there. She said ""Oh, it was Tom Arnett's body wasn't it?"" and I just said ""yeah"". She scrunched her face and said ""How do I put this..."" and I said ""Just say if he is dead or not"" and she said ""Ok, he's dead"". Then she was talking to Stephen Tobolowsky who was hanging around in the background. I was trying not to cry and walked back to school. Some boy was throwing this ball and talking to himself. I walked into the senior school block and said ""Geez, you're noisy"" to the kid."
"2005"	"(2008-04-01 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I were driving, but we were in Dad's car. I was with Dad at first, but it changed to Mom. There were deodorant cans or something on the road. This creepy, dirty guy was standing in the middle of the road and he put this yellow bin in the middle of our lane. The car was high enough to miss it, but we were like 'what the hell was he doing?'. We had to leave the car and we were walking through this swampy looking place. Mom and Ezra had been hurt and were looking for a hospital. There was some brown/green water, which was also bubbly. We had to cross it to get any further. There were some signs and one had stuff spelt wrong. Mom and Ezra went in it and started swimming, so I followed them. The next obstacle was below us (it was dug-out, like a pool, but with sand on the side and no water). We had to jump into it, but so that we would slide across this little slid-y bit on the bottom of it. Mom did that but she didn't slide and Ezra went and slid into her. I just climbed down the side of the 'hole'. The last thing was this trampoline and you had to get into this ""air swing"", which Mom said people had sex in. Ezra got into that and we had to get somewhere else. We finished it and Mom was like ""Why don't you want to have sex with the guy?"" and I was like ""Huh?!"". The guy came out and he was blonde and odd looking but he was pretty hot. Seamus was there playing a DS and I said ""Shiggan! You're still alive! We thought you'd been raped and killed"". He laughed. The guy was gay. Then Ezra was Seth Green and we weren't there. There was a fat girl there too. The guy said he wanted to keep Seth, but the girl was ""manlier"". She was crying and I was like ""What the flip? You're girly!"". Then it was us again. I was telling the guy that the guy with the bin reminded me of the Winkie's scene in Mulholland Dr. I went home and Ezra was going to stay with the guy. Then Dad got a text that Ezra was coming home."
"2006"	"(2008-04-01 (17)) I was in a room. This guy's phone had exploded before. Then his friend's phone was going to explode and he threw the bomb thing and I was like ""Now your phone's going to explode"" and he was like ""Damn it!""."
"2007"	"(2008-04-02 (17)) I was at school in math. Mr Gutenberg was there. We were doing some weird results thing and it was like a 3D bar graph. There was ""one drawn right and one with the right answer"" -- one was mine and the other was Eugene's. It happened with another thing too. Selena was talking to Alejandro about family trees and he thought she said cheese."
"2008"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) This guy had a little apartment. His friend caught up with him and then he left. The friend and I went back in. The guy was coming back and I hid in the shower. His friend tried to distract him and I had to move under this thing (that was like a bed). His daughter and her friend heard me and took a box that I was hiding behind away. Eventually the guy got distracted and I ran out. Then the guy came out and the daughter had told him I was in there. It had happened once before. I think the first time, Christopher Ryan was in the shower."
"2009"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) We were at a shop. This lady and I were poisoning apples. I was driving and I took off from the lights but then I had to stop quickly and I didn't stop in time and I hit the car in front of me. It then hit the car in front and that kept happening down this very long, busy street (domino effect). At the next set of lights, there was a huge accident. I asked Mom what I should do and she said ""die"". She brought me to this road that I had trouble with and I said ""Are you trying to kill me?"". She said it was so we didn't have to go to jail. Ezra was also in the car."
"2010"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) I was at Nana's. She was going to bring me to the hospital for some reason."
"2011"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) I was watching TV. This dating show thing was on and this guy, who wasn't bad looking, had three girls to date. One was blonde. The girls were sitting together and she said she was going to the toilet, but she called the guy instead. It showed the guy talking to the camera, saying about one girl, ""I got this virgin vibe"". He said about the other girls: ""They go off to the club and shower together"". It also showed the girls in a pool and he was looking at their boobs."
"2012"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) We had an excursion. There was a height and weight scale in this big clothes shop. It was really big and it went around in a circle and had spaces for six or so people at a time. When it was done you got this cool piece of paper with all this information on it. Elijah and Noelle were there. Everyone participated except for me. We saw Salim walking across this oval to get there. I wanted to ask if I could go on by myself."
"2013"	"(2008-04-04 (17)) I was at school. I don't remember properly, but Eugene and I were friends and I think he liked me."
"2014"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) This guy was making a movie. He cast Kevin Connolly in a role, but was originally going to cast Theodore. I was painting a room. Everyone there had a certain colour to paint with. Tucker was there. I had red. On the wall, already painted, was red, yellow, pink and something else (they were in stripes). There was a certain order but if we liked a spot more, we could paint there instead. The pink was called the ""mystery colour"". I don't remember what happened but Dad, Ezra and I were in a car. Sometimes Dad was Mom. These people in this other car were doing weird things. Mom had an argument with this lady, who looked like Liza Minnelli. Ezra wanted to read some diary extracts and I said no. We were at a house later and they had school photos there. They were from this thing that some students went to. I wondered if Eugene was there so I looked through them, but he wasn't. We were then in a room somewhere and I looked out the window and there was no ground; all there was outside was clouds and darkness. We were then driving. Elijah was with us. There were fireworks and people from school were like 'I haven't seen them in ages'. I was thinking about the stuff we learnt about fireworks in chemistry. This lady was driving and she went back up this road and trees were in the way and she stopped on a jetty. I said ""now someone's going to come and push off"". This car then started coming. I jumped out and ran. I ended up in front of this house and Dmitri opened the front fate and let me in. He told me to look for something and he was doing something with this weird thing and I was like ""Are you the Anti-Christ?"" (something about the Anti-Christ had come up earlier) and he told me to look at this thing, which then turned into this bright white light. I was then somewhere else. People didn't like us because of all these accidents that had happened to some people and they had died. We went to the Liza Minnelli woman later to apologize. Dad said he didn't want to have her ""on his butt"". Will Arnett was somewhere. Dad was watching a movie earlier. I was with Calvin somewhere."
"2015"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) I was outside at this place, which looked a little bit like a hedge maze. I was walking along a path and I saw Eugene and Darius coming down the other way. I was looking at Eugene. I was then in a house. Each house (or room) could only have a certain amount of people in it. It was raining. We had to go inside if it was raining or if it was hot (or we would die). The rain was dangerous for some reason. We had to lock each door to make sure no-one else snuck in. I had trouble locking a door. Then it was hot. Someone was trying to come in because someone inside owed them money. Then Dad and Ezra were outside and knocked on the front door and they said ""It's ok now"". We lived in a desert, because everywhere was now a desert."
"2016"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) I was in English and we were sitting in our groups. We thought we were going to be practicing our speech, but Ms Madsen had already started recording us."
"2017"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) I was walking outside with Mom. She was looking for Spaceman and I was calling out for him and I saw Cuddles. There was a big black cat on this video and its face was blurred. I was at home, which was really different. I was on my laptop and the internet wasn't working properly. Mom wanted me to go on some site. I was watching a bit of 24 and Tony was lying on a lounge and Michelle was on the TV."
"2018"	"(2008-04-06 (17)) I was at school. Fatima and Colleen were there. Fatima was asking me questions about our speech. I think she or someone else, were having sex with this random guy. Some people were making fun of me. Fatima had text me and I hadn't replied. I had a text from Colleen too."
"2019"	"(2008-04-06 (17)) I was at home and it was before school. I was playing a game on the computer. I lost track of time and Dad was like ""We're leaving now"". I had to get dressed and straighten my hair still. I said ""Look, just get Mom to drop me off"". It was already 9.30am. Ezra was there. They were like ""Oh, you'll just wag"". But, I wasn't going to."
"2020"	"(2008-04-08 (17)) Some band had done a song with Buddy Holly and the Crickets. I discovered that Ryan Cartwright was dead and looked him up on IMDb. They didn't have a death date on there, but I worked out that it was on March 2. I was reading posts on the message board and he had been murdered. People suspected his mother. I was doing heaps of washing. Acquaintance-M-01 called. Dad asked me what job would suit him and I said ""Computer... analyst?"", but that was what Acquaintance-M-01 was, and Dad was only saying it so he would stop asking him questions, so we had to think of something else."
"2021"	"(2008-04-09 (17)) Eugene was telling me about some speech he was doing. I was at Nana's. Then I was at 'school' and Mr Reilly was early and it had something to do with his wife. Then we were at this place and something had fallen into this water in front of this restaurant (it was like a long, square shaped pool, but it had a bridge over it and you didn't swim in it). Then Mr Reilly or I jumped in to get it. Some people helped us. It had something to do with his wife again."
"2022"	"(2008-04-09 (17)) I was at Fatima's. Some others and I were staying there. We went out for a walk. Her parents were really strict and annoying."
"2023"	"(2008-04-10 (17)) Mom and I went to a petrol station or deli. Ezra was on TV talking about Runescape and summoning. I was thinking that I wanted to do my summoning. Someone was questioning Mom about us, so she made us record a bunch of stuff so she could say she was with us. Some lady was in a building with another lady who she was protecting. The bad guys came and she said ""we gotta get out of here"". Then it was a game and on the screen there were lots of dots and it showed which dots were bad guys. I had to find a path where I'd be ok. Then I was at school and we were watching something which was really weird and I said ""It's like David Lynch!""."
"2024"	"(2008-04-11 (17)) Mom and I were at some weird place in the forest. It was dark. There were these hamster like animals with long snouts. They were doing some weird things, so Mom left a note on the cage saying that they had fallen and hit their head. We got a lighter, some gas and a lantern and it made a little explosion when we put them together. We then had light. We were walking down a path and if we leant forward and walked a bit faster, we would suddenly just go really fast, so we did that. Then we were at a village with a place to sleep. Then it was Eugene and I. We were in a room. He was in bed and there was another me and I was watching her. She was like ""Oh, I need my cappuccino"" and Eugene and I were like 'what the flip?'. He couldn't see me. I realized I'd been 'separated' and had changed the part of me that didn't like coffee. It was sometimes a game and I was little and jumped onto the bed and collected coins. Then I went in the kitchen and collected the coins in there. Then Ezra, Mom, Dmitri, Eugene and I were in a car. Mom went to a petrol station and Dmitri was in the driver's seat. This guy went to Ezra's side and asked him to write a note about the car and started going to the driver's side to take it. I locked the doors and then I was in the driver's seat and I took off. I was going really fast, but the guy went into a car and was following me. We ended up in a shop, still driving, and the cops were chasing me. I saw a cop car, so I stopped the car and threw my hands up. I told them a crazy guy was following me, but he was gone."
"2025"	"(2008-04-11 (17)) I was at home. Eugene, Darius, Alejandro and Jeremiah were staying over. Ezra was there too. My room was really messy. My diary was on the floor. I was going through a box of stuff and Alejandro was watching me. I found some Goosebumps books and I said ""I love Goosebumps!"". I didn't want them in my room in case they got hold of my diaries, but they didn't go in there. I was going to play Pokemon Diamond."
"2026"	"(2008-04-11 (17)) I was in the car with Mom. Ezra called to ask if I wanted Clayton's sub from Subway for dinner (he didn't want it, and Dad had forgotten to get me one). I said no, and he told Dad I said no and Dad said to get Mom to get something for me. We were trying to find a Subway. We went to some shop in Innaloo which had a Subway. Mom got me roast chicken, but when I looked at it, it had only one 6-inch and bits of chicken and tomato and stuff on the plate. I complained to Mom and this lady went to put salt on it. I grabbed it away and complained that salt would make it worse. It had some sauce on it, which was actually pretty nice. The chicken was in strips. I went to this toilet. There was a big room and three doors -- one was the men's, one was the women's and one had a silhouette in the shape of the head of Frankenstein's monster. I tried to go into that one, but the door wouldn't budge. I was then at home, I think, watching something. Some guy had been the only one to survive this ride (it kept getting rigged by this dude so people would die). It was all filmed and I was watching it. He had been going down the slide and to his doom, but the dude who rigged it, had set up a box which told you how to survive it. He managed to survive, but then the guy went after his family and they all died. At the end of the slide, one of them was blindfolded and had to light all these sticks and once they were all lighted he could let go and live, but they started going out and he let go and died. Then Dad said the next one was ""Eugene Pritchard"" and I was like 'what?!'. I took it off him and it had all this information about him and baby photos. It said his birthday was January 11. I was reading some stuff about him doing well in science and I was crying. Ezra was asking me something and I was trying not to look at him."
"2027"	"(2008-04-12 (17)) I was in the car with Eugene, Rodney, Ezra and Dad. Sometimes Dad wasn't there. We went to Mom's and then Bradley was in the car. We were sitting so that it went Bradley, Eugene, then me. Bradley asked me if I could see if there was a coffee chill. The house was different. Mom had cleaned out some of my room (Ezra had stuff in there). I went to the fridge and there was hardly anything in there. There were some green bottles in there. Mom was playing on the computer outside. Darren was around. I told Bradley that there was nothing. Ezra was playing Counterstrike. I had a water bottle and Eugene kept drinking out of it. My hair was normal, but looked straight. Eugene and I kept being rather close."
"2028"	"(2008-04-13 (17)) I was in a shop I think. This girl kept calling me fat. At another time she was annoying me about not having friends and I said ""Who wants them?"". I grabbed this weird waffle thing and left. I was then driving and was having trouble. These cops behind me put their lights on and I was like ""What do I do?!"" and Mom said to just pull over and that they seemed like they were nice. The cop asked me if I'd been drinking and I said no and he made me breathe into the breathalyzer. The cop started picking on me and I was wondering what was going on but didn't say anything. I walked past Eugene's house, but it was different and in a different place. I could see through the window and Eugene was on an orange lounge that was falling apart and he was watching TV and putting this mould of an old guy on his head. Later, he was trying to get people to bet on some horse dressed as the old guy. I told Dad not to and said ""it's a guy in my class"". Later I was walking with some girl from school. There were these weird lights in the sky and they were falling to Earth. Soon, there were a bunch of them and we realized they were aliens. I was hiding in a car. The aliens took over Earth."
"2029"	"(2008-04-14 (17)) I went to school. I got given a slip by Mr Stevenson to see him and some girls at the ""hotel looking hall"". I was in the office and went to the hotel like room. Mom was there. These ladies were talking to me. I had a sniffly nose. Mom said she was taking me home after and I was thinking 'Ezra's not going to be happy'. Mr Haynes was there too."
"2030"	"(2008-04-15 (17)) We had an excursion. We were put into groups and we drove up there in a car. Eugene, Calvin and others were there. It was like a camp. I went in a pool which was really deep. I jumped in and went to push off the bottom but there was no bottom and I couldn't swim back up. I waved my hand and some people pulled me out. I said that I forgot how to swim. Ezra was there too. I had to evict people from our group after tasks. We had to 'win' minutes to sleep. I got 70 minutes. I was thinking that Eugene had 8 hours. I was playing Runescape, except it was real. I teleported somewhere and this spider thing attacked me and I almost died. Then back at the camp place, we got down to the final two in our group, but I don't know what happened then. Mom was driving me to 'school'. There were a group of Asian men outside. I said they were filming ""House of the Dead II"" [note: Ezra had it on his desk when I was using his computer yesterday] and that David Lynch was directing. We had a new camp. Girls had to get this suction thing off of Ms Corbett. Eugene wasn't there this time. Evelyn, Fatima and Calvin were there. Calvin got a suction thing and I said it was only for girls. Some people had colourful suction things. Fatima, Calvin and I were in a group and we ended up in a car with some others. Fatima and two others were in the front with the air-conditioner on. David Lynch had done some movie with Rebekah in it. But it was 'real'. It was at Mom's old house, but it was different. We needed money so we wanted to rent a room. Rebekah was the only person in the state who wanted to rent. I didn't want to let her, but we did anyway. She never paid and kept running off at night etc. I was going to kick her out. I was telling Dad about something."
"2031"	"(2008-04-16 (17)) I was near the lounge room. Eugene was in there with some others. Dad was talking to me. Tigger was just at the entrance to the lounge room and I was playing with her and calling ""Linxy!"". I went driving with Mom. There were clouds in the sky and they were weird looking. Mom asked me if I knew what they were and she said they were hurricanes. I freaked out. We went to a petrol station and Andrew McCarthy worked there. He said my limit (for petrol) was full for today and I was like 'damn, we can't do the logbook quickly'."
"2032"	"(2008-04-17 (17)) It was the morning before school. My hair hadn't been straightened. We had jackets with hoods but I didn't think it was going to be cold enough so I planned to wag. I was near the kitchen and Dad reminded me to make breakfast. Then Ezra was there. We got to school which was really different and I told Ezra to go upstairs (so I could tell him I was walking). We were in this big room. Ezra said ""Hey Aunt Sally' and I saw her sitting in there. I didn't know any of the teachers there. It was for form so I was trying to find mine. There was a guy and a girl and I asked each of them if they were from B2 but neither answered. A movie about some wagging boy had come out recently. There was something about A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm McDowell was hitting some guy in the balls. This lady teacher was annoying me so I yelled at her and started walking out. Ms Pascal was coming and everyone ran out of the room, so I went with them to sneak out. There was a pink bike near some trees. I took it, but had trouble with it. I got home. All these people turned up outside a while later. Aunt Sally, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur, Dad and others. Dad came and talked to me calmly, then Mom came to stay with me."
"2033"	"(2008-04-17 (17)) I was at Nana's. Last time we were up there I had started making some dessert but had stuffed up and didn't finish. I had some game with recipes for a cake. We came up with the ingredients for it. I tried again and it was stirring, but it was just pink and white lollies in there. I realized I forgot flour and milk and all the important stuff. I asked Nana for a bunch of ingredients (eggs etc). Dad was annoyed at me because he wanted to leave. There was some show where they tested if talking to plants helped or not. One of the girls on it had lost half her weight and was embarrassed to go on. She actually didn't and went on the show."
"2034"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) I was at Mom's old house. Fatima lived next door and we'd become friends. Her parents and Mom and Darren wanted a chat with us. They had recently got our reports and were disappointed. I had an A in Accounting and a score of 201/202 and the others were ok and one C. Fatima had one C and 2 D's and the rest were 0 (Accounting and something else). I said that I got a C in Biology because I didn't send off all the assignments in time. Darren asked something. We were outside, but under a sheltered bit. They went away and we tried to sneak past Mom to go back to my room but she saw and we all laughed. There was a ghost. Fatima was trying to sleep. There was a cat with xx eyes. Fatima's father was on the roof with the ghost and the ghost pushed him off. I was playing Runescape. Varrock had the best bank but to get in you had to go through this thing where you jump on these monster's heads. If you missed the head it took heaps of damage. I ended up going to Falador instead. I also got some teak planks at some point. I got an IM from Seamus on MSN. He sent me a message through some site though. He said I had changed heaps and I was emo because I had been listening to ""Choirboys- Run to Paradise"" and I was annoyed that there wasn't a space between Choirboys and the hyphen. I said I hadn't changed and that I'd liked that song for ages. I didn't really understand what he meant by what he said. We continued conversing and it was really funny. My music playlist on Windows Media Player kept going all stupid."
"2035"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) This guy on some show would do stuff to people to see how they react. At one of the houses he said ""pee on the wall and blood on the doors"". Then he realized they had a son because he saw baby stuff on the ground. They came home and someone and I went out the back and over this gate at the front of the next door neighbour's house. Some guy was like ""Hey I just saw you-,"" and I said ""Yeah, we lost our ball""."
"2036"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) I was at 'home'. Sometimes it was Mom's house. Kenny Hotz was there and he was trying to kill me I think. I hit Spenny with a metal pole and he fainted. I hit Kenny and he was bleeding, but was ok. I ended up in the pool. I had a shower at Mom's house. I got out and realized I had forgotten to wash the conditioner out. Ezra came to ask me something. I was then at 'school'. Some guy called Tim Course, who was an actor, was coming. Ms Corbett was in the common room, which was different. She asked me to go. Calvin and Liesl were there. We were getting put in groups and Calvin was trying to get me in his group, but I wasn't going to go to see the actor guy."
"2037"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) This friend of mine and I met up with Frank Whaley and he was talking to me for a while. He and my friend fell asleep on a lounge behind me. I was taking photos of him and Tigger with my phone. I was thinking that he was really hot."
"2038"	"(2008-04-19 (17)) I was at home. Nana, Dad and others were there. Santiago told me to move the exercise bike into the games room. There were different groups of females. They were allowed to request one thing each for some competition thing. One of groups was black women. This other group had this pretty girl in it and she wanted this cream and I was like ""Why don't you just get food instead?"". I was out the back. Leslie was knocking on the door. I had been looking after her kids, but I'd forgotten all about them. Nana thought something I don't remember was bad for young kids. Dad was making my lunch for school, but we only had bread with sultanas in it. I asked if any shops were open and the only one was called Copenhagen. We went there. We were outside and Nana saw a competition where you jump up and hit this part of a poster and if you hit all of them, you could win trips to different places. She won a trip to this theme park. Dad and I were waiting for her to finish there. On the TV it showed her going down a waterslide. Then these people wanted to interview us (we had all gone now). They were setting up video cameras in this shop. We were lined up, so Ezra was at one end, then someone, someone else, Trevor Fehrman, Dad and then me. I complained about the order and Dad said to go next to Ezra and I said ""No, I'd rather be next to Elias here"" and pointed to Trevor. They were asking Dad questions and pulled him away from the shop. We went to follow them but they told us to stay. The interviewer kept pulling people away and then it was just Trevor and I. He said ""That was a tidal wave"" which was a reference to an earlier joke. I laughed. There were boxes for Sims 3 and we were arguing about it and the people were filming our argument."
"2039"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) Dad said he was going to leave for Seabird today. Ezra was there. I said I'd just stay home then because I still had to wash my clothes, do my iPod etc. I asked if he could just go tomorrow and he decided to."
"2040"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) I was at 'school'. Fatima, Calvin, some others and I were outside of our class. Someone gave us a sheet of paper which said ""I love someone"" and my name was on there ('I' had signed it). I said that it wasn't my hand writing. They went to show someone else the paper and I followed. I left before them but this teacher lady made us all stay back. My desk was at the front of the classroom. We were seated: Fatima at the wall, Calvin, Lucia, someone, then me. Lucia was out of her seat.  We were doing some stuff on the floor. Eugene was behind us and he said that they couldn't fit behind me. I started yelling about them calling me fat and that I didn't ""have to look like a prostitute like them"". I saw Eugene looking at me and I was like 'oh...'. His friends asked him later to ask me out, but he said he didn't want to (it was mean). The teacher was in this office and said ""Izzy?"" and I said ""Me?""."
"2041"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) I don't know where I was, but I found my diary from 2002. In it, I had written that I was going out with Eugene. I was like 'what the hell?'. Every entry had something to do with him. One of them said ""Me and Eugene are going to get married""."
"2042"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) I was at Nana's. There was a boxing match and this guy wanted to win on 30 points. They could get 'free' points by spinning a wheel. The other guy got 40 points. We went outside. The boxer guy was there. A friend of Ezra's was there and I started hitting him. This curly white haired guy was near the fish pond and I said ""Who's the creepy dude?"". The boxer said ""My manager. My father,"". His mother also had curly white hair. We all went to leave but all the exits except for one had been blocked. We went out and there were stairs. We saw this car drive off, but then it came back. This dark coloured lady got out. She had set up an obstacle course. I passed the first obstacle and was going over to the second thing. I had to go through a hospital and this lady gave me a baby boy to hold. He was really small and kept opening his mouth but he was 'muted'. I got to the second thing, which was on a computer, and the lady came so I gave her back the baby. Alejandro finished at the computer but someone else got his computer. Eventually I got a computer. We had to play this Mah-jongg game. If you made a mistake you would get an electric shock through the mouse. I finished and then was at a chess board. This giant lizard escaped and it stepped right on my side of the chessboard. I told the lady what happened and she said I could move on. The lizard was then a dinosaur. It kept coming after me. I was running up and down stairs and then went into this shop. The whole inside of it was cushioned, airy, bouncy and dark. The dinosaur followed me in and I hid under the wall. The dinosaur went past, but then saw me, but I got out. This girl was hiding behind a pillar. She was going to check where the dinosaur was but then its nose came past and was sniffing. Then I was in the car with Dad and we were driving to this forest. The sky was smoke and fire. The trees were burning and they had health like on Runescape and it was going down."
"2043"	"(2008-04-21 (17)) I was at home. Dad was working late or staying out. I had gotten some movies out earlier so I went to watch one of them which had Ana Ortiz in it. The cover of it, showed her pregnant, having the baby. Then I heard a car pull up and I looked out the window. It was a blue car with Tooth Pritchard/Tooth Pritchard (one on top of the other) or something as the number plate. I put the chain on the wood door and went to my room. They tried to get in. All I could hear was loud banging. I tried to call Mom but it said the phone was unavailable. I called Darren but he said they weren't at home. I called Dad's work and told him to come home. At some point, Ezra came back. We were outside somewhere and this guy was trying to get in the building. We began to run away from him and we opened this door and were in a classroom. The door didn't lock and I tried to keep it closed, but the guy got in. I got some scissors and I was stabbing him. There was lots of blood. We also had to kill the cats at one point and we kept attacking them but they didn't die and I got upset because Tigger was so scared and I was hugging her. The next day, Mom came over. Some other people were over at first and I was in my car with the air-con on and I had strawberries and Milk Arrowroots to eat. She came and we went to her place, except we kept getting lost and sometimes we were walking instead."
"2044"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) I was at Mom's. Ezra said Spaceman had been acting weird since he got some purple thing on Runescape. It changed his stats and Spaceman was hissing at him when they were high."
"2045"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) We were at Seabird. Mom came down. I asked if she could take me home and she went to drive off. I managed to convince her to and I got my stuff in the car. As I was packing, Ezra was in the room, then Dad came in complaining because I didn't tell him I was leaving."
"2046"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) I was bored so I went to this place I had been before with the school. It was closed to the public, but there were people inside. I went in and I asked this lady at a computer some questions and asked if she had this program where you put in a scenario and it tells you what would happen (how many people would die, what would be destroyed etc). She said she didn't know. Then I was doing a quest on Runescape. It was called Slug Menace, but was a different quest. There were lots of toys with stripey snakes and puppets and they moved away from me as I moved. The room was empty and quite dim. I had to get into this cage, but had to go the long way. To get through one part of it, I had to light certain things to get certain colours. There was black, green, red and blue. Dad was there at one point. The second time, a room was pitch black and I almost fell down a hole."
"2047"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) I was at a party, it was some famous one. This guy and I (and sometimes I was Katherine Heigl) were in a shop. He was holding me and kissing me and rubbing my feet against chocolates and stuff in the shelves. Then a friend of relative of mine was nearby and I was trying to hide my face. He took me into some male toilets and I said that I was going to go the toilet in the ""ladies room"". The doors of the cubicles were high, so you could see people sitting on the toilet. I went anyway. This girl I was with was watching me, smiling. There were some girls in the cubicle next to me and one had a baby and they were saying how she had to go without sex for a week and she had gone past a gym and all these guys came out with their gym clothes on and they were sweaty and stuff. I was thinking 'what the hell, that's disgusting'. The girl I was with and I went back to the toilet, but then there was a play and we were walking towards the stage. Madelyn was with us too. The girl said that we had to do some thing with Justin Timberlake (like rubbing boobs on his head) and I was like ""I'm not doing that and I'm not touching Justin Timberlake!"". She was wondering why and that she thought I was more outgoing or something. I said that she didn't even know me very well and that this was ""the first party I've ever been to"" and ""I'm not as wild as you think I am!"".  We got to the stage and Calvin text me and it said that Madelyn was coming near me and I realized he was there because I was standing next to her. I was involved with the play, so I sat on a chair on the stage (there were heaps of chairs behind the curtain) at the front. Evelyn, Gavin and others were singing Camelot (Monty Python and the Holy Grail), which I mouthed. The tape stuffed up and they had to stop the play. There was a guy called Ned and he told me some story. Darius was playing Evelyn's lover in the play. Eugene wasn't there. We were in the common room later and Daryl was asking ""Who do I like?"" and I remembered that I'd seen photos of the person on his Myspace but I couldn't remember who it was. Everyone thought it was going to be a guy, but it was Genevieve."
"2048"	"(2008-04-23 (17)) I can't remember what happened at the beginning, but I went to Northtown High School (which was different) looking for something. There were lots of black people and they weren't letting us through. Later, I was leaving and going down some steps and these girls were getting in the way and yelling things at me. I pushed past them. My car had a hole around the area that the registration sticker thing was. Every car had it, but my sticker was a little bit above it, so you could put your hand through the hole. Poppa put his hand through to grab something and I asked if we could cover it."
"2049"	"(2008-04-24 (17)) Someone in our close family died. I went to a shop with Dad and Ezra and we were buying food. I didn't want to go to the funeral because ""I don't believe in funerals"". Dad yelled at me about it. Later, we were at a place where they were buried. I had written something about Runescape and in this hill there were print screens of Runescape stuck on the side. We walked across the hill and went to this house. It was Granma's. She gave me and Ezra these cool pencils to draw with. Mom and Ezra were waiting in the car for me, while I wrote down the brand of the pencil. It was in Greek or something. This cop came and I realized there was going to be a raid. Mom got sick of waiting for me and left. I called and text her to meet me around the corner. She got me and I said there was a raid. The radio was on and there was a Searchers song playing and then Summer of 69."
"2050"	"(2008-04-25 (17)) I was in a shop. This guy was putting on a show, by hanging people up and eventually killing them. I was one of them. I managed to escape, but he caught me straight away. I escaped again and he came after me and eventually got me. I escaped again and went and hid in the music section. There was a guard at the exit. I moved a little and the guy looked and he realized something was up, so he came over to check and I hit him with a chair. He shot his gun and fell. I ran out. The guy was there and I ran into the carpark. I called Dad and told him to come with Mom. The guy was sometimes Michael Rosenbaum. Mom and Dad came and the licence plate was different. The numbers at the end had three lots of numbers and I realized that they were dodgy, so I ran. The guy would let me choose a section of the carpark to darken and I could hide and then he would come after me. I went to some foreign girl's caravan. I told her my boyfriend was after me. Her sister came. She let me hide in this corner of the caravan. The bad guys came to question her and they were James Spader and Vanessa Williams. They were talking to the girl and I got bored and jumped up, but James just asked the foreign girl to marry him. There was something about David Tennant and he had red hair and his brothers had red hair and freckles."
"2051"	"(2008-04-26 (17)) I had to 'build' houses for some little people (like figurine size). To build it, I had to click on stuff and cook it. One of the things I had to do had sausages and some people in the oven until 12:30. I started having trouble with it because there were so many people and their happiness rating kept going down."
"2052"	"(2008-04-26 (17)) I went to a pool. I had a shirt on over a full bather's suit. The people I was with took the shirt (it fell off) ran off and tried to lock me out of this house, not realizing I had bathers on. There were bees and I was trying to fight them off. There was a dirty kid and he was evil."
"2053"	"(2008-04-26 (17)) We were at the beach. Austin worked there. I was with Dad and Ezra. We took the van and as we walked back to the car Dad said ""I should've let you drive"". It was ANZAC day. I was looking for Eugene's car."
"2054"	"(2008-04-27 (17)) I was seeing a play or show or something. I was involved with it somehow. I was there with Kyle MacLachlan, but he was like Dale Cooper (Twin Peaks). While they were getting ready for the show, we went off to this restaurant. The food was already at all the tables and you had to pick a table to sit at. The one we chose had good shakes."
"2055"	"(2008-04-27 (17)) We had an excursion and we were going to a shop. I didn't have money with me and Calvin was there. I got bored and called Mom to get me. We had to get into groups and Duane said ""We'll have Evelyn in our group"". I was then at school. There were gangs of white people around a lot and we had to watch out for them. I saw Eugene walk past and then saw his brother Rodney walking a bit behind him. I decided to walk home. Colleen and a guy with a red bag were in front of me. I realized it was Eugene. Colleen kept touching him. Johanna was then there and they did this weird thing with their arms (holding hands and making shapes). I kept getting trapped in it, so I ran ahead and they were laughing (friendly). Then I was at Granny's old house. I went in and I was lying on a mattress on the floor, watching TV. My phone was being screwy. This darkish lady came and I said that I didn't know anyone was living here and that it was my Granny's old place. She let me stay and later this other lady came and she said ""This must be your Granny"" and I said ""No, she's Alice Muriel Wedding"". I text Mom and Darren. I tried to call Dad."
"2056"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) I was reading a little red book. It had random stuff in it, but also had a Twin Peaks thing in it. I was reading it, but watching it. Truman went to some barn after Josie died and there was a problem with insurance. The next day, they found Truman dead, slumped over a window. Dale Cooper (sometimes it was me) was in this other barn with some others trying to work out who killed him. There was a photo of Jack Nance in the book as Pete. Darren came out and the Log Lady was there and Darren was saying stuff about who killed Laura Palmer and that it was obvious and I was thinking 'they already solved that'. I was at home and Dad wasn't feeling well. The next day it was freezing cold and we had heaters on. Dad was in his room and he had this really bad cough and was sweating like crazy. Ezra was on his laptop. Dad went into my room and took a notebook of mine to read and I was like 'what the hell are you doing?'."
"2057"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) Eugene and I were dating and had had sex. He was staying over. Ezra and Dad were making up some sleeping plan and it was messing up our plan to sleep in the same bed. I called some counseling place and they were talking to both of us. Then some kiddy van pulled up outside. This guy came out and was giving us stuff and informing us how babies were made, how to look after babies and Eugene and I were like 'what the hell?'."
"2058"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) Eugene and I were dating. We went to the ball and were waiting outside for the main room to open (it was at 'school'). We were both wearing casual clothes. Ezra was also there. We kept sitting down on lounges and Eugene would sit right next to me so we were touching. I kept looking at him, amazed that we were together. We were also at this other place at one point. The walls were all concrete and the windows were just square holes in the wall. The people there were acting weird. I thought they were going to say something bad about us, but they said that I was pregnant. Eugene jumped up and we hugged excitedly and then I was like ""How am I pregnant? And how do you know?""."
"2059"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) I was walking through these weird woods and I was thinking I should teleport to Ardougne. Eventually I saw Dad's old work and went past it to this video shop. As I passed I heard William, it Was Really Nothing playing and I was singing along to it. I was in the video shop, and outside it looked like there was a fire (there wasn't really, it was just effects). There was a creepy dark room."
"2060"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) Ezra got this dog and it was called Tess. It was quite big. We kept it out the front of home and it just sat at the door. Farrah had a Myspace and it said she was 16 and I was thinking that it wasn't right. I complained to Mom about the dog because it was going to go feral because no-one spent any time with it. I went to school, but I had an excursion (just me). I went to some school place and I was in the art room. Other people were there too. There was a big slope in the room and a table was nailed down. We had eggs with a brown thing wrapped around it. Then we had to put curry and some sweet stuff in it. It was taking forever so I just ate it, instead of cooking it, but it was actually meat or something. I was hoping we were there for two and a half more hours so I would miss out on all of school (it was Tuesday by the way)."
"2061"	"(2008-04-29 (17)) I went to the movies to see some The O.C movie. The cinema was packed out and I was sitting next to Liesl. She had her feet over the arm rest and kept kicking me, so I moved over. The movie started and I realized it was going to be really boring, so I left. It was really late, so this guy had to unlock the door for me. I called Mom to get me."
"2062"	"(2008-05-01 (17)) We were at a shop looking place. Dad was there. It was home sometimes. There were all these teddy bear touch lamps on, and so I was turning them off. One of them wouldn't turn off because I had to download a patch. I downloaded the patch on a computer but I needed it on mine to use it. Then the site to download from was down and I couldn't find something to transfer it with. We were then at an old lady's house and if we guessed her full name we could download it because she blocked the site or something. Mom, Ezra and I were looking around her house. I found out that her initials were DSL. I found something that said ""Danielle, Scandella, [something] "". I said the name, but it wasn't hers. I complained because her last name could be anything and I said that the people at school had last names such as Conell, Ivanovich, Lundquist, Pritchard, Johnston. Sometimes she was a guy who looked like Michael Parks. I went into this really cold freezer and I was putting ice-cream back. A servant told me the guy's middle name was Izzy. I was then at a beach, which was the first known beach or something on Earth. Dad, Poppa and Uncle Wilbur were there. We were on a ledge of a rock formation and waves kept coming up (they were gentle). I put my phone on a ledge higher than the water. I went to swim out and I was holding my phone, but I accidentally got it in the water. I pulled it out but it was completely screwed."
"2063"	"(2008-05-02 (17)) Robert de Niro got a job at a takeaway place."
"2064"	"(2008-05-02 (17)) I was walking with Calvin and we were talking. Eugene was in front of us and he turned around and said ""Do you [whatever we were talking about] ?""."
"2065"	"(2008-05-02 (17)) I was looking at a school photo from year 7 and Elijah was in it and I was thinking that I didn't remember him being there. There were big photos."
"2066"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) We went to Nana's. It looked the same with a few small differences. Ezra was on a laptop outside and was sick. Mittens was on the swinging chair and Tigger was sitting below it. Mittens kicked Tigger in the head. Ezra said Spaceman was under a chair. Mom made me talk to this Asian guy on some site. She said she was trying to find an old friend of hers and her daughter was now 20. I was on the computer in Dad's room at home. Darren was there doing something. Austin came over looking for him."
"2067"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) Sherilyn Fenn had done something to help people have sex for the first time. Twelve people, myself included, were paired up and went off into rooms. Calvin was there too. I got paired up with Eugene, and the rooms were really dark. When we had finished I went off into this other room where two guys and a girl were in the bed, but one of the guys had no partner, so I joined him. We were having sex and it was really vivid."
"2068"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) I stayed at Mom's which was really different. I had a double bed which faced the window. The curtains were green/yellow. The night before I had gone home with Dad, but I woke up and I was back at Mom's."
"2069"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) I stayed at Mom's, which was actually Nana's, but was completely different. Eugene, Darius, Jeremiah and Alejandro were staying there. The next morning Mom was going to go to the deli and Darius, Jeremiah, Alejandro and Ezra went with her. Mom said that ""Eugene is still asleep"". I was playing on a computer outside all the rooms (which was outside on a balcony, ledge thing). I went down the stairs and got a new water bottle and it was school (but different). That fat Denton was annoying me. I was fighting with him and kicking him and throwing water bottles at him. I locked him in a shed. My water bottle was in some sand. I saw Eugene's father Abraham in a car and they all left. Alejandro was still there though. I complained to some people, including Autumn, about the Native kid. There was some The Simpsons thing about corn and they were eating it. I was at home and Dad said the internet was working. It was but the ADSL light still wasn't on (we didn't even have the router plugged in)."
"2070"	"(2008-05-04 (17)) I was at home. Dad and Ezra were there. Dad said he was going to go out (it was night), so I asked Mom to bring food over. She came over and this cop car went past slowly. It was being dodgy so we swapped Mom's car for mine and then these guys turned up and pointed a gun at Mom's head and mine until they got something. I don't know what happened but they left and we they got back they said the cops pulled them over. I was telling Dad, who was watching something, that the guy on the show he was watching was in Monty Python and that he was my favourite Python (obviously, Michael Palin) and that it was his birthday tomorrow."
"2071"	"(2008-05-05 (17)) Calvin had been playing my random old songs to people and they were singing them. Some people had them now on their iPods. Isabel was there. I was at a university or something and Eugene, Jeremiah, Darius and Alejandro were all in the class. I'm not sure what it was. I had to collect eye things and find somewhere to set up. The class was then smaller and Autumn was there. Jeremiah said he got into some university and was going to leave to go there before school finished."
"2072"	"(2008-05-05 (17)) There was a boat in the water which collected 'freaks'/immigrants. This girl with long stretchy arms jumped in. This young girl's bottom half was horse-like and she liked riding horses. I was at some evil person's house and the backyard had all these broken cars in it and a big pile of mess. I tried to get into some police car (which was GTA IV like). Some guy went to this shop and they had jumpers on a rack which were orange and blue. There was a creepy kid in there and he tried to scare me. Mom was meeting this lady who gave her drugs and we forgot to pay and I remember seeing lots of money. Later, it turned out we had been tipped off about her."
"2073"	"(2008-05-05 (17)) Ezra and I were doing something, but I don't remember now."
"2074"	"(2008-05-06 (17)) I was at school. Ms Madsen had stuff on the walls which were like medals and stuff that her students had won. Someone had got a gold medal for an essay on An American Werewolf in London. I was thinking I wanted a medal for doing an essay on a cool movie. Then I was at home and I had heaps of them from her (of all the ones she had got). I found one that I'd got for some games thing, which was silver. There was something about Meg Ryan. Mom was on the phone and I showed her. I was thinking about looking to see if Eugene had one. I had asked Mom to bring me food but she brought a coke and this disgusting looking burger. I threw them straight in the bin when she gave them to me. She came in and made a mess of this stuff I had, including sand. There was a photo of this playground covered in sand and Darren had taken it. I was playing GTA IV. On the game, the character had another girlfriend called 'little party trick'."
"2075"	"(2008-05-07 (17)) I was at school and I had a biology test last. I was studying during 'form', but we had been called to the library, which was different, for a meeting. Calvin came and sat next to me, and Elijah sat next to him. Evelyn sat on another chair next to me. We were on a lounge. I don't know what class I then had, but Elijah was still around and I was talking to him. I kept getting called out of class for stuff. I was in chemistry and there were more people in the class, but Eugene wasn't in the class and it had always been like that and I didn't like it. In one class I got three notes to go somewhere. I can't remember the first place but I had to go to Falador and this place in the Underground Pass (which was different). Jeremiah asked if I knew where to go in the Underground Pass and I said yeah but he didn't believe me. I went to this tree, as did Theodore and someone else (they had to go to Falador too). Ms Solomon asked if we had been called to go to Falador. No-one knew what it was. The tree was hard and we had to break the bark off it. Eventually we did and I said ""Say no more!"" and was thinking about that sketch and Eric Idle. There were all these big ants crawling around and they were red and black. I pointed them out and Ms Solomon said they weren't ants, but spiders. I said ""fire spiders"" and I then said ""fire giants!"". They were dangerous so I moved away and lots of them were all over the ground and in the tree. They turned into human looking creatures, but if they touched someone they would catch on fire. They also didn't respond to pain (a lot like the L'vrai in Mindbridge, which I read last night). I was at the office and this teacher had this little baseball bat and was hitting them on the head. I was annoyed that I couldn't finish going to all the places I was asked to go. They took form of the people at school. One of them looked like Darius. I discovered that water killed them so I led some to a pool. I had some dead people from school in the pool and I was walking around the pool (and there was a gate around the pool) so that they would go to follow and fall in. This only worked with some of them. I had to kick the others into the pool. After I had finished, four of them were still ok."
"2076"	"(2008-05-08 (17)) I got put into a higher level English class. I was getting a level four though. The order it went in (IB level English) was my class, other class, and then Ms Solomon. I was annoyed because I enjoyed having Elijah in the class. The class I got put into had Calvin and Evelyn in it for some reason. A leg on all the tables and chairs was broken. Mariam and Isabel were there. The teacher was female, but was then Mr Noonan."
"2077"	"(2008-05-08 (17)) I was at 'Mom's'. Granma was there. Ezra and I were on the computer playing this weird Minesweeper game. It had sound and Granma complained because they couldn't hear it (they were cooking) and turned the sound off, so I had a go at this Sonic the Hedgehog game."
"2078"	"(2008-05-08 (17)) I was with Jeb. It was then Dad. We went to Hungry Jacks and got some nuggets and Ezra said they were yucky. I accidentally put mine in a bin, instead of eating them. Dad and I went to this island which was supposed to have nothing on it, but there was a KFC and another shop or something. The people there tried to get us. This guy was driving down a freeway. He ended up getting angry at something and got caught by some people. He was put underground and attached to a rope. People would be thrown in there and the more he caught the longer his rope would get, which meant he could reach out further to catch people. He was then a creature of some sort and a woman got thrown in. She escaped. There were other creatures around at different places. The closest one to him was this really violent 'guy'. It got odd then and I think the guy was actually a prisoner (had been thrown in). People with bad tempers were thrown in. He managed to escape and he was running around the streets. He turned this corner in a car, but then he was lying on a skateboard rolling down a hill, it went over a little bump and the skateboard disappeared. The cops were after him and he jumped on a bus and was thanking the bus driver. Then it showed outside the bus and the driver motioned to some police that were driving next to him. The guy noticed and jumped off the bus and kept running. Then it was me and someone and we were climbing up a tree. The person I was with asked what was in my hair and I noticed I had blood in it and I said that it must be because I was ""pumped full of adrenalin"". I think I was then him and the other person was Kristen Kreuk, who he liked. This girl who was friends with him and these other guys said she was the sister of him and his brother and that it was all a training exercise. Eventually they got free. But they kept getting hassled so at the end of the movie (which it was now), they met up with some guy and when they got back in the car, it exploded (with him, his girlfriend and his son in it). Then at the funeral, it showed Kristen Kreuk looking across and then it had zoomed out and they were both there on this hill. They were then at their house and their son was asking her how long she had stayed alive for (her double in the car) and she replied ""200 hours"" and told him that he was going to have another brother, ""like Kyle""."
"2079"	"(2008-05-09 (17)) It was Thursday night before the chemistry test (last night) and Eugene, Jeremiah, Darius and sometimes Bradley were staying over with Ezra. They were in the lounge room playing GTA IV and I asked Eugene what mission he was doing. It was one that I had done and I told him that. He followed Ezra to Dad's room at one point and he looked into my room. Jeremiah asked me if I had studied for my chemistry test and I said that I had forgotten about it and hadn't. He said they had forgotten too. I remembered that I was having the day off because I was sick though. Mom and I went to the school to do something and when we were leaving Mom had to drag me out because I couldn't walk. Ms Braun helped her and they took me to the car. The outside was decorated for Christmas. Ezra text me asking about a movie. Eugene thought the movie was one thing, but Mom thought it was another. One was about a girl who was molested or raped or something and the other about some Indian and chicken. The chicken one (Mom's choice) was right. Tigger had kittens or something. I put them in her mouth so that no-one would know. Nana made sausage rolls. We were confused about something. Evelyn was in some group."
"2080"	"(2008-05-09 (17)) We were out the front of home. We had a pool shaped hole out the front and we decided to fix it up. There was me, Dad, Ezra, Aunt Sally, Uncle Vic, Uncle Wilbur (who had lost weight) and Poppa. There was music playing and Poppa and I were trying to guess what it was and what year it was. I Will Follow Him came on and The Great Pretender which we said was from 1955. We were thinking that it was year Nana was born. I was taking photos and I was going to put this thing on my side (the hole had a wall separating two sides). I said to Aunt Sally ""they don't know"". Tony and Michelle (both 24) were there."
"2081"	"(2008-05-09 (17)) I was at school, as was Eugene. I don't remember anything else now."
"2082"	"(2008-05-10 (17)) I was at school. We had an assembly. Calvin and I were a bit late. On the way there I had bright blue pants on and I realized and was like ""What the hell?"". Eugene and Darius were behind us, talking. Calvin said ""you know sexy Marconi?"" and I said ""No, but I know Lucia Marconi"". When we got to the place, it was full and we had to go upstairs. It had floor hanging over so if you looked down you could see the assembly. The floor was broken so we had to sit back. Elijah came up there. When they left I put my proper pants on. There was this room there which was a mess and things were broken in it. There was a badge with my name on it. I suggested we clean and fix it and use it. Then it was clean."
"2083"	"(2008-05-10 (17)) Mom and I were driving down the road next to Midvale High School. This bus was coming around the roundabout and it hit the curb and hit us. We were ok. I think Mom said she wanted to take us to Dad's, but I said I'd just walk there because it was just around the corner and quicker."
"2084"	"(2008-05-10 (17)) I could go to the past. I was at a shop with Ezra and Dad. We all found a lounge/chair we liked and asked this lady to show us on a tour. There was a games section with Monopoly. It distracted Dad and Ezra and Ezra wanted to buy the Monopoly and I said that he already had a spiffy one. There were pieces of paper with bands on them -- Herman's Hermits and The Beatles are the only ones I remember. Then I was in the past. I was with some famous singers including The Beatles. I was friends with John Lennon. We were all playing card games and the public was watching. I told them to say that whoever lost was going to retire. Then I was earlier in the past and John Lennon was young (the first time we met). He had become more attached to me than his mother and she was annoyed at this, but when he was a teenager she died. I had taken my camera back and I was taking heaps of photos. I saw everything in black and white but the camera took photos in colour. I took some video too, and some guy was singing and dancing from the roof and also video of John Lennon. He was playing darts, when he was young, and this fat lady was calling people retards. I went to the UK in the past. Mom told me to speak in an English accent because they might not like outsiders. But I figured they wouldn't like someone putting on an accent more and so spoke normally, sometimes I was a guy. They were being shifty at first, and then I said what if I was a bar reviewer or something and they acted more friendly. I checked my phone and it was ringing (it was on silent). Alan was ringing. Alan was this guy who looked like the main actor in C.R.A.Z.Y. and he was friends with me. I got out of the bar and then it was hung up. I got this text saying he was in an accident. I called him and he was like ""Why didn't you answer?"" and he was crying. I was near this lady's house and she didn't like me on her lawn and she kept putting her sprinklers on. When I got there, I was a guy and he was a girl. She decided to run off with me and become famous. Her mother was annoyed but when she thought her daughter would be famous she was ok about it."
"2085"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) There was a list of birthdays. Michael Palin was on there. I was on there and Nana was too. I went to January 8 but Eugene wasn't there."
"2086"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) We went to Seabird again. We got there and I realized I had forgotten some stuff -- my camera, iPod etc. Ezra and Dad were there. We were waiting in the car for a bit. Mom was coming up later to drop some stuff off, so I called her and she was on her way and she said that I ""HAD"" to come to a restaurant later with her and Darren. I told her to pick me up. Dad complained because I left early. The restaurant was this one where they would help you with a diet. Mom gave me a brochure for it and I chucked it into a fire. It was an expensive looking place."
"2087"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) There was this movie in the Top 250 with Will Arnett. It was a superhero comedy thing. It started and he had this 'ring' around him and it broke and people were laughing. Then his wife (who was Olive from Pushing Daisies) explained he was actually dreaming and in a room somewhere. His dream became this fairy floss monster. He wrote a symphony for his wife."
"2088"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) Nana, Dad, Ezra, Poppa, some others and myself went to see this psychologist guy for something. He was pretty cool and we went through this thing together. Nana wanted to listen to 80's music on my iPod. The psychologist told me to listen and try to hear his voice while listening to the iPod. His voice started fading. I listened to Dancin' With Myself and Goody Goody Gumdrops. When we left, I was then at 'school'. Calvin was waiting with my bag. Evelyn was dressed in orange. I saw Darius and Eugene. We went outside to leave and one school called Andrew Gardner was blocking the easy exit and if someone not from the school tried to go through, they would throw popcorn and wouldn't let them through. I got lost and somehow ended up in a vent. I got down and was in this weird place. I went through a door and there was a stage with people on it and snipers. This guy said it was just a show. I went outside, but there was no way to leave. I went back inside, and it was now a garage looking place. I went back to the vents. The next one had a dying rat and cobwebs. I asked the guy to clean it for me. There was a washing line with my undies on it so I put them in a bag. He cleaned the vent. There was a video on my phone of snow, and then the vent was filled with snow. He gave me a towel so I'd be warm and to clean as I went through the vent. In the vent, it was cushioned and squishy. There were holes, with a ladder leading down. I went down some and was looking around for a way out. One of the ones I went down there was a young black kid and he said ""I'm blah blah authority figure"" and then I was Will Smith and I rambled about some law thing and put him behind some stuff. His father was tied up. Then this woman came and she had a daughter, Grace, from Will Smith and she had a son now from another guy, except Grace was pale and the mother was pale. Then they were teenagers and trying to be as slutty as they could. One of the girls said ""I slept with [someone] and got pregnant!"". Then it was That 70's Show and they were running around dancing and I was trying to get back in the vent, eventually I did."
"2089"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) We were back at school. We had a male teacher and we had written our names and some other stuff up on this board a while ago. We were told we were going to be doing some pairing up thing. The guy started pairing us up and everyone was annoyed about it. Elijah and I got paired up. Calvin was there too. Ms Madsen was doing the role and was asking us who was there and who didn't go to the school. There was someone called Choo Choo. Someone was singing Oh Sherrie. Then we were driving (Elijah was driving). He hadn't driven before but after a while he was driving really well. He was smoking later on. Then I was driving and sometimes the car was a bike. I was driving over this beach (it was where we had to drive). All these Ethiopians (they were black and someone said they were Ethiopians) were lying over the sand and everyone had to manoeuvre around them. I did well (and I was going fast). We went to this shop to pick up my laptop, which was actually some guy's (I was the guy). It wasn't there. The case and charger were there. I said ""didn't one of you use it as a [thing you put under a dodgy leg of a table] ?"" and I was blaming on this guy called 'Pool Cue'. I said ""I'm not saying it's at your house, I'm just saying Pool Cue did it"". Some guy smashed a bottle."
"2090"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) I did some quest on Runescape. You had to get married to this guy who lived next door to you and it was a long quest."
"2091"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) I was watching video on a video camera of Calvin, Ezra, some others and I when we were younger and went to the Royal Show. It was afterwards and we were pranking people, asking them to take us to places. I was filming from a while away. Then I was there. We went to this indoor place and I was like ""Don't I seem much older than I was?"". Abukar was there and some other people. I was then standing up and another me was sitting on a chair. I touched the other me and got sucked in. So we decided we wanted to film it, but another me didn't come. Elijah and Evelyn were there too. We thought some of the people there were dodgy. We were reading Laura Palmer's diary (Twin Peaks). It mentioned tapes and that ""Izzy's condition is cool. It's Izzy cool. Cool. Cool. Cool."" but never said anything about what it was (she was trying to hide it, in case someone found her diary)."
"2092"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) I was watching Twin Peaks and Albert and someone went to this place and the guy said to them ""I have an opportunity for you""."
"2093"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) Calvin and I got paired up for something in Biology. Elijah and I were paired up in something else. We had to create what our kids would look like. I don't know what Calvin and I had to do. I went to my room to get textas. I don't remember who, but someone said ""Who's that noob on my bed?"". Dad was in his room. Mom was in the games room."
"2094"	"(2008-05-13 (17)) I was baking poffins on Runescape. I had to go to this outside place and they all went on a conveyer belt. I had heaps already there and some were made. I was trying to find blue ones for Feebas."
"2095"	"(2008-05-13 (17)) Mom called me to say there was a job at some movie premier place to escort a B-grade actor called Scott Ferguson. I was like ""What the hell?"" and hung up. Then I was watching a movie. Scott Ferguson was actually Chuck Liddell, but was Patrick Dempsey. He was there with a ""big name chick"". He was there with James Marsden and I showed Dad. They were gay and together. There was something about Patrick Dempsey being stereotyped in the 80's to play gay characters. Judith Light had been playing lesbian characters. I then looked old and I looked in the mirror and complained. I looked really strange. Something exploded in the shower and I had to have a shower. Mom complained about my Beatles shirt. We went to Midvale shops. Mom was driving the car stupidly. Someone said ""Smudgy"". The back of the car got smashed and I yelled at Mom and Darren said something I don't remember."
"2096"	"(2008-05-13 (17)) I was at school sitting at a bench with Calvin and Evelyn. I asked why we were at the bench. Calvin said he didn't want to sit in the common room at lunch. It was really sunny."
"2097"	"(2008-05-14 (17)) I was playing Runescape and I was still trying to do Regicide. I had to kill some other thing, but I didn't have any food with me so I didn't kill it."
"2098"	"(2008-05-14 (17)) Calvin and his mother came over. I don't know why or which house I was at but eventually she left."
"2099"	"(2008-05-15 (17)) I was on a bed with Calvin, Jeremiah, Selena, Ezra and others. We were at school or something. I think we were watching TV. Jeremiah was listening to someone's iPod. I said ""I got The Beatles"". I tried to take a photo of something. Elijah was there too. We were walking and saw Theodore. At another time, Elijah locked himself in a toilet."
"2100"	"(2008-05-15 (17)) This guy who looked like Jim Sturgess was driving his car fast. Ben Horne (Twin Peaks) also liked to drive his car fast. They were driving near a forest."
"2101"	"(2008-05-16 (17)) I went on my laptop to get some pictures of people. I had a James Spader folder. Ezra wanted to use the USB so I said I just wanted to look up a picture quickly. He said ""Yeah the guy from 21"", (Jim Sturgess), which it was. Then I went into this room so I could read this book in peace. Austin and someone came in and were talking, then all these people from school came in and were talking. It was fully packed and I was sweating so I got out. Lucia and some other girls were sitting at the door doing their nails. I said I wasn't worried about where I was stepping and I stepped on Lucia's hand and she yelled out. She said ""Yeah, but you're heavy"" and I said that I didn't care. Mom was there and was watching TV. Britney Spears was on there and her hair was all wavy."
"2102"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) Nana and Uncle Wilbur said they went on my website and that it was disgusting (the diary entries). I was trying to explain that it was just for me."
"2103"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) Calvin and I were at home. I thought I heard a noise and asked Calvin to look, but he didn't. We closed my door and I called Mom and I said someone was outside my door and he was trying to keep the door shut. I got some scissors and stabbed the guy. Then Mom came."
"2104"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) I was at Mom's. I went to have a shower, but Ezra was in there naked, so I walked away."
"2105"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) I was at a shop. I had lost some weight and needed a disguise for something. I went to the girl's clothes section. I tried on this little top and it was too small and my boobs looked huge, and I was thinking 'what the hell am I doing?'."
"2106"	"(2008-05-18 (17)) I was at school. I had accounting and had to go to the library. Elijah, Daryl, Calvin and Genevieve were there. We went in and there was a guy at the desk. I explained we were there for accounting and he was like ""oh, I don't know if I can let you"" but eventually he did and I tried to sit next to Calvin but Genevieve got in the way."
"2107"	"(2008-05-18 (17)) I was playing some game. I got stranded in the woods with this guy and a girl. It was night. It was like a quest and I was reading a guide on what to do. I think I left it for a while and then it was day, which made it easier. I then had to catch some pig and a fox thing. Later, these people came and rescued us."
"2108"	"(2008-05-18 (17)) I woke up on Wednesday morning. My phone said it was 4.45am, but the lighting looked wrong, so I checked on my computer and it said 10am. I left my room and asked Dad and he said it was 9am. He had given us the day off school because he wasn't feeling well."
"2109"	"(2008-05-19 (17)) Dad worked at this little 'ticket' place (like a booth thing) and he had been working there for a while, but I didn't know. Ezra had known though. Dad liked this girl that worked there. We went there and these bad guys came. They wanted to steal the shampoo. We got in the car and the girl did something that allowed us to get out. I was then at home and there was a class next door and Ms Madsen asked me if I was ""logical"" and then a while later asked what I thought of some story ""with the purple stuff"". I said it was stupid. The next morning, I think, I woke up and felt dizzy and sick. I was walking down the hallway and fell over. Dad said he wanted to look at my phone. I slid it over. I told him I was too sick to go to school and he was annoyed."
"2110"	"(2008-05-20 (17)) I was in a building with a female friend of mine doing some work/study. We were in a stairwell and it looked really rundown. There was a girl with red hair in this red room. There was a window on one of the walls (in the stairwell) and a while later I looked out the window and there was a bright red cloud. I told my friend to look and there was a flame going across the sky and then a big mushroom cloud of fire came up. The aftershock came and the building shook and knocked us down. We were on the eleventh floor or something and we were running down the stairs. We made it to the ground floor and there was a restaurant and we climbed through the window to get out. Jeremiah was there and he said ""The great wall exploded!"". I called Mom and she said she hadn't heard anything about it or seen it. There was this weird animation that showed what would happen after and something would turn into a planet. Then we were poor and it was post-apocalyptic. I met up with Eugene, Daryl and some others for something. Eugene and I were dating. He was handing me cutlery and plates and things from the restaurant to take. The guy accused us of stealing stuff and we were denying it. We needed the stuff as it was hard to get and was expensive (needed it to survive). Then I was in accounting. Melodie was complaining about Fatima and Fatima was arguing with her. Then Ezra, Mom and I were in the car. I had called Mom and she told me to go to the corner of these two streets. I was wondering why and thought she was shifty. She took us to this other place and we were 'rebels' now. I tapped Ezra on the shoulder and motioned for him to go back to the car. We all got out and Mom gave me the keys to fix the window. I jumped into the driver's seat and drove and Ezra got in. Then the car was little and yellow and it was a game. The car kept getting smaller and I had to find a power-up to change into another vehicle. It turned into a duck and then I found something and it changed into a turtle which was extremely slow and the bad people were walking right next to us."
"2111"	"(2008-05-21 (17)) We were at a shop and they had this 'game' where you had to crawl along these blocks, most of which were high up and in the air and you had to balance, and it was an Are You Afraid of the Dark game (I don't know why it was called that). Dad, Ezra and I were on it. Ezra went ahead and then I got in front of Dad. Ezra was going to some creepy religious thing and the people had these things on their heads that made it look like they had no faces. We had been on this before, and they had changed this bit where you have to get ice and now only people tall enough could get it. There were DVD sets on display of Are You Afraid of the Dark, which were coming out soon. I went to another shop later with Mom and they had giant ice-cream sandwiches and they were back to normal. Jeremiah was somewhere and he said he was going to marry this girl who liked some other guy."
"2112"	"(2008-05-21 (17)) I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV. Then it was a movie. It stayed close to the game though and as the main character was driving down the road, he was weaving in and out of traffic (like in the game). I was also doing something on Runescape. Then Dad and I were walking somewhere. I had a snake but it bit me, so I let it go."
"2113"	"(2008-05-21 (17)) I was at a house. I was worried about a killer. I tried to call Mom but there was no answer. There was some spoof movie and there were people outside and there was a guy standing on the pole near them, who was the killer. It was a rip-off of Jeepers Creepers."
"2114"	"(2008-05-22 (17)) Ezra and I were both able to acquire an ice-cream we had invented. When we wanted it, we got it. Ezra's was this hazelnut Magnum type of thing and mine was something else. Everyone wanted to try his. We went to this shop and we were on this little go-kart thing and there was a poodle. We knocked everything over and the shop workers were annoyed."
"2115"	"(2008-05-22 (17)) I was at home. This black girl (who we knew) was talking to some guys in a car. She was going to steal some drugs and I was unlocking the door so she could run in. After unlocking it, I told her I didn't want to take them. Then I was at Mom's. We all got inside and I locked the doors. I went somewhere else for a while and when I came back she was talking to them through the fly screen. I went to lock it but the guy shot at the lock, so I closed the wood door and he shot through that. Then they came in. The guy told us that the drugs he had were stolen from a casino from these really bad guys. I explained that I didn't know about the drugs and that it was the black girl's idea. I had snuck off earlier and called the cops but they weren't working because it was mother's day. The lady I spoke to said she'd said send someone to check it out. She spelt 'Barlow' with two A's and then crossed it out. We were in the dining room at Mom's, but it was different. The guy said that if the bad guys found us we'd all be dead. Then the door busted open and this guy in leather was there and he looked mean. The guy that was with us looked at me and we grimaced (we knew it was the bad guy). The lady on the phone had come with them too. He took the main bad guy (the one who was doing all the talking) and did something to him and I think he died. He made this girl lick his feet, and I told her not to breathe. Then this lady cop came and someone told her to shoot the other guys and we were all arguing over who the bad guys were."
"2116"	"(2008-05-23 (17)) We were at a shop, which was school and we were sitting in a group. I accidentally took a photo with my phone and it made a noise. I was sitting with Calvin. He got excited and said that Evelyn and Darius had just walked through the door together. I looked up and saw Evelyn going down to another corner and Darius coming towards the group I was with. Later I was in a clothes section. Darius was wearing that dressing gown that I liked. I went through the clothes looking for another but there weren't any others, then I saw him wearing another blue one so I went back to look again. When I saw him again he was wearing the one I liked and he had bought it. I complained to Mom and him that I'd wanted it for ages. He said ""Well, it's either yours or mine"". I don't know what happened after that. I saw Eugene's brother Rodney and I heard him talk and was thinking he sounded similar to Eugene (but he didn't). There was some game with a helicopter and you go to a spot and then deliver something to another spot."
"2117"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) Ezra and I were waiting in the car for Mom at a shop. I thought I saw Jeremiah in the car park and went to check and to ask Mom how long she'd be. I was then teleported to a dungeon and unlocked a music track on Runescape and I had to kill a blue dragon, but it was only level 72 or something. Then I left and Mom still wasn't out and it had been over an hour. Bradley was also talking and laughing with someone and kept looking at me and I thought he liked me. I was also thinking that his new haircut was really hot."
"2118"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) I was at some get together thing at a really big playground. It was filled with kids. This guy told me to do the countdown, so I did. Mr Reilly, Ezra and Eugene were also there. I was then at Mom's and my room there was like my room at home. The ceiling was also collapsed at some places. I asked why Ezra always got the good room. I was then at school and in some class with Mr Stevenson, but it was in the science block."
"2119"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) I was watching 3rd Rock From the Sun. They found this kid and John Lithgow didn't want to tell him they were aliens. I was trying to explain the proper Earth talk. Someone was writing and it said some girl was in a demons body."
"2120"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) I was at a deli in the lollies section and they were expensive. Mom said to just get individual packets because it was cheaper. They had the pineapple lollies. They also had these weird ""John Lennon"" Santa lolly. Someone called Dad and I answered and they said they were going to the UK and that no-one could stop them."
"2121"	"(2008-05-25 (17)) Nana sold her house because they couldn't afford it for much longer. They had a 'business' running out of it (eggs, etc) and Asians had done some bus thing where only Asian's could take the bus to work. I don't know why that mattered. Her new home was a bit bigger than Granny's old house, which I mentioned to the others. Poppa was there. They explained they had room for Aunt Sally and Dad if they wanted to stay (which were little two story blocks). We were all out the back and the backyard was still the old house. They had to fix it up and then the old house backyard would disappear. I was thinking we wouldn't be going up there anymore on Sundays."
"2122"	"(2008-05-26 (17)) I was on a 'holiday' with a male friend of mine, possibly my boyfriend. We had gotten this ""adventure"" package which meant we could watch a movie I don't remember or The Hills Have Eyes. The other movie had a fat guy in it, and that was the one we were going to watch. We were watching it in the office at home (it was clean), and Dad, Poppa and Nana put a bed in there for me. Nana had not set up the computer monitor, which she mentioned to me. Before, I needed stuff for Biology and I couldn't remember what it was. Austin was on the computer. I went to the Biology site and they had a games competition. Ezra was playing too. Mom was there."
"2123"	"(2008-05-27 (17)) Dad was friends with a gay guy. They worked together. Then Dad was me, and Ezra saw this guy playing poker by himself so Ezra wanted to play with him. He lived next to Mom's. Ezra saw them building a room on the roof and said if they'd got that house, he'd still have the better room. Someone came over to the gay guy's house. He was a gardener. We were outside for quite a while. I was playing Runescape and was killing something and this guy died and when his stuff appeared I tried to take it but I only got this cape, and it wouldn't let me get the rest. I walked away from the area and people were running back for the stuff. I was in this cave which was muddy. These kids were running down steps."
"2124"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) I don't remember but there was something about someone called Sadie."
"2125"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) Eugene and I were talking with some others, but I don't remember now."
"2126"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. They said something smelled, but not as bad as me. I was walking home down the street across the road. When I walked across there was some guy and he went to stab me, but this other guy there stopped him."
"2127"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) There was these fish called Ugugu and they were seeds at first and they turned into this axolotl thing. There was a scary one that kept trying to suck on my finger."
"2128"	"(2008-05-29 (17)) There was a platypus called Peter, an elephant called Ellie and another thing. They were in a classroom and Peter or the other one was explaining a plan to catch this ""bilby"". They were outside. They had set up a cage underneath this little undercover area, which had a curtain surrounding it, on top of the cage, were some ropes. Ellie tried to catch it, but it didn't work. Peter got caught in the ropes and the bilby was coming. I was then the one caught in the ropes and I got on top of the cage and saw the bilby coming through the curtain, and it was a really big blue/green monster, which scared the hell out of me) and then I woke up."
"2129"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) I was doing a quest or a mini-game on Runescape. I got teleported to this guy called Nostrodamus and he told me to teleport somewhere and then back there. It was then real life and Elijah and Theodore were there. Elijah said ""Turn that way for me"" and I said no. Then it was Runescape, sort of, again. There were three people there. One guy got drenched, and the other two were in rooms. A person there told the guy to soak the others and two more soaked would die. He told the others and said one wouldn't die."
"2130"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) I was at some place with Calvin and Elijah. My dream books and dreams were on my bedside table. Calvin was trying to look to see who I liked and I said ""Just wait man!"". I said that the person I liked had hardly been in my dreams. I was then flicking through the books and showing Elijah some of the pages. One of the pages had a list of 'top 10 guys' from school and Eugene was first obviously. I said ""oops"" and told Elijah not to say anything. Calvin wanted him to tell him what it said. Elijah wrote down a list of who he thought my top 10 was and Dmitri was third and he was first. I was at a place outside with the school. There was a big track for a rollercoaster type of thing. I was watching people on it and Jeremiah asked me to join them and I said no. Fatima and a girl were with me. I was climbing up from there and Eugene was coming back down and then Alejandro and I went at the same time. There was food and some strawberries. They were giving them out and at the same time, Eugene and I said ""No cream!""."
"2131"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) We were playing sport at school, but it wasn't school. We were in this huge outside area which had two 'storeys'. The bottom part had a Jacuzzi thing and Geneva liked it. Mr Quinlan was supervising them. Fatima and I were sitting out, but we decided to join in. Mr Quinlan said ""Fatima! Where's your team?"" and she said we didn't have one, but he said he had clothes in his bag (put on his red shirt). I told him I didn't have my shirt and this lady said they had some. He was going to send us down, but he had sent a guy down earlier and he had got on a bus and gone back to school. The game was like minesweeper and you had to dig in areas and those without mines had stuff under them. There were little Pikachu's on the ground. Then I was at home and I was out the back. The tree started shaking and I looked at it and a heap of branches fell down onto the spa. I didn't get to close but then saw a gigantic frog on it. I ran inside and Grady was in the kitchen. I said ""It's a giant frog!"". There was an even bigger one out the front. Then a HUGE one was out the back. It was walking and it stepped over the house. I was worried about my car."
"2132"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) I was telling Calvin about a dream I had had where everyone was wearing leaf outfits. It was playing out live for me though. Calvin said ""And Eugene!"". Someone was covering and someone else was hiding in the bush. Darius said something about some flower. Evelyn came back and was hanging with us and we didn't know what to do. Julianna had done something and had called her parents to apologize, but they were still complaining."
"2133"	"(2008-05-31 (17)) I had this tall ledge in my room. I had made this thing which would tell you stuff about how you'd be in 20 years and it would send whoever did it, some mail with all the details. Then I had a quick one where you put your thumb on it, with this other thing up your bum or another orifice and it would give you a spiffy fingerprint thing. Mom and Ezra did it. He put a thermometer in his mouth. I wanted to take it to school and do people at school, specifically Eugene. Nana was getting rid of her pets. We got Simba and Fido in the car. This kid with cool hair was wandering around and this guy started getting rather close to him and so we tried to get the kid in the car. Another day, the guy was trying with some other kid, and we got him in the car too."
"2134"	"(2008-06-01 (17)) Ezra and I were outside this cinema at this rocky place. We saw Austin and Ezra asked him why he was there (it was late at night) and he was waiting for Indiana Jones 4. We had keys so we let him in. I finished Monkey Madness on Runescape. When I was killing the demon, I had low health and ate some tuna, but I finally killed it. The next day we were at a shop at the food hall. Calvin was there. This lady there accused me of breaking into the cinema, but she had no proof. She and this other girl started chasing us and we were throwing cakes at each other. They kept putting them over my head. I caught the other girl and told her that the other lady was making it up but she didn't believe me. Finally, she got caught and we decided to take the cakes."
"2135"	"(2008-06-01 (17)) We were at Nana's. Mom was there too. There was food including vegemite toast and peanut butter toast. We were taking the ones that hadn't been touched. Ezra asked Poppers for money. Mom was doing my hair so I couldn't get up to him to get the money. There was a dog outside and I said ""Fido! You're not Fido!"". Poppa, Nana and Uncle Wilbur had a feast out there. We all sat down and ate."
"2136"	"(2008-06-02 (17)) Mom had gotten a crossword scratchie and got 15 words on it (which was the highest and worth $130000). I was looking at it. She had forgotten to scratch some other stuff (which increased her winnings). We were at this shop and this lady who worked at a clothes shop made these pants for me and they were so tight my legs went red. Dancing in the Dark was on the radio. I don't know what happened next, but I was then in the car with Darren. There were zombies. There were a lot wandering around. Darren went into this little deli and I locked the doors. This female zombie kept hanging around. Darren came back and she attached herself to the window. We went to this place. Then Darren was someone else, a friend of mine. We went to this guy's house, who turned out to be Robert Sean Leonard and we were knocking on the door to wake him up. He let us inside, but realized this zombie liked that house (he had a house, this shed like house and a little stingy house thing), so he sent us to the stingy one because it was safer. There were little, squishy beds. Some little zombie kept staring at me. I started talking to it in a silly voice. She was like 2 years old and I thought she was retarded. I was like ""stop teasing me!"". Her father started bashing her for teasing people and I was like 'oops'."
"2137"	"(2008-06-02 (17)) The external Accounting exam was on at Westland University and it went for 3 hours."
"2138"	"(2008-06-03 (17)) I went to the movies. I had to go in by myself, but the school was seeing the movie too. I had asked the guy at the door if I could take a seat and go somewhere else, but decided to stay in the cinema. Later, I was at Calvin's work and I was telling him I saw some movie, which was the 4th in the series, but what I was actually describing was The Eye."
"2139"	"(2008-06-03 (17)) I was with the school, but I don't know where we were. Elijah and some others were doing some flower things. Eugene and his group were hanging around a bench."
"2140"	"(2008-06-04 (17)) I went to school, which was different, for an exam. I also tried to get my leavers jacket. I went to Mr Billings and he said something that meant I couldn't get it yet. I was sitting at a desk with Autumn, who was next to Alyssa. Autumn was talking about the Grand Exchange on Runescape and I said that I liked it. The exam was in a big room with steps and everyone sat along the steps and it was packed. Elijah was at the exam. I thought it was Accounting so I text Mom to bring my chemistry notes. She got there but then I realized it was the chemistry exam and tried to get rid of her, but she insisted upon giving me the notes. Finally, the exam started, but they had given me and Autumn a year 7 exam, so they took it and gave us the proper one. But we had to get these tube things and they only had munted ones left. I said ""what do we even need these for?"" and the guy said to get everyone out of the building and told this kid to blow this horn thing and everyone ran out silently. This lady said we didn't have to do the exam."
"2141"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) Dad and I were playing Scrabble, but we had cards which had people I thought were hot on them. Robert de Niro and Al Pacino were in a row. We were then playing another game thing. There was a big sphere in the middle of my room. There were coloured balls that went round and dropped into a space."
"2142"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) I don't remember properly, but someone was doing something and they had accidentally killed this person, then had to kill this other person to cover it up. Someone needed to get out of this building and Jack Nance (as Pete Martell) was in a car. One of the people killed was Catherine (Twin Peaks)."
"2143"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) Ezra and I had to cross the street, but I don't know why."
"2144"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) I was at school and was sitting with Calvin and others. Evelyn came and was talking and laughing with us until we pulled out something about Evelyn and Darius and she moved far away."
"2145"	"(2008-06-07 (17)) Mom was going to see a friend. I drove I think. Mom met up with this other guy first, who was a 'behind the scenes' guy and he was weird looking, but hot. As he was leaving, Mom said ""he's kind of weird"" and the car did something weird and I said ""ooh"", but she thought I was saying ""ooh"" at the guy and kept telling everyone that I liked this guy. I went in and was resting on a saloon type of door and then saw someone who looked like David Spade. Then he said ""How's Kylie?"" and I was confused and he said ""never mind"" and I remembered we had had met him before. I wanted to leave to I complained to Mom and she left, just as these others got there. I was at this place and I walked past Eugene and thought ""oh look there's my boyfriend"". I had to go across this obstacle thing. There were chairs and planks in odd positions. I had to carefully maneuver over them. At the end this chair had a leg missing and if I fell I would've been badly hurt. I got over it though. Then Bradley and Eugene were going through it. I put up the chairs at the end to help them."
"2146"	"(2008-06-07 (17)) Dad, Ezra and I were on a holiday, but it was at Nana's (and none of them were there). We were in the lounge room and it was set up differently and there was a lounge with an air conditioner on it. There were some kids nearby who liked to play with Ezra. There were zombies outside and they were like 'brains' ones. We closed the blinds. Someone was at the back door talking to them and I realized he was going to open the door so I ran there and locked it again. I told Dad they were going to get through, so we grabbed our stuff (I grabbed my keys and my phone, which had fallen between the lounge cushions) and went to the front door. We realized my car was in front of the garage. There were no zombies at the front door, but we couldn't see enough out of the door, so we stayed inside. We then saw the zombies run to the front door so we decided to go down these stairs to this fence and not many zombies were there. They were trying to climb over the fence and we were kicking them down. I got down first and started punching them and stuff. Then we ran to this circle, which was surrounded by zombies. I went down and there was a shelf with dumbbells so I was hitting them with them but they were too heavy so I ran back up. It was then a shop. I was climbing along shelves and it was a chocolate section. One of the chocolate's wrappers said it was Oprah's favourite and it had some alcohol in it. I was eating some of the chocolates to try it and I started feeling sick. I was feeding the zombies chocolate and eventually they were all full and drunk. Then this zombie had a sore hand and I suggested a bandage. He went looking for one with me and he found it first. This girl behind a counter thought I was shifty. Later, I had a job at this girly place in the shop, called 'Soho'. They had weird hats and we needed to sell one a day. There was a jumper which was brown and it didn't protect from the cold very well. I was also at school at one point and Ms Bigwood made me popcorn with lots of butter and it was gross. Mom gave me chicken sandwiches. I went to eat. Fatima was at a table, so I sat with her and then she moved."
"2147"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) I got mail from this Asian girl saying she loved me and we had the same birthday and were both born here, except she lived in the US now. She had found my site. I was confused about it. Her name started with a 'T' and was long and Asian like. Mr Reilly (I assumed it was him) sent me a video of some girl saying ""Rawr!"". There was a computer, Mom and Darren were on it, I think. My car was just a shell and it was light. I went inside and got a call from some guy called Dennis and he said he was ""Brad's Dad"". I was wondering why he was calling me and how he got my number."
"2148"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) Mr Gutenberg had given me some study guides for math."
"2149"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) I had been watching something and it mentioned a movie called ""Two Guys in a Bed"" and that they were in a bed for the whole movie. I looked it up and it said Justin Timberlake and Will Arnett were in it. It was also made in 1997. I downloaded it and I was watching it and it wasn't bad. Then Justin Timberlake was actually this latin-y looking guy and he was in highschool. He was playing basketball in a gym and this guy asked him if he had ""slept with an older guy"" and he said yes. Clea Duvall was also in it."
"2150"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) I had been doing a family tree and had discovered that we were related to Martin Sheen. It had a photo of Charlie Sheen, then Martin. Someone like Martin's sister had someone who was related to us. Nana saw it and she was like ""Sheen?"" and I said yeah and that I was going to go as far back as I could."
"2151"	"(2008-06-10 (17)) This lady did some charity thing. She told the group one day that they got a heap of money, but then the next day, her, this guy and another guy called Alec, left and went to Australia and took the money. This cop person (who was me sometimes) was there and there was a thing saying the ""girl is med-hot, Alec and is cool"" or something. They thought he was going to kill her. They discovered she was allergic to pepper. They put a thermometer in the guy's mouth, who was then Ezra and the temperature went way up and the cop said ""You're under arrest"" and Ezra was confused. He said he liked peppers in meatloaf and he had bought ones the girl wasn't allergic to."
"2152"	"(2008-06-10 (17)) I was at school. My bag was moldy. I was then at Mom's old house. She told me to throw it in the bin outside. Calvin was there. Ezra was saying that Elijah's middle name was ""Thilby"" and I thought of James Wilby, and how I keep thinking is name is Thilby."
"2153"	"(2008-06-11 (17)) I was at 'school'. When we got picked up we had to climb over these lounges. There were lots of blue ones and a pink one. I always went over the blue ones and Josephine went over the pink one. Emery and Ezra were annoying me."
"2154"	"(2008-06-11 (17)) I was at home and Mom, Calvin and this guy were there. Calvin found this stuff of this dead girl's and one of the things had Stanley Tucci and his phone number on it. This guy was in the room (and we suspected him of killing the girl) so we called the number and someone said to hurry up and get him. Before we could say anything, he left in my car. I accidentally got in the passenger's seat. The guy left but Mom went to talk to him so I left quickly and went down a side street. People started coughing and I realized this was the disease ""from Runescape"". Then we were in a little house. We had to keep duck blood to keep the diseased away (they were like vampire zombies) and keep lights off, etc. It was a game too and I had to get skills up -- farming, health etc. The internet was really slow. We had these ice things to stab the diseased with. They were going to break in."
"2155"	"(2008-06-12 (17)) I had made up this ring tone on this site. At first, it was food, then it was a Sim. It was this apple pie looking thing with extra stuff added. It was nice. Then it was a female Sim. I decided to eat my phone and I was eating one of the sliding bits and then decided I didn't want to so I asked Mom to get me a new one tomorrow. I told her about what ring tone to get. Ezra was also there."
"2156"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) I was at a shop with Dad. They had videos and Dad wanted to subscribe. We found this 'grieble' thing except it was spelt wrong. We couldn't think of anything else to get. There was a chocolate section. There were giant chocolates with an area of 1m2 and this kid ran up to it and it was bigger than him. His mother went to get him and the chocolate started slipping and I went to grab it but it slipped through and landed on the kid, but he was ok. Dad complained because I didn't get it."
"2157"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) This guy had been seeing this girl but they broke up and he had met this other girl. He was a doctor. He was examining her and said that nothing was wrong and she said ""Thank God!"" but then he went down on his knees, grabbed her hands and said ""You're going to die"" and they were both crying and hugging each other. His ex came and he tried to get rid of her."
"2158"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) I was at a house. Ezra and a friend were on the computer. This unicorn thing kept running towards me when I opened a door. There were other strange creatures there and ones like chickens. They kept trying to attack me. I was hiding behind a door. Some guy got attacked and all that was left of him was dust."
"2159"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) We had an excursion. I had driven there and other cars had come to (people had been allowed to drive others there). I had a navigation thing. I don't remember what the excursion was but some people had to choose a girl and then they were all put into groups and they had to have kids with the men. Kristin Bell was in a group and I said ""she's going to make some ugly babies!"". There were four groups. Group one had some pretty girls in it. Will Arnett was one of the guys and another hot guy (don't remember who) was in it too. I had become friends with Martin Freeman and that whole day had been recorded and it went for 78 minutes. I went to drive back. The car was small. Some random people got in the car. I was trying to work out how to reverse the path for the navigation thing. I was reading the manual and trying all sorts of things and eventually everyone left the car. I finally worked it out but I was driving too fast. At the top of the screen was a police icon. I got pulled over, sometimes I was on a motorbike. The cop said he couldn't talk to us with something in my hand. There was a helmet. I explained to him about what happened. I had no information about the bike. He drove us back. The clock said it was 3:02pm."
"2160"	"(2008-06-14 (17)) I was playing Runescape. I was in a field and I had to go through this gate and there was a monkey or something at the top and I didn't want to pay to get through so I just walked through and it was throwing stuff at me, which hit for quite a bit of health. I went to a shop and I was with Mom. I wanted to get a game but they only had ones I didn't want."
"2161"	"(2008-06-15 (17)) Two couples were in a bed. There was a black guy in each couple and one girl's boyfriend. This woman and some kids were naked. There was a computer with a female voice. One of the black guy's was a killer. I think we were at school. It was like a movie and everyone looked different. I was running somewhere and I walked past Eugene and Darius but they didn't look like them. There was a line of kids outside the classroom I wanted to go into and I ran past. There were cobwebs. I waited until the kids got rid of them and went into the class. Eugene and Darius had followed me in, but I left straight away and there was a spider. There was a secret group. Payton was recruiting people into the group. They left the light on and I complained that others would see. Melodie wanted a pillow so I gave her one. Samantha's sister Cyndi made a pasta dish. I told her off. This teacher guy tried to get in. We had four rooms or so and everyone was assigned a bed. Eugene and Darius decided to join. They were in the bed across from mine. I wanted Eugene to be in my bed."
"2162"	"(2008-06-16 (17)) Exams were on. They were all done in this little room at one desk. Eugene, Jeremiah, Bradley and others were there. Jeremiah had 3 hats. My neck was sore and Ms Solomon told me to rub this bit of my neck, so I did and eventually it cracked and felt good. I think we were doing the English exam. Jeremiah was next to me and a yellow hat was in the way. Mom worked at McDonald's. There was a really cheesy burger. The shop was set up strangely and it was hard to wash up. There was weird soap. I was out driving with Dad and I saw the oldest number plate -- started with 3DE."
"2163"	"(2008-06-16 (17)) I went to a play. It was actually stuff from people at school of when they were younger. Some of it was speeches. We had to sit in seats in certain areas and there were only two seats left -- one was next to Eugene and the other next to a teacher. I asked if I could just sit somewhere else a little further away and they said no, but I did anyway."
"2164"	"(2008-06-16 (17)) I read a bit of The Liar and it was really good. Some spy lady had to go into this computer but it was then me with Eugene and the others. It was taking a long time to download the stuff and the people came back (one of them was Jeremiah) but I managed to print out some stuff. This teacher caught us and Eugene told me to go back and he'd give himself in."
"2165"	"(2008-06-17 (17)) I was sitting on this lounge, which was two sided. Samantha, Silas, Calvin and Evelyn were on it too. Sometimes Silas wasn't on it. Evelyn was talking to us like nothing had happened but would sometimes just stare at the ground and we would giggle. She left to go to the toilet and we had been sharing some food, so we got Calvin to go to McDonald's (which was right next to us) and get a clean plate, to pretend that we had eaten everything. Roland was there, so Calvin asked him to get it. When we got back someone else had finished off the food anyway."
"2166"	"(2008-06-17 (17)) I was on IMDb and ended up on some actress's page and it said Christopher Walken had died and I thought it was odd that I hadn't heard about it."
"2167"	"(2008-06-17 (17)) I started a new account on Runescape to see what it was like for new members now. The skills only showed up when you talked to a tutor for that skill. I was telling Ezra. Then it was Dad's work (I wasn't there) and Gunther hadn't come in and he was due for his shift hours ago. He was getting worried and then he came in, drunk. Dad got home late with some random movies, including Singing in the Rain."
"2168"	"(2008-06-18 (17)) There were zombies. Dad, Ezra and I were at Nana's. Aunt Sally and her kids, Poppa, Nana and other random people were also there. For the first week or so after getting settled there we went to a school. We soon stopped going. Some Spanish kids were with us and they were growing vegetables and had zombies wandering around where the vegetables were growing. There were two kittens and two babies. I had something and someone complained about it because I didn't need it. I was wondering where Eugene was and I was annoyed that there weren't many people my age here."
"2169"	"(2008-06-19 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I went through the drive thru at McDonald's except I got a barbeque roller (from KFC). It was going to take 30 minutes and Mom wasn't going to wait so I jumped out of the car and went in. Then I thought I saw Eugene's father Abraham and looked up and saw it was his father and he and his brother were also there. They ordered and sat down to wait. I kept looking at Eugene. His father mentioned his mother and Eugene said ""I liked it when she wasn't dead"". This ugly freckled girl who worked there asked me if I was going to order or if I was waiting. I said ""I've got an order"" and she said ""Well, you look like a type A, would-,"" and I stopped her and said I've already ordered and the girl who took my order was holding the bag and gave it to me."
"2170"	"(2008-06-20 (17)) I got to school late. I thought I had chemistry because it was Wednesday but this random class was in there. I went to English (which was in a different class) and saw all these old school books of everyone in the class on random desks. No-one was in there. I had been put between Dmitri and Alejandro. I saw Elijah's book. I was looking for Eugene's desk but then he and a few others came in. Duane and Eugene were playing Pokemon together and I was playing by myself. I ended up talking to Evelyn about Neopets until I said ""Your mother's gay"". Her password was 'rarity'. Ms Solomon said we were going to the library, so we went to the library. Ms Olmstead complained when I cleaned up some mess. I was outside the library and these two girls were saying that people never knew what they had in their bags. I tried to get my bag on, but it was too heavy. They said they had put sand in it and I chased after them and I was going to throw it at them when some other girls heard what was going on. Dad went to Midvale shops and bought a Danish. Eugene was there and Dad had said something about his leavers jacket (something rude of a sexual nature). As we were leaving, Eugene and some others were laughing at a bus stop."
"2171"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different. We had a lizard with a red thing on its head and it burnt you if you touched it. Mr Reilly had had said before that they were extinct, so we had to be careful. We got them all in a bag. Teller came over and he spoke with a British accent. Mom and Ezra were there. Teller was pretending he was going to drive into us. He was really funny. I was telling Ezra who he was."
"2172"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) I was at home alone. I was going to stay at Mom's later. I saw a lady who looked like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos out the back trying to get in. I yelled at her and she ran away. A few minutes later I was on the phone to Mom and other people came. They stopped running from me and they were checking out the games room window. I told Mom to get me now. Where the games room window was, was now a door (which was two doors). They started pushing a limousine into it. Finally they pushed it open and I ran to my room and told them not to take my stuff and that they could take anything else. One guy said ""you can have anything but your stuff"". I said I'd give him $5000 for my laptop and he said ok. I left with Mom. Later I went back and there was basically nothing left in the house. I called Dad, and I also had Gunther listed in my contacts. He came and I discovered my laptop was gone and they left some stingy one. I was really upset. I said I didn't want to have to make my Excel spreadsheet for my dreams again or type up my dreams again (even my external hard drives were gone). I was also thinking of the photos I'd lost and the ones I'd taken of Eugene. Dad was doing some quiz on the internet for something. The window in Ezra's room had been taken off. I got a text from one of the guy's and a computer game had stingy requirements. His text said ""nice cats man, the next thing they lose is their skin"". I found a skull in the cupboard under the microwave and it looked fake, but it was real and it was Mittens's. I thought if Mittens was dead, then Tigger must be dead too and I was really upset."
"2173"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) Dad, Darius and I were at some place. Darius was being stupid and it was really funny."
"2174"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) I was at a shop. I got lost and ended up at one end of the store and there were two little shops next to each other. One was a fortune teller and the other was a blood place (donate, get tested for stuff). I got in this other line, not knowing what it was for. This guy turned around and he said ""this is for a Matiz"" and I said ""What if I was looking at a Matiz"". I was going to go to the blood place to check it out, but I decided not to and went to the fortune teller. I asked what she did. The readings were expensive - $60. She told me what each option did and then she said ""if you show me the money"" and I said I didn't have any money and I was just wondering. She didn't explain properly anyway so I left. I was on MSN later and she was talking to me and had a font, which was a nice purple colour."
"2175"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) It was the morning of the careers excursion. Darius, then Jeremiah, Bradley and Eugene showed up and I was thinking 'yay, Eugene!'."
"2176"	"(2008-06-22 (17)) We had gone to this place for an excursion before and it had been built in the early 2000's. It was in the middle of being built and it was underwater (not of all it). The first time we went there we were lining up and in another queue were celebrities, I remember seeing Adam Baldwin and Matt Damon and Tom Welling was in a car. The second time we went, I didn't notice anyone I knew. Mr Billings got some of us to go down to these seats. Elijah, someone else and I went and sat down. Darius made a stupid pose. Calvin and I were then sitting somewhere. Later when we went back, Tiana and some others were sitting in front. Some chocolate fell and they were going to steal it, but I got it back. There was another seating section and Eugene was sitting there, but if I sat near him it was too obvious why I was sitting there. Rodney came and sat near us at the front. There was something about Big Brother and Adam Sandler went in and he had no shirt on and was dancing and singing."
"2177"	"(2008-06-23 (17)) These guys were going to breed buffalo or something with chickens for a competition. There was going to be a ""buffalo chicken"" race or like ""best quality"" competition. To get them to breed, the buffalo had to run at a certain speed and hit the chicken, rupture the side of it and lay an egg. They were the hardest thing to breed. The first chicken they tried got flung over and died. The next one was successful. People got hit too. One of their mates got hit and impregnated. One guy said ""You guys didn't even try to go down on him"" and they laughed and said that wasn't the first thing to come to their minds and the guy said ""No, like CPR""."
"2178"	"(2008-06-24 (17)) I was at a shop, and it was a game sometimes. These girls were after me. I hid behind a pillar and they gave up. We got a new teacher in form [yesterday, we got a new one] . I was on eBay looking for something. I went to some school place and met with Eugene. We were going out and we walked to his room (he had his own one). The beds had nice blankets. First we went to a room with lots of beds. We were lying in his bed and he had his arm around me and was stroking my arm."
"2179"	"(2008-06-25 (17)) Ms Solomon asked who liked music from the 80's, then 60's and then asked about movies. Calvin was on a computer next to me. She did something to our index page. Alejandro pinched someone and Calvin complained to him."
"2180"	"(2008-06-25 (17)) Dad, Ezra and I were watching TV. Some of the channels weren't working. Dexter was on and Michael C. Hall and Miguel Ferrer were shown. Miguel was some guy who was in the war. He was also in a TV remake of The Shining that was made in 1989, playing a dead guy. St Elmo's Fire was also on."
"2181"	"(2008-06-26 (17)) I was in a shop. I don't know what happened at the start, but Dexter (Dexter) was there. We were friends and I knew he was a killer. Calvin and I found stuff that belonged to people at school, including stuff of Eugene's and Darius's. We were going through it. I was with Dexter and he killed this girl because she knew something. His hands were covered in blood. Darius liked this girl. I spent a while convincing her to go out with him and finally she did. They hugged. Dexter killed this other girl and as we were walking away I thought he was going to put his arms around me. Later, we were all sleeping the shop. I was listening to Mister Roboto. Ezra, Mom and Dad were there too. Then another time, Dexter and I were making out and they thought we were going to have sex and gave us condoms. Mom got her car back and it was full of smoke. I went with Dexter, who was then Austin and then Dexter again and he dropped me off home."
"2182"	"(2008-06-27 (17)) This girl and her boyfriend ended up with this dude. I don't remember properly, but Pete Wentz was in a van along with them and the guy's sister. It was then dark and Pete and the sister disappeared. They were trying to find the guy's sister. They went through McDonald's drive thru, but the van was too big so they went back and got a smaller car. Then they were at the guy's house. The girl had now fallen in love with him. Her boyfriend was going through all these trapdoors trying to get out and to find the guy's sister. His girlfriend and the guy were trying to kill him. At one point the boyfriend came up through a trapdoor and his girlfriend pointed a gun at him. Then they were in an underground place that looked like an abandoned Royal Show and they were near some show bag stalls. All these people that the guy had killed were hanging on hooks with posters of them next to them. Pete Wentz and the sister were down there. It had then been a movie, and Dad said ""he wasn't there earlier"", as he had thought Pete Wentz hadn't been in the movie at all."
"2183"	"(2008-06-28 (17)) A bunch of us ended up in a shop, including Eugene. We thought something bad was going to happen. I went outside and saw this mist coming and I told everyone to go inside. We then had to go into this other section in the shop and everyone was taking a long time to get in and so I shut the door (it was airtight). Jeremiah didn't get in. We had to flush out the mist. People left behind passed out and were on the floor, but they were ok. I was getting some stationery and some magazines to read. I went out and took Tigger with me. Some guy attacked me. When I got back he was there. I told them to get rid of him because he was dangerous."
"2184"	"(2008-06-28 (17)) I was at home and I thought I heard the bathroom light on (the fan). I went to go have a look and Dad opened the door and Vivian was in there naked."
"2185"	"(2008-06-28 (17)) I was on Runescape and some people were doing a competition for people to run down a freeway and the winner got houses on Runescape with good items in there, and also random items like ""tuna and a waterfall seed"". Then I was in a shop and people were gathering for it. I had to find a girl called Bwana Como or something. I found her, then I was a guy and I wasn't me. He told her he had a surprise, but within a short time he fell in love her. The next day, they woke up together and he had slept with her. They had been sleeping on metal pipes. His mate complained about her. He saw a creepy dude watching him. Then I had to get in to this place with some stuff. Someone had this statue and we 'flew' into it through its belly button. Poppa and Dad were there. They opened this trapdoor as I went down. I ended up in a girl's toilet but I couldn't get into the shop. I tried to leave but this girl tried to take me and put makeup on me and I punched her. I kicked some other people and then left, running. I called Mom to get me. I was outside, and this group came out too. One of the people was Ezra and a really a fat kid. They attacked me and I was hitting them with a water bottle. I asked Ezra why he was with them. I said the girl was bad and that boys could do things (in poker and stuff and the girls would 'whip you'). Ezra dropped his Pokemon Diamond [though he has Pearl] through gaps in this bridge. Mr Billings got in and brought it up and it was ok. Then they left me alone and Mom came."
"2186"	"(2008-06-29 (17)) I went to Comic-Con and met with Jewel Staite, but I don't remember anything else."
"2187"	"(2008-06-29 (17)) We were at some place and when I left, I left with Eugene, Jeremiah and Darius. I was driving and they were all in the back. We went to McDonald's and I was thinking the passenger seat was empty because Bradley left. Eugene was behind the passenger, then Darius in the middle and Jeremiah behind me. We ordered heaps of food and a girl served us."
"2188"	"(2008-06-30 (17)) I was in a room. Jeremy Piven and some other guys in there too. We were watching TV. I went into the next room (which didn't have a door) and I was naked and getting changed. I turned around so that my back was facing them so I could put a towel around myself. Jeremy Piven then said something to Kevin Dillon and when I turned they were looking and Kevin turned back around but Jeremy kept looking. I then sat down and felt really uncomfortable. Then I was at a shop outside, and all these people of a certain age (and other characteristics) turned into females with tongue piercings and I was extremely annoyed about it. People outside were going to break in."
"2189"	"(2008-06-30 (17)) Some guy (or guys) had killed 15 people and their murders were a mystery. Someone, a lover of this guy who had been killed, said he'd give the address of an old lady who could help to someone. I had a list of the 15 murdered people and I was not allowed to tell anyone about them. Ezra kept trying to get it. Mom was there. I said ""I bet the lover is a guy"" (he was gay). He was. He gave me the address on a band-aid. A lady was recording us and she had Mom's license plate recorded and had zoomed in on her computer and it was really good quality."
"2190"	"(2008-06-30 (17)) Poppa came over and was in my room. He started going weird, like convulsing, and I called Dad and Mom and they told me to drive him halfway to Nana's. Then it was a game and I was looking at a map and couldn't find the police."
"2191"	"(2008-07-01 (17)) I was in a backyard. Jewel Staite was in a chair, signing autographs and the like. Mom and Ezra were there. I was telling Ezra about how nervous I was when I got a photo with her. Granma was then there. Mom made some rice salad. There were some signed videos but I don't know what was on them. I had gone to the shop earlier and Michael Palin was there and I had fainted and then Paul McCartney was there too."
"2192"	"(2008-07-01 (17)) I was driving down Princess Road and I got to the roundabout near the bridge and then I realized Mom wasn't with me and I was driving by myself so I pulled over."
"2193"	"(2008-07-02 (17)) Dad, this girl, a guy and his girlfriend and I went out into space to the moon, I think, to find this 'star'. The girl didn't like me and I was worried that she was going to try to kill me. The guy and his girlfriend kept making out. The star was loud. The door of the vehicle we were in (it was just a room) didn't close properly and it was like a shed door. The girl said to close it on my side and I thought she was going to do something, so I moved to the other corner. It then showed her looking at ice on the floor and it was coming from the roof. I noticed ice in front of me and I showed Dad. I realized we were back at Earth and I said to let the girl out first (so she couldn't do anything to me). They put her down in a carton of milk. Her friends were excited and happy she was back but then ditched her and befriended this other girl. This other star went past and it was also loud. Someone said there was a ""mini Australia"" on the moon. We were then in a bar. People were dancing and I was trying to take a photo. This girl was doing a weird dance and she had red hair and green lipstick on and bright yellow eyes. I asked about her and they said she was weird. They had different characters there and she was one called 'Lisa Simpson'. Charlize Theron was there. The sky had these diamond shapes all in a row, so I took a photo."
"2194"	"(2008-07-03 (17)) I was at school. We had an assembly in a classroom where the girl's toilets are (but they weren't there anymore). They said girls have to not pee, although some went in there earlier and peed on the seats. Jeremiah was sitting not too far away from me and Silas was talking to him about Eugene, about how he didn't like waiting more than three seconds for a response. Then Silas said ""What about Beatles noob over there"" and pointed to me and Jeremiah leant over and whispered to him. Jeremiah kept saying words to me, like ""parallel"" and I was confused and he was laughing. This girl sitting on the ground started singing a song ""bleep"" and Darius was laughing. They took us to where I get picked up from and we held onto this fence and this bus pulled us along. I called Mom as I didn't want to wait there for 20 minutes. It was then night and there were trees across the road. Eugene was in there but there was a weird glow coming out, which was how I knew he was in there. Then he was right near me, and our faces were close and this light was shining through the gap. Then he was playing Pokemon. His friends said they were going to watch a ""27 year old movie"" and Eugene said he'd rather watch a new movie and I said I'd rather the 27 year old movie and he said we should go. I hesitated and he ran after them and then I did. I saw Mom and I told her I was going with them. Eugene also played Runescape and he was level 100 summoning and some other skills were 100 too. His total level was 1511. I was trying to work out how he got to level 100, since the maximum level is 99 and he had only joined in December 2007. We ended up at this creepy cinema place. These people broke in and caught me. Eugene had hid in time, and was flashing this light for me to follow him. They made me get a glass for them and the water in one turned into blood. The guys were covered in blood and someone said they were dead."
"2195"	"(2008-07-04 (17)) I was bored and went to this funeral place. It had a cemetery and a building. I was walking through the cemetery and there was a funeral happening and Kiefer Sutherland was there. Then I was at this creepy place that looked like it was set in the western times. I asked this young girl, who looked like Jennifer Morrison and was also British, where I could search where the funerals and gravestones were. There was a roller door and I had to push my finger under it. There was a bright light and I got trapped there. Then, I found the building and I saw Eugene sitting with his family. I had actually gone there to look for him. He gave me a little wave as I walked up these stairs. I was wandering around waiting for Eugene to get upstairs, then Dad and a friend of his came and they were getting haircuts. Eugene and his family came and they were saying speeches. Julianna was talking and I was angry about this, as I was annoyed that she was close to their family. Jeremiah was there too crying and smoking. Eugene was crying too. Jeremiah said ""Yeah, yeah we love you Eugene"". Then they left."
"2196"	"(2008-07-04 (17)) Samantha had a party somewhere. It was supposed to be a dress up party or you had to ""go to the toilet and then brush your teeth"". Calvin was there. It was not Samantha's party all the time. There was a girl and she wrote me a poem thing. I was then dressed as Betty (Ugly Betty). There were some photos from the party and I was looking for ones with Eugene but there weren't any. Daryl was there too. We had to leave. This guy we came with killed someone. This girl I with got in a car in the backseat and I said ""who's driving?"" and she said ""you are"" and pulled a gun out, so I drove. Then there was me, some other people and Kevin Dillon. This guy explained something, proving we were bad guys. ""He's wearing a necklace on his neck, this symbolizes..."" etc. Police came after us. We got out of the car and I went into this area surrounded by dogs. I had to climb over the fences and distract the dogs long enough. I got trapped in the middle, but managed to run to the next area and there was a little dog. It was eating ears. I got out and it was gone, instead there was a little turtle."
"2197"	"(2008-07-04 (17)) I was at home and there was a bus out the back. It was an excursion for the last day of school. Calvin was on there. The bus driver was a driver I'd had from ""year three"". He remembered me and Melodie. He had to drive through the kitchen. Everyone was then in the games room. I said to Theodore, ""Not Tigger, you can attack Mittens""."
"2198"	"(2008-07-05 (17)) I had an excursion which was like a sequel to one we'd gone to in year 11, that I hadn't gone to. Calvin came. We were told to go to this meeting room after lunch. At lunch Calvin, Eugene, others and I were in the room. We realized no-one else was there and I said ""where is everyone?"" and Eugene said ""I dunno"". We walked out and everyone was sitting in chairs and a guy was talking. Ms Solomon gave us gel stuff to put everywhere there was hair. It made my hand look nicer. I was naked and she was putting it in my hair and I was covering myself. I was looking in a mirror and I let go and saw my boobs and quickly covered back up. Some guy with a really squished up face said hello to Calvin (first, we were in a tree along with Spaceman and had gone to run away and I had trouble getting down). He had annoyed Calvin last year but obviously didn't get in trouble for it. He kept hurting him and me to a lesser extent. He was trying to drown me at one point. I went into a room to hide. The excursion was a 'study' excursion and there was a lady in there. I told her I was doing biology study, but she made me study a map of Spain."
"2199"	"(2008-07-06 (17)) I ended up in 1910 with David Tennant as the Doctor (Doctor Who). The TARDIS had screwed up and didn't come through with us. Sometimes I was with Eugene not the Doctor. There was a video of this girl and a guy with a doctor on some rocks. The girl hated them but she was enjoying herself anyway. The doctor mentioned Bonnie and Clyde. Then it was like 1919 and we met up with these other people who traveled in a TARDIS. They knew we were too and I went to go with them but the Doctor said ""Izzy! Don't touch it!"". He explained that I'd get disconnected from the other TARDIS and I would disappear, so I didn't touch it. In the mid 1920's, we met this lady who was a psychic. I asked her what you play games on and she said ""computer"" and I mentioned a song and started singing ""I asked Bobby Dylan"" and she said ""I asked The Beatles"" (The Seeker). There were photos of Bonnie and Clyde and there was a whole section in a library dedicated to them. There were photos from the movie, but with different people. Somehow I told Dad that we were stuck in time and had been for 10 years (although it had gone faster for us, we also hadn't aged). He went inside the TARDIS and hit something, he got out of it and it fixed it. We got back and I hugged him. I went to hug the Doctor but I thought 'we did enough hugging'. Dad and I were walking across a road and there was a car with an old number plate."
"2200"	"(2008-07-07 (17)) I was at school. Mr Billings was talking to me and told me to see him at the Year 9 block sometime. He asked why I didn't call my Biology teacher and I said I forgot. I went to the library for Biology and it was different and huge. Ms Atkinson was there and she had a short haircut. I went into an area to study and Elijah and Josephine came in. Some teachers started pulling curtains tightly around a square area, including around me. I said ""What are you doing? Meditating or something?"" and Josephine said ""yeah"". Then four of us were sitting and they had there legs crossed over like they were meditating and I was trying not to laugh. Sometime later, we stopped some kid on a ledge. I pushed him off and first yelled at him angrily and others complained about what I did. We were then in some big house. Everyone there slowly left to sleep in another room (because I hurt the kid) except Calvin, who stayed. Ezra was there too. We then decided to run upstairs as a joke and pretend to all be leaving me. We went up and everyone had started going back, we then left. We met up with some Irish guys. I got the impression one of them liked me. Silas and I were mucking around and the guy said ""Oh now I love Sasha Wyatt"" and he cried. I thought it was because he thought I was with Silas. I was worried about sleeping that night because I didn't trust the Irish guys (there were three of them). I walked past this area, which we had hidden out in before and it was now too rundown to stay in. Nana was there. I said ""ok, why don't we just stay in a house?"". I then realized it was a bad idea because 'they' were about to come home. Then it was a movie and this lady, her two sons and her husband were in their house. She put the kids to bed and then she left and it showed a spider web with a big bug on it on the door (it was Halloween, and supposed to look like a decoration). I said ""now the spider will move"" and it did. Later, the kid woke up and was screaming. The Mom woke up and sprayed insecticide before opening her eyes. Then she opened them and smiled and got up. There were lots of bugs and she was spraying them. They had to leave because other insects (in other houses, they were taking over) would've heard them. Then there was a pub looking place and it had weird ads on the walls (one of them was for a movie with people who had been taken over by something). The cops came to find them. One of them said they had been there just a few hours ago. There were hairs in the roof. There was this weird thing that I was 'giving' hair to. I pulled the hair through the top of its head, like a comb and then it had blond hair, but it turned to spiky red hair and there was green straight down the middle."
"2201"	"(2008-07-07 (17)) I don't remember the start and it was possibly a continuation of the last dream (definitely a different dream), but Eugene and I were running from zombies, but they weren't really zombies. They would mostly walk slow, but would suddenly start running fast. They also didn't seem very zombie like. We were at a big shop, in an outside area. There were lots of dead people around -- slumped over in chairs and on the ground. Their eyes were turning red and their skin was saggy. There was a radio, which was repeating old recordings and it said something about a weapons/military place and I suggested we go there as there would be good protection. As we were talking, some zombies started to slowly come towards us and they sped up so we ran. We ran behind this column and hid there. They ran past and so we came out from behind it, but one was still there and when we killed it we made some noise, so took off before the others came back. We went into a food hall and we were hiding underneath a table, but I decided to run into the next room. Eugene hesitated and the zombies came in and he thought they were going to get me and said ""sorry!"" because he wasn't going to go with me, but the zombies didn't come for me, they just wandered around the place, looking around, so Eugene ran to the next room with me. I don't know what happened to him but in the next room it was full of zombies. I was alone and some of them were eating. They completely ignored me. I started waving in the face of one of them, who was eating a bloody foot, and I hit him with something. He growled, but other than that they ignored me."
"2202"	"(2008-07-07 (17)) I was at school. We had an excursion. I wasn't wearing any pants because they were wet and I left them in the car. Calvin was with me. I had to go to the toilet so I went to the toilets in the Year 9 block. The last toilet had one wall missing and the door was low. This girl was looking over the top. This chubby girl did a dance. Some girls had been teasing me and pushing me and we had made a rule that they couldn't film it. I attacked them. I was walking to the bus and I told Ms Vickers that I forgot the key to the car (to get my pants) so she said she would take me home. Bradley and Darius were in another car. Jeremiah was taking stuff to the excursion. Eugene wasn't there. As we drove home, we missed the turn off at first. The house was different. Dad had a roller door at the front door. I couldn't get inside. I tried to open this window. I finally got inside, but grabbed two bars of chocolates and put them in my pocket as I had gone there to get food, not my pants. I went back to the car and Ms Vickers was now Ms Solomon."
"2203"	"(2008-07-09 (17)) There was some disease thing where under everyone's skin were these little maggot like creatures. One guy went to a lady to get rid of them. He stood naked and they rolled over his body. It was a fairly painful procedure and he would lose bits of skin and stuff and he chose to keep his hair, so it showed the maggots crawling around under the skin on his head. Mittens was infected."
"2204"	"(2008-07-10 (17)) Dad was playing Runescape. I went somewhere for the day (it was Tuesday). When I got back, he had taken the day off to play and he had level 92 mining. Ezra and I were amazed and confused. From the ore he had mined, he could make 425 million gp."
"2205"	"(2008-07-10 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I were at someone's house. Austin was there and he was doing something with tobacco. I was picking at the food and Mom thought I was trying to 'look cool'. I felt dizzy. Ezra was asleep. I was outside and my laptop was in the car, because it downloaded faster. Ezra, Dad and I were at some place, with The Simpsons playing on a huge screen. Pokemon and Invader Zim also appeared somewhere."
"2206"	"(2008-07-11 (17)) I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Burke came back and everyone was surprised. He and the Chief went into a room because he needed some medicine or something. Yang walked in and his pants were down. They hugged."
"2207"	"(2008-07-11 (17)) Ezra, Mom and I were in a car. I found out that Michael C. Hall was at some place, so I went there with a friend of mine, who was actually Katherine Heigl. This black guy was guarding the entrance. When I got in, she wanted to meet Michael straight away but he wasn't there yet. I was thinking of Comic-Con and Jewel Staite. My eye started itching and it got bad. There was random furniture around. I looked in a mirror and my eye was all red and there were all these pimples on my face. Michael got there but he was also sick, as were some others. People who weren't showing symptoms got tested. Katherine walked past me and I told her off. This Indian woman was with us. I was talking to her and she looked up at the ceiling behind me, so I looked and then looked down and Michael was standing there. I jumped and said ""you scared me!"". Then the place was actually in the water and they were testing different areas of the water for poisonous areas. The Indian thought she had been bitten by something."
"2208"	"(2008-07-12 (17)) Dad and I tried out for Big Brother. We got in but first we had to meet in groups of four and get acquainted. We were with another girl and a guy. The guy was next to me and looked like David (BB06) and was kind of hot. They told us stuff about themselves. Dad said his last name was spelled ""Goatse"" or something, but I thought he meant like David Bowie. I said ""My name is Izzy Conell, I'm 17 and in year 12 doing IB and next year I want to do forensics"". The guy got something out of my hair. There was some guy with no legs and he was dancing around and singing. He got rejected from the show. Then I was at school and in the middle of a class. Terrence was there. I didn't know if it was him at first but it was. Then we were on the computers and I signed in on Runescape and he looked me up on the high scores but kept misspelling my name. He added me. He said he hadn't seen me ""since that time at Mom's"". I remembered back and we were in bed and we were kissing and he was touching me and I was thinking 'why the hell did I do that?'. This teacher lady told me to get Biology homework and I said I'd give it to her tomorrow. Calvin and I were in some water on Runescape (though we were in it). I didn't want to go on the main land because it was in the wilderness. Ezra got a new GTA, but was in Al Kharid and it was all desert like and you couldn't use prayer in the wilderness part and Ezra was annoyed about it. We were then at Mom's and the computer was laggy. There was a warning siren, signaling a nuclear war. Mom got me back inside. I was trying to say that I just started watching Threads yesterday."
"2209"	"(2008-07-12 (17)) Others my age and I were being held in a camp which was at home. We all planned to escape and we were put into two groups -- the cows and the locusts. I was in the latter. We climbed over the garage and ran. This guy and I ran up the hill and hid behind a bush. I suggested it would look less dodgy if we were walking. Ezra called telling me to escape. I saw Mom's car and they had others in the car and we got in. We drove away. There was a Pseudo Echo St and Listening was playing on the radio. I said we weren't bad guys. I thought Mom was taking us back but she took us to a restaurant. Then I needed to pee. There were two little 'pee booths' and when you flushed it went into someone's mouth (there was a pub thing underground). The guy I was with called someone and I'd translated what he said, working out that he was bad. We went into this cinema. Two kids were taking food from the back room. I took a Milky Way. Mom, Ezra and others found it and they were taking stuff. The staff were coming and I warned them. I snuck out and asked the staff where the toilet was so it would seem like I was an innocent bystander, and then we had to make clothes to go to another camp. I wanted to escape."
"2210"	"(2008-07-13 (17)) Dad and I went to this place which had men stripping. I was wondering why the hell he brought me here and asked if we could leave. We walked and we chatted to this guy for a bit. Also the wife of the president took photos of him with some guy. We had to get frisked because of something about GTA 4. I saw the guy we were talking to in the car and when we got there he took some popcorn. He was planting evidence to say we had killed this lady. Later I was at Mom's and the middle room door wouldn't close and it was really creepy. It had been this girl's room, who was now dead."
"2211"	"(2008-07-14 (17)) I was at home which was really different. Ezra and a friend called Andrew had had a fight and there was danger of Andrew killing Ezra and Dad was friends with his father and they organized to meet up and discuss it. I had to go too. It was like 1 or 2am. I turned off the lights at home to leave. Andrew had an older brother, who was there. Then it was a game and people came. I got a sniper and was shooting (it was like GTA 4). The game had sold out and this shop needed more."
"2212"	"(2008-07-14 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom was there. We were there to do a drug deal. Then a fat blob (literally) came and we hid from it. I was with someone, who later was Calvin, and we were crawling and running from the blob. It caught up with us and said it had its stuff. I left. I was trying to call Mom to pick me up but she didn't answer. I was waiting outside and Evelyn was there and she said she'd get her car and get us."
"2213"	"(2008-07-15 (17)) I was on an island. It was nighttime. First it was in a building and this lady got given a gun. Later a demon/dragon was on the island chasing us. I ran into the building and up the stairs to the top level. Selena was there and she got a gun. It was at the window and she shot it, but it was ok. I ended up on the roof, in a room, with it. It wanted these sheets and I had just enough and then it decided it wanted 1000 more. I tried to say we needed to call someone. Then it was a game and I was reading the guide. There were two options for this part, I could ""romance it"" or kill it."
"2214"	"(2008-07-16 (17)) I was outside at this place. I don't know what it was. It was GTA 4 sometimes and I had taken my girlfriend on the game there. She didn't like it. Then there was a huge cop chase and so I spawned a car and Ezra, others and I got in and I driving it."
"2215"	"(2008-07-16 (17)) I was at a shop and it was someone's birthday and I was invited. I had to wear this yellow singlet and I asked Mom to get me some pants. It was 4.50pm and she wanted to go to these other shops before they closed. Then it was Jewel Staite's birthday and she was hugging and kissing everyone and I said ""happy birthday"". Then it was someone at school's birthday. I was surprised I had been invited and wondered why I came. I got my log book even though I didn't know how to park. There was a mistake on the certificate and it said ""Staite, Jewel"" instead of my name. I rewrote it. I was taking out plugs and took out my computers one by mistake."
"2216"	"(2008-07-17 (17)) Along with my usual 8 bird's nests on Runescape, I also got 7 ""Eloi"" seeds, which were worth 300k each, but they all sold for all 30 million. Then I was Clark (Smallville) and he suspected Lex (Smallville) of doing it to try and gain his trust."
"2217"	"(2008-07-17 (17)) I was at home. Eugene was over and he was in Ezra's room. I wanted to take photos of him, but it was too risky. I don't know why he was there."
"2218"	"(2008-07-18 (17)) I was at a shop. I was in this 'secret' room and I would climb through this hole into this other room with all this fun stuff in it. Next time I went I was with a guy. There was a teacher in this other room complaining at him. Rebekah was around and I called her a ""stupid ugly cow"" and she spazzed out. We hid in this place in the secret area that you could lock. There were four kids, each one with a different hair colour -- blond, brown, black and red."
"2219"	"(2008-07-18 (17)) I was arrested for some reason. I befriended this cop because he didn't think I did it and we liked each other. He was going to be interrogating me in this warehouse, alone. I had a jacket on which could shock me. I was tied to a chair and he untied me and we got in his car. I was thirsty and we went to this Chicken Treat which was in the middle of a country place (there was bush around). The people there grabbed you. I ordered popcorn chicken with sweet and sour sauce. Ezra and Dad were also there. We all sat together. Mom was then there and there was a song on the radio called Peaches, which was by some guy. Mom said it was a guy and a girl and something about David Cronenberg. Dad and I didn't know what the hell she was talking about. Some time earlier, Mom and a friend wanted to do a dance."
"2220"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) I was at Eugene's for some reason. His mother made these cookie things. She dropped them and I was picking them up. Eugene and his father Abraham asked how to spell my name. I spelt it out and they said ""we would've called you Katie Sophie"". There was a water container and we were refilling it. I was talking about Simba. We then had houses on the beach."
"2221"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) It was the first day back at school. I didn't want to go and Mom dropped me off at home so I could do something. Dad left. I decided to stay there, but ended up on a beach and there was a new waterslide in the middle of the sand."
"2222"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) I was watching the episode of Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction about the psychic girl [watched it last night] . The actors were different, but it showed the two 'popular' girls in the cinema with her and after the movie they could go to the party because they would be alright."
"2223"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) I went to a class and asked for everyone's notebook. There was a guy with a notebook and it had stuff about a movie called Take That and how it was a gay movie and he looked gay, so I let him keep it. I had met this guy from this event. He came into the class and someone said something about marriage and he got down on one knee and asked if I would marry him. I said ""me or the class?"" and he said ""you"". The class were clapping and then I kissed him."
"2224"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) Mom, Dad and I were in this cave, which was like a building, and they were telling me about oral sex. I was trying to tell them I didn't want to hear about it and they were demonstrating it on a replica of female genitals and it was really gross. I found this toy bear with lots of little sealed bags in its butt. They were pictures of people of who they thought had had oral sex. Nana and Granma were in there, along with celebrities too."
"2225"	"(2008-07-20 (17)) I was leaving 'school' with Ezra. I called Mom to ask if she was here yet because I needed her to look for some X-Files thing, but she was already there. I got in the car. I Wanna Be Your Dog was on two stations on the radio. I was reading That's Life and this girl won a date with David Duchovny. There was a video of it and he kept looking away from her and looked bored. I asked Ezra about the 24 parody with the day off and he said ""Is this your card?"" and I didn't understand and he said ""take it to the left"" and I realized what he was talking about. Ezra had broken stuff under his bed so it could get fixed."
"2226"	"(2008-07-20 (17)) Ezra was hitting me with this thing which would go into you and sting. I complained to Mom about it. I hit him with something."
"2227"	"(2008-07-20 (17)) I was at 'school'. I needed to find something I'd left behind on Monday, but I couldn't remember what I'd had last that day. Eventually I remembered it was chemistry and I was walking away. Ezra was staying behind for a study thing. Somehow I ended up in this class with other people, including Calvin. The teacher said girls who didn't take ""mith"" in Year 10, had to take it now, but I had (because of Runescape). Daryl found out that I had liked him and he said he liked me. I was trying to avoid him and I was annoyed that it wasn't Eugene. Porky was in her cage and she was still alive, which I thought was odd. Then I was at university and I had a text to meet them in a toilet -- it was Daryl. We left and went to some cafe place, but it got blown up. We were dressed in bear suits and went back to this other place. We had to clean it and wear these tight shirts. The lady called me fat."
"2228"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) There was this thing to get rid of insects, and you had to use more insects. There was a really infected house. At the end it was clean. The whole thing was a scam though."
"2229"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) There was a movie with Kiefer Sutherland when he was 14 and Elisha Cuthbert, who was 10 and I was showing Dad."
"2230"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) I was playing Sims 2, and Mario was in it and he had sex with this 'rock' (literally rock) woman."
"2231"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) I was in a car with Lex (Smallville). Something came up about never dying and he started going fast and crashed into this river to see if we would survive."
"2232"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) I was on Runescape and they changed something and I got attacked as I was going out and ended up on 0hp but I was still alive and out of food. Ezra was watching. I used the ectophial and got food. The banks were different. In 'real life' I was at these booths at the ""Jagex headquarters"" and some guy was in one near me. There was funny graffiti. This girl came. Then I was walking up these stairs with people following. Some guy was having a party. I waited outside and then left and joined these two guys. I was at school and I had text Mom earlier to pick me up because I forgot to have shower and straighten my hair. I had six messages. Genevieve was in a room and this guy told these people he was single and she said 'really' and he admitted that he was going out with her. I went outside and Mom was there."
"2233"	"(2008-07-22 (17)) I was driving with Mom and Ezra. We went to McDonald's. I think we were outside. We ordered a new ice-cream each plus one old one to share. There was music playing, which was all stuff from my playlist except Mama (Genesis) was in it. Ezra complained about the music and I said ""I chose this!"". Some guy was talking to Mom about ice-skating. I checked my downloads and I had a movie called Ficur Ng which was about talking monkeys that only say ""ficus"" [Watched Kiss Kiss Bang Bang yesterday] . I also had a Marx brother's movie and other stuff. I had 110 movies downloading in one day. Then I was in the car with Dad. He was going to go through a drive thru but it was full and every time we came back it was a huge line. One day he parked on the side of the road and it was getting dark and the guy at the gate went out to get food, so we couldn't get in. We went back to the car but this guy put something on it to say it couldn't be driven. He said the guy at the gate had paid him to. Then this fitness couple, who were Mario and Lisa from Big Brother UK, plus this old guy and a young girl, who was Stephanie from Big Brother UK were training to escape from some place. They pretended the guy was a part of the team but they knew he was a bad guy and had a secret plan. Lisa was pregnant. The place was really creepy and had lots of dry plants."
"2234"	"(2008-07-23 (17)) I was watching Big Brother. Ben was the only one I recognized. There was an ugly old lady on there (she was about 40) who was interested in Ben or this other, uglier guy. Ezra was like ""how the hell does she have a chance with Ben?"". This Big Brother wasn't letting them have any fun. They had a small TV and they weren't allowed to have one-on-one conversations. Then it wasn't Big Brother. This guy from the house took Ben and some guy to lunch at this restaurant. It was a big, shiny, black building with lots of windows. A van drove past, and the van along with the building had CRS on it [referencing The Game I suppose] . I couldn't remember where it was from. Then the guy left. They blew up the building from the top storey down. Ben and the guy decided to risk it and jumped out a window. They were ok and were relieved and then saw matches scattered around and so they ran. Every time they got away there would be more matches. They ran through this forest and throwing sticks behind them and I was also running with them. At the end of the path, which was then in a building, we turned around with sticks out to defend ourselves at the same time. No-one was there and we laughed. But then this guy started throwing random stuff and we had to do certain things to stop them. Then Ezra was there. There was a fast ball and this guy kicked it and I said ""Go Kenny!"". The guy thought for a minute and then rolled a slow ball, I missed it and everyone was wondering how and I said that I thought it was going to be fast and got confused and we laughed."
"2235"	"(2008-07-24 (17)) I was watching a movie with Ezra. I had seen it before. Leland Orser was in it and he lived in this huge house. I remembered he had died and become psycho or something, but after that (he got killed by a ghost) it was real and I was there. I had met him before and he decided to leave his stuff to me. I went there and saw him sitting on the stairs. He said hello and he asked ""You're dead?"" and I said ""You're alive?"". He said that ghosts could make things happen (turn lights on and off etc). I went to bed there and he staying with me for some reason. He got in the bed and I went to lock up. I went back and he said something to me and I turned on the lamp and said ""ow""."
"2236"	"(2008-07-24 (17)) I was on Myspace or some similar site and I was looking for Eugene, but I looked for his birthday -- 8 January 1991."
"2237"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) I was at a warehouse like place. I needed to go somewhere and Dad, Poppa and I left in a van. They had to drive it a weird way and no-one knew how to drive it. Poppa sat on the roof. I said ""what about Matt Frewer?"" because he was back at the warehouse. So we went back and got him. Other people came with us. I was then at a shop, which was Mom's. I accidentally brought a hat through those things that beep to warn when someone hasn't paid for something, and it beeped and a security guard came and I said ""I work here"" and he made me fill out a form about what had happened. I was on my laptop and it was going slow. Silas was there. There was a quiz and he had Leon as one of his favourite movies. There was a girl, who was sometimes my daughter, who broke her leg. I was thinking if I had a boy I would make the middle name Edward, because it was Michael Palin's middle name. I was then at school and there was an obstacle course. Sometimes it was at home. There were ten swings and a slide in the way. I was digging underground and there were rabbits, rats and guinea pigs. I asked Nana for garden gloves and they were made from a bra, and so had a squishy thumb. There were some Asian people there. This lady was asleep in Dad's bed. I was looking for something and Hungry Like the Wolf was playing and this girl turned it off and I kicked her out of my room."
"2238"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) I was at a shop for an excursion for school. Calvin and I were following Evelyn and Darius around and laughing. There was a machine with balls with fortune telling readings on them. They were all stuff to do with us and we got all of them out. One of them said ""Eugene loves me"" and there was one about Evelyn and Darius, and me and Eugene. I kept it. Barack Obama was in an aisle and someone said ""Isn't that the president?"". Ezra was talking to him. People were lining up and this ball shot out of the machine and this guy put them all in a bag and I was going to keep them, but he put them in a bin. We were waiting for him to leave, but he didn't (he didn't want us to get them), then when he thought we weren't looking he moved the bag. Later the guy turned the power off. Calvin and I quickly went through all the bins and I found the bag. Everyone started gathering outside and someone said Evelyn, Darius and Eugene were missing. I got a torch and said I'd find them. I heard breathing in a dark, quiet end of the store and found Tigger and Simba in a shelf. I told them to come out and I kept looking and found Gizmo, who was actually Eugene, and we all left."
"2239"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) There was something about Robert Downey Jr, and his first name was actually Richard."
"2240"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) Mom got a message to steal some cars from a library. This lady would always leave her alone with the car and then Mom would drive out with them. The fourth time, the car was really fast and I was hanging on the back of it. We got to her house, which was different. She had bought some small bits of land at this park. There was a tiny area, like 5m by 2m. She needed money later to help Granma and got a message to steal a car, but it was at someone's house so she didn't. I said it was like GTA 4."
"2241"	"(2008-07-26 (17)) I had been staying at this person's house pretending to be someone else. I had brought my Wii there. Mom and Ezra came over and she pretended she was my driving instructor and I was packing my stuff together and Ezra and Mom helped me get the stuff into the car. Then some others and I were on the run. People on these boats were shooting at us (we were at like a park). This girl and I ended up swimming under this bridge. We swam to the next city. There was something about Cloverfield. Then I was at school, but it was different. I was outside and there were stalls around and it was all on a big field (no buildings were in sight). Elijah and Autumn were there. Elijah was giggling. Some guy asked Autumn if she remembered him, but she didn't. They had slept together. She had slept with Elijah too. I went to the canteen and there was a Twix, which I really wanted but it was $8, so I decided not to get it. Then Mom bought me one from a drive thru."
"2242"	"(2008-07-27 (17)) We had an excursion. I was taking photos with my phone but they came out straight away. Eugene and Darius were staying quite close to me. There was a tunnel with water and the head of the Statue of Liberty. Samantha and I took a photo. I had photos of Eugene. We all sat down and Calvin sat next to me and was joking about Evelyn and Darius. I went to put the photos on the computer."
"2243"	"(2008-07-27 (17)) Granny had a house by herself and I was there. It was really hot. She gave me a muffin but it was too hot, and she told me to wrap it up and put it on the toilet. She went to bed. I walked out of the kitchen and Alec Baldwin was there. He was friends with Granny. I text Dad saying there was a Baldwin here."
"2244"	"(2008-07-29 (17)) I was watching Big Brother UK. I was telling Dad about a couple in there who pretended that the female half was pregnant. They got Kylie Minogue in there. She was in there for a while when she got called to the diary room, but had to go through this other room which was full of obstacles and tunnels. David Tennant helped her escape and she ran. Hugh Laurie got up and said something, but she was gone. There were lots of blocks. Then she got back and Big Brother said that she was allowed to stay in the house. People were having an argument. David Tennant was there and he said ""Look, calm down"" and saw everyone looking at him, so to take the attention away from himself, he said something about Georgie, a contestant in the show and also the guy from Summerstorm. A lady in the house got a laptop so she could write a diary. Then it was my laptop. I had to say that I wouldn't use it to meet or annoy ""Michael Robert Downey"" and it was actually Michael Palin, but it said Downey for some reason. It kept changing colour based on what I was thinking. It went green, orange, light blue and black."
"2245"	"(2008-07-29 (17)) I was outside at school, I think. Eugene and a guy in front of me were talking about smoking. Darius was smoking. I was thinking 'what are you doing Eugene! Don't smoke!'. There was a girl there with an attitude problem."
"2246"	"(2008-07-29 (17)) There was an interview with that Michael Owen guy and he was scared of the dark and had agoraphobia. It was a really random interview."
"2247"	"(2008-07-30 (17)) I was at a shop. Ezra and Mom were there too. Mom came to get chips. Dad had gotten a divorce from Nana and Poppa and I was wondering why he would do that. Darius was trying to sell stuff. Ezra had some scales. I spilt money all over Darius's back and then I was picking it up. Midge Ure was playing a piano. When I got near it, he finished and Ezra was talking to me and said ""you have dreams?"" and I said ""yeah"" and he said something and I was annoyed and he said ""and dreams about that gran vienetta son"" and I laughed and the guy who sings it was right there and he pushed me so my butt would be in Midge's face. This red haired guy called Rex was around and he reminded me of Brucie from GTA 4."
"2248"	"(2008-07-30 (17)) We were at school and had sport. Mr Reilly was teaching us and he lagged and got there late. We had to wear a white shirt. I was getting changed and the shirt was too small. I was putting my Spongebob shirt on, and Mr Reilly was coming to I told him to stay away as I had no shirt on. I said I didn't have to play anyway because I had screwy knees. Everyone was on a huge basketball court. Alyssa and Rebekah were there. Then it was raining and Evelyn was next to me. Autumn was also there. I had been there for a while and I thought something was going to happen. It was then dark and this lady walked into the rain and started biting people and they turned into zombies. We ran and then were in a shop. I ended up with Eugene and some others. Calvin was there too. I was trying to call Mom on my phone and this guy saw me with it. She was in the area so was going to come and get me. The guy was going to take it and I started hitting him. I smashed a window with a water bottle to get out. I was walking down a street with some people and there was a baby, which had been killed and had a spanner in its head and there was blood everywhere. I went to the carpark and Mom came and I got in the car and I was trying to tell her what was happening. She was laughing about it. There were cars pulled over on the road. There was blood everywhere and zombies. They were blue and their arms were weird. Mom said ""well, at least the roads are faster"". I was wondering why I had left Eugene."
"2249"	"(2008-07-30 (17)) There were zombies and they had taken over and there weren't many people left. There weren't really any laws anymore, ie people drove however they wanted to. There was a family of three women, one of which had refused to move in a few days. The other one got angry and sent her to her room. They didn't keep their door locked and one locked it and then an alarm for zombies sounded and they bolted out this other door into a hall, with other units and ran to a carpark and into a caravan they had. Also, Mom and Darren had bought a caravan. Then it had been me living there and I ended up at this place where they housed lots of people. I had a room under a bunk. Calvin visited once. There was a guy pretending to be a different nationality because certain nationalities weren't allowed. I was hoping that Eugene would turn up. I had gone back to the house and there were zombies everywhere so I was killing a few. I was then in a dark alley with Ezra and it was sometimes GTA 4. I couldn't spawn a car and there were zombies around, who were starting to get anxious."
"2250"	"(2008-07-31 (17)) I saw a bit of some bad movie and this guy had a male and a female guard standing on a rocky ledge. The whole place was outside, and was rocky. There was a big ditch next to it. There was this other guy with them who was very flamboyant and gay. Something started controlling the guards and they walked off the edge, killing them. One of them got replaced by Steve Sandvoss. This girl on the internet was in love with him and she was 15. I was then at some place with Mom and Ezra. There was a TV show and something was getting killed on it. Giovanni was on it in his leaver's jacket and said ""is it live?"" and he was going to be in some movie. Then we were there and it was a Friday the 13th movie, except Robert Englund was in it. Someone decided that I was going to be the first guy to be killed and Giovanni was the girl. The place it was set at was not far away and we were walking there. The actor playing the killer, was actually a killer, and I said ""do you really trust him?"", but we had no choice but to go there. The room we went to was really green and had some red/brown in it."
"2251"	"(2008-07-31 (17)) Nana made some food for me. I wasn't feeling well. She gave me some chicken. Aunt Sally was there. I told Mom I thought I caught Austin's cold."
"2252"	"(2008-07-31 (17)) Calvin and I, and possibly others, had built an inside swimming pool at school (which was different). It was for Year 12's only and there was no private shower or toilet. We hadn't gotten anything for doing it. Calvin, some others and I were swimming. I said something and Calvin said ""yeah, Eugene"". My bag was in the water. There were 'hoses' hanging from the ceiling that you could swing on, although you weren't allowed to. I was naked and was swinging from one. Some younger people told a teacher and Mr Willingham came and asked who did it and I put my hand up. I got my bag and some of my stuff was in the water, but it was ok. My phone, keys and iPod had been cloned. Somehow I had a time machine and Calvin, someone and I went back to 2003. We were at a shop and everything was really cheap, so we decided to buy heaps of chocolate and we did. There was a $200 bar of chocolate. We were buying it on these cards we had. We eventually ran out of money and we left. We only had a small amount of time to stay there."
"2253"	"(2008-08-01 (17)) I was with the school at a cinema. You could make the seats higher. Some people went to a different room for a while. Eugene was in the second row behind me. We were going to watch The Dark Knight. I was on IMDb and it was number two now and I was like ""Yay! It's not number one anymore!"". It's rating was now a 9.4 and less people had given it a 10. I was extremely happy that people had come to their senses and given it a lower rating. [I checked its rating in the morning, and it had actually gone down] ."
"2254"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) Someone was saying that I was one of the few people who checked up on previous Big Brother contestants, pointing out Tim Brunero as an example. Someone checked up to see who he was sleeping with, including myself, but he wasn't sleeping with anyone. I was at Mom's, then I was at school and I had an accounting test. Ezra had some test results. Ms Pascal saw my phone and gave me this other thing to use instead. Someone said ""I'm John Lennon"". There was a video on Youtube of Kevin Spacey, but it was actually a photo of him."
"2255"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) I was at school and Calvin called me to ask if it was a pupil free day tomorrow. I said yes and then said no. I had a text from Evelyn asking the same thing and I said no again and then said ""sorry, yes I got confused"". At the end of the day, I was waiting for Mom at a different spot. I went to the other side of the road and Eugene was there. Mom walked up to me and said she parked the car somewhere else. Eugene was playing with a manhole lid. Mom said to him ""be careful"" and introduced herself and Eugene was looking at us."
"2256"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) I was at school in the library. Indians were in there praying. This guy came in and threatened to let off a bomb. I left. I was in a shop, when the bomb went off. Darren had this electronic map game thing. This president guy made me make the decision to do something about the guy. Someone offered me coffee and I said that I didn't like coffee."
"2257"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) I was on IMDb and the rating of The Dark Knight was 9.5 and it was still number one and all the other movies in the list were random, new ones that wouldn't ever be in the Top 250. I was thinking that all these teenage idiots must've been rating all these lame movies because of The Dark Knight. I was annoyed that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was now nowhere to be found."
"2258"	"(2008-08-03 (17)) Before Batman Begins had come out, there had been a TV show with Christian Bale playing Batman. I watched a bit and saw him (I hadn't been sure it had Christian Bale in it). I was then at Mom's and Austin was singing Yellow Submarine. Ezra was there too and I was discussing something with him. These two guys, who were friends, were at some place and they fell in love. Then I was one of them and was hiding under a bed. There were lots of beds around, with beds underneath them."
"2259"	"(2008-08-05 (17)) Mom picked me up from school early. We went to the shop and I was in my leaver's jacket. I saw Ezra. He motioned to Mr Noonan, who was in the shop, and I shrugged. Then Mom came and started yelling at Ezra for wagging."

"2261"	"(2008-08-06 (17)) I was at home, and it was in the morning before school, filling up water bottles and there weren't any in the fridge I could take to school. I filled one up with cold water but it had a dead fly at the bottom. Dad came to get a drink. I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone and this guy and his girlfriend/wife lived in a small, stingy apartment thing. He kept his brother in a room behind his closet. He would only let him sleep when he had a bath and could only have a bath when he did. He wasn't allowed out of his room either. He had a brown rug to lie on. The other guy's wife was tan and had dirt on her face. Something happened with the police and so they all left. The brother who was locked away, dobbed his brother into the police for freedom and got interrogated by some guy who pretended that he was going to kill him. This black guy smacked him around for a bit. The guy's wife told him to hurry and said urgently, ""I'm doing it"". These insects came out of somewhere and they were really bad effects and there was also a bad effects rat. Some creature hissed. I was then at home and Dad was watching Gone with the Wind and the 'chapter' was 2.37. Dad was talking to Ezra about lynching."
"2262"	"(2008-08-06 (17)) I was writing down a dream about Robert Downey Jr., where he had been at Nana's (which was totally different), looking through these photo albums. He had also been driving really fast. I couldn't remember if I'd written it down or not. [When I woke up, I thought it was a dream I'd had, until a week later when I went through them and realized it wasn't] ."
"2263"	"(2008-08-07 (17)) I was looking up stuff about The Monkees [there was a biography show thing on TV last night] and first the internet wasn't working. My computer was on the table. Dad was in the family room and Ezra was around. Then the net was working and I told them it was working again. The only Monkee I recognized was Davy Jones. I was trying to find some other band, but I couldn't remember the songs I wanted to download from them or The Monkees. I was on a site which had autographs and interviews and it was local. There was one with Al Pacino and his wife was called Diane and there was a photo from Scarface."
"2264"	"(2008-08-07 (17)) Calvin came over with my leaver's jacket, but it had ""No. 1 No.1"" written on it. He did it as a joke. I was then at school, in class. Eugene was in there. I heard some old recordings of mine coming over the speakers. I bolted out of the class to this room where this girl with a black cloth thing on her head was sitting at the desk. I threw stuff at her. I asked the principal to turn it off. I had had a dream about it happening."
"2265"	"(2008-08-08 (17)) I was at Mom's but when I left the room it was home. Something happened and I asked about why it was important to remember stuff about 'snow scraping'' and something for school. Darren said something and then said ""it's like 10 minutes from here"". I went to put my dinner in the microwave. Dancing in the Storm was playing. This crack appeared in the carpet in the living room. I went outside and told Mom. Mom told me to fix it. I aimed the microwave away, as the radiation had cracked the ground, which was now like ice, and it was dangerous."
"2266"	"(2008-08-09 (17)) I was at school in English. My desk was facing the back of the classroom, and three girls, including Josephine, some other girl I knew and this new girl who was ugly and chubby. They were talking about someone who they thought was ugly, and the way they were talking and looking at me, I figured it was me. Josephine said ""and all that fat"" and I looked up and they were looking at me. The new girl called me ugly and I said ""look at yourself"". She was like ""at least I'm not as fat as you"" and I said ""At least I don't look like you"". I got angry and so picked up her desk and pushed her back. I picked it up again and hit her with it then I left. Ezra was in a class outside and Ms Madsen was telling me to stay in after class. I said that I was going to call Mom to go home. Ezra followed me and I told him off. I was saying that ""teenagers are stupid"". I called Mom and she said she would come and get me."

"2269"	"(2008-08-09 (17)) I was on the computer on a game, except I was playing it out live, and it showed red and green dots. It was in this street, except it was in abandoned village. I jumped across a building. I was on top of the building and bad guys were gathering around on the ground. I was shooting at them. Others came and we finished them off. This gate was open and we left and were trying to find some information. Elijah found this room with ""our homework"" in it. This teacher person came. Then we were in a carpark and we had to put things on our heads so we didn't get wet, then it was raining. Ezra was there. A car of someone who was bad came. I can't read the rest of my notes."
"2270"	"(2008-08-10 (17)) I was at Mom's and we were having dinner. Ezra was being slow. Mom and Darren were at the table. We had gnocchi and they put hardly any on my plate so I asked for more and Darren did. We put sauce on it. Someone said something about West Virginia and where it was near and Darren was singing Wheeling West Virginia and I was like ""Yeah, I think, what are the lyrics for that damn song?"" and Darren was like ""I was just joking"". I said something back that I can't remember."
"2271"	"(2008-08-10 (17)) I was in class, in English. The class was different and I was at the very back. Ms Madsen had assigned leaders for something and they got these black coats to wear. The leader names were 'wind, earth, water and fire (me)'. I was putting the coat on and these people were watching me and laughing so I went out of the class to put it on. It was tight, so I took it off. This girl said they were laughing because of the ""fat around your elbow"". Fatima was next to me. Eugene came in to the class wearing a suit with a red tie as a costume for his class. He had a ring on and an earring and I was really annoyed. The girls kept bothering me and I got annoyed and said ""so what? Why is that funny?"". I pinched her cheeks hard and said that she had fat there. I threw something and it hit Johanna and I said ""Sorry, didn't mean to hit you"" and she got up and tried to attack me. There was a whiteboard at the front of the class. I tried to poke her in the eye with some pointy object, but I only did it gently, because it hurt my eye and it wouldn't go through anyway. I gave up and ended up knocking her out. I left with Fatima. My phone broke and I text ""smile"" and then ""... or not"". People were after us. People on the street could turn into them (like The Matrix). There weren't many people around though. I got into a car."
"2272"	"(2008-08-11 (17)) I needed to go to the shop for some reason. I drove by myself but had my L-plates on. Ezra was with me, but he ended up driving instead. He reverse parked, but had a bit of trouble. We only had $1 but they had a deal for two lamingtons for a dollar so I got that."
"2273"	"(2008-08-12 (17)) I was at some friend of Dad's place. We were on Hotties, on my account. I was worried about typing in my password but figured it was just Facebook. They had a young daughter who was really munted looking and one side of her head was big. She was crying. We went home and my money on Hotties transferred to Dad's account, because his friend had stolen my password."

"2276"	"(2008-08-12 (17)) I was in the bathroom and I turned my head a certain way and I could see an enlarged view of inside my right nostril. It was gross and dirty and scabby and I was thinking that must be what's wrong with it. I couldn't get the view back again."
"2277"	"(2008-08-13 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I went to this shop like place. There was ice-cream which looked glow in the dark at first. This lady made us one. It was cookies and cream and was nice. There were these robot hairdresser arms. Then I was at a house. I had to leave so I pretended to storm out angrily (I wasn't allowed to leave) and I jumped into the car. I was someone else sometimes. I was combining photos of people and I did Evelyn and Darius. I had recent photos of people at school. I showed Ezra. Mom disappeared and went to this place for bad adults which was next to a place for bad kids. She got out to deal with some killer person. There was some flaming Indian thing. Someone asked this person on a horse how he could only stay with one girl. Something happened that was actually a joke and had something to do with radios in 1980."
"2278"	"(2008-08-14 (17)) Dad was staying out late and Mom wouldn't pick me and Ezra up. I decided to make some food. We had a new microwave in the cupboard where the toaster shelf is. I put food in it and went to my room. I was thinking that I should return the microwave and get a toaster instead. Later, Ezra said he smelled something burning and I remembered about my food. I went out and it was all smoky. The cupboard the microwave was in was burning. Ezra turned it off. We panicked and tried to call Mom. She wasn't answering. Later, I was with Mom and Ezra. Dad was in his van except it wasn't him. Mom got us a new microwave, which was huge and old looking; I said it looked ""30 years old"". We went to the shop and got a mudcake and a lamington. She was asking about some robotic thing for Darren."
"2279"	"(2008-08-16 (17)) I was at school in this underground area near the canteen (which was bigger). There was a desk thing and Eugene and two others were on there. I sat down another time. I had to sit behind Eugene and someone. I went into the office, which was different, and I had my iPod and Shake It was playing. There was a book with records of all the students and the guy had the page open to Eugene. He had done well in something and got 99.8 in it. I had biology and I saw Evelyn and said hello and asked what she had [talked to her for the first time since May yesterday] ."
"2280"	"(2008-08-17 (17)) I was somewhere that was possibly school. This guy's girlfriend was on the phone talking to a guy and they made plans to meet up and have sex. I tried to tell my friend without telling him, that they were supposed to have lunch together. I was having lunch with him. Later, we were doing an experiment in chemistry and we were supposed to use the Bunsen burner but some people didn't and they got sick and I didn't. Later people were turning into vampires randomly. I was also in the middle of turning, and it took a while. Elijah was in the street. I went into the sun and sparkled (like in Twilight). I could smell blood."
"2281"	"(2008-08-17 (17)) I was at school and Calvin was there and had come back from his trip earlier than expected. Eugene and Darius were near us and he said something about me and ""Swamp Boy"". Later, I was at a park with Farrah. We went across the road to this little rollercoaster and I remembered going on it when I was younger. We climbed up and Farrah went for a ride but I realized I wasn't going to fit on it, so I went to climb down. Ariana was on the ladder and she wouldn't go back down. I was going to fall, so I pushed the ladder and she fell, but I had done it in a way that she wouldn't get seriously hurt. Dad put it back up and I got down."
"2282"	"(2008-08-17 (17)) I was at a carpark. Eugene and some others were there. There were smashed computers everywhere."
"2283"	"(2008-08-18 (17)) I had a sea lion. Poppa had something to do with it. We were moving it somewhere bigger. We were chucking it in the air and we could see a brown thing in the clouds and it moved in flashes. I showed Mom. I asked if it was going to go to her pool, but she said no as she was keeping the sea lion a secret. I don't know where it ended up. Later it was night and I went to the shop. This car stopped in my way and I had to get in. There were two guys in there and they asked me some questions. They then let me out, but there were these other guys. It was misty and one of them said ""we like mist"". I ended up in this weird town. This girl kidnapped us, but she had a shower and I escaped. This guy friend of mine had already escaped and I caught up with him. This Asian boy had raped this girl and was standing in this hut thing looking away from me. There was a spaceship thing and there were three guys. We all had to pair up. We were all in suits. I found this guy I had been looking for and we went into this capsule and got sent to the ground. He was then Peter Weller, and I didn't think he was going to survive, but he did."
"2284"	"(2008-08-19 (17)) I was at Westland University looking for apartments. I asked this lady if I had to fill out a form and she was being really difficult. Mom came. The apartments were nice and you could get fresh slippers brought to you every day, but I didn't get the point of it."
"2285"	"(2008-08-19 (17)) We had an excursion and went to some famous dead artist's place in this old abandoned town. There were old buildings in the town. When we got into the artist's place, there were animal costumes and I put on a llama outfit. There were also statues and things around. We went into this elevator, which was on the outside of the building and it started shaking and I said ""We should've taken the stairs"". Selena had this other animal costume on and we were pretending to be a couple and were taking photos together, but they all turned out blurry. We were then playing some pass the parcel game and I was next to Eugene. We had to all put our arm around the people next to us and so Eugene had his arm around me and I was extremely nervous about it. He fell asleep, but his arm slipped off and he woke up. Nana was also around. We were staying in a room that was really high up (the building was really tall). We had to climb up this ladder and there was a secret password. Eugene, Shen and I were staying in a room. These bad guys were coming and Shen said ""oh no"". I was looking in my sandwich to see what I had."
"2286"	"(2008-08-19 (17)) I was with Mom in the car and this cop guy pulled us over. He was talking to us and then I said ""I feel like some Grand Theft Auto"". The cop ran off to his car and got on his walkie-talkie thing and I called out ""No! I meant the game!""."
"2287"	"(2008-08-20 (17)) I was at school in Accounting. The seats were back to normal. I was next to Elijah though. I got results on a certificate for four of my subjects which were out of '10%'. For Chemistry and something else I got 0%. I ripped up the certificate."
"2288"	"(2008-08-20 (17)) I was talking to a werewolf. Vampires also existed. I was angry and was trying to stop them from doing something."
"2289"	"(2008-08-21 (17)) I was on a street. Ezra and I were trying to get somewhere. This evil guy was around and Ezra and I ended up in this alley thing. The evil guy got in and half killed me, but once he left I was fine. He got six bags of blood from someone. I tried to call Mom but I got no answer. We left the place. Later I was in a building, but cars also drove through it. I saw Eugene's father Abraham and he let me through. I saw Eugene later and he had this thing on his ear, which I realized was something that he was using to listen to some sports thing. This guy was going through my pencil case. He didn't say anything to me. Alejandro, Jeremiah and Darius were yelling about something. Thuy called Eugene 'Mickey'. One of them said something like ""Eugene would've had more to say in a convo especially since Alejandro didn't know much"". Darius was swearing in Macedonian. There was this other evil guy who had light brown hair and brown eyes. He had bushy eyebrows which were angled down, like he was angry. He could easily swap his hair around. He made his eyebrows normal and he was pretty good-looking. I was a car with him later trying to trick him. Lillian, some others and I were in some photos. I had made a face accidentally in one of them. There were other photos of kittens."
"2290"	"(2008-08-22 (17)) This girl and guy had been sleeping together for a while, but they were keeping it a secret. Her actual boyfriend, who looked like a young Hugh Laurie, decided to sleep with some other girl. She was outside this motel looking place and he was in one of the rooms. She saw him having sex with her and she was calling him a retard. Then it was me. I went to this other room and a young James Spader was naked on the bed, but was covered up with a blanket. I sat on the bed with him. We were hugging and my legs were on his legs (which were hairy). He was stroking my legs, which were also hairy and I said ""I couldn't be bothered [shaving] "". He then had grey shorts on and I was wondering how he got them on. I think he could go to the past sometimes. He had this radio from the past. I got McDonald's breakfast and dropped it off to these people, but I had forgotten some. I was going to give it to them tomorrow. Later, Ezra and Dad had been in a small accident, they came back in the back of a small Ute. The doctors had thought Ezra might be pregnant. Mom was hanging up my underwear on a line outside the building, she said ""there might be sperm in one of them"" and I said ""ew"". I was at school and Mr Reilly had done a family tree of me, he was pointing out ""Tommy Conell"". Alejandro said something about an ""arch of life"". There was a photo of my room when it was clean and Jemma said ""What's that on the roof?"" and I said ""That's my floor"". She thought my room was messy. Mittens and Tigger were in a photo. Eugene was in the class. I was going through my phone and Ms Quintana was in my contacts. I was telling Calvin later as I didn't know how she got on there."
"2291"	"(2008-08-23 (17)) I was watching a movie, except it wasn't, which was like a sequel of Children of the Corn. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) was in it. Granma was pregnant. Smudgy and some other cats were in this cage, which was like a glass container. There was a pig in one too. We took something out of a smaller container and I asked why we didn't let Smudgy out. Smudgy didn't like this guy called Jacob, which reminded me of Twilight. Somehow we saw a glimpse of the future and a fire was going to burn the whole world. We realized that someone had done something in Gatlin. Eli, some others and I went there. There were kids infected with corn and we got them to leave. If they were infected with corn, they would burn better there. Eli randomly turned into a tomato on the path. Granma apologized and he turned back and said in a weird voice, ""apology accepted"". Ezra found this scene of Twilight on Youtube, which went for 8 minutes. I said it was ""still stalking me"". It showed Edward and Alice (from the movie) and I said that the actors chosen suited the role. Rosalie (actress from the movie) was driving and I said she didn't."
"2292"	"(2008-08-24 (17)) I looked out of my window to see the moon like two squished ovals on top of each other (see diagram). I was on the phone to Mom and she was watching it. It went white and then close but then it flew back and I got off the phone and it turned fuzzy and red around the edge and then filled in and looked like the sun. I told Dad and Ezra that they should look. It got closer. Dad said he would look when he got something (he was on his laptop). I said ""We're going to die"". I was then thinking that I had to see Eugene. Then there were aliens in the sky and the Earth was shooting back at them. I decided that they were after Ezra. They shot back at us and my door got shot to pieces and it had metal framing which was hanging off. They came to the house. Some of them were squeaky and looked like mice. They were also really fast and I couldn't catch them. I managed to get a few and was hitting them with one of those cake server things but they would just squish a little and not get hurt, so I started flinging them into the air. I gave some other aliens, which were more human-like some cake, which was really nice. I gave them popcorn too. They were joking around with us and I was trying to tell them that Ezra wasn't here. There was a friendly mouse thing called ""Chit"". Ezra and I were later watching TV. Robert Pattinson was on there and I said ""he's in that stupid movie I have to see"". Ezra misunderstood what I said and said ""he's the reason why you want to see it?""."
"2293"	"(2008-08-25 (17)) Calvin had sent me a text saying ""it was subtle"" and I didn't know what he was talking about. I ended up having a baby and it turned out, as I found out from Ezra, that I'd had sex with Silas. I then remembered deciding to have sex, but couldn't remember why. I drove somewhere by myself and I had the baby with me. Mom yelled at me for having it with me."
"2294"	"(2008-08-25 (17)) There were 10 kittens and I had to pick one to keep. Mom had bought all of them. Four of them were just circles. I could hear one of the kitten's thoughts. Someone was saying how they could see something and then not remember it. I can't remember what he said properly."
"2295"	"(2008-08-25 (17)) I was watching Tropic Thunder and it showed Ben Stiller in the war outfit, dirty and bloody and lying on the ground. Tom Cruise was dancing."
"2296"	"(2008-08-26 (17)) I was in science. Lucia was there and she was saying to move the desks around so that Elijah and I would be facing the back wall (she was being mean). I said ""suck my balls noob"" and Jeremiah and Bradley laughed. Bradley was saying to Eugene ""Did you hear what Izzy called Jess? She called Jess a noob"". Eugene said ""I like it"" or something."
"2297"	"(2008-08-27 (17)) I was at Nana's. I had my Gameboy stuff there. I had slept there. Dad was there. I called Mom to get me at 2pm -- it was 1pm now. Poppa and some others wanted to sit at the table so I sat in the lounge and Aunt Sally was down there. All these flies/bugs suddenly covered the windows and inside [I watched the bug episode of Supernatural last night] . To get rid of them, you had to breed them with other coloured bugs and they would suddenly disappear. We were running through the house, breeding them (it was instantaneous). There were four cars outside and the bugs had eaten three of the engines. The other car was older and had a different thing instead of the engine. Ezra, Dad, Poppa and I drove to this friend of Poppa's, the first path was blocked off and so we went a different way. I accidentally killed him with a stick. I checked the time and it was 3.18pm, so I called Mom to remind her to pick me up."
"2298"	"(2008-08-28 (17)) Dad and I were in a car discussing a movie. I was telling him I interpreted some of the stuff and he was amazed at the interpretations I had made. I had been invited to some house. It was night. When we got there though, Dad wasn't there and this other guy turned up. He was saying to me to pretend it was a horror movie and we were discussing the things not to do, so you don't get killed. There was a long empty patch of land next door, which looked quite creepy. He pointed to it as an example of not leaving the group and doing things alone and I said ""and don't have sex"". We joined the others at the back of the house. There was a chubby girl, who was the leader of it, and she said we weren't allowed turn our backs (so we had to look at someone) or we would be killed. This wasn't her fault though. The guy and I managed to look next door and all these people were dead on the ground and were a green colour. Everyone who had played this game had died. We realized that everyone died the same way and that there was a killer involved. We decided to leave before the killer came and so we jumped over the fence we had come in through. As we did, this taxi drove off. We walked instead and found these bridges, which were Asian like and they ended up getting really thin. It was also daytime now. There was one obstacle thing and Ezra was there and we needed to cross these bridges while singing David Bowie songs, and Ezra didn't know any. A long time later, the guy I with or someone else and I went back to the house and the police were there. There was a lady who made me write a note for some guy and I signed it ""Love [as a loveheart] Jacob"". Jacob was a werewolf. Dean and Sam (both Supernatural) were there."
"2299"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) I was in accounting and we had a test. The class was smaller. I got distracted by the teacher, who was Ms Madsen (but sometimes was someone else) and only ended up doing one of the many questions. Darius and Michael (and the rest) were sitting at these desks front of me. I had accidentally hit Darius and he went to the nurse. When he came back he said ""I had to get a test"" and Eugene laughed at him. Eugene asked me a question and came and sat next to me for me to answer, but then got interrupted by his friends. I saw Alejandro outside, walking to the classroom and I went to open the door, but it was already open."
"2300"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) Ms Pascal accused me of having a phone and I yelled at her for not believing me when I said I didn't. Eugene and the rest were laughing. [Yesterday I had felt sick, and she didn't believe me] ."
"2301"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) Eugene said ""If I hear that Nickelback song one more time, I'm throwing this [ring] away"". I wanted the song to come on so that he did."
"2302"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) Mom was going to let me have the day off school, but then Dad and Ezra pulled up at her house. Ezra stayed, but Dad left. We went to McDonald's to get food. Calvin was there and this other girl. I put my leg out and she almost tripped. I said ""sorry, automatic reaction"" and she said that it didn't even move and then some allusions to me being fat. This guy was singing and I was videoing it with my phone. Brianna took my phone because she wanted to do it. Later, the girl and along with Melodie and others were with me. She called me fat and I said ""at least I don't look like you"" and she said ""you're ugly too"". I said ""I can lose weight, but you're stuck with that face"" and that she ""looks like a rat that has been hit in the face with a shovel 1700 times"". She was Asian looking, with dark skin and was ugly. She looked at me incredulously. I was then threatening her with a butter knife. I asked Calvin to get me a sharper one and in a high pitched voice he said ""a sharper one?"". I got one myself and placed the point above her knee. I didn't think I would be able to stab her as it would be hard to get through and also that I would feel uncomfortable, but I stabbed her in the knee anyway and it went through easy and I felt fine. She screamed. I stabbed this pen too and the ink ran out into a bin. I tried not to get ink on my leaver's jacket. I planned to kill her but let the others go."
"2303"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) I was out the front of home and there were lots of kittens near the garage. I was trying to put them in the garage, but there were so many and they kept getting out. I started putting them in boxes instead. This guy was there and I said ""damn, an adult is left"". He reminded me of REM for some reason and then later I found something with Everybody Hurts on it. We got all the kittens in the garage, but I had to leave. In case he closed the shutters and took over the place I was hesitant to leave. Eventually I said ""you promise"" and he agreed and I left to get water and a light. When I came back he had closed them. I opened the bottom of one of them and he popped his head out and I aimed and squirted water in his face and said that I'd shoot his kittens, but he had a gun and shot them himself. The kittens ended up letting me in. Light was shining in my face. The kittens were now people and they killed him. I told the kittens not to go near the pool. Then I was watching a movie and Jason Bateman was in it and he was keeping zombies in his garage. All the zombies were kids or teenagers and they were just like people. His garage was fancy and looked like a house. He had a bed in there and these two zombies (girl and a guy) were on a couch under a blanket. Jason Bateman's character's father said ""is that the guy-,"" and saw the girl zombie pop her head out. And he said something like ""you and that girl"". I liked the way the garage had transformed and so liked the movie."
"2304"	"(2008-08-30 (17)) There were cats in the bathroom, hiding. I heard a noise and I followed it. It was coming from under Dad's bed. Ezra said there was a cat under there. Cuddles was under there. I went to my room and put her on my bed. I saw a dark green/black snake like thing slithering under my stuff on the floor. Poppa and Dad were out the back and I asked them how to kill it. I described it and they freaked out. Poppa, in which I think was an attempt to get me to leave the house, asked if I wanted food and I said ""No, Mom's getting it for me"". I thought it was Sunday and that Mom had to do my hair, but remembered it was Friday. There were some people filming a music video on a beach and the snake was around."
"2305"	"(2008-08-31 (17)) There was a demon killing kids. Dean and Jo (both Supernatural) were talking and she asked him something and he said ""I love you. I've always loved you"" etc. Then Sam and Dean were somewhere looking for the demon, but it was standing over another kid."
"2306"	"(2008-08-31 (17)) I was staying at Mom's, but I was at home waiting for her. I called her to ask how long she was going to be and she said ""Don't worry, I'm coming, it's your turn to stay""."
"2307"	"(2008-09-01 (17)) Some others and I were in a hotel. We were then outside and this gas started coming and was going to be everywhere, so we left. One of the people I was with said it smelled like ""toxic gas"". We were driving really fast and weaving through traffic. We were outside this hospital. I was with lots of others my age. The ambulances were taking off really fast and I couldn't cross the road. Farrah and Ariana were there. Ariana was trying to climb up the back of the hospital, and I was holding this thing steady for her. Valerie was also there. This other lady was around. I had pants on and was hot, so I went into this little room which was away from the hospital to change. There were lots of towels in a cupboard in there. I couldn't get them around me and so the lady made me 'smaller'. It felt weird as I was getting smaller. I could now wrap the towel around and wrapped around like a skirt. Ezra made fun of it. We ended up getting into the hospital but it was just a large room with kids in it and most of them were dead."
"2308"	"(2008-09-02 (17)) I was watching Supernatural/Freaks and Geeks. Someone was telling Neal (Freaks and Geeks) that the yellow-eyed demon was his father. I was saying ""I knew it"". His father had cheated with someone who was actually the demon and his wife had gotten pregnant from it. Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks) was around."
"2309"	"(2008-09-03 (17)) I was at school in the common room. Lorelei was standing up and had some bits of paper in her hands and she was talking to someone and they asked her how many she had. I realized they were dreams. She had thirty something. I told her that I had 2300. She showed me a dream she had written and it had two sentences and a bunch of pictures, including one of Jared Padalecki. I told her it was better to write full sentences rather than put pictures. I said I had five books full of dreams and I was typing them up. She asked why I was typing them up."
"2310"	"(2008-09-03 (17)) I was at Mom's house, which was different. Ezra was moving back there and I decided to go to her house. I got stuck with a lame room again."
"2311"	"(2008-09-04 (17)) I was at the exam place for chemistry. Eugene and I had become friends which I knew due to what Calvin and some others were saying. Calvin and I had to walk along this narrow ledge. Others were in front of us and these guys stopped to buy a drink from a stall. We got held up, so we jumped off but it was where the ledge basically ended. There was a mirror somewhere and it wasn't reflecting properly. Calvin ran into this cinema and I followed him. There was a weird movie playing and he left. This lesbian started talking to me and said her current girlfriend had thought she was a guy at first. I left there and was carrying lots of books and my calculator. Autumn dropped some of her stuff and thought she'd lost her calculator but she didn't. I went into this other cinema, where another weird movie was playing, which had a guy with red hair dancing. I was writing down books to use for my English exam and I had included A Clockwork Orange and written Anthony Burgess next to it. I was trying to remember the director of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but I couldn't. I was trying to remember the ""three hour movie"" he did as well."
"2312"	"(2008-09-04 (17)) I'm not sure where I was but I was in a room somewhere. Eugene was sitting on a chair. Something happened and I realized it was a dream. I saw Eugene in the corner and forgot what I wanted to do. I put my hand on his shoulder and said ""Hey Eugene, what's up?"" and he just looked me and then looked away. I ran my hand down his back and then through his hair, which felt rough and like dog fur, saying that I'd always wanted to do that. I told him it was a dream and to do a reality check. I did and breathed and my nose squeaked and then everything went white and I had a false awakening. I was at the end of Brookland Ave, at the lights. Jeremiah and Selena were there. I was going to wag, but there were lollipop ladies everywhere. I also thought I saw Ms Corbett. Darius and Jeremiah were walking and they said they were going to pick up Eugene and then go to school. I went with them and we walked slowly, but we got to school and Eugene was already there. I saw Alejandro around too. They were all wearing their leavers' jackets. The library had no books in there and had lots of lounges in there. I was telling Autumn that Nana had the same lounges (the recliners). Elijah was joking about it and said ""a library with no books"". We had an excursion and Elijah didn't want to go so he planted this stuff around to excite the teacher into searching for more stuff (like a treasure hunt), so she wouldn't go. Julianna was around and I was telling her how to do something."
"2313"	"(2008-09-05 (17)) I was at school. We were watching An American Werewolf in London. I wasn't facing the TV but then turned around so I could watch it. This lady asked us what we rated it and I said ""10 out of 10"" and she was like ""10 out of 10?!"" and I said 'Yeah I loved it the first time I saw it'. Elijah had cupcakes and he gave one to Ezra. Samantha was also at the desk. They were really nice cupcakes. I felt full and stopped eating them. We were going to be picked up early. Then I was watching Supernatural and something happened to Bobby, whose name was actually his real name, Jim Beaver. He had bones in his desk. He was actually dead and Sam said ""he tricked us"" and then someone slammed Sam and Dean's heads together. I was going through my most listened to music on my computer and the most listened to song was Don't Fear the Reaper."
"2314"	"(2008-09-06 (17)) We went to a cemetery after someone in our family died (or someone else). I was with Dad and Ezra and we were carrying the coffin. Eugene and his family were in front of us. He had two sisters and he was wearing his leavers' jacket. One of his sisters had ""Seecee"" on the back and the other had ""Solaris"". Eugene said it was either a ""Russian movie or a Russian spacecraft"". Then we were on an excursion and Eugene was following me. There was a mirror maze and Eugene went off to get changed. Jeremiah and Darius were around in orange jumpers. Across from the mirror maze were some guys fighting on a stage in a weird way and one of them was in a lot of pain. I asked someone if we were supposed to get changed and they said no and I said ""Eugene is"" and I went through the maze. We then were eating lunch. Jeremiah told Eugene not to sit with me because he thought he had a 'thing' for me. He sat somewhere else. We had to write down a question and I went to get a black and red pen out of my bag, but first I forgot the red pen and grabbed blue instead and then I went back to get the red pen. Last Train to Clarksville was playing. This book of mine wouldn't close, so I just left it open. Evelyn was crawling on the floor to get to a plate. Jeremiah came to the table where I was and asked Alejandro and I what we were eating and I said ""vegemite sandwich"" and he said ""same old, same old"" and I wondered how he knew. Then this girl went to this house with a vampire guy. They got separated and she bumped into her brother. Some guys took their car, which was the car from Supernatural. This vampire morphed into this woman. This girl was later outside at this rocky place with a vampire guy. There was a vampire couple in a bed. The girl was pretty and she had brown hair and a red ribbon thing around her neck. Later I was at home and Uncle Wilbur and Poppa were there doing something for me, but I don't remember what. I had to have a shower."
"2315"	"(2008-09-07 (17)) I was at school. In period 2 I decided I wanted to go home so I text Mom and I said to pick me up before 10, so I would miss out on lunch 2. I left class and Mom came and she said the office ladies had been really rude and they were going to make us talk to Ms Pascal. I was trying to explain that I was sick, because of those headaches I keep getting, but they wouldn't listen. Ms Southwell was also there. I got angry and pushed all the paper off the desk and went and sat in the car."
"2316"	"(2008-09-07 (17)) I had to collect kittens from this giant red dog. We had to crawl inside it and it had walls. If we touched the walls with this electronic stuff we would get -2 points. Each kitten was worth 1 point and we needed 6 points to pass. It was dark inside the dog. Then I was outside and there was this forest area with these metal drums with dark, murky water in them, with snakes in them. We had to reach in to grab them. There was another area with animals surrounded by fences. There were dogs and there was this really pretty pony. This guy came and I don't think I was supposed to be there."
"2317"	"(2008-09-07 (17)) I had an apartment thing at school. I lived with three others. It was quite messy. I went to the toilet and when I wiped there was this green, plant like stuff on the toilet paper. I wiped again and then the toilet paper was the plant stuff. I left the toilet and in another room there was a guy with his head on the desk and he looked like Daryl. I left the apartment and ended up in this undercover area and I took my shoes off for a second, but then I couldn't find them. I asked this teacher guy for help, but then I found them. I text Mom to get me because I only had private study left. She said ok. I told her to go to the far end of the street so that I could sneak out and didn't have to sign out. She said she was going to get some ice-cream first. I sat down at a bench and saw some white shoes walk past and I looked up and Eugene walked past with his brother, talking to him. Calvin came with some girl. We got some photos and we had our leavers' jackets open."
"2318"	"(2008-09-08 (17)) I was at school and it was Monday. I was annoyed that I was in Ms Solomon's class now because it meant I had English on a Monday [I don't really] . Eugene and someone sat in my seat, so I had to take one at the front. Ms Olmstead was teaching the class. She mentioned --Torrent and she asked what letter came before the -- and no-one said anything and she said ""not even the people who know want to tell me"". Someone asked Eugene if he knew. We went on the net and Ms Olmstead told us to do this quiz that would tell you what nationality you are. Mr Nixon was in a dropdown list. I saw Ms Solomon and I was glad I didn't have to do this essay."
"2319"	"(2008-09-08 (17)) I was watching Supernatural. Sam fell asleep and Dean woke him up. They were after something that wasn't human (I think it was a dog or something). It could so something 'supernatural' and they were trying to talk to it. Sam was then in the car with some girl and Jess was in the back. These police told him that his car was leaking gas. Sam was saying to someone ""it is better to tell the truth than lie""."
"2320"	"(2008-09-08 (17)) I woke up and went on my computer and realized it was late and we weren't at school. I called out to Ezra to ask why we weren't at school. Then I realized it was Sunday [not really] . I was glad about this. The internet wasn't working and I kept resetting it. I found four more episodes of season 3 of Supernatural, but they were classified as season 4. I had another download going and it had 9mb left. I finally got the net working."
"2321"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) I was watching some show, of which only five episodes were made. Then there were zombies. This guy and a girl were in a room. This door thing kept keeping something open, but if it was closed it wouldn't open again. The guy made sure it was open and let the girl out, but he left too and they left this other girl."
"2322"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) I was reading something on the net and Jared Padalecki had two sons and another kid on the way. Colin Clive was on this reality show to get married. I was like ""I didn't even know he was alive"". He was 80. This girl was at the door for him and she was 40 something. She left because she was awkward about the age difference."
"2323"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) I was at this house in the middle of nowhere. I was with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and going out with the former. Mom came up and left with him. When they left, Jared put his arm around me and we started making out. This black guy was a friend of his and was cleaning something outside and he knew about this affair we were having. I wanted to leave and called Mom but she only just got back and said it would take ""70 minutes"" for her to get back. I started locking all the doors and windows. None were locked because there wasn't anyone around for miles. There were stingy looking frilly curtains on the windows. This guy got angry and picked up the only car there and threw it into the water. Then he was this girl friend of mine and her name was Emily or Jade. She decided to look for a car herself instead of waiting for Mom. We went to this shed and she looked out the window and told me to get a badge and she grabbed this police badge. The only one I found had a fish hook on it as it was used ""for bait"". We made up names and went down. There were two cop guys there and they invited us to eat and there wives were sitting at a table. We saw the bad guy outside the window, but he had seen us earlier so as to not blow our cover we hid our faces. Then this guy with a gun walked past so we went after him. We ran through this crowded undercover place and everyone was shooting. I shot the bad guy but then my gun clicked as it had run out of bullets and he lifted his gun to shoot me, but this girl, who was an ex-girlfriend of his, grabbed him and shot him herself. I threw my gun to this kid and said ""take the gun"". This black cop guy got it off him. Then I was with Nana and I was going through That's Life. I had written stuff in it. There was a page where I had written stuff about Twin Peaks and then the next page had a picture of Kyle MacLachlan. There were photos of Fido and some other dog with its tongue sticking out."
"2324"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) Ezra could add music and other audio to video files in Windows Media Player and it worked really well."
"2325"	"(2008-09-10 (17)) I was at school. I was in the class next to Ezra's in a computer room. We got into a little fight. Then I went into this other room to do my ""art work"" and he had squirted this red/yellow sauce on it. Ms Solomon was egging him on. I yelled at him. Then I said to the teacher that I was leaving. There were only a few minutes left to the end of school anyway. I was then in some lady's van with Mom and Ezra. They went into the bakery at Midvale shops, but they made me stay as they didn't trust the lady. I asked for a chocolate muffin. They had the right notebooks for my dreams, but Mom had already bought me the right one this morning. This grey plane, which looked like a giant beetle, was flying around the carpark. It wasn't being driven very well and I said ""I wouldn't be surprised if it hit us"". Then it landed on the car in front of us, and rolled and just missed us. I took a photo of it as we left. Mom took me to this lady's house. There were cops up the street at another house. Mom suspected this lady of killing her kid. There was no furniture in the house and I said ""this looks like a big hall"", there was light against the wall from the window behind me. She asked me where I'd put some table because her cat, Pudding, liked to sit on tables. She left and I was alone. I saw a cage thing with something dark in it. Mom came and I shone the light from my phone in there and it was a dead baby. Mom called out bye, but the lady realized we'd found it and started bashing us up. These spirits that we'd saved came and were threatening her. This new girl spirit got excited and lost control and killed her. Sam (Supernatural) and I were then out the back chucking stuff into the ocean. There were a lot of bags and they wouldn't push out to sea. There was a little area out the back of her house and there was a lizard and I fed it to something. There were snacks nearby. Sam complained about all the bags and I said ""wait until you do mine!""."
"2326"	"(2008-09-11 (17)) I was playing a game, although it wasn't. I went into a house and there were helicopters and cops outside. I had this sniper and was shooting cops that were on the stairs outside. I ran out. The house belonged to a guy who was friends with the previous owner, who had been killed by the guy (who was me). I was at a deli and I bought a chocolate. When I left I realized I had all these other chocolates. This guy bumped into me to take them (he had put them on me so he could later take them). I kicked him in the nuts. He called out to the shop lady, whose name was Valerie, to say I had stolen chocolates. But we knew her so she didn't believe him. Later she was waiting for a date with this other guy was also a thief. This disabled friend of hers was with her. Dean and Sam (both Supernatural) were outside and this guy tried to shoot them. There were dogs sitting in the snow outside."
"2327"	"(2008-09-12 (17)) I was at school. I was in the library, which was different. I had an accounting test next. When I went out, my bag wasn't there. I told Ms Solomon and she let me search for it. We then had an assembly in a weird room. There were steps for us to sit on, but people were sitting under them as well. I was drawing a picture of a car in pencil. When I rubbed some of it out, the lights on the car broke and it also made this sheet of glass break. A teacher found it and I said I'd accidentally hit it and they thought I'd chucked a sad and broke it on purpose. Someone was on their phone and found my Bluetooth, and so I followed the signal from my phone and found my bag. My Bluetooth was called '2018'. There were some elevators and I was with Mom. Daydream Believer and Don't Fear the Reaper were playing. Darius had his bed in the common room. Margarita was around and was talking to someone. I was driving down the street with Dad. We saw Jayson, Jonas and others standing on the side of the road with these big white suits on, which looked like astronaut suits, so I asked ""What's with the astronaut suits?"". Dad said they were limo drivers. I saw Eugene there and wondered why he had decided to become a limo driver."
"2328"	"(2008-09-12 (17)) I was in accounting and we did a test and then I left to do something. Something of mine fell off. I told Ms Bigwood. I was then eating with Calvin outside the classroom. Abukar was telling a story of something to some girls and they were crying, but Geneva was laughing as it was a joke. Some boy asked me if he could have my sandwich. I said no, but then the siren went so I gave it to him and said ""go to the toilet and eat it quickly"". We went back into class and we were on computers. Calvin and I went on Runescape. Darius was behind us. On IMDb it said it was Alejandro's birthday, although it was the 19th. Elijah was in the class. I joked it was a dream and did a reality check and realized it was a dream and looked out the window and it looked really vivid out there. I tried putting my hand through the window a few times, but couldn't. I went outside and ran a little and put my fist into the air and flew up. I was sort of floating about and it felt weird, but then I fell out of the dream."
"2329"	"(2008-09-13 (17)) I was watching Grey's Anatomy and trying to remember why Denny had been in the hospital. I remembered that someone had been threatening Izzie with a knife and he had jumped in the way to save her and got stabbed [didn't really happen] . I was going to download those episodes again. I was on MSN and Jayson was on there. We had started talking and he sent me some links. Poppa needed me to go to a church in ""Montreal"". I was in the car on the way there but I forgot the name of the church. It was called St Nixon, but then it was Yeates and I thought 'Like Rebekah'. I was then with someone else and they pointed out the church. It was 12:10, and I was supposed to have done whatever I was supposed to do by 12. It was dark. This guard/priest guy was outside and was watching us. Poppa explained what I had to do and that I had to go into the ""hold"". I forgot the rest of what he said though. The guard guy called the cops, so we ran and were jumping and running around for a while. We ended up jumping into the hold, but it wasn't really. We kept making noises and then they would hear us and we would have to run again. It was then daytime. It showed this lump of ground and it moved. Then it showed this lady outside her house being questioned by the cops. Then it showed this other cop holding a gun to this guy's head, who lived across from her. They were going to kill him if she didn't tell them what the ground was for. They were actually aliens. They lifted up the grass, and the ground underneath was really soft and they put their hands in and pulled out a big, old phone. Then I had a flashback of me talking on it to Poppa. One of the aliens said ""How long did you know?"" and the other said ""13 years"" and the other one said that he'd known for ""38 years"". My partner and I were in disguises leaning against a wall around the corner. There was a lake across from us, and we ran and jumped into it. We were swimming under the water looking for something on the bottom of the lake. The aliens were now swimming behind us. We reached the end, then I quickly leapt around to the other side, using the sides of the lake. The person I was with was then Autumn. They ended up taking my partner to see what I would do, but I ran and got into the car and drove. It was then dark and I didn't put the lights on and almost drove into the lake. I put my lights on, but I had ended up on this rocky wall and I couldn't get off it and I had to drive carefully. Some parts of it were snowy. Three years later, I got off. I went back to the town and got a motel room, which had no TV and the lady was offered me hers. I then went to Mom's, which was her house, but Nana was there. Dad and Ezra were there too. They had these sausages, normal ones and ""French"" ones. The French ones had this hairy skin like stuff on them. I opted for a normal one. Dad had a French one. Ben (Big Brother) was there. Mom knew him. He thought I was Ezra when I first came in and said ""Hey Tommy"" and I said ""I'm not 'Tommy',"". I went to my room and Ezra's bed was still in there."
"2330"	"(2008-09-14 (17)) I was watching Supernatural. Then Dean, Sam and I went to this town because of murders that had happened there. We noticed that everyone looked emotionless (and it was called Happytown). Someone normal was talking to us about some creature that had a lump of stuff on its bum and I joked that it had a ""rectal prolapse"". We were then near this dirty, swampy water. There were ducks in it. I think someone was getting attacked on the other side and we all jumped in and swam. I had a fork in each hand and was trying to swim around the ducks so I didn't stab them. Sam and I were joking about it as we swam. We got to the other side and near another bit of water and this mother duck, which was this deformed creature came out. They stabbed it in the bum and it had a rectal prolapse, but it had this flap of skin coming up from under it, so the prolapse was kept in it. We could see this field a while away with this other lone mother duck with a prolapse. I was helping Sam get his stuff into his bag and throwing the useless stuff away. I was looking at rocks around the place for a certain type. Then the mother duck said it was going somewhere and Sam was like ""The colt murders?"" and it said yeah. It said that the people of the town were being controlled and some other town was sending the Happytown people to be sacrificed. We left and then we were on a street. Sam and Dean were down the street a while from me and I was with a girl. We saw this lady and pointed her out to Sam and Dean and they shot her in the butt a few times. We ran over to say that that's not what we meant, that she wasn't bad. She was ok, and we took her to the hospital. This nice car drove past and it had a black guy in it. The girl said that it was probably a good candidate for the bad guy. We were then in a hotel. There were female ghosts there and they were trying to get us to have sex with them. They turned me into a guy and made me have sex with one of them."
"2331"	"(2008-09-15 (17)) This guy wanted to be a magician. It was me though. I was then playing this game, although it played out live. I was in a police station and I had to unlock this thing and hide behind a wall for a certain amount of time. I started unlocking it but then this guard came and I hid behind the wall. Every time I went to leave I did it too early. It would then reset. Then the magician guy's friend got blown up, but he thought it would reset, but it didn't. He was ok though. I was then outside a shop with Ezra and we were walking around to get somewhere. I saw Milo Ventimiglia and I hugged him and stole his car keys as this was part of a timeline (we were time traveling or something). He had a blue car."
"2332"	"(2008-09-15 (17)) I was with a bunch of people. We had to decide who was going to die for something. I got chosen, but I wasn't on the list so I didn't have to. It had something to do with selling souls. But when they were doing it, I was lying down with the rest of them as they covered us with a blanket."
"2333"	"(2008-09-15 (17)) Vampires were now known about. They were blue. This girl was going out with one. Three others came and threatened her but she ignored them and then they were cool (it was a test)."
"2334"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) Mom and I were at this house, as she wanted to buy it. It was big and they said it was an Asian design. The front of it looked symmetrical, with two rounded sides with a pointy roof on each and a flat roof in the middle. I was looking at the bedrooms and they all had a double bed in them. There were two master bedrooms and two normal ones. One of the normal rooms had a bathroom next to it and I wanted it. The other one was bigger so I hoped Ezra would take it. We went out the back and it had a huge backyard. We were in the middle of a garden. I joked that we would need the scooter thing that Poppers has to get around it. He was also there a while away from us."
"2335"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) Dexter (Dexter) jumped into the water and swam to get rid of evidence. Then I was with Dad sitting on these train tracks. Al Pacino and Robert de Niro were there. Al was telling us what we had to do and I joked to Dad if he knew which one he was and he did know. We had to quickly cross the tracks. This girl said something to Robert de Niro and he came over and leant over to talk to her, but this train came and killed him. It reset and so he didn't die, but someone else did. He fell into the water next to the tracks and this boat exploded."
"2336"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) I woke up and was writing down a dream I had about Chris Barrie, which was the first dream I'd had about him."
"2337"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) This teacher had sheets of paper with information about all the students on them. I was looking as they flicked through and I saw Eugene's one and his middle name was Rodney and I thought that was silly since they named his brother Rodney."
"2338"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) We were at school and the siren went, so we were walking out of school. The little white car (1BEE) was there. Ezra and I got in, but Mom went off to the school. We didn't know how long she was going to be so I drove to her house. I called her and thinking we were still at the school asked, ""Why don't you ask one of the teachers?"" and I said we were at her house and she was angry."
"2339"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) I was at school. I had an accounting test but Elijah walked towards health to do a test. When I got to accounting though, he was there. Calvin and Darius were also there. The class was like a restaurant."
"2340"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) I had just woken up and was in bed writing down my dreams and Dad came in and turned my light on and told me angrily to get up."
"2341"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) I was in my room on my computer and I had read a magazine earlier that had posters of Martin Sheen from Apocalypse Now, Jensen Ackles and a picture of James Spader. I showed Ezra the pictures of Jensen and Martin. I was typing something personal later on the computer and Ezra came in and I was trying to hide it and get rid of him. I had downloads going too. He wouldn't leave. We both left the room at the same time. There were no water bottles in the fridge and I complained. Ezra left a cup of orange juice on my desk and I ran to his room and poured it on the floor. I realized he'd be angry and ran out. He stormed out angrily and was coming towards me."
"2342"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) Bill (True Blood) and I were going out for some reason. Also, vampires weren't known about. We went to this house. There was a couple there. Hitler was there too. Bill and I were speaking German to each other. Hitler said to me that people liked him and they even had this mask thing of his face on the wall and there was a fish plaque thing as well. I said ""There's one of a fish too. I prefer the fish, you might taste funny"". He got angry and came after me to kill me, but Bill got rid of him. We were then at another house, which was Mom's, but not. We had actually gone back in time before. Ezra, Mom, Bill and I were at the table. Bill left and I said that he'd remembered that at 2.47am he had to save me. They didn't know what I was talking about. I went out into the lounge room and words appeared on the window saying 'ghost is here'."
"2343"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) There was some supernatural thing going on. I was watching this video of this lady, who was a pro zombie killer, was left at this fake apartment block. It was night. At the end of it, this helicopter came and she went outside and all the zombies were dead. I was also a good zombie killer. I was at this house with some others and we had been fighting zombies. I came across this normal blonde haired dude who threatened us, but he got away. Later we were walking down a hall and he was there and had someone next to him and behind us. Scarlett was attacked by the guy behind us and she fought with him. I killed the two near me with a knife and Scarlett was gone and I figured she had been killed. I turned the corner and this guy with spiky black hair was there. I thought I knew him, but I didn't. I think I killed him and this guy I did know turned up. We were rivals. He walked out of the building, saying loudly, that I'd killed his friends and my friend, Scarlett. There were cops surrounding the exit and I was arrested. Then it showed Scarlett in hospital and she was ok. Callie (Grey's Anatomy) said to her, ""I love you"" and kissed her. I was let off and I ended up setting something up for the guy. I had gotten him to pick something (a number or a card or something) and he said ""I pulled out 70"". He chased me down a street and I jumped into a ditch and then the cops pulled up and got him. This old guy was talking to them and said he'd seen two people. They asked if he knew the names of them and as I ran off, I heard him say ""Izzy Conell"" and I was thinking 'damn it!'. I went home, which was different and was like a unit. I had to walk up steps to get to the front door (a second storey). Ezra had an empty water bottle, so I went to get more and he filled them up, which surprised me. We were having mudcake with cream [we had some last night and it was really nice] . I showed Mom and she was unfazed. We also had lasagna for dinner. There were Pokemon game boxes on the table."
"2344"	"(2008-09-18 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We were doing some things before school. We went to get breakfast and I realized it was 12.15pm and Mom had already dropped Ezra off. I was then at home and I asked for the day off since there was only two periods left. I was showing Mom some photos at one point of Samantha and her sister Cyndi. I said her sister was ""only 14"" as she was wearing inappropriate clothes. We turned down a street and I thought I saw Samantha driving a car. I saw Eugene's car outside of a house and I realized that it was his new house and I tried to take a photo."
"2345"	"(2008-09-18 (17)) I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone or something. There was a small town and not many people were around as there was something that stopped them from leaving. It was night. This guy worked at a shop and this thing only allowed him a certain number of customers and he let an extra customer in and he said he was worried about this ""tailor"" coming. This lady came to town and walked into a house which had its door open and then walked out, and this wasn't allowed at night. She went into the shop and the guy said ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" and asked if she was the tailor and she said she didn't know what he was talking about. Then the tailor came and it was this short and ugly guy and he had lots of rings on. The woman stood with her face to the door and tried to leave quietly as the tailor killed the shop owner. He saw her and went after her. All the other residents of the town and her were running up the street to get away. Then I was the woman. He was shooting at us. There was a big circular ramp thing, which we had to run up and jump over this fence into our backyard, then into the pool and we would be back in reality. I couldn't be bothered running up the ramp so I jumped up to the top of it. I got over along with this girl and a guy. I dove into the pool and when I came up, no-one was around and it was day. Then the girl was there. I went inside and had a suspicion that she was the tailor. She was facing away from me and she turned around and had his face, but still her body and her hair (which looked funny). He turned to his normal form and he was going to kill me but I suggested we work together. He said ""So you tell everyone"" and I said ""No! Well, yeah"". I explained that I would tell people about all the myths and things that would make him appear. As an example I mentioned Bloody Mary and said ""kids do it"" and he said ""I do [kill] kids too"" thoughtfully and I said ""there you go!"". He took me up on the offer. The girl whose body he had taken over was in the games room. He grabbed the vacuum and put it on her vagina on high, to kill her. She was screaming. Later we were outside a house and this lady gave us this golden bowl, which was one of the myth things that the tailor could use. I said ""I know the perfect person for it"" and he said ""that Rebekah girl?"" and I said yeah. I remembered that earlier in the town, I had mentioned that I hated Rebekah. Later I went home, which was now different. I had a bunk bed. My 'sister' (she was a young adult) usually slept on the top bunk, but she was away. The tailor now looked like Rimmer (Red Dwarf and he looked season one/two-ish) and he said that he looked how I wanted him to look and I was thinking ""you got that right!"". He still had the rings on though and I really hoped he would take them off. He took the top bunk. I also had a brother who was around the same age as the sister. He came back and was not happy about the guy staying there. I was at a table and reading a magazine. There was a picture of David Tennant but it looked like Callum Blue at first. Then I was watching Ugly Betty. There was a flashback of last season and Gio and Henry were with Betty at a gym/yoga place and were waiting for her to make her decision and they both were knocked out. At the start of the new season, Betty was now missing. Her sister, who was different and pretty, went to the gym place and asked if Sookie worked there. They said yes. Henry saw her and asked if Betty had chosen. Gio stood up and the sister said ""Gio!"" and they hugged and kissed. Betty had now been the woman in the town and had died and Sookie (True Blood) was in her body. Back at the house, Sookie was lying in the bottom bunk. She had no shirt on and her bra was lifted up. In the kitchen, the tailor was wearing her shirt and teasing her brother. Then I, except I was someone else, was walking through this forest, at night, which had wires everywhere. I ended up at this house, which also had wires everywhere. The lights were off and it was dark. I noticed there was no furniture in the house and realized it was a surprise party for me. I turned into the next room and they yelled ""Surprise!"" and turned the lights on. I was getting married. There was a penguin, standing on a table, but it was actually a cake. I touched it and realized it was really solid."
"2346"	"(2008-09-18 (17)) I was at school in English. I asked Ms Solomon for help with this graph thing, which was actually Biology work. My tooth was hurting and was loose. I was chewing some bubble gum and I sucked at it and my tooth came out. I spat it out and there was heaps of blood. I was wearing white socks, and they, along with my shoes got covered in blood. I got a tissue and then asked if I could go home."
"2347"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) Rimmer (Red Dwarf) won an auction to sleep with some virgin girl [I read something like that yesterday] . She liked him though and they stayed together for the weekend. He had told her that he was someone else, someone who was rich and powerful etc. Later, the Red Dwarf crew had to go to her and he had to go along as himself. When they saw each other he smiled sheepishly. Lister told her that he had lied, in a way that made Rimmer sound bad and Lister sound good, and she said ""well at least he's good [in bed] "". Then it was me with him. We had watched some stupid romantic comedy and we decided that it was 'our' movie. We went to a planet. Kryten said the scan showed that there was lots of doors and humans had come before to replace plastic sheets with doors. We were outside near a paddock thing and Rimmer was tapping a song on a wooden log, which was part of the paddock. He said it was a lullaby his father used to sing on Io. It sounded tingy, so I tapped the wood, but it wasn't as tingy. There were these magazines on the ground somewhere and one had Angelina Jolie on the front. It was from far in the future. I found a book and was like ""Oh my God!"" and it had a family tree with me and Rimmer at the top and all our descendants, who were mostly actors. Some of the names were purple, from having been previously clicked on as I had looked them up from movies and stuff before. I was completely amazed and couldn't believe I had looked them up before. We were trying to work out how it was possible that it existed and we decided that we must have gone to 1995 and started a life together [the timeline was different, so I wouldn't have been young then] . Then I was at a shop with Ezra. They had 24 stickers for a 24 sticker book. We didn't open them as we didn't know if they were any good. I was watching some teenage show and I was talking in a voice like in White Chicks and I did the laugh from it. I ended up opening the cards and there was one of Elisha Cuthbert and Kiefer Sutherland (who was young). There was a video on Youtube of this young girl, who was about six, talking about who she thought were the 10 hottest guys. One of them was Ted Bundy and I thought that it was odd for a young girl."
"2348"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) I was at home. Mom and I went for a drive, but when we got back it was 7.50am, and Dad was leaving for work. I wasn't ready for school and asked Mom to take me. She said no and left. I decided to stay home and I went back to bed. Later, I saw a car in the driveway. I closed the wood door as it pulled up. It was dark outside. I ran to my room and put my school clothes on. The light was really dim in the room and something felt wrong so I did a reality check, which worked. I was then in a class with others who were lucid. I tried to put my finger through my palm [had read about it yesterday] and was saying ""there is no spoon"". I woke up and it said it was 25:99 and so I did another reality check, which worked and was talking to Ezra about lucid dreaming."
"2349"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) I was with the cast of Red Dwarf in a basement place, which had quite a few levels. I saw this guy's head pop out from somewhere and I said ""It's the 217 guy!"". He opened this door, which led outside, and told us to go outside. It was Earth. I said that I should stay, but I didn't. We didn't walk too far and there was another door, on the left side of the path. As I went to go in, it started to close and I made it through, but Kryten was left behind. I had to run across this dodgy bridge and then I was standing with Rimmer, who had screwed up his line (which was something about Lister). People started walking towards us over this oval. There was this girl and Rimmer ran to her saying ""Shamara!"" and hugged her and she was confused about it. Poppa, Dad and Mom came, along with various other people I knew. It wasn't real though."
"2350"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) I was at Nana's. Granma was there and her food was moving. Dad and Mom were there too. I saw Spaceman, Mittens, Fido and some other pet. I was petting them. There was something about Brad Pitt and Claire Danes."
"2351"	"(2008-09-20 (17)) Mom decided to this thing where she would make a honking sound and we had to say whatever we were thinking at the time. At one of the times, Darren said something really random. I was trying not to think about Chris Barrie. The next time she honked, I was."
"2352"	"(2008-09-20 (17)) I don't know where we were, but a bunch of people from school, some others and I were there. One was a guy that I had been with when I met Jewel Staite. We had this other picture of me and her. Someone was coming to see him and he gave the photos to me to hide somewhere (so no-one knew anything about him). Eugene and Darius had a room there. They changed something on the door, so it said Eugene was Finnish and Darius was French. I think Eugene and I were going out. I got into a car and Ezra was in the driver's seat. Eugene came and the car started reversing out into the street and wouldn't stop. He got stuck on the bonnet, but decided to stay on the outside of the car. There was a girl with a balloon and I grabbed it and it started shrinking and popped and she blamed me, but I said it was already popped (it was). I saw this director guy and recognized him. I found something about him and was like 'That's where I know you from!'. Some guy asked us if we knew any actors (for a job). Then it showed some of us entering a building (we had taken up the offer). I had to get in to this place and I had a bag strapped and this other guard checked it. While they were distracted, Theodore slipped into the toilet just behind them. I went into the bar and Johanna and two others were there. I went into the next room and some girl I had met before decided she wanted help with applicable math. They cancelled intro calc to do it and Fatima came in and was trying to work out what happened. This girl and guy were trying to get this other guy horny and when he did they pulled a gun on him. Maeby (Arrested Development) was outside a window of the building on a high storey, attached to the inside door. If someone opened the door, she would be killed. A lady tried to open it, but she couldn't. Maeby slid into this thing, so the cord wouldn't be as short and therefore wouldn't cause her to be killed. Ezra was confused about what she did (it was something that she wouldn't have been able to do in real life). There was some experiment, where these people had guy a big hole and there was lots of sand next to it. Something changed the reality and now Germans had dug a bigger hole. The reality kept changing. Some of the new realities included Alejandro being there, our postcode was 6064 and other random stuff. There was some alien disease. It was like the Hex virus from Red Dwarf and I was thinking 'Rimmer!'. I was also watching some Red Dwarf thing. Cat was on it, but I didn't recognize him or any of the others, except for Rimmer. In this reality, I had met Chris Barrie. There was a book by someone which said that The Beatles were their favourite band. There was a shiny spot in the book, which had Jared Padalecki written in it."
"2353"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) I went into Ezra's room and he was watching season 2 of Red Dwarf. I remembered how skinny Rimmer was compared to season 7 and 8 and was thinking he was really hot. I was going through stuff on my computer later and I was in the TV shows folder and I had to scroll through everything and it was cloudy and taking ages. Ezra had downloaded the latest Heroes episode and asked me what happened to Claire in the shop and I had no idea what he was talking about and he gave the episode to me. Claire and Peter were in a flashback. I was with someone sitting on a dodgy ledge thing on the beach and we were scabbing money off people somehow. Sometimes I was with Dad. Ezra and I were playing this virtual reality type game and I was a hologram. We were trying to escape and he died. I was fighting and trying to steer this huge boat. I was having trouble controlling it and then I had to fight this guy and I was having trouble with him, so I grabbed my lightbee and was fading away, so as he punched me, he fell off the boat."
"2354"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) I was at school, which was different. There was this competition on, where we had to go through some different stages. First, there were three different lots of bugs in three different places, near each other. I realized they were breeding with other things. I can only remember scorpions and spiders. Eugene was there, but he didn't do this part first. The people who were doing this one, went inside this house, which was just past the bugs. As we climbed up the stairs, which were circular, there were also three lots of things scattered over the stairs. The first one was serial killers and Ted Bundy was one of them. They would come to 'life' and one had an axe. This girl and I decided to just run, instead of identifying them. We got to the top and since only the top 3 could pass, I was worried someone would get rid of me, so I pushed her off the side. This fat guy, this other guy and a girl came, but the fat guy fell off and accidentally took the girl with him. The other guy and I were the only ones left. We didn't want to go back down the stairs so we had to get out through a window. I grabbed a towel and put it around my hand and punched the glass. I said ""I watch too many movies"". Then we had to go to this room, ""om1"" and there were random tests. The room had computers in rows in the middle of it, but I sat at a round table at the side. This guy with a posh accent was talking to me. The tests were really random, one of them was it would give us a German title of something and we had to rate how ""fierce"" it was."
"2355"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) This girl was dead and had died at a young age. She was a ghost in this dilapidated house. She made me follow her and fall through the floor. I discovered that her father had poisoned her. Then it was me that had died and that's what had happened to me, but it wasn't Dad that poisoned me. I was a ghost and was trying to tell Mom."
"2356"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) I was with some friends on a street and we were trying to hitchhike. It was early evening. We were thirsty. Eugene was there and we were going out. I was thinking that we never made it out of this and were never found. This guy pulled over and I thought he was dodgy but this girl and I went to get in. The girl sat in the front and I opened the back door to get in and I said ""Eugene"" and he quickly came over. We were in the middle of the back. As we drove, I put my arm around him and he did the same and said ""it's ok"". The guy did something and when he stopped, I jumped out and ran and Eugene followed. The guy stabbed the girl. I got really puffed out. I kept looking behind to make sure Eugene was with me and the guy was close behind. There were houses around, but they were all empty I think. I was trying to text our other friends to tell them not to get in his car so that we didn't all die. We did manage to get away."
"2357"	"(2008-09-22 (17)) I don't know how we got there, but I was at this house. I think two guys lived there. I was with a male friend who I liked and a female friend. They took one set of keys off of us, thinking they were car keys and wouldn't let us leave. Calvin told me a joke about a guy who puts his finger up people's bums to see how clean they were. I was like 'it's not that funny'. The guy I liked was now Eugene. One of the guys wanted to test us. He wanted to put us in an animal porn video. We were playing Scrabble and the guy almost had the letters to make 'Johnathon'. The guy left to do something. Eugene was next to me and I asked him if he had keys and he said no, but I hadn't realized the guy was still there and he suspected Eugene of having keys and found them and took them. I said ""sorry"". There was a room behind us, with a shelf against the wall full of videos. They were all animal porn and I was trying to stall the guy by asking him what the best ones were. There was one of him having sex with these two dogs (he was having sex with one and the other was doing him). While I stalled, I managed to attack him. I got our keys and attacked the other guy. Then it was a movie I was watching and the two girls there escaped. They met up later and shook hands instead of hugging (they had been friends for ages, but the experience had driven them apart). I was outside somewhere. There were these bin like things, which were thin-ish and cylindrical, with a line a few centimeters down. If I touched the bottom part of it, it turned blue and the top bit turned white. Some didn't work. This other guy was doing it too and it was easier for him. One of the bins was dodgy and it wouldn't work for either of us when we touched it."
"2358"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) I was on the net and had a message from a guy about a post I'd made on the Red Dwarf forum about my desk, which was written rather oddly, and my preferring movies over TV shows. He said he knew a guy called Doug who knew where to find Top 250 movies. On Red Dwarf, some guy liked to sleep in Lister's bed at night. Lister found him and was like 'what the hell are you doing?!'"
"2359"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) In chemistry, Mr Reilly asked if I'd done some chapter and I said no because I'd been away. He gave me Eugene's book and said to take it home. Eugene came in and was looking everywhere for his book, but I didn't say anything because I wanted to take it home and read it and scan it."
"2360"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) I was playing Runescape and it played out live. I had to run south to this place, but I wasn't totally sure of what to do. People from school were there, including Calvin and Eugene. I started running, but realized I'd forgotten my stuff, so ran back to the bank. After, I started running there again. I saw Eugene, Autumn and a girl go a different way than the guide said, so I followed them. I went down a hill, but I didn't know where to go and Autumn and I went the other way. I later realized that the other way was a shortcut. I got to the place and this girl was there and I think she had some weird disease. I think she tried to have sex with Eugene."
"2361"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) I was on Chris Barrie's IMDb page. I downloaded a bunch of movies that he was in and I was on the message board later. He had an account and was answering questions. On his profile it said that he had ""4 sons, maybe"", because he had three and his wife was pregnant, and ""I have had sex"" and something else. It also said he had a son born in July 2003. I was telling Ezra about some movies. I watched some video of Chris Barrie and he was walking on a sidewalk with a kid in a pram. His shirt said ""I -- C... B...""."
"2362"	"(2008-09-24 (17)) I went for a drive with Ms Solomon to her house for some reason. It was a somewhat long drive and past a forest. Later, we were in Canada and they pointed to a white bit on the map (it was snow) and said it was hard to get around because it was big. I was riding on a trolley thing. Payton was too. He asked Ms Solomon if we could get our reports now. People were on the road. One group had a member lay down in front of us. They would also shove people's faces into others' bums. Evelyn was one of the ones who got forced into someone's bum. I was then with Calvin and when we got to the place we saw Evelyn inside and tried to convince her to leave her 'friends'. She refused and we said that they were mean and we weren't, we would ""make jokes"". We got her on the escalator and kept pushing her, so she didn't go make up to them. We went outside the building and they wanted her to ask this guy out. He was old and married. To distract him, I went across to this little shed and screamed and pretended to be looking for the screamer. He came and was annoyed. Eugene was then with me somewhere and I did a reality check and I was thinking it was weird to breathe. Then I was in 'my room'. There was a bunk bed and a penguin toy on the top bunk. It was black and white, like usual with a yellow/orange beak. I was looking at it as it was very vivid. I tried to make Eugene appear and was turning around. I had slept in my bra and it was hurting me, so I took it off and then had no clothes on. Dad came in and I woke up and was like 'go away, I'm naked'. He left."
"2363"	"(2008-09-24 (17)) I was at home. Tinkerbell was there. I was taking photos of her but they were all blurry and she looked a lot like Tigger. Ezra was there. Sometimes everyone could see her but sometimes only I could."
"2364"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was watching a movie with Linda Cardellini in it. She was the main character but she was different. Her brother, his friend (who looked like Bradley) and this other guy went on a holiday. A crocodile tooth got in her and she died, but they took her somewhere and this guy ate something with the crocodile and she was then alive, but different. When she took this stuff, her eyes went black and she went a little crazy. She made her brother and Bradley makeout and hug and then gave Bradley boobs and 'femininity'. This guy called Brian realized and said she was doing it because she liked him. He was in this room and she made the window disappear. I grabbed his hand thinking if I was touching him she wouldn't be able to erase him, but we got confused and I let go and he faded away. She killed some people and then brought him back. Her eyes went normal and she smiled. I looked the actor up and his name was James Me, but his website was ""nathanscott.com"". I was then watching an episode of One Tree Hill. Ezra came in and I paused it on James Lafferty. He wanted to check the show out and I said ""no, how about you get out of my room?"""
"2365"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was watching True Blood and Anna Paquin was talking about something. I was then reading about the book."
"2366"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was staying at this hotel place with Eugene. It was Tuesday. I went to this shop to check my downloads. There was a computer screen with a computerized woman on the screen who looked like Hilarie Burton. Then, Eugene, some others and I were outside in a carpark behind a tall shop. This helicopter had smoke coming out from it and crashed into the other side of the building. We ran to get away because the helicopter was still going crazy. Then I was in a building somewhere and I was filming with my phone. This guy there gave Orlando Bloom a room. This guy was in manhole in the floor and he went under to see this girl and then his chest and throat were being ripped apart by little hands. Then it was happening everywhere where there was a hole. These babies, or deformed monkeys, would tear you apart. I went to the shop where the computer was and there were lots of emergency vehicles on the road. I checked my downloads again. This hole nearby started opening. I ran outside and this guy in a beanie was there. We were trying to work out what to do."
"2367"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was in bed at home. I was shaking and my eyes were shut together and hurt. I was thinking I would try to have a lucid. I felt something touch my arm and I was thinking that it was Eugene, but nothing else happened."
"2368"	"(2008-09-26 (17)) I was in a hotel like building in the middle of the woods, where I lived. I had my computer there. This guy came and gave me a pack of stuff for my video camera, but I then heard a high frequency squealing, which signaled a bomb about to go off, so I ran. Nothing happened, so I went back to grab some stuff. He came back and we were trying to find out about the bomb. We were looking at photos on the computer and doing a scan on the people's eyes to see if they were a liar. If they were liars their eyes would go red. There was a photo of me and a clown, and the clown's eyes went red. It was actually Jensen Ackles. There was another photo of him and Jared Padalecki, which also scanned red. It meant that they were after us. I grabbed my dream books and we left. This other house blew up."
"2369"	"(2008-09-26 (17)) I was at school. I was waiting for Calvin to come so we could open the time capsule, but he never came. I went to form, which was in some weird place, and this girl gave me the notices. I was alone in the room. When we left, I saw Elijah lining up outside a classroom, which was next to the library [there is no building next to the library] and I joined him. We were doing our practical chemistry exam. We all went in and were given a sheet of paper with experiments on it. The first one involved a Bunsen burner. Autumn did it for me. I had a CD with my music on it. We put it on and Hot in the City was playing. I was reading a list of songs on it, which included Daydream Believer, We Didn't Start the Fire and Strangelove [they were all in my playlist at the time, except for Strangelove which I hadn't heard before] . The next experiment involved seeing how much leg fat you had, which would tell you how many volts your leg could handle by putting these resistor things on your leg. Jeremiah volunteered to do it and we stuffed up and he got electrocuted, but it was only ""640V"" and he was ok. Mr Reilly got Eugene, Bradley, Darius and Alejandro to do it. Darius wrote on the board ""I'm Haley, I'm city and country"". Johanna was then there and made a joke and no-one laughed."
"2370"	"(2008-09-27 (17)) I was outside a shop. Mom wanted me to read this book, but I'd already read it and she didn't believe me. I was then with a guy friend and we were crossing the road from Midvale shops. There was a school across the road which was an all boy's school and an all girl's school in one (although in the dream, this didn't seem odd). Anyone who didn't conform to the gender stereotype was shunned. I was wearing a jacket, so tucked my hair into it so no-one could tell that I was a girl."
"2371"	"(2008-09-27 (17)) I was in my room and there was a big black beetle on my bed, which climbed onto my wall and these little red ones were following it. I sprayed them. Nana and Poppa didn't like something. I found a dream about Dmitri that I didn't write into my book, from the 4/6/06. I was then at this place with some people. It was a school, but it was a bit dodgy. There was a blow-up like playground. I thought something was wrong and there was never food anywhere. There was a cold squishy thing in a hole. Dmitri was there. We were all wandering around and teachers kept asking us which class we had. There was this one dodgy lady teacher who kept turning up. It was lunch time, but we took a long time to sit down to eat. Samantha started eating and then the bell went. We laughed and complained. I asked this girl with chocolate if I could have some. We snuck out of the lunch room to explore. Then we were looking off a ledge and there was a girl, who was Kim (24) but was in another body and Nina Myers (also 24) was also in another body and they were fighting, but Nina had powers. Ezra and I were confused about it. Dmitri was at a table eating. I went and sat next to him, but he was writing or talking about me and told me to move. I didn't know this though and was annoyed. Later we were on an oval place. This guy we were with said my boobs were on a ""nice right angle"" and said they were like a triangle and this other guy agreed. I folded my arms over so they couldn't see. I think the other guy was Chad Michael Murray."
"2372"	"(2008-09-27 (17)) It was night and I was at home by myself. I was in the lounge room watching a movie/TV show. I turned on the lounge room and the dining room lights but they were really dim and I thought of reality checking but thought 'nah, it's not a dream'. I looked out the kitchen window and saw the back of a guy's head, who was sitting down outside. I jumped into the corner of the room, which also had a lot of mess and called Mom. I said there was a guy outside and I was freaking out. She said she'd be over when something was done and I could hear Darren talking in the background. From where I was sitting I could see cars coming down the street. The guy called out to me to turn the 'clicky' thing on (the TV). I called Mom again. I then pressed play and was watching the show. I kept calling Mom. I then thought I saw clothes poking out from the dining room wall, but I figured they were there before. Then they moved back. I heard someone in the kitchen and realized he was inside. I had trouble calling Mom so I text her. She said they were finally coming. It was now daylight. I jumped out of the spot and went to go outside. I was worried about the guy locking the door. He came out of the kitchen and was balding strangely. I argued with him and grabbed him to pull him outside. He tried to let go. I remembered something like this happened before and they disappeared before Mom got here. I took him outside and Mom got there. I yelled at her because it had been like 12 hours and she said she didn't think anyone was here and I said ""I told you there was a man outside!"". The guy gradually turned into a young (20-ish) girl and he explained that he was some creature which ate electricity. Some more of them came out of the neighbour's house. He said we were in an alternate universe where everyone knew about them. He said he tried to make up for scaring me by washing some clothes and making dinner. He also said that people would marry them and they had to turn into them. Then I was watching Red Dwarf, but then at the shops. Lister had disappeared in the last episode. Some guy was walking around with a hood on and it was Lister. He didn't remember anyone and I was thinking 'they've done that enough times'. There was some food that Rimmer had created there. It was gross and it had his face on it. He tried some and spat it out in disgust. They started chasing each other around and Rimmer and I found an entry to some room. There was a picture or something of 'Dave Lister' and something and someone coloured it in stupidly. He then chased us. Then it was Kenny vs Spenny. Spenny was trying to finish it. This girl he liked went to Savannah [someone went to Savannah in an episode of One Tree Hill I watched last night] but had died. He ran down a hall and then Kenny finished it. There was a room with the girl Spenny liked and some others and Kenny was using them as puppets. He said that it wasn't funny. She wasn't really dead. Kenny kissed her and she laughed and said ""ew"" but then continued kissing him."
"2373"	"(2008-09-28 (17)) I had been to this place to get a TER before and passed, but went back to enter another course. I went with Calvin who was sometimes Haley (One Tree Hill). It was in this huge building full of obstacle courses, all physical activity stuff. If you made one mistake you failed. I got to the last obstacle, which was this little playground and had to climb up a rope ladder and go down it. I saw Eugene and his mates and Calvin pointed it out. He was also like ""Oh, I might go to University too"". Eugene waved at us. I went back to get my shoes, when I finished. Then the people there congratulated us and said we passed. I had used a fake ID because I didn't know if you could do it twice. Peyton (One Tree Hill) didn't want something either. They let us off. Then it was episode of Red Dwarf. Rimmer wanted to be a ""matre d"" which was someone who goes out to kill themselves in a war."
"2374"	"(2008-09-29 (17)) I was in a lucid dream (in the dream) with some others. We were in the common room but it was unattached to the school and was different. I said it wasn't really a safe place because of all the glass. It was night. We tried to find weapons but none were around. A girl wished for a chainsaw and one appeared along with some baseball bats so I wished for a chainsaw too. Zombies suddenly came and were walking through the wall. Lots of them came and we were killing them. Jeremiah got bit, so I killed him but later he was ok and kept looking at me strangely. We left and I had wished for a car and me and a girl got in it, but we stopped and there were two zombies in it. I grabbed the girl's gun and tried to shoot. I hit one and missed the other. I couldn't reload. I jumped out of the car and couldn't work the gun out. Other people came and killed the zombies. Someone else wished for these jet ski things. I got on this one called a 'bananarama' and it was yellow and blue and little. Ezra was there. We were driving on a road and there was a bend, on a cliff. I fell off the side of the road, but managed to get back on before going off the cliff (it sort of flew out and got pulled back). I went around it a second time though and fell off and into the water. I wished for a path to the road, but ended up with a rope instead so I climbed up. The way I was climbing meant I was rubbing against the rope and ended up having an orgasm. There was some movie from the 1920's and Granma was in it. It was like Dead Like Me, but was Blazing Saddles and I thought it looked lame so I didn't want to see it. It was also in black and white. At some point we were at a house, which was home and we had no food. We were hiding there from the zombies. Dad had Oreos. I had a couple of biscuits and a piece of toast, which I ate."
"2375"	"(2008-09-29 (17)) I was at a shop waiting for Mom. I bought some muffin cake from the shop and it was pretty and tasted nice. I went to find Mom. I asked someone where she was and then she was behind me."
"2376"	"(2008-09-30 (17)) I was reading about some show and some of the episodes in season one had James Lafferty and Chad Michael Murray in them and also some other actor."
"2377"	"(2008-09-30 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill. Andy found out that he and Karen were related."
"2378"	"(2008-09-30 (17)) I was in my car, which was big and different and I was going to be living in it. I had an apartment at Westland University too. I was setting it up. It was like a game and you had to have a dispenser on the wall, either tampons or condoms. My hair felt gross so I put it under a tap. I called Mom to fix my car. It had stopped working and then it was a bike. I called Dad to bring some stuff. I brushed my hair."
"2379"	"(2008-10-01 (17)) There were zombies. I was with Eugene. I've forgotten most of it, but we were at a house and a few zombies came. There were two people there too. We kept moving between some spaces and zombies would come down the hall and Eugene would kill them. At the back of the house, was a cliff thing made of sand. There was sand down the wall of the house too, and when we threw sand on it, it would react with a spark. We climbed down the cliff, but Eugene and I had to go back. He got to the top first and he grabbed my hand and pulled me up. There were zombies down below and we were throwing sand onto the sand to get them. Some got to this guy (one of the people in the house) and he died. We heard motorbikes and Eugene told me to move stuff around to look messy (to make it look like we had taken over the house). Then Nathan and Haley (both One Tree Hill) were at a school and people were bothering them. Peyton was wearing a mask which was spotty and gross. There was a theatre. A long time later we had a baby. Babies were required to dance in a cot, but we hid her. There was a map of the school. We were trying to work out who was going to 'work' and who was going to stay home with the baby. Then it was Andy and someone's baby. There was a gate, and the baby was behind it. They were trying to trick each other into who was going to stay with the baby. I was watching some bloopers from shows. One was a lady who said ""intelligents"". Another had two guys sitting on chairs and in the middle of a joke they both fell off at the same time and died. Some science fiction show had 8 episodes that crossed over with Red Dwarf. Lister and Rimmer were the only two I recognized. I was trying to talk like Craig Charles by saying ""Dave Lister"" and emphasizing the ""er""."
"2380"	"(2008-10-02 (17)) In One Tree Hill, Dan did something bad to Haley and Nathan. Months later, he was in a car in the carpark of the dealership. There was a Quikeze in the back of the seat and some proof of what he did. Cops came for him. Then Haley (or someone) was racing him. He got surrounded by cops and stopped."
"2381"	"(2008-10-02 (17)) I was at 'school' opening the time capsule. Tiana and Ramona were there, and they were sometimes Calvin and Samantha. Dmitri was still at school. There was a new time capsule in a box. It had Eugene written on it and I was worried someone was going to see it before we opened it. Mr Gutenberg said I had to do a test tomorrow. Jeremiah was there. Some lady's kids were there."
"2382"	"(2008-10-02 (17)) I was somewhere with Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush. Sophia was the daughter of a guy Mom was friends with. Someone said there was a photo of her on the fridge with two girls and Chad. We were on a rooftop and we were doing some in-joke thing, where he would put his arm around her and then he'd do the same thing to me and we laughed."
"2383"	"(2008-10-03 (17)) I went out with Mom and we were walking. We saw Dad and Ezra come out of a building and walk down the steps. We went to this oval and I had to play some game. We had to control these bugs that ate certain things and also had to ride some and go through these circles around the place. The goals were listed like in Miss Management. We had been to the oval place for an excursion before."
"2384"	"(2008-10-03 (17)) I was in an underground carpark and lying in a bay with Eugene and we were making out. We got up and went to another bay. Later, Deb (One Tree Hill) came and had sex with me. I didn't know why I let her."
"2385"	"(2008-10-04 (17)) On One Tree Hill, Haley walked into a room at school. There were three guys around. She was pretty far along in her pregnancy and had a photo of her and Nathan on their wedding day. This guy said she should be ashamed of her last name. Lucas came and attacked the guys. This other guy came and took down all of the guys. They took down a ladder. They were then in a grassed area with benches and people around. Lucas had blood around his mouth. Some other time, Haley and Nathan were talking to Dan. She blurted out that she had feelings for him. It was awkward and he left. She told Nathan that it was true. Later, I was Haley, and I went into a room which was Dan's. He said ""West bank"" and I said ""that's helpful"" and then said ""city bank"" and he said ""good one"" and we laughed. He said something about Deb. I had Mom's phone and it had nice buttons."
"2386"	"(2008-10-04 (17)) Someone was in a bakery or something. Shia LaBeouf was there and someone said he was ""a second Shia"". Someone tried or did kill someone. Someone was chasing me."
"2387"	"(2008-10-05 (17)) A ghost was either getting visited by or visiting girls to kill their boyfriends if they were cheating or betraying them in some way. This woman and her boyfriend were in a building and the ghost came for him and she said ""you're not cheating on me"" but he was and he was killed. Mittens was in an underground area and someone, possibly me, said ""you know I'm shortsighted"". On One Tree Hill, all the main characters were gone. Anna was back and I was annoyed about it. There was a movie with a wave in a building and it had good effects. I showed Mom. I was trying to get Ezra to say ""kill me"" on the phone so it would allow the ghost (who was a girl) to be able to kill anyone. The ghost was in a kitchen and was controlling ghosts or maybe people. There was a knife in the toaster and it got hot. This lady didn't want to kill this girl, so I killed her."
"2388"	"(2008-10-05 (17)) I was at school and it was over. A mural [I can't read it properly so it might not be] had poo on it. I was with Calvin, and we were near Eugene. Calvin was sometimes Ezra. I stuffed up this experiment. There was green stuff. I watched it wash down the corridor. I told this teacher a joke about condoms."
"2389"	"(2008-10-06 (17)) I was doing a quest on Runescape. It was a 'choose your own ending'. Ezra, Roland and another friend of his were there. First I was by myself and there were zombies. I had to right click and press zombify and then quickly kill them and save something. I got bit. I was then in a shop/museum and I had to get something. Also this fat kid stole some yoghurt. I got in the car. There was another place and all of us were together. I had finished the quest and gotten the reward which was three lots of 70,000gp. There was a room with a king and a person we had to release. I walked past and we were looking for the key to take a car. Someone saw us and we ran. We went into the water and they came after us with a canoe. We took a canoe. We had to pick two random colours and/or numbers. I climbed up a ladder. Darren said something to us. We were then little and in a fridge in a kitchen. We had to make food for this old lady. There was a still picture of a cat. Ezra got this same ending."
"2390"	"(2008-10-06 (17)) I was with the school at some hotel place. I got room 264 and I was by myself. There were three other lots of beds in the room (they were in lots of two, so there were eight beds). Later some Asian guy had to join me. Mom came and was helping me set up. These other people came in and joined their friends (other people now were staying in the room). The balcony was next to my bed and we looked out the window and saw this ugly couple in a tree, kissing. They started taking their clothes off and Mom yelled to them and they said ""oh, do you have a child in there?"" and so they only took their pants off. There was a magazine on the bed with Sophia Bush on the cover. I went downstairs to this place with someone. We saw some dogs outside and then ran into this stairwell. I closed the door as they got there. We ran and hid in this big office like room. The door was clear. We looked to see if they were coming. They weren't so I ran out to the elevator. A dog came and I kept pressing the button so the elevator would close but people kept coming in. Eventually the dog left, but I kept missing my floor because of the close button. It was there when I got to my floor but someone hit it on the head. I went to my room and the Asian guy was actually a dog."
"2391"	"(2008-10-08 (17)) It was a long time after there had been a zombie outbreak. I was with James Lafferty, who was my boyfriend. I was at some place with people from school. I had to go under water to get this thing with a sticky thing and pick something up, it was a game. There were kittens and puppies and I had them in separate sections. This girl had been training kittens and bunnies to turn them against us. We ran away. We were in a field and this guy came and helped us. We went to this place to do a trade. The guy came on a plane. There was an auction and we bought him for $500,000. There was a submarine and a guy with axes. He cut a guy's arm off and we ran. We went into a building and I could see waves out the window. They were really big and people were swimming. There was an elevator which was voice activated. I said I didn't trust it because some numbers were dodgy. There was a room with computer chips and we were then small (the chips were bigger than us). A guy who was normal size was fixing a computer. We got out and I had my arm around James. We went to a shop."
"2392"	"(2008-10-08 (17)) I think this dream carried on from the last one (there had been zombies). There was a picture, except it was a video of the Red Dwarf cast and I was painting over it with white, leaving only Chris Barrie and Norman Lovett's face. We were outside a house. A car was coming. People would look for people who were under 18 as they didn't like them out after a certain time. I was 18. We all ran back inside, but they saw us and called us out. Three of the people I was with were under 18, but they thought that we were younger and so took us. I had to go in the car with the leader. I asked why I had to go and he said he was going to be my boyfriend and I said ""I already have one, I'm married"". He dropped me off at home with food and said he would be back. The phone didn't work. The lights in my room weren't working either. The house was clean and we had a computer in the house that kept it clean. I ended up in a building trying to send a video message to James Lafferty, who was my boyfriend again, to help me. The guy who owned the building though was dodgy and he called me Ackles and I thought 'I'm not going out with Jensen Ackles' and because of this I realized he was bad. He said ""good try"". I ran from there and got outside. Then it was sometimes a TV show. There was an accident outside. A parcel was let out. I found an underground place looking for James. There was a game and I had to climb up a ladder and couldn't fall in the lava underneath and then I had to go through the door. I eventually did it and had to go over the same tiles as the guy in front of me. I didn't, but I passed anyway. Then a friend of mine owned some place and gave me a 'bed' which was actually a lounge and had a cow print like pattern, which reminded me of my bed at Mom's. The guy who had captured me before had a room across from my lounge though. There was a big area full of chairs (mine was there too) and there a couple of actual rooms on the side but they were expensive and hard to get. I went to see someone I knew and I said ""I'm 18"". Then something was happening and supposedly everyone was going to be there so I was going to go to find James."
"2393"	"(2008-10-09 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill. Carrie and someone in the Scott family or close to the family had become friends with her and they brought her to Nathan and Haley's house. She said she was getting help now and these other people at the house tried to get rid of her before Haley saw her there. Nathan had an apron on and was covered in chocolate as he was making a cake or something. They tried to stop her going in the kitchen, but Haley saw her and got angry demanding that she leave. Then a few kids were there and they were all boys. I couldn't remember who was who. Keith was there too. I said he wouldn't be able to raise his kid. Haley and Nathan had had a new son and it was just born and it had a ring on, which looked huge and like it was going to fall off and I was like ""Ew, why does a newborn have a ring on?""."
"2394"	"(2008-10-09 (17)) I was at school. This lady decided to take us for a drive while dropping Elijah off at his house. Bradley and Theodore were also in the car. After she dropped Elijah off, she asked if I wanted to go home so I told her to go behind North Midvale and she thought it was far away. Bradley went to sleep with his head on my arm, I tried to move it but decided to leave him, so I tried to take a photo but I couldn't position my phone properly. She went to drop Theodore off and made me, Bradley and some people go in. She made this girl called Alice, who was then me, pretend to be a scientist and Bradley went off to be an assistant. There was a balloon outside this classroom. The building was round and so just outside the classroom was a round outside area where the balloon was. These people were supposed to tell me what colour it went by doing certain things to this thing inside. It went green by leaving it and smelled bad. It went yellow/gold with these things in little cardboard boxes. This girl burnt the next one which screwed it up and we had to start again. I then left, but got lost. I found this colourful little playground and I took a photo of it. I then tried to find my way out. Eventually I ended up back at the playground and noticed a gigantic one next to it. Jamison had his head through a hole in the playground. I thought we had been there before. It had a cool waterslide. We all kept going on it and Dad and Ezra were there too. Then I was there with the school. There were photos of us. Bradley was acting weird and supposedly liked me. I couldn't find my shoes. I had taken them off at one point. I asked a lady if she had seen them. Then I had no shirt on. This person had my Beatles shirt so I put it on while I sat on some stairs. I went to the place again at a later time and got a locker. At the end of my trip there I was packing stuff and putting things in certain boxes. I was going out with someone and packing for them too -- shampoo, hair dye etc. Mom was there and was helping me pack."
"2395"	"(2008-10-11 (17)) I was looking out a window at the moon. It looked huge because of a light from a building that was on. You could see all the detail. I went to take a photo but they turned off the light. Later, the light was back on but they took it away again and then it rained. Mom and Darren were there too."
"2396"	"(2008-10-11 (17)) I was with Mom. She had been friends with The Spice Girls. I asked her how they became friends. Then we were in a car and Feels Like I'm in Love was playing. I was singing along to it. Ezra was in the back. The guys from Entourage were in there too. Someone told Vince I had liked him when I was younger and he was teasing and flirting with me. Eric said ""there's a problem, you, Vince"" and I said ""I was going to say that"". He wanted to go to this Chinese restaurant. Turtle did something for me and I said ""Thanks Turtle"". This girl hurt her leg and she was a cheerleader. Some people were undercover somewhere."
"2397"	"(2008-10-11 (17)) Samantha, Calvin and I had these capes and when we put them on we turned small. Calvin grabbed onto the back of a car and we grabbed on and were flying around as it drove. We ended up getting off at this busy street because we were getting too far away and I said we should get back. We were in a grassy patch in the middle. There were two lanes on either side of it. At the top of the road going back towards home there were then stairs leading up to a gate. There was a black prisoner there and he tried to stop us. Then I was at a house with Dad, Ezra, Nana and Poppa. Nana put a raw sausage on a plate and said it was dog. I said I wasn't going to eat dog and said ""dogs are for pets and chickens are mostly for eating... unless you're Asian"". Nana said we had eaten it before without knowing. I left. I went with Mom and Uncle Vic was at Granma's and I had read this on Wikipedia about how it happened (it hadn't happened yet). We stopped at a deli."
"2398"	"(2008-10-12 (17)) We were going to a cinema. Ezra had been driving really fast and went through a wire fence and I said ""this isn't GTA"". We parked in this dodgy place in the bush. There was a fence around that and we found holes in the electric fence and got to the cinema. We had brought water with us but it was half empty. It was almost time for the movie to start. I went to buy snacks but Dad went somewhere and I said he has the money so I went to him and asked. He gave me a $20 note (but later it was a $90 note) and wanted a Yorkshire pudding and instructions of heating it. I ordered myself a water bottle. I had to hold bottles for Dad and Ezra too and they didn't carry much. Some lady told us to put our right index finger on our forehead sideways to see who was stupid. It was a Red Dwarf joke and she said that people who couldn't do it would get holowhipped. Dad and Ezra were then wearing red and green costumes, respectively, from The Dark Knight and I said that it was lame that people were dressing up. I saw a bunch of people going into a cinema so I followed them. It was number 26, which happened to be playing the same movie we were seeing. It was really fancy. The lights went dim and off as we went in. Dad sat next to some person dressed as a furry animal. It was packed and only a few lone chairs were spare. Ezra and I sat a few seats behind him. I gave Ezra his Coke. My water was in a red sports drink bottle and I took a drink but it was a disgusting juice and I almost vomited. I couldn't find water anywhere. I took Dad's drink and took a drink but it was something gross as well. On the screen, a short film of The Importance of Being Earnest was playing. I was then driving down the hill on our street. I had had a few drinks and ended up crashing the car. I was with Mom. I was then at home. I was on the phone to a cop and I was upset. The guy tried to calm me. They then came over. They made me take a breathalyzer and I had to take big breaths. It said I'd only had one drink but this was due to time wearing it off. They tested this red jacket that was in the car and it said I'd had four drinks, but I'd actually had two. I thought you only got in trouble if it was over the limit (I wasn't). Later I was in bed at Mom's, which was different, with some guy and we were making out and I was thinking he was the cop from before but he looked different. There were some bunnies at the front door and I was putting them in a cage."
"2399"	"(2008-10-13 (17)) This guy I knew and I started going out. Then it was a movie, but sometimes not. He left his house and Penny (Big Bang Theory) moved into a new house and later left. She then got a castle and had some thing at the very bottom. It rained and flooded and I had written my dream from the night on a shirt so I grabbed it. There was only one room with walls that wasn't part of the castle. The dream rubbed off. There were outtakes and rabbits were running away from Jared Padalecki."
"2400"	"(2008-10-13 (17)) I was at school. It was a huge building and it been painted white with bits of black."
"2401"	"(2008-10-14 (17)) I was watching Entourage. Ari and his wife had a specialty shop each in a shopping centre. Hers was a general store. There was a new shop opening and Ari was giving his shop a facelift. He and his wife were competitors and they were getting people to run between them. He went over and realized and sobbed to someone saying ""I've really made a mess haven't I?"" and then they were trying to work it out. Zachary Levi had married this ugly woman and had twins."
"2402"	"(2008-10-15 (17)) I had this girl friend and I liked her brother and thought he liked me. We were in this place which had chairs going down in steps, and a stage at the bottom. She was on a quiz show and had just won the latest episode. Dad asked me if it would be ok if she won again and I was like 'yeah, why wouldn't it be?'. We grabbed some stuff and left. We were in this carpark with the school at this place. I thought we were doing some Runescape thing. I wrote something on my foot. Elijah, Ezra and others came through this small space near some stairs. I started miming Tongue Tied and doing the motions. This girl saw me and was wondering what I was doing. I walked around the stairs. We had to these activities and take photos of us doing them. There was a trampoline and Silas was on it. There was a shelf with stuff on it just next to it. I got the camera off it. There was a photo of Silas, Samantha and someone. There were photos of me and Ezra when we were younger too."
"2403"	"(2008-10-16 (17)) I went for a drive with Mom and we went to some underground carpark, then to someone's house. They had these weird things for the pool. They were long, grassy, green things that were used as 'tubes'. We went back to the car and there was an alcohol/drug tester bus. Mom called out to me that she was ready to go and we left and didn't get stopped (by calling out she was pretending she had been tested). I had an email from Roland and it was signed ""love""."
"2404"	"(2008-10-16 (17)) This guy could talk to some fish thing through mind reading. Only one person could do it and it was whoever had the highest 'level'. If someone went into the area and had a lower ability they would die. This teenager guy called Duncan, who was hot, went in but the guy pushed him out and I went in. I was ok though. It turned out that the guy, Duncan and I had exactly the same level."
"2405"	"(2008-10-16 (17)) Some family had organized for their daughter to marry Dad, but heard something about him before hand and said no. I went there to talk to the girl (now it was me that was supposed to marry her I think) and the mother yelled at me because she thought I was going to get up and go the father who had just pulled up. The daughter yelled at her and said she wanted to go with me. We all sat down to talk. They complained because I didn't go to church anymore and I was going to say 'church and God suck"" but I said I didn't have to go to church to ""prove my love for God"". I felt like an idiot saying that and having them think I was Christian, but it was the easiest thing to do. This older lady told me I should wear shorter shorts and do some cheer thing and I said ""or not""."
"2406"	"(2008-10-17 (17)) I was at school. I don't know what I did for most of the day but at Lunch 2 I did something that prevented me from eating my lunch. Then I remembered I had to do an exam at noon so I quickly started eating my sandwich. Ms Pascal said hello and asked if I was ""mighty awesome"" and this girl giggled and said to a friend, ""Did you hear that? Mighty Awesome!"" and they said it was that guy from Chuck (Captain Awesome). I got to the front office, which was different and threw the crust into the bin, but it hit someone's burger on the table and I was thinking they weren't going to like that. I went into the room to do my exam and Ms Solomon and Ms Madsen gave me the questions. Autumn was doing Applicable Maths and the exam too. The first question was ""gobble"". I got my calculator, ruler and notes out of my bag. The people doing the year book had a secret room with a picture of a girl who was killed by a drugged up guy and was the same guy who killed a guy called Jimmy Edwards [name of character in One Tree Hill, but unrelated] . I was looking at the pictures and there were profile photos of Chris Barrie, Milo Ventimiglia and Martin Sheen. There was a joke about Martin Sheen and him winning lots of rewards. Some guy's restaurant/shop had a back room with books in it. A cop was looking around the shop but ignoring the room. I said ""shouldn't you be checking in there?"". The guy got worried. There was a problem with the electrical wires and I was crawling on the floor and hit one that was uncovered with my finger and it burnt and left a mark. Dad told me to rub it on the floor and it hurt so he was showing me how hard to press."
"2407"	"(2008-10-18 (17)) I was watching Ugly Betty. Daniel and Betty were going out. They were kissing. He put on a black jacket and someone got this UV light and it had stains on it. He had black stuff around his eyes [episode I watched last night, Alexis did] . He had a baby, but it wasn't his [in the same episode, it was discovered Daniel Jr. wasn't his] ."
"2408"	"(2008-10-18 (17)) I was at Mom's, but it was different. I was on the balcony and so was Spaceman. There were no rails on it. He was sniffing something. I picked it up and was going to throw it over the balcony, but threw it inside instead and he ran after it. I said I was glad I didn't throw it over."
"2409"	"(2008-10-19 (17)) I was watching some show. Kyle MacLachlan was in it as a detective guy. He discovered the murders weren't by people so he left. There was an ugly girl character and it was her 17th birthday. Her parents made her stay in her room. She was lying in bed and turned up her music. It was night. She asked for someone to join her. There was a tree at the window. The roots came in and said ""can I come in?"" and then it shoved its roots through her and she ended up at the roof and she died. Later I was in a field with some guy. There were a few houses and he thought this one we were near housed the bad guys. I thought it was the other one and there was something about Henry DeTamble (The Time Traveler's Wife book) living there or something. We went there. Then this girl and I snuck in a hole behind a bar in the house. The people were in the same room and were saying that he shouldn't have taken notes of some scores from 1969. There was a guy and a girl. One of us made a noise and they heard us. The girl grabbed a bottle as a weapon, but when she saw us she just laughed. We came out. I don't know what happened then, but they gave us a drink of water. I was suspicious of the drink so didn't drink it, but the girl I was with did. I asked her if she was sleepy, but she fell back and I grabbed her but then she was Tigger. I was then trying to escape with Tigger. There were two different ways to run. One took longer to get to exit and had guards, but I chose that one. As I ran past, the 'camera' turned to them and one said ""why do they always choose this way?"". I got to the exit and put Tigger down because she was annoyed and she walked back the other way, so I went back to get her. I took a car and started driving. I was going fast and couldn't control it. I decided to pull over and this other car was pulled over already so I had to drive a little further. There were three kids and one was called Haley and she was homeless and asked if she could go with me and I said yeah. The streets were surrounded by trees. There was a sign in German or something. Then I was at home and we were getting ready to go to Mom's. This guy was there and we freaked because he was the bad guy and he said we had to stay with him."
"2410"	"(2008-10-20 (17)) There was a program to do morphs between two celebrities. There was another thing I found. There two photos of this girl and one was darker and the other was lighter. The lighter one was crisper looking and she had shiny lips. I did a morph of Mom and Dad. I put random settings so it had green eyes and purple lips."
"2411"	"(2008-10-21 (17)) I was checking my emails and I had heaps. I had an email from a social networking site, saying ""Eugene Pritchard has added you as a friend"". I got excited and checked his profile. He had photos up but they were bad quality. One of them he was holding a blue toothbrush in a strange pose and I was thinking 'who takes pictures like that' and I noticed that the toothbrush was the same as Dad's. I noticed he had these necklaces on and I was thinking 'damn, I thought you were perfect!'. I didn't know if I wanted to see more, but I did anyway. There were photos with him wearing earrings too and I was deeply upset and his turns on were listed as ""braininess, piercings, tattoos"" etc. I was annoyed about this."
"2412"	"(2008-10-21 (17)) It was Friday and we got up ready for school. The day before were at Mom's. I answered the door saying ""I like chickens"". This serious Spanish-like guy was there to get money off Mom because Dad had borrowed a stolen car because he had been in an accident in his car. Some time later my car was in the garage but it was there sideways underneath the roller door. Ezra was in the passenger seat and made it go forward and then back and I told him not to. I wondered how it got there. Dad closed the door but then it was inside the garage normally. I sat in the front and Ezra was in the back. It was then a convertible and the top was down, but part of it was sticking up. I was wondering why we weren't taking the work van, but remembered it was Monday. It drove really smoothly. I asked Dad to leave the cars out of the way so I could go for a drive later. Some dude took the stolen car as we left. We got to school but it was 7.49am, which was late and Dad drove through this park and went in this really dodgy way to get there, but it was totally different. I then remembered I wasn't going today and Dad said he'd drop me off at Mom's afterwards because he had stuff to do. I asked why he didn't tell me I wasn't going earlier. As we drove back through the school I saw people walking in. I saw Alejandro, Bradley, Darius and Evelyn. I looked for Eugene but remembered he came from a different way. Instead of going to Mom's, we ended up in this dodgy, grey city. There were a lot of high roads and tall grey buildings and was really creepy. I asked where we were. There was no good music on, so I checked the old music stations and Maybellene was playing. I sang along to ""oh Maybellene"" and then said ""I can't believe I didn't know Chuck Berry was black"" and Dad replied ""I don't see what's so great about blacks"". I sang along again to ""Maybellene, why can't you be true, oh Maybellene"". The Angels Listened In also played along with this other really catchy song. We went to a car yard place to get dads car. He gave the lady at the entrance booth a receipt."
"2413"	"(2008-10-21 (17)) I went for a drive with Mom pretty far away. We went to this shop and Mom bought some stuff and asked if I wanted to get an ice-cream from the shop. I said I wanted cookies and cream. We were at the top of the shop, and there was a big slope going down to the bottom, so I slid down that. It was also really cool in the shop. There was an ice-cream shop at the bottom as well. Mom didn't get one from the shop, so we were looking in there. There was other random stuff in there and pies. I asked Mom if the one I wanted was in date and she poured pepper and other spices into it, because she thought there was a lid on top of it, and this would tell you if it was ok. She had ruined it so I told her we should go. Outside the shop, I had a bicycle. I was getting my licence. We were riding it and people were in my way and I kept almost crashing. This lady was stroking her hair in front of me and wouldn't move. This other guy smiled at me and also wouldn't move. The L-plate came off. We finally managed to get out of the carpark. Mom had to go back to get the car. This British guy was hanging around. It was 3.24pm and once we started driving we realized we had forgotten to get Ezra and we were supposed to pick him up at 11am."
"2414"	"(2008-10-22 (17)) I was at school. I had planned to sign out. I went to the office at the time I wanted to leave. Calvin was there to sign out too. Ms Atkinson was there and she was going to eat lunch and told me to fill out the slip. I asked the other office ladies if they would sign it and they said ""you're just going to put it in your pocket"" (accusing me of being a liar) and I said ""What am I going to do, eat it?"" and they laughed. I went. I started walking and then saw Ezra and Emery. Mom's car was behind them but I didn't see it behind Ezra. Then we were at a shop or something with Granma and Mom and they were in a relationship I think."
"2415"	"(2008-10-23 (17)) Mom took me home. There was a plane in the sky so I jokingly said that it was going to crash. It then went down and there was a loud noise and then lots of smoke. We freaked out and then drove closer to see it better."
"2416"	"(2008-10-23 (17)) I was at school handing in my English stuff and I was told I actually needed to hand in one more."
"2417"	"(2008-10-23 (17)) I was playing Runescape. I was getting attacked and lost of heaps of health and died but I only had gay items on me."
"2418"	"(2008-10-24 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different, and in my room. I decided to put pictures of hot guys on my wall. I had these pictures in my diary and they were of Michael Palin and James Spader but also one of Terry Jones. The wall I was going to put them on was in my cupboard. I left to do something and when I came back Mom was in there looking around. I was then taking them down and they were blu-tacked there."
"2419"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was reading a book which was online. People were voting for the comedian who had the funniest quotes. Rik Mayall was number one at the moment. Chris Barrie and Will Arnett were on the list as well. Will's joke was ""the only way to inhibit a dwarf is with a club"" which was really funny. Chris' picture was disco like and he was wearing glasses."
"2420"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was walking with Ezra near home. We saw police and a car and thought it was Santiago's but it was his brother's. It was a yellow car. I had to walk past to get 'home'. Then I was a guy who knew the guy who owned the car. I was an inspector and this cop guy told me I couldn't get inside, call anyone or travel."
"2421"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was at home. This girl always used the same movie and notes for essays and things. There was a gay movie with gay sex in it. There was a nice desk in the movie. Two more people had taken my quiz and I had a comment. They said ""bald isn't hot"". Ezra was around. We had this meat thing for dinner and then another meat thing, rice and salad like stuff and a nice chocolate thing for dessert. Ezra was tired."
"2422"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was at this guy's house. His mother didn't like me. She thought I ""killed Duran Duran"". She called the cops on me. She asked if I was drunk that night and I said I didn't know because I had had drinks one of those nights. She thought I broke a guitar. We were upstairs and we both turned and I hit her and she fell down the stairs and died, but had a smile on her face, because she 'knew' I'd get in huge trouble for it. Out the back were some broken cupboards."
"2423"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was going through the chemistry exam, checking my mark. I saw I hadn't answered a multiple choice question so I circled it with the correct answer. It was question 23 and the answer was 'C'."
"2424"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was at home. In the pool, I had a fake crocodile lying on a real one. I looked out through the games room door and saw the real one was upside down and I thought it was dead. It then flipped around and I realized it was alive. There were kittens out the back. One was a cute little brown and white one. The crocodile went to eat it. I banged on the door and it ran away. I went outside and took the kitten inside. I showed Dad. We looked out the games room window and saw there were eight more feeding off their ma. One was purple-y with stripes and a black one with bits of white. I needed to save them. Tigger was outside too. I called the place I got the crocodile from and they said they would get it soon and I said I needed to get rid of it now. It started slamming into the door to get inside. It eventually did and I punched it. It stopped moving and Dad said it might not be dead and I ripped its head off and said that they didn't have to worry about it now."
"2425"	"(2008-10-27 (17)) I went to a newsagency. Dad was waiting outside in the car. It was night. I had $10. I got the Dolly Diary and some other stuff. The guy behind the counter reminded me of Rosso (Freaks and Geeks). It came to $11.10 so I said I had to get some more money. I asked Dad and he threw it on the ground and there was lots of money on the ground so I was grabbing some."
"2426"	"(2008-10-27 (17)) I was at an Indian wedding place. Me and a male friend decided to play a joke and so as the couple came out, we went through the shop pretending we were getting married. Later I was at school, which was different, and all these characters from Freaks and Geeks came. Some of them weren't real ones. They were people I'd gone to school with. I said ""now Linda Cardellini will turn up"" and she did. It had been ten years since we all saw each other. Linda had gone out with James Franco's character and was still in love him. She was calling him Brendan though. I was looking for Jason Segel. I went to find James. He was sitting on a bench in the middle of the oval (which was hilly) with a friend called Mark. I said ""Bobby"" and then Mark, who was really annoying, and I had a short argument, then he left. James was Bobby from Twin Peaks. I asked him to talk to Linda and he agreed."
"2427"	"(2008-10-27 (17)) I was at school. I thought it was home time and went to walk out, but then Lorelei sat down on the path outside the front of the office and started eating. It was only 11am. I wondered why we were here since we had finished and so I called Mom to get me. She was hesitant but I was like ""We graduated!"" so she came. I was waiting with Lorelei. She gave me this little white thing as a graduation present. As I walked to Mom's car, I looked back and saw Darius, Eugene and lots of other people there. When I got in the car I commented on this to Mom."
"2428"	"(2008-10-28 (17)) It was this week but it was the last week of school. I was annoyed because they had said last week was the last week. We didn't do any work and just mucked around and it was really boring. On Wednesday Dad went to get breakfast from the shop. Mom picked me and Ezra up and we went back to her house. I decided I was going to go back to bed and go into school at 4pm for graduation practice. There were three water bottles on the kitchen sink."
"2429"	"(2008-10-29 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and we were on our way to her place, but had only just left home. She stopped on the side of the road. This car pulled up next to us, a car length away with two people in the car. Then, another car pulled up in the middle of us, and this one had Lafayette (True Blood) in it. I said ""Two of em!"". They did their thing and then I was in the back seat. Mom put this envelope on the back floor on my side. I looked at it. She had made it up. It said Sasha Wyatt with a face on it. It was to me from Westland University and was green. It had money in it and she gave it to me because it was a lot of money and she couldn't do anything with it. I was then at her house and I was complaining that I wasn't going to get into university because I was going to get a low TER. She said that it was my fault and I said I know, but that I could've done well in the exams but it wasn't going to boost me enough. She asked why I put veterinary science first and I said that it was still what I wanted to do most though I knew I wasn't getting in. Then I was Dad and Ezra in the car. We saw Samantha walking on Princess Rd at the park, so Dad asked if she wanted a lift. She got in the back, behind the passenger. The time capsule was there so I moved it. I had written who I had liked on a small piece of paper and it was on the top and said ""Kohler"" and I was worried she was going to say something. She lived at an apartment block and I walked her up. I kept leaving my bag and running back for it. Her father didn't like people coming into the area so we left."
"2430"	"(2008-10-29 (17)) I was sitting outside the front of a house. It was empty, and it was surrounded by a fence, except for the side with the driveway, which was on the left side of the house (if you were looking at it). I had my bag and it was fully of sandwiches which were moldy. I was taking them out and I had two good sandwiches in there but they weren't wrapped so I decided not to eat them. I had a huge pile of moldy sandwiches next to me. Teacher-M-08 walked past the house (the side with no fence) and I quickly got up and tried to leave. He had this ability to 'glamour' which meant he could control you. It was a form of population control. We were in a desert like area, but there was a grassy oval up a hill just across the road from the house. The area was surrounded by a track and this train cart thing would go all the way around it. Some times an 'alarm' was sounded and everyone would then try to get on. If you got on it would suddenly go really fast at the end, but if you made it you were safe and could glamour. People would also try to get on if others were trying to glamour them. I started walking towards the oval. I was standing next to two teenagers. Teacher-M-08 was watching me and was told to glamour one of us. We started running to the track. There was a hill with step like things that you had to run up, to get to the track and it seemed like it was pushing you back, and it was really difficult. I got onto it but it went too fast and I fell off. Then it was a movie or something. This boy got hurt on it and was at some authority's house while he was healing. Teacher-M-08 was outside but the windows were tinted and you couldn't glamour through the tint. Teacher-M-08 told him he was ""forever immortal"". There was a track inside the house. The boy asked this lady what happened at the end and she said ""you end up in hospital"". It was rigged at the end, so no-one ever got to it. The kid was determined to get to the end though and he did. Somehow he was alright and was now able to make people into these faded images and the glamourers were confused and couldn't glamour them. Now, everyone could do what they wanted. These two girls were hugging. One stopped and said she liked men and only went to ""her kind"" when she was desperate. The boy was now older and was sitting back and he could do whatever he wanted."
"2431"	"(2008-10-30 (17)) I was at school, which was different, and it was graduation night. It was an undercover area. Ms Braun started singing and dancing to Tongue Tied, so I joined in doing the movements too. I had to sign a sheet to allow it to be released afterwards (it was being recorded). Eugene was there and looked really upset/angry. I was sitting on a lounge near him and wanted to take photos but he kept moving. Darius was on a chair. Ezra grabbed Darius's shoe and threw it and he just sat there. I got it and threw it back over. Mom and Darren got there and I wasn't in the right clothes so told Mom we had to go now and I ran really fast through this grassed area. I saw Elijah. Fly was playing ""I want to get away, I want to fly away"" and I thought it was fitting. I still hadn't got pants or shoes. It was 6.43pm and it started at 7pm and I wasn't ready. There were chairs on the stage and I helped to arrange them. Evelyn asked me about the funny stuff I'd written down in class and if it was in my diary and I said no. I was worried her parents would see her talking to me. Mom had called some teacher guy about how I was going in Biology and I wasn't doing well. I said it was because one of the assignments was for me to watch Red Dwarf and I loved it. Mom said it was average and I said it was hilarious. Then at school there was a Red Dwarf section. There was a picture of Rimmer with a big mouth and a story about Lister. Boys and girls had to all go into the same toilet. I was waiting outside but had to go in and some people were naked and I was grossed out. I had to go to the toilet but the cubicles were all open ones so I didn't go. We were in the carpark. Mom asked if I knew the guy I like's car and I said ""Yeah, and he's here with his mother, father (Abraham) and brother (Rodney)"" and Mom asked ""sister?"" and I said he didn't have one. I saw Eugene's car on the other side of the carpark."
"2432"	"(2008-10-30 (17)) This guy had a picture of himself in a red room. He was in a hotel. He didn't remember anything that happened before the photo, which was recent. He went to a car yard and it asked how many years he'd been playing 'Pokey' and he said eight years because he could get a free car (for lease). It was a scabby car though. The guy worked there was gay and they became friends. He had an argument with his boss and the guy let him stay with him. He was getting changed and the gay guy had no shirt on and the straight guy had no clothes, so put on a pink shirt of the gay guy's. This girl (who was a love interest) came up and saw them and thought there was something going on (jokingly) and walked out. She thought it was funny. He was driving with her and was looking somewhere and drove off the bridge. He was trying to get her out of the car and he ended up dying and she was ok."
"2433"	"(2008-10-30 (17)) I hadn't eaten my dinner at Mom's, so I was trying to get her to get me something to eat [this happened last night too] ."
"2434"	"(2008-10-31 (17)) I was at school. I had to do this chemistry experiment but it was with plants and I had to make the plant make music and explain why it did. It made music, but I only got one mark for each answer (there was a total of 10 marks). I got back the work and they were all like 2% for each."
"2435"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We got to her house and it was different. Quincy and a friend of his came over and his friend was made to stay in the car with me. Mom wanted to keep an eye on him as she said no friends of Quincy had been good. There were some biscuits in a bag and Mom said ""I want some biscuits"" and the friend jokingly took them. Mom was telling him a story of someone coming to the door to tell us to watch Supernatural."
"2436"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) Dad and I ended up somewhere and found this cheap hotel. There weren't many people. We got room 12. We got to where it was supposed to be, but there was a just a wall with a kitchen look to it and an oven. There was a thing at back to turn and I was worried about flames. It clicked and opened and there was the room. It had stingy blankets."
"2437"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was reading about Jeremy Piven and there was something about 'half a neck'. I asked Mom if she remembered Dad talking about Ari and she said yeah and I said ""no you don't""."
"2438"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was in a shop like building. I thought I was daydreaming. Sometimes people from school were there. We were going somewhere on buses and they sent two groups. I was in the same group as Calvin, Eugene and Dmitri. I was thinking this plane was going to crash and then bonding would occur between Eugene and I. Everyone split up though. Rebekah was sent into the lower school bus. I then had no pants on and as Ms Pascal locked up the doors I said ""Wait!"" and decided not to go. I put on pants and changed my mind and ran back out. Ezra was there and I asked ""are they still there"" and he said ""yes"". They were gone though. I ran down the street and saw the bus turn down the next street. It was dark and the buses had lights all over them. I saw a broken bus just outside with a note on it saying it'd take one month to repair. I went back and told this lady who worked at the school. As I was talking I saw a bus appear on another road (the road with the broken down bus had a bit of bush land behind it, and then other road). I saw a colourful portal like thing. The buses were coming back. The people were dressed in old-fashioned clothes. I said ""you must've gone through some kind of time warp"". They want back through the portal. Dad ran out of the building, but then it wasn't Dad. There were zombies. The guy (who had been Dad) stabbed them with a knife. I asked for one. I said 'don't we have to cut their heads off?'. When I cut them, it felt like cutting nothing. We finally killed this batch and then all these people started eating the dead bodies and started turning into zombies. I chopped this guys head off and then I yelled ""No!"" and I clicked on something and exited the area (it was a game now). I ended up in this underground part of a house. There were two groups. One had an option to talk to them. I had to block the door with dragons and I decided it was too hard and stressful and gave up. It was a quest on Runescape."
"2439"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. Emery was trying to take a photo of my Wiki. Some little girl friend of Mom's was around. Later, Darren was driving down this road with forest on either side. I was telling him to slow down because I had heaps of Christmas presents, ""this is Nana's and this is dads"". There was a bit of sand covering a section of the road and it had grass and frogs in it too. It was there to block the rest of the road. Darren maneuvered through it, there were people scattered in it too. He was just hitting them. At the end he stopped and got arrested. Mom got 'points' but Ezra and I didn't get in trouble."
"2440"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I had been staying at Eugene's and going back there at like 2am. I was sleeping in his room but in another bed. The bedspread was Indiana Jones themed, but it wasn't the 'real' Indiana Jones. The guy would talk to himself and talk to a Family Guy post on the wall, which voted for a different Indiana Jones. Later we had graduation. We all got crowded into some building and didn't know where to go. Ezra was there. He came back to Eugene's too. Eugene got bad results -- he got 3% for two subjects. There was a video of him and some Spanish joke about 'Kevin's county'. There was a girl who looked like Colleen. Cuddles was in a school and she was doing well at math and was ""inquisitive"". Mom was there as well."
"2441"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I was watching a boxing match with Ezra. It was a girl vs guy. The girl got the guy down and he ended up dying. His name was like Michael Spinocolli or something. I thought he was a race car driver for some reason. Later I was reading about him and his name was actually Ben McCallum. Later I was with Mom driving and I realized it was Ben from Big Brother, but his name was Brett, sometimes Brendan. I realized when it said he was from Midvale. I was telling Mom and she was in shock too. His profile picture was of a black-ish guy."
"2442"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I was at school, which was different and we were sleeping there. I was next to Calvin and some girl. We had to be inside by a certain time or we got in trouble. The girl and I were outside and we went to the toilet. I waited outside for her and then we went back to the school and then I realized I needed to go to the toilet. I asked the teacher and went back. There was 'platinum' toilet paper. People worked in the toilet. I went back and there were little pineapple lollies. We ate them. I had photos of Eugene. We had both been stuck somewhere and I had saved him but he hadn't spoken to me at all. There was some guy called Piggy and a friend of his died. He said that if he died he'd only be remembered as 'Piggy'. But he had helped me through something and I thought I'd remember him for more."
"2443"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I was on Facebook. Mom posted a photo of her, me and Ezra. A lady commented saying that ""those are my kids"". We had a long argument over it and I think she eventually realized we weren't."
"2444"	"(2008-11-03 (17)) I was playing a Mario game. I called it Super Mario Sunshine a few times. It started off as a race and I had to collect stuff on the way. You had to collect people (celebrities) and coins and other stuff that was scattered around. You got stars (like in Mario games). I won the race the first time but skipped a lot of the stuff. I tried another time and there was Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore and some other girl. The other girl had to take Neve's place and wear a weird hat. There was a wood slope up and you had to be Beaver Mario to get up. There was a platform with holes, which was covered in people. Dad came home and had no pants on. I told him and he put a shirt on. I told him I was playing because I was going to study later and it was boring."
"2445"	"(2008-11-03 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different. I was on a balcony and it was apartment like. We had a cover thing and they put it down. Darren was there. I went downstairs and there was a jumper. I pressed ctrl-c and it turned out smaller -- it was a setting. Mom had gone on my computer and seen my Chris Barrie desktop. She was telling Darren later and said she ""had no clue"". I had been in some Red Dwarf episodes and I was thinking I wasn't funny or good enough to be on it. I wondered how I had been on it."
"2446"	"(2008-11-04 (17)) I was Mom's, which was different. Ezra wanted to go on my computer to play some game, so I created a new account. I had torrents downloading and four of them were 1gb and we only had 800mb to last the week. This game I played you had to run across the country? It was linked to Runescape after you did a quest. I got into a war and the army was weak but it won and I got points in some skills. Mom was taking me home, when we got to the street before home she decided to walk to the deli. The street was a bit shorter. Lydia drove past and asked if we wanted a lift and then drove off before we could answer. She came back and we said yes. Then Ezra and Fatima were there. He asked what Fatima's name was and mentioned that she wanted to change it. We finished at the deli and they had left so we had to walk. We got to Princess Road and there was work going on at the shops and on the road. This guy said he'd set us up in this four room motel as there was a tornado supposed to be coming. I said to Mom that I'd woken up that morning thinking I was going to die. She didn't believe me. He mentioned big waves. I was like 'I'm going to die!' and then he said everyone had gone to some school so I took off to go there. Mom said not to because only one person had mentioned it (and so it might not be true) and it reminded me of something I had read or watched. I don't know where we ended up, but I saw a tornado forming in the distance. I was freaking out. Then there were waves. We ended up under this gazebo and people were strewn about underneath it. Another one was coming up and Mom and I wrapped ourselves around a leg of the gazebo. The wave was huge. Then it was a game and I paused it. You could choose what you remembered about the wave and I chose not to remember anything. There was another wave and then it was some giant guy. Someone knocked him over with a spring and then Hancock (Hancock) was kicking him. I said to Mom ""Hancock's a good movie by the way"". Also we were at a shop at some point and there were lots of diaries of Nana's. I saw one from ""1991 January 25"". There was a little conversation on how she discovered I was born and the name was Jessica. I didn't have time to work out what it meant."
"2447"	"(2008-11-04 (17)) I was at a small cinema. People from Red Dwarf were there. Someone said to a waiter how Rimmer hid. Ezra and I went in and it was a ""fake alien"" story. There were people in seats. We hid in the seats with Rimmer. I was sticking out and realized Rimmer was doing the same. This alien came and took him, but left me and Ezra alone. They pulled his pants down and raped him. It was funny though (it was an episode of Red Dwarf) and we laughed and he just stood up afterwards and pulled his pants back up. He had a serious, but sad look on his face and I was thinking he was a really good actor."
"2448"	"(2008-11-04 (17)) I was walking out of school, which was different. I went to the carpark and was following Eugene. He went to his car and I couldn't see Mom. She waved at me from this weird silver car at a different spot. Later we were at some theatre place. Some actress had hung herself and had fallen through the floor, which was the roof above the stage. I was asking Dad when elevators were made. The school was there, I think. I was taking photos and video. I was on Myspace later or something and Dmitri had photos. Calvin commented on them and I was worried he was going to tell him that I liked him."
"2449"	"(2008-11-05 (17)) I ended up taking a Technical College course except it was actually a university course for those who didn't do well and it was at Westland. It was veterinary nursing and was my first day. I was in the car with Mom and Darren and I said to Mom ""I don't even have enough clothes to wear a different outfit every day"". I gave this girl there a sheet to say who I was. There was a random mix of people there, one was an old lady and there was a teenager with the rest of her family. There weren't many people there though. There were microscopes. I discovered there was a forensics course there but I hadn't seen it when I applied and I was annoyed. The first class I had was mixed in with another class which contained Bradley, Eugene and some of the others. I was sitting in a room with benches and this old guy gave me a drill thing. This other guy came later and gave me a bigger one and I said I wasn't part of that class. I asked Mom if I could swap classes. There was a video of a heart rate experiment we had done. I didn't like Eugene at the time and when he was near by heart rate didn't change, but when Dmitri was near it went from '46' to '100'. His stayed the same when I was near him though. There was a list of information about people in the class. For me it said ""adoniss"" and I had a number which was white and a 7 and thought 'No it's Eugene's', his was number 8. I was then on a plane, I think. Calvin was there and we had photos."
"2450"	"(2008-11-05 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill. Jamie, now that he was older, wanted to get more involved with exciting storylines. He asked Haley if he was going to be in 15 episodes and she said he was only in 11. He fell or was going to fall and I thought Nathan would catch him. There was a flashback in the next episode with Keith."
"2451"	"(2008-11-07 (17)) I was at this school thing and we had to sleep in this room, which was separated into sections. There were beds and lounges scattered around the room, which was quite big. Darius had hired prostitutes for him and Eugene to lose their virginity to. They were in a different section to me, and pretty far from me. I was upset and angry about it. I went to my section and saw the prostitute and Eugene kissing and then a curtain covered them. I went to sleep. Later, Ezra was in a bus which scraped the wall. Ezra thought I was angry at him. Eugene and Darius were waking up. Then I was closer to their bed. Darius was stroking his prostitute. Eugene woke up and said ""now I have to break up with her"", which he said was the hardest thing for him. I grinned and said ""she's a prostitute"" and he realized and laughed. He looked sort of weird, but still hot. Then I was in a car with Dad, Ezra and him. I was trying to take photos of him and put my phone on silent. He was singing. We were getting McDonald's but I said I didn't want anything because of the pink burger I'd gotten the other night (in real life). We went to a shop and I wandered off to the newsagency. I was crawling on the floor and the lady that worked there thought I was dodgy so I left. I saw Eugene wandering around. Ms Solomon was in this place with others. There was a thing in the water and at a certain level it would attack something."
"2452"	"(2008-11-07 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and the radio is on. A song that sounded like Genesis came on and I said ""Genesis is always on"" and Mom said it was David Hasselhoff."
"2453"	"(2008-11-08 (17)) Mom had gotten me a puppy and a grey kitten the night before. I hadn't named them yet. I had the kitten in a litter tray and the puppy was in a birdcage (the tall one we used to have out the back) temporarily so it didn't run off. I gave them fresh food and water. Later I was at school, which was different for graduation. I was limping. There was a video of it, which showed Eugene and afterwards with his parents. We had to give a gift to the school and we had to read out a bit of a story along with a recording in the background saying the speech. Mine had lots of pauses in it. Only three of us did it and it was to show that without practice you will make mistakes. As I was leaving this guy who was doing MIS was there and I had to help him do something, but I left. I couldn't find Mom and it was 3.24pm. I saw Bradley eating. Mom came and Granma was there too and she was doing something with drugs. Someone had a daughter (maybe me? I don't remember)."
"2454"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I went to Granny's old house for something. Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur, Dad and Ezra were there. Later, Elijah was there too. I was telling a story to someone about how Dad and I had gone there and this guy from ""208"" (a TV show) was there. Someone was playing a video game on the TV. Elijah got bored and left. He actually went to a place to see if his computer was fixed. We were going to see a dead relative and someone thought my clothes weren't formal enough. There was a blue car and then someone and I were climbing in stuff in water."
"2455"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) Some of us had powers. I got up and went to this underground carpark. This guy was shooting at me. I hid behind a pillar. He got me a few times. These people came and got him. Then there was another guy."
"2456"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I was watching Chuck and a girl asked Sarah and Chuck why they weren't together. Sarah said they were exes so the girl would leave them alone. We had to swim far underwater. There were two others and Bradley was there. There was a graph of emotions for Bill (True Blood). His emotions were all low and he was called something different but because he was so old, it had made his emotions go down which was why he rarely smiled."
"2457"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I was with Nathan Scott (One Tree Hill). We were signing a marriage certificate thing. We had to sign a different paper and then a lot more. On the last one I signed my name, although my last name was ""Abrams"" and I wrote ""I -- Nathan"" in this really nice writing. Nathan had written ""I -- Izzy"" the same way."
"2458"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I was in a motel. It was stormy. We had two rooms. There was a bunk in one and two single beds in the other. There was some loud thunder. I went out with Mom. Later she ran away from me so I chased her. We got to some trees and she stopped. We had to get inside because there was a bad storm coming. Eugene and his mother were there. Something was happening to her. I tried to bring her to the single room so I could share the bunk with Eugene but she went to the bunk. I asked some people for help to drag her. I got a chocolate thickshake from McDonald's, but it was strawberry. I was at a shop with Dad and we were trying to decide what ice-cream to get. I decided to get 'Chest of Nuts' but then the shop closed on us. They said they'd give it to us if we came back before Saturday (it was Thursday)."
"2459"	"(2008-11-10 (17)) I was at a school with Calvin. We were trying to find our way out. We had a map but it didn't tell you the specifics (roads etc). Eugene and Darius were near us. We found a carpark and the road was leading out. Eugene's father Abraham was in the car driving out."
"2460"	"(2008-11-11 (17)) I was at Calvin's house which was big. It was night. His mother, who was a woman with curly red hair was in the kitchen and was talking to me. She said if I stayed balanced for ten seconds she would give me something, but I couldn't and we laughed. She suggested I stay the night and left the room. Mom was waiting for me outside. I saw her leaving and ran out. She drove back around to the door (the front of the house was like Nana's). Calvin came out. Ms Solomon was arguing with his him and his mother so he decided to stay at our place. He tried to get in the car, but Mom thought he was already in and drove off. I started laughing, so hard I couldn't breathe and I couldn't say he'd been left behind. Mom did some weird noise and then said a joke to Ezra and Calvin and she realized that he wasn't there and went back for him. I was watching TV and they had an ad for 'You Don't Know Jack' and Jack Nance was laughing and talking and I said that he sounded different. There was some lesbian show on. There was a transvestite too and some guy was talking to her about whether to make the bad guys on his new show black so as to vary the 'culture' or not. This guy was getting ""exulted"" because of his legs being shown. I was then at Nana's and it was day. Mom and Darren were there though. Sometimes it was their house. I was packing stuff up to go home and I had to go back inside to get my bra and water bottle. Darren left to do something. I went through the front door and the dining room had a thing that covered most of the door to the kitchen and you had to slide under but there wasn't much room. The door at the end of the hall was the same to I went back out and told Mom I couldn't get in the house. I went around to the garage thing and opened the door to the house, which had more doors inside. There was this creepy girl with curly hair about three doors in (they had little windows on them) and she was staring at me. I saw this creepy boy outside and I told Mom to get in and pulled her inside and locked the door. The kid hit the door and Mom was like 'there's nothing wrong with him, he just wants to play' etc. Darren got back and shot him with a special gun, except now he was a girl. Darren said some cop would be here soon and the girl had 24 minutes to live and I thought he meant until she was infected and turned into a zombie, so I shot her 28 times before realizing he meant that she could still be saved in the 24 minutes and I apologized but no-one seemed to care. The girl inside was now up the second door and was snarling."
"2461"	"(2008-11-12 (17)) I ended up in the future in a game, except it was playing out live. We landed in a spacecraft which was then a car and we closed the doors they locked. This meant we were stuck here. We had no weapons. This guy had a gun and we were trying to hide from him. We went into a building. There were Asian people and they tried to talk to us, and I think trying to help us. Instead of hiding we decided to fight. This other person got a gun and I hid. Then we were in a shop and I ran out as the guy came. There was glass around the corner and I knocked the guy off and took his gun. People were coming across the lawn and we were shooting and I kept missing and someone called it ""target practice"". Then there were hairy monkey things outside and I said they were ""what Austin evolved into over 100 years"". There was a train station which allowed you to teleport to places. There was also a fast ride which was really fun. You had to control it for a while at some point and jump over obstacles and get coins. I got game over at one point."
"2462"	"(2008-11-12 (17)) I was at school. Everyone was in this room. I was standing with Calvin and Eugene was there too. Ms Bigwood was doing some effects thing on photos. She got some off my Facebook and she asked me if they were ok. There was one of me smiling with Nana and I didn't like the smiling ones. Evelyn was standing with us. She kept saying ""Eugene"" which was annoying me and I wondered why she had started saying it. There was another photo Ms Bigwood did where she had made us covered in chocolate."
"2463"	"(2008-11-13 (17)) Selena and I were hanging out. We were staying in some hotel room. We had these little boards for in the pool, which holes for your hands at the flat end and a curvy end at the other side. First, I just was out and she came and we decided to use them. We had bathers on. There was water in the hotel. It went uphill and I kept choosing the bad path. We were talking about driving and the speed limit and I said I ""sometimes go over, but go straight back down again"". She said Brianna had said I had a "" [something I don't remember] finger shirt"". There was a pool and this lady said we weren't allowed to have the boards in there. We had to distract this dog for a certain amount of time. We took the dog and she went after it and we ran away. She followed it."
"2464"	"(2008-11-13 (17)) Mom and Darren were buying stuff on their computer. I can't read some of my notes. This other computer didn't have Java which I discovered when I went to play Runescape."
"2465"	"(2008-11-13 (17)) We got our TER results in the mail. I got 95 and I knew this was wrong so I thought it must've been someone else's. There was a note in there about Jeremiah so I realized it was his. I checked out the council number and it wasn't me and I was annoyed as well because I would've liked to have gotten 95."
"2466"	"(2008-11-14 (17)) I was with some guy, who was sometimes Ezra. We were lost and walked past a pen with a bull in it and it was angry. We ran up this tree and it got out. I dropped my phone and Ezra went down to distract the bull while I got it. We waited up in the tree and someone came eventually and punched the bull in the nose."
"2467"	"(2008-11-14 (17)) I was on Runescape. There was a quest with a scary monster so I went on Ezra's account to see how hard it was. You could log out and not save what you'd done. I died on his account and lost his stuff, but it saved. The next day he had made all the money back, which was over 100 million gp."
"2468"	"(2008-11-15 (17)) Mom and Ezra were going to Bali. Mom left without Ezra though. So later, Dad and I went to do something. Then Dad went back and I went clothes shopping with a girl friend. There were some purple dresses and she tried to get me one and there was some joke about someone's parties and John Lennon. Then I went back but I went with Ezra. We were on a plane and there weren't many people in the plane. There was like two rows of seven seats each. We slept. Then there were zombies and I was in a shop with some guy. There were kids there and were climbing up the chocolate shelf and the zombies were pushing them forward and we were jumping from the shelves. There were lots of people running past. I decided to leave because there were heaps. This girl got punched in the face (by me or otherwise, I don't remember). I managed to get out. Then it was a movie we were watching. The zombies were still in the shop. They pretended to get a food plate, to fit in with the people and I complained that they weren't supposed to be smart. One got its head sliced off but it was still ok. Someone explained the zombies visited each other and got 10 points for chopping a head off. The plane was full now. We were watching Saw 5, but then it was something else. This guy on the plane liked a girl in the movie and he put his hands over his pants. Then I was with Dad and Ezra in a car and it was night. It was ages after zombies and everything was deserted. We stopped at a petrol station because Dad needed to pee, but some people showed up. The car had 8ZE as part of its number plate and I thought it was Eugene, but it wasn't. I told him not to leave us because we'd die. This guy with a mace came to the car and was about to smash the window but we drove away, but now I was driving. The guy ended up electrocuting himself in a tunnel. Then I was walking, during the day, on a boardwalk on a beach. There were a couple of shops around. The bad guys found me and I attempted to bleed in an attempt to attract Edward (Twilight movie) to help me, but I was a vampire and so couldn't. So I yelled out ""Edward!"". Then I was Bella (Twilight book). Edward was near and he heard me the second time. Also, some time before I was at a restaurant and we were eating this really nice lobster. This Asian dude held up the store. I put my phone down my pants. Then I had gone in the past and replaced my phone with a gun. They then didn't have guns and I aimed the gun at him and he tried to escape."
"2469"	"(2008-11-15 (17)) I was at a shop called Shoe Stand, which consisted of walls and shelves with shoes. It had bags too. I then went with some people into a school. One girl actually attended the school and her younger sister did as well. These people were doing media in a classroom and they unlocked the door for us. One of the people didn't want me using the desk because I'd move them. We had a big argument. Then one of the girls got this thing out of a desk and made the whole room over in a few minutes. It was now night time and somewhere else. This girl had a gorilla suit and was in the woods. Someone came and she hid behind a tree. They were looking for her. She went back. The next day there was a dead deer with two holes in it outside someone's door. A vampire was questioned and it was Bill (True Blood). He said ""When we turn, the urge to feed is too great, we cannot protect our prey"", which explained why the deer couldn't have been killed by a vampire as it would've been shredded. Then I was the girl and I was coming into a barn through the roof. Bill hung out in there. He got me and I went to look up and he turned my head away. The 'camera' showed the roof and it had bits of insides in the roof. Then he was someone else (it was still him though). Take on Me was playing. We were covered in mud or something and he was naked (I don't know if I was) and I was rubbing my hands on his chest and stomach and then I put my head on his stomach to sleep."
"2470"	"(2008-11-16 (17)) I was at school, which was different. I was outside. We had these cords connected to us and mine got tangled underneath the building and other random places. I went to the office and I pulled it out of the wall and went to Ms Pascal, who was in a meeting. She took it and told me to leave. I came back later and she gave me a ""toxic turtle"". Classmate-F-06, Lydia and I were in this small room with a big window and a door leading outside. Classmate-F-06 asked if anyone here couldn't smell. I said I couldn't and neither did she. Then Lydia said she couldn't either. I said ""your mother"" and Lydia glared at me and it turned out her mother was dead. I thought it was odd that three people here couldn't smell. I was thinking I had to tell Mom. There was some game and Calvin visited me and gave me furniture for my room on the game."
"2471"	"(2008-11-16 (17)) I now had 13 quiz attempts on my quiz and four quiz comments, mostly saying ""yes"". The rating was 4/5. Someone had gotten 88%."
"2472"	"(2008-11-16 (17)) I went to my accounting exam. Dad dropped me off. I brought my graphics calculator and I told Ms Pascal and she wouldn't give me a normal one. I called Dad and he got there a few seconds after she started the exam. I looked at the page and then it was hours later and I didn't remember doing it."
"2473"	"(2008-11-17 (17)) I was at school. I was naked except I was wearing undies. My hair wasn't straight but was tied back. Elijah was following me around. I called Calvin and he turned up with Dmitri. I was trying to get out. I ended up in Northtown but it was different. I called Mom to get me. It was night. I got to a cheesecake shop and they gave me the uniform of ""Big Jimmy"" to wear. I was driving a car and the police drove past and then saw them behind me. I got out of the car and ran but they didn't do anything. Big Jimmy and his father were walking on the street. I gave them the uniform. He had been in love with Sookie (True Blood) and had a picture of her with vampire bites which had upset him. He had a torn up teddy bear that said ""first love"" on it."
"2474"	"(2008-11-17 (17)) I was on Pet Society. There were new clothes, lay out and a shop now had mats in it."
"2475"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. Dad was telling me that it was one week since he had had some dream. There had been an entrance to something and he had gone in it. I realized I was dreaming. There was a pipe thing with two entrances in it. Dad said he could see it too and he said he must be dreaming and I said 'no, I'm dreaming'. I pinched my hand and felt nothing. I got them to do the same and asked them how strong it felt and they replied with random words. For some reason, Ezra ended up chasing me and I ran into a bigger shop and he kept getting things to throw at me. First it was a kettle and it was always heavy stuff. I tried to make him stop and then tried to make the stuff disappear which didn't work, but it always missed. He threw a heater at me. I hit him with it. I ran out and there was a car parked just outside and it was unlocked so I tried to get in, but I didn't get in in time. It was actually very vivid at the time and I was thinking it was going to be a lot to write down, but was worried my poor dream recall lately might affect it (which it obviously did)."
"2476"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was driving with Mom and Ezra and I was in the back. There were all these people on the street and I said they were ""Pettigrew's"". They all looked like Jason Bateman and his last name was Pettigrew. The kids looked like Emery though. There was a list of Superman movies and one of them had a black Superman. I went to this old lady's house and she gave us drugs. She said they were really strong and asked me if I was ok because she had seen some silly photos of me the other day."
"2477"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was out the back. Tigger was on the table and I fed her and gave her milk. I kept spilling it though and it was in packets. This black cat was talking to a box and then I realized Tigger was behind it."
"2478"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom and I climbed up these boxes, which was really high. Ezra was on the other side and I yelled out to him and he had to climb all the way over again. He had a Labrador with him. Mom and I went down. Greg Grunberg was sitting on a lounge in another room and I walked past him again and went to get my phone and ask for a photo. My phone wasn't there. I asked Mom to ring it and it was in the boxes, but it was Ezra's phone. I told her to call Ezra's and I found my phone. It was low on battery so I put it on charge. Greg was going to the toilet, he said something scared him and he said that he ""shat myself"" and I said ""waste of a trip then""."
"2479"	"(2008-11-20 (17)) I was at home and it was Father's Day tomorrow. I was sorting out the DVD's in the family room in a row. Then it was food, venick like (or however you spell it) and I arranged them into a circle. When I came back they were gone and Mom said she put them away before Tigger ate them. Ezra was coming back to her house to stay. I had to get my external hard drive. I had Your Love playing as I was packing it away. We went to a petrol station and this truck and a car had had an accident and were pushed to the side so they weren't in the way. Then it was just me and Mom there. We were going to get something for Dad and I said ""those trees are gay"". We were then outside this hospital and there were lots of tables. Nana had been at the hospital a while ago. Ezra, Dad and other family were there. There were these computer booth things scattered around and Ezra had made a quiz on them. Kate (Lost) was there and drank out of this cup and then spat back in. I was really thirsty (in real life too)."
"2480"	"(2008-11-21 (17)) I was at Mom's and Ezra was over. On Yahoo, there was a video of Farrah with fire sticks. I called Dad to tell him and he answered with ""five"". He had already commented on the video. Ezra was then at home. I was complaining about the equilibrium of the water bottles. I was telling Mom that some guy from something she watched was in True Blood (I was talking about Rene) and that he was the killer. I was explaining that Sookie could read minds and she was like ""Sookie?"" and this had something to do with a killer that had struck nearby. This girl had a 'Tanaca' (I think) dress on. It was then the next morning and I hadn't slept that night. I had stuff on my bed. There was some party thing and Eugene had facial hair, which looked hot so I was trying to take a photo. Mom was going to see a guy called Ted. I said ""Ezra's not here I have no-one to play with"" and went for the drive. Gavin was somewhere."
"2481"	"(2008-11-21 (17)) There were another lot of external hard drives. It was the 23rd of whatever month it was. Mom asked me when I was going to study and I said my first exam wasn't for ages. She said it was in a couple of days. I went to check and the accounting exam was on today. It was 8.20-30am and it started at 9.20am. I went to her place and it was her old house. I ran upstairs and got changed and got my calculator and stuff. Darren was asleep on their bed. I went to the kitchen and there wasn't much food. I grabbed a muesli bar and went back down. Ezra said it was too late and it was nearly 9.30, though the clock said 10.18 (it was an hour fast). I fell to my knees and cried and was crying out that I was going to get like 5% average and that I'd be lucky if I got a TER of 1. They ignored me and commented on the neighbour's lawn."
"2482"	"(2008-11-22 (17)) I was at a shop with Calvin and we were later joined by Evelyn. She had a lot of meat and rice in her trolley. Later I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Sloane and Derek were in a room lying on a bed. Derek was lying on his side at the edge and he ended up masturbating to test out a new sexual position (on his side) and was slapping his bum. Sloane was shocked at this but masturbated as well. I was wondering what the hell was going on."
"2483"	"(2008-11-22 (17)) I was at the hospital because of some friend of Ezra's. It was hard to get to other sections because you had to go over this maze which had water moving in all different directions. Deb (One Tree Hill) and some guy were having sex in the water. She was pregnant and then had the baby and named it all these 'Cajun' names and Jeremiah was one of the names. Then the baby was this extremely cute kitten and I was holding it and said ""you're the cutest thing I've ever seen""."
"2484"	"(2008-11-22 (17)) There were zombies. I was with Eugene and some others. It was dark. We went into this building. There were three rooms. The one we were in had a big red 'foam' mattress thing (like a rectangle) and it almost went as high as the roof. There was an archway leading to the next room, which contained a windowed door leading outside and a normal door leading to another room, which also had a red mattress thing and was like an inside gym. This room had a bolted door at the far end. It also had another door leading to the first room. Anyway, I checked the place for zombies. I opened the bolted door and this black guy came in saying they were coming. Elijah helped me close the door and we had trouble bolting it. The zombies started pushing against it. I ran to leave. I went to go through the door we came through but zombies had already started coming through so I ran the other way. Eugene had gone that way too. There weren't many zombies this way. There were a few steps outside leading down to a carpark, which was quite full. We ran down the steps. Eugene got a car and picked me up. I was in the back. I was about to lock the doors but I saw Sophia Bush in the carpark and let her in (we were friends). There was a guy driving a car in front of us and he was driving really slowly and kept stopping and we ended up hitting the back of him. We got past him but he started chasing us. We drove over an oval and he followed. We ended up losing him shortly after that and drove into an underground carpark, which was also pretty full. We parked and were looking for a fast car. I found this silver one which looked fast and it was hard to drive. We left the carpark and saw Autumn riding in a closed Segway."
"2485"	"(2008-11-23 (17)) Madonna, sometimes Granma, brought me to this boardwalk near a beach. It was night. She had set some stuff up and wanted to show it to me. There were feathers placed around as some sort of clue. There was a hot tub with flower petals in it. I was trying to take a photo of it. The reason for it was she had fixed something with swans in it and the petals were for someone called Rose. Then I was in a car waiting for someone. Someone was outside so I locked the door. I tried to take photos with my phone with the flash on but I couldn't see them. They came up close and it was Jeremy Piven. He walked around the car and smiled. He told me to call him, now, which confused me but I did anyway. I selected 'bitch' on the phone which allowed him to go somewhere. Then Robert Downey Jr. got in the car as the lock didn't apply to him. He went to Red Rooster and asked ""Do you want anything?"" and I said ""Can I get a Flayva?"" I think he was annoyed. I think Jeremy Piven and I ended up having sex and we had been for a while. Mom and Ezra were going to Seaworld and I was telling her about the cool stuff such as the jet skiing and the beach at the Gold Coast. I accidentally said ""Lindsay Lohan"" instead of something."
"2486"	"(2008-11-23 (17)) We were going on an excursion and we were on a 'bus'. Calvin was on the floor and he was eating chicken wings. We were going to some aquatic place to help some animal. Then it was a game and there weren't enough people to play so we recruited some players and we were successful."
"2487"	"(2008-11-24 (17)) I was with Sam and Dean (both Supernatural). Something was killing these people and we went to investigate. We were talking to some people, all girls. Sam and I kept giggling. They gave us this rainbow coloured band and I put my finger on it and pulled and it was squishy and we laughed. The killer thing was a blob. I think it was killing people who had a disrupted childhood and I thought that Sam and Dean would qualify. It started chasing us and so we ran off in the opposite direction to the people it was chasing and then it disappeared. Sam started making faces (like in the bloopers) and that model pose. Then I was playing a game in the sky. You had to make words out of the letters but it was going too fast. At the top of the screen (and the top of the 'word tree') was fruit."
"2488"	"(2008-11-25 (17)) I was doing a movie, but for a scene, some guy had to perform oral sex on me. When he did, no-one was around. He did it for ages, but not much was happening, I was just very wet with saliva down there, which was gross. He stopped and told the director, who then replaced him with Hurley (Lost). I walked out before he got there. I complained and they said ""well, don't you like Bradley Cooper?"" and I said ""Yeah I do like Bradley Cooper"". I was telling Ezra about the casting and how a fat, old director casts an old, fat actor and a young, thin director casts young, thin actors. The director of this movie was Judd Apatow. Later we were doing something in these woods and talking about camping. Something happened with a dog."
"2489"	"(2008-11-25 (17)) It was night. Mom pulled up the front to take us for a drive. Ezra and I went out and Dad came to see what was going on. It was then 2.30am and there were chicken things out the front."
"2490"	"(2008-11-25 (17)) I was playing a game, out live. I was at a house and someone knocked on the door. It was some weird guy with a squishy head. He said he was new in the game and I told Ezra to deal with him. We were in some caves and there were patches of grass with Pokemon in them. The only one I had was Nidoran (male). A trainer battled me, but he had 3 Pokemon and it took away two, so it was fair. I did a tail whip movement and it knew what move it was and the Pokemon did it too. Later I was at a school, which was big. I was at a bench with Calvin and some others. Forrest came up to us and I asked if he'd do something for me and he said he would do it tonight. Samantha asked who it was and I giggled and said ""a friend from when I was younger"" and she said ""he's small"". I was then in a room on a computer with profiles of all the people at school. The photos had a 360° movement. I saw Mackenzie's one. I was editing mine as it showed my birthday as the 13 September. I was learning some American ways, ie using stuff on the opposite side. There was a ladder thing I had to climb and I had to put my left foot first which made it really hard. I was hanging on and there was a long drop below. I was scared. This guy friend of mine came to help me. There was a long queue waiting to go behind me. I was now in a muscly body and did it and everyone clapped."
"2491"	"(2008-11-26 (17)) I was with Mom in a car at night. I had chickens at Nana's but I hadn't fed them in a while. We went past and there dead ones. Her house was different. We went around the side, near her room and the light went on. I went to the front door. As it opened I said ""it's Izzy"" and Nana said ""I was about to hit you on the head""."
"2492"	"(2008-11-26 (17)) I was at a library at a table with That's Life. I was facing away from the front and I was sitting at the back. This Native guy and a white guy came in and they were dodgy looking and I thought they were going to hold it up so I was going to leave but I didn't want to seem racist. But then they did hold it up. I put my phone in my pants so they couldn't get it. They sent me and this guy to lie on the floor. They shot the guy and I had the feeling he was with them. They let me go. I called Mom and there was a guy with a sniper near a tree just outside so I ran away and called her again when I was near Northtown. She was already there. I told her I was ""near Dad's old work"". She got me and we were driving down a road with lots of trees on either side. I saw tornado things in the distance and I freaked out and then saw more, but they were all going the other way."
"2493"	"(2008-11-27 (17)) I had met Broken Lizard before. I only remember Erik Stolhanske and Paul Soter though. I went to a cinema. It had a small screen. There were a bunch of guys I was friends (adults) sitting in a row at the back, so I sat in the row behind them (you entered the room through a door at the back). They ignored me and then moved and I was annoyed at this. I remembered back to when we were friends. I had gone out with one of them, but this other one and I had decided to have sex. I remembered back to this and we were on a lounge thing and he was on top of me and I wondered why I did it. He was really nice though. He came to the cinema and said hey to me. I was then outside of Mom's and I had photos of celebrities and other people for my PowerPoint presentation and for my Wiki. The photos were in plastic and I took them out and tried to put them back in but they were ruined. Meyer came over."
"2494"	"(2008-11-27 (17)) I was at a carnival with the school. I was with Calvin. We were walking on the side of the road to avoid something. The carnival didn't actually start until ""7 November"", which was a while away. I had to go to the toilet (at school I think). The cubicles didn't have doors so I went to the shower. I had been in math and the teacher said we could go to the toilet. Then I was with Dad in a building. There were rabbits so I pet them. There was a giant rat thing with a spider and it was shaking. These guys shut the place down. The guy told us most of them were ok but I felt bad."
"2495"	"(2008-11-27 (17)) I was watching Ugly Betty. Lindsay Lohan was back on but as a different character. Betty was hiding in a house and to be with Lindsay (I can't remember if she liked her or not). They had knocked the house down. These garbage guys said they'd been doing disposals for two people and something happened twice in 20 years (can't remember). Someone had been mean."
"2496"	"(2008-11-28 (17)) I was showing Mom a bit of the first episode of Chuck. It was really weird. Chuck walked into a room and he said something weird and his sister was sitting in a corner with a bald head and said ""Anton!"" and I laughed and told Mom that I'd forgotten it started off weird. Later I was playing a game and this girl was going for a job interview and her choice of clothes was a Pokemon shirt. Then I was the girl, but not. The door to my room was back to front. I called out to Mom ""I'm going to a job interview but I can't lock the door"". I told Mom we had to take the keyhole off and switch it but she said it would take away the auto lock thing. I said I didn't care. While I waited for her I was going through the stuff on the shelf in there -- it wasn't my stuff. There were movies; one was the ""original Red Planet. Oh there's like 1800 of them"". Some of the covers were faded the rest had red covers. There was a movie that started with an 'I' (I think it was called Ilysum) and it was French sounding. The girl on the cover was from something and I told Ezra it was really weird ""like almost David Lynch"". There were pictures as well and one was of Malcolm McDowell from A Clockwork Orange and I said ""Oh, I'm so taking these"". Dad was at the table and I thought he was at my spot, but he was in the one next to it. He was eating something."
"2497"	"(2008-11-29 (17)) I was in some building with the school. We had been practicing this game and it was now the official exam or whatever. We had this strip straight in front of us and a hot air balloon at the end. We had to go down the strip and get something. I didn't have a balloon on mine. Autumn was next to me. I got the first thing and the lady said I was disqualified and I had no idea why. She said that you had to stay within the width of the balloon when doing it, but I said we didn't have to do that when we'd been practicing and that I didn't even have a balloon."
"2498"	"(2008-11-30 (17)) I was at school and it was different. We were getting tickets for graduation. Mom and Ezra got our tickets at the library. They left. I had to get a 'fracture form' because I had hurt my ankle ages ago. This lady had been writing very neat and spaced. It said 'Sydney Fox' who was a teacher. I asked ""is it a 'y' or an 'I'?"" and she had written 'y', but I thought 'I'. I saw an official sheet and it had spelled it with a 'y'. I was then waiting outside for Mom. Eugene was nearby with his friends. Jeremiah was telling him about Facebook. I got my phone out and took a photo but it wasn't on silent, so I moved it away and the photo was blurry. I put it on silent but he moved. They were sitting on the grass further away and it showed thought bubbles. Eugene's brother Rodney was there too. I took a photo of them. Bradley was next to him. I remembered Calvin saying that Bradley was ugly. Then I had a car. I drove out while trying to call Mom. I was on the road and the speed limit sign said ""Q"" which meant 75. It was then a bridge, which was right on top of the water. Then there was some really pretty water. It was jelly like and bright blue. There was a lot more of it further on. Then I wasn't in car and I was in it. It was cool and felt really nice. The waves rolled over me and I just lay there. It was in a place called Sublima. Then I had a car again and I didn't know how to get out. There were chocolates in a shelf. Most of them were nutty and one was a Violet Crumble. I waited for Mom."
"2499"	"(2008-11-30 (17)) I was watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Jason Segel was talking to his uncle and his mother. This girl came along and his uncle went and put these two curvy balls together (which was some sexual joke). There was a laugh track and Jason Segel was looking at his mother and trying not to laugh. I was like 'what the hell is this? This isn't funny'. Later his uncle said to him that he ate ""shit for you!"" and then ""literally. I had my legs around his waist..."". I remembered something earlier with Paul Rudd jumping off a cliff."
"2500"	"(2008-11-30 (17)) I was outside somewhere. There was a house behind me and my car and this other red car were on the lawn. A retard girl and her mother were there. The retard would open her mouth and go ""dur!"". It was really funny and I was trying not to laugh. I had to wash her head. I held Mom's hand and she scrubbed. Calvin was watching. My car looked orange, so I sprayed it with the hose, which caused the other car to go orange. Mom then sprayed the other car, which turned mine orange and we kept going back and forth."
"2501"	"(2008-12-01 (17)) I was at Mom's. I had a file on the table and I knocked it and it fell out and went all over the floor. I was picking it up and Mom got home. She asked where her coke was and I had chucked it in the in. I went home and she gave me lots of chocolate. Ezra gave me more. Dad was on my laptop getting a show off there. He said ""I like your screensaver"". I said it was my desktop. I looked at it and it was still Chris Barrie, but there were fewer pictures. I had a cube with all the guys from The Young Ones on it. I only remember Mike, Neil and Rick on it though. Ezra was complaining that Lost was different now and weird."
"2502"	"(2008-12-02 (17)) Ezra was playing on the Wii. I wanted to play Bully, so he said he'd save his game and let me on in a minute. When I did start playing, it was different. I had to find a date for a dance. I was looking at the girls to find a pretty one. One of his enemies was annoying a nerd, so I chose to beat him up and let the nerd go to the toilet. I was helping others out. The bad guy complained and said he came from a bad family. He decided to fake something so the bad guy didn't have to do something. I had to go to the toilet (in real life too)."
"2503"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I was watching Lost. Charlie had met Jack ages ago and he had almost made him give up drugs. Someone secretly saw some guy. A lighter had no gas, but there was still a flame. Someone told Locke to watch out for some guy. I watched a trailer for Twilight, which showed Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. I told Darren it had a 4.5/5 rating on Flixster which was really lame, because it sucked. In True Blood, Sookie was in a chicken suit and her feet were on an angle and she couldn't work."
"2504"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I was a kid. I was weird looking and my lips looked funny. I kept forgetting I was younger. Ezra and Dad were around. I was in a hotel. There was something to do with Lost."
"2505"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I was at home, out the back. I was with Ben (Lost) and some others. Sawyer (Lost) was one of them. We planned to break into a casino. At first it was just to steal something from a smaller place, but he changed it to a casino. We were in the garage at a table. Then there were other tables around and it was a McDonald's. The roller door was open and Ben said it was so people would think it was a distraction. He wanted it closed a certain way and I asked why not just lock it there and he agreed, so I did that. Ben was a leader-ish guy and decided to go his own way since no-one in the group had listened to him. He went inside. They were saying that he was ""hot enough"" to do that. Ben was then a bad guy. I decided to go with him. I went in and locked the door and put the metal rod in so it couldn't be opened. He asked me why someone of ""high morals"" would decide to go to the ""dark side"". There were two drag queens who kept trying to be a part of the group. We wanted one of them, but not the other so we were trying to trick them. Then Brad Pitt was part of the group. We were breaking in somewhere. Then Ben had this huge room with replica casinos everywhere. When we first opened the door, Mom was in there. Then someone turned around and said ""hey Mom"". Some of the people were wearing SWAT like gear and had guns. One of the casinos there had those red sensor beam things."
"2506"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I had a baby and the father was Eugene. Then it had been Mom, but she had actually just renamed me and Ezra. He was now called Ian Holder and I said if you add ""Somer"" then you're Boone (Lost). Ezra said ""I don't wanna be Boone!"". I was renamed to Kim, but then changed to Amy. I was driving and Mom called to ask if Ezra could borrow my shoes. I said yeah but they wouldn't fit. Then I was at home with Ezra, who was sometimes not. This guy was trying to get in through the kitchen window. We got him away and then I couldn't lock the front door. He got in, but I was still holding the wood door. We got a knife and were tying to stab him."
"2507"	"(2008-12-04 (17)) I was at school. It was university. Eugene and I were the only people our age. I didn't know what to do. I hadn't brought stationery because I hadn't known what I needed. I called Mom for help. This girl showed me some different organizers."
"2508"	"(2008-12-04 (17)) There were werewolves. To prevent them going to you, you supposedly had to greet them and say their name. We were at some stands. Claire (Lost) was pregnant and was kicking one leg back and forth. This attracted them. We got to her and this girl said she'd have to have the baby. We took her to the car. She wanted to have it at the airport. Mom was getting stuff out of the boot. A werewolf came and we told her to run. Later, it showed the door of the car covered in blood."
"2509"	"(2008-12-05 (17)) I was going to the Comic-Con with Mom. It was 4pm and I was going there to meet someone. I forgot my shoes. We went back there and it was 4.30 and I realized we wouldn't make it in time. Mom said that the show ended tomorrow and so I gave up and said ""oh well""."
"2510"	"(2008-12-05 (17)) We were in this sewer like place and there was a bit of a jump somewhere on one of the levels. Each side had these squishy platforms. Elijah was there. Gemma jumped across and hit her foot. I jumped and missed and I laughed. This guy had a vision of him under a table in his 'shop' class. He was working out how to do something with a piece of wood. I was thinking it had something to do with time travel. When the flash ended, he brought his mates down to show them, but the wood wasn't there. One of his friends was Sawyer (Lost). He had another flash of a tree outside and something on it. He realized that it was a different day he would find the wood. I was with them now. We were outside in this park like area. Calvin and I were walking across it. Cutter walked past and asked me if I was the one with ""lots of rooms"". I'm not sure if it was rooms. We climbed down some steps and zombies were coming. I ran out and there was another flash which we realized happened later too. The zombies were everywhere. We ran back. There were people running everywhere. We went up these ladders in the sewer place. As we climbed up this ladder, there was a movie review behind it. Michael Emerson was in it and they mentioned Cate Blanchett and said ""things to consider"" included Michael Emerson. I was thinking he was awesome. There was a photo of him included and he was bruised and battered. We waited on the highest platform. After a while I opened the door and there was a hallway in a building. There was room at one end of the hall, where a woman was sitting on a chair at a desk. I said hello and she said hello back. I said I was just checking that you weren't a zombie. She said she was and showed us the bite on her hand. I backed away."
"2511"	"(2008-12-06 (17)) I was at school which was different with Calvin and we were trying to leave. I got a call from Ms Braun saying the yearbooks were ready but they weren't actually the yearbooks. I had $20, which was enough for it as they were $7.99 each. I went to health block and Mr Quinlan was in there. Ms Braun sent me to the English block. Ms Pascal was on the phone when I got there. She asked if I was in trouble or wanted something. She gave me the yearbook thing. She asked if I was ok about the ""English Sofia award"". It was like the ""razzies"". I was getting it for being the worst English student. I remembered getting a note about it before. We were then at the liquor store at Midvale and it was really neat and tidy. Ezra was there. I remembered when Dad used to work there and it was messy and big. 'Greasers' used to hang outside and Poppers and the others would call the cops on them."
"2512"	"(2008-12-06 (17)) Calvin and I were in a car and then were walking down a street. There was a big woman with blonde hair in a clothes shop -- she was Nordic looking and reminded me of Elijah. I told Calvin about her. We went to the end of the street and then we were going back and we saw a car put its brakes on. The driver guy hit his head on the wheel and then drove off. As we walked away, Classmate-M-03 fell to the ground as he'd been hit. I said to Calvin ""Classmate-M-03's been hit"", but he refused to look around. We got back to the shop and realized we'd left the car and I said I didn't want to walk all the way back. Calvin said he would. I saw Alejandro walking the way we wanted to go, so I went with him. We got to a school. We were outside the gym. I took my pants off, because it was hot, but then realized I had no shorts. We went in through the gym, into the room next to it. A teacher lady kept walking in and out and the other students there helped us stay out of sight."
"2513"	"(2008-12-06 (17)) Someone and I went to this famous person's house. There was a band called Petrol Station who had made Snow Patrol famous. I walked down the road to the house and there was a big patch of grass. We went in and there were people walking around. There was food on the table and they let us eat. It was all lollies and sugary stuff. The guy we were here to see walked past and then we couldn't find him. We were in a lounge room. These guys came up to the door and I went to open it and then they were gone. They were coming back up the stairs and round a bend, so I ran to the door and screamed and it scared them. I locked the door. There were biscuits and chocolates in the fridge and took some."
"2514"	"(2008-12-08 (17)) I decided to watch the last few episodes of Twin Peaks. This guy and his mother pretended he had turned into a mermaid so he could leave the place. He was swimming in a lake and the cops came and caught him. He jumped back in and now it was me. I was swimming backwards with a cop after me. I was swimming really fast, but he was really close. I almost reached the other side and we had a fight underwater and I got out. There was a creepy lake next to it where someone had gone missing. I sat on this swing and the creepy lake tipped over. I grabbed onto a branch. Then there was a skeleton and it was talking to me. I showed it the swing and then it looked like a normal person, a girl. We went to the cinema and when we left, it was packed. I tried to call some people but no numbers worked. One of the people I tried to call was Alyssa. We got to the carpark and a car pulled up with people in it. Samantha was in there. I asked if she could see the person I was with and she said yeah. The skeleton got in and I sort of explained who she was. The door wouldn't open and I was worried they were going to trap us. Then I was in with Dad in a car. Mittens and a cat called Sam were with us, on the outside of the car. There was a snake and it bit Mittens and then it was near Sam and I said ""Sam!"" and it got hold of her and then let go. We opened the window and Sam came in. We left and I said that we'd left Mittens."
"2515"	"(2008-12-08 (17)) Leigh Whannell gave me videos of his original Saw ideas. They only included him and his mate and were totally homemade. I thought it was good. I was showing it to Mom and Darren. They were bored and Mom started making faces and sticking her tongue out."
"2516"	"(2008-12-08 (17)) I was at a hotel place. I don't remember why but this guy let me in to his expensive suite. There was a comfy lounge outside the room. Then people I knew were there. Ezra, Dad and some others took beds in one of the rooms. Theodore was in the other room and he was the only one in there. He took the first bed, next to the wall, closest to the door. There were about 12 beds, three rows of four across. I lay on all the beds to find the comfiest one. The only comfy one was at the other end of the row of Theodore's (next to the other wall). He made food, which was bacon and steak. It wasn't cooked properly. He said he'd put it on for longer. We had Bully and Saints Row for the Wii. I accidentally hit reset and it reset mine and Ezra's data for Bully. We had gotten really far and I was like ""Nooo!"". I was telling Mom about it. I went to play on the X-Box. I was playing Saints Row but told Darren it wasn't, but it was. You could play with the Wii remote and I was punching some guy on the game."
"2517"	"(2008-12-09 (17)) I was watching Lost, but then it was real. I was in a submarine. It was filling with water and was up to our heads. These guys went under water to get some bar (rectangle shaped and silver) and gave it to me to put in this other room and I had to set it right. I got it in the right place and the water went down."
"2518"	"(2008-12-09 (17)) I was at home and out the back. There was a baby and it was laughing at me. Mom was nearby."
"2519"	"(2008-12-10 (17)) I was playing a game with Ezra, which played out live. You were a superhero, I think. You had to kill some Superman villain and then The Joker, which was the furthest I had gotten. I blew them up. Then you grew. I was the size of bottle caps at the moment and was collecting them. The next stage you were the size of people, I think. You had to collect eggs. I had other people with me to help. Elijah was one of them. Then I was sitting in a hedge maze thing with Ezra and Eugene was there too. We were playing a board game. The die was made of paper and I accidentally ripped two sides of it."
"2520"	"(2008-12-10 (17)) Betty (Ugly Betty) was on an island. She was sitting on a flat, round wooden thing, that was like a swing over a pit. This guy came on to sit and said it was safe to drop. I think she dropped, but couldn't get out. Amanda (Ugly Betty) was saying that Bad Ronald was real and was trying to show Betty. Then I was there trying to get through a jungle. There was some sludgy sand and I thought it was quicksand so tried to get out. It was really hard to lift myself out of. I met up with some others. Granma had lived on the island all her life. There were photos on a computer and it said who was going to get them when she died. Some of them were for me, but I changed them so they were all going to me. Mary Lynn Rajskub had pictures on there and they were really ugly. Someone's father was dying. His son was with him and he was sick. The father was lying down and they were waiting for this black girl to come back with some bandages. The son decided to kill his father and put his hand over his nose. He was crying and there was blood everywhere for some reason. Then the girl got there. Haley (One Tree Hill) was his girlfriend. She was there too. Then I was at a table/desk and lots of other people were seated around it. Eugene was on the other side and I was trying to take a photo of him, and was covering the light on the phone with my finger. He was then James Lafferty and I took a photo and he was smiling his crooked smile. Haley made a face at a girl which was funny. Then she made a face at my camera opening her mouth pretending to put her mouth over it. She laughed. Michael Emerson had been credited at the beginning of season 2 of Lost although he didn't appear ""until one month after"". I was thinking that I didn't remember that."
"2521"	"(2008-12-10 (17)) I was at home, which was a new house. I was in the lounge watching TV, which was a movie that was a cross between Lord of the Flies and Battle Royale. A pregnant lady had died. People had forgotten about the island they were on and they now had to fend for themselves. At the end of the movie it zoomed into a face of a small black boy, hiding in the trees. I thought he saw someone coming (at our house). My room had thin curtains on the window. When walking into the room, my bed was in the middle of the room coming out from the wall towards the window, which was on the left wall from the door. There was a desk just in front of the window. There was a small stream and a lot of bush and trees outside the window. Dad's room was across from it. I went to my room and I thought I saw a shadow of a head outside and I tried to call out to Dad, but no noise came out."
"2522"	"(2008-12-11 (17)) I was at a shop. I went to go in one of the shops inside, but the lady closed the gates on us. We went in another way. I was with Calvin. We snuck around trying to avoid the staff. We went to hide and there was a box of Nintendo 64 games. I grabbed Banjo Kazooie. This guy started following us and we pretended we were looking at TV's. He made us leave and closed the gate. I still had the game and banged on the gate and the price said it was $3.20 and I gave him a $5 note and he said he'd still tell on me, so I gave him another $3 and he left. The inside of the cartridge looked all screwy, but it played ok. Mom said it might not be ok though. I went back and replaced it with a better one and put it in a female friend's bag. Then we went out and it was raining. We ran down this slope. I was insulting one of the lady's that worked there and then realized she was eating at the table behind me. It was almost time for Mom to pick Ezra up, but I text her saying I was at Centerville shops and needed to be picked up. Later, she, Ezra and I were in the car. She was at a deli getting us a hamburger. It was going to take ages."
"2523"	"(2008-12-12 (17)) Eugene and I got ourselves a house/apartment. We had a double loft bed and brought a huge TV to put under it. We joked that we had more stuff than when Mom first got a house. The bed was shaky. I was lying on it. He came up and I said that we needed to get a better bed. He agreed and put his arm around me. Then there was a thing to record past times. One of my dreams that was recorded was about Sims 2. He put it on the low setting so I could dream properly. Then it was The Simpsons and Homer said he put it on low but instead of actual scenes showing it was pictures of a dude in a bricked house and Homer said ""Doh!""."
"2524"	"(2008-12-12 (17)) There was a big dark green shed in which medical stuff went in. House (House) usually worked in there and didn't allow others by themselves. He was standing outside a fair way away, so all the doctors, myself included, ran in and tried to lock the door. There were two latches and I tried to lock them together but they just kept swinging around. I couldn't work it out and he was coming so I just ran back. He came in and pulled a lever to make this stuff pour from the rood, which was like animal insides. Before it got to me, I ran out. Then I was behind the big shed at home, which now had a fair amount of space next to the fence. I had gotten clothes from the second storey of the shed. The shed three storeys, but they were tiny (not high enough for a person to stand, just to store stuff). I was going out with Eugene I think and he was out the back too. He had clothes in the shed too. I was getting dressed and I heard him coming around the shed to see if I was there and I banged on the shed so he didn't come and he jumped and didn't come around. The shirt I had had a picture of Pikachu (Pokemon) and me on it. I put it on and came out. He was sitting at the table under the patio thing with Mom and some others. There was a chair next to him, so he stood up and moved so I could get in. The pool was clear and we were going to go in. Later, I was at Mom's old house. I left with Eugene. I needed to go the toilet so walked up the stairs to get there."
"2525"	"(2008-12-13 (17)) I was with hobbits (all from The Lord of the Rings movie) and we were trying to get away from wraiths. I was with Pippin, Frodo and presumably Sam although I don't know if he was with us. Merry had left earlier. Pippin had psychic abilities and could hear how far away the wraiths were. We got home and were hiding at the window in the dining room, they were too close so we didn't have time to go anywhere else. The table wasn't there. They came in and found us straight away. I asked the leader if I could get a water bottle. He said no and I said that I was going to get thirsty. We had been in the desert at some point. He gave us names and mine was ""Honesty"". I was then doing a quest on Runescape which was supposed to be the longest quest. I was with a girl and a guy. I was in a red place that looked like the city of TzHaar and had lava streams around. I couldn't pause the quest until I found a job (it was like a social simulation game now). I was immune to poison and couldn't lose any health, because you had to stand on lava for some of it. I had to assign a job to Ezra first and I gave him the best paying one and it gave all positive attributes and one skill a day (though, not a Runescape skill). I had to get a lower paying job somewhere else, the options included at a hairdressers and a cinema. I don't know what I picked."
"2526"	"(2008-12-13 (17)) I was on the side of a road. I'd made a bet or something that I could hitchhike. I was wearing skimpy clothes to help get picked up. Rebekah was there and she was a hitchhiker/prostitute. I said ""she may be expensive, but I'm [something I don't remember] "" and we laughed but she said ""you know what I do every night?!"" and she did some stupid thing because her mother had died or something. Then I was walking down another road. It was a long straight road, and I walked past a road to the left (like a T-junction) and a cop was parked on the side of the road. The road was now sandy and bumpy and this person was driving waiting to be out of sight of the police before picking me up. The cop came and ended up crashing. Then it was Freaks and Geeks and this had been a test. It showed one of the main female characters having sex with someone and then all the secondary characters were masturbating each other. I was like ""ok..."". Then Mom took me home. It was late, I think. Darren was in the car. I had to transfer some stuff I had downloaded. When I came back to Mom's, they were on porn sites. I was then watching Lost, but Laguerta (Dexter) was on it and she couldn't remember anything she did after getting in her car the night before. Then Ben and Juliet (both from Lost) were talking. I thought they were going to kiss and I was thinking 'ew, Ben's too cool for her'. Then Juliet was with some other guy. Laguerta remembered had seen the dude and had either had an affair with him, or had found out about one."
"2527"	"(2008-12-14 (17)) I was at school, which was different, with Mom and Ezra. It was pretty much empty. The ground started shaking and Brianna and Selena came out of nowhere and we all ran into this building, which was the girl's toilets and stood under the door frame. It shook a lot. Then it stopped and we went out and said it wasn't an earthquake. I said it was became they don't come in waves. I was thinking it was like Cloverfield. We went down to this place and I had to crawl through this vent and go through the teacher's area. I ended up in this shop/cinema. Ezra and I started grabbing bags and chocolates and water. Then I was in a shed place with some people. Shaun Micallef was there. He was going to talk to some guy. Mom was outside. It was night. I kept looking at the city waiting to see a Cloverfield like monster. Then Michael Stahl-David and some others were on a boat and they fell into the water. They drove the boat to some oxygen tank in the water. Then I was watching a movie. This guy had a scar on the right side of his face. He was talking to this guy in a pub, I think, and told him the story of how he got the scar with a few details omitted. He knew the guy he was talking to had given him the scar. Shortly after they almost got into a fight but then the guy said ""I'm Jack Lint"" and the guy was shocked and then was laughing evilly. The scar guy attacked him somehow."
"2528"	"(2008-12-14 (17)) We were getting takeaway for dinner. At around 2pm, Mom went to get it. I was watching a movie and doing stuff and got distracted. At 9pm I went out to see what was going on. Darren called her a cheat. She hadn't been back and no-one could get hold of her. I called her and on the second time she answered. She said her car had broken down. Later I was with her and she continued saying it was because her car had broken down, but she was acting nervous like. There were four really bright stars in the sky and I was trying to take a photo."
"2529"	"(2008-12-15 (17)) I had been going out with this hot guy and for some reason that I couldn't remember we had broken up a few weeks ago. Me, him and some friends were going out. We were all in this big toilet while some of the others got ready. He was there with a girl and he was hugging her and had his arms around her from the back and they were mucking around. I was at the wall and was bored. I slid down to the floor and put my water bottle on my head. Later, we were outside somewhere and Ezra was around. I was thinking that we should play Warcraft. We were talking about Crusades and our daily production on the game, but it wasn't really Crusades. The guy and I made up and he said he wasn't over me etc, but the girl he was with wouldn't leave him alone. I was sitting down in this forest and he walked past Elijah, who was sitting on a stump playing a guitar. He was playing the first few notes of a song. My guy friend said to him ""you won't [or will?] get her like that"". Elijah didn't know I was there. I remembered back to a while ago and we'd had sex and A World Without Love was playing. I was trying to remember why I had sex with him."
"2530"	"(2008-12-15 (17)) I was at home, out the back and these kittens kept coming inside. I would get one back out, but then another would come in. There were three black ones. I went inside and locked up and then saw Tigger swimming in the pool. I unlocked it and ran to her, but I couldn't grab her and I accidentally pushed her under. I tried to dive in, but I couldn't (I was like, floating upside down), so I swam under and she was at the bottom. I grabbed her and pushed her out the top. I got out and the pool tasted like Vital Green and I had some yellow sliver of slime on my leg. I put her inside and Ezra came and gave her a pat. I realized I was thirsty (I was in real life too) and got a drink. I noticed I had some dreams on the bench, so I grabbed them. There was an old envelope of mine and I opened it and there was a brand new, crispy $50 note in it. Dad mentioned a new Keanu Reeves movie called ""Klaatu"" coming out and I said ""Klaatu barada nikto, I've seen the original, I'm not interested in the remake"". I went to my laptop and I had a weird movie playing. The USB was plugged in and had random stuff on it. I had a 4.5gb ISO with Crash Palace on it. I didn't know what it was at first, but I played it and realized and was pretty excited about it. I decided to finish watching The English Patient. Then I decided to go to the shop. I walked there and only brought my water. I was wearing a tight-ish girl like shirt that was almost navy blue. I was near some girls in the shop and these other people came and they owned some alternative clothes shop, with clothes that no-one would wear and there were quite a few scattered throughout the shop, and dissed our clothes. I was walking down the same way they were and they said to be that ""it must be embarrassing walking around wearing that"" and I shouted ""it must be embarrassing walking around with that face!"". I walked back and went into this shop. It had a small entrance and this old lady was going in too, so I stopped and let her go first. When you first got in, there was a shelf full of DVD's. There were DVD's for Thank God You're Here and they had Shaun Micallef on the front, which I thought was odd since he was a guest star. There were DVD's for Lost, but they were in CD cases and the covers were boring. They had strips, the top one had Locke and the rest had the episode titles. There were four episodes per one. Point Break and another Keanu Reeves movie were on the shelf. There were a few other movies which I had decided to download last night. Across from that, were the video games. I was looking at them. This lady was following me around, watching. I had gotten a pack of little Easter eggs and was eating them. I had a plastic bag, that I was keeping them in. I realized I had forgotten my wallet and my phone. This business like lady was next to me, and I thought she was a vampire. She had dark red lipstick on and a black bag. I was going to ask her if I could use her phone but I decided not to. I asked the lady who was following me, since she worked there and told her I'd forgotten my phone and wallet. She brought me to a counter. They went on the computer and asked for my ""Netpay"" number. I said I didn't know what they were talking about, although I assumed it was something you get when you have a job, are over 18 etc. They said they had to make sure I could pay for the call. I saw the prices for some of them and it said ""1 x 9.05"" ($9.05 for one minute) and it was like $400 for a 30 minute call. I told them again I didn't know what they were talking about and that I'd just finished year 12 and was going to the Technical College/university next year (and therefore wasn't working or over 18). I got really upset saying that I only needed to call Mom so she can bring money because I ate one of the Easter eggs, which I ate because ""I haven't had chocolate for ages"". They said that they wouldn't let me go until I paid and I started shouting saying I needed to call Mom to be able to pay and that I just wanted to go home and finish watching ""a movie with Ralph Fiennes"". A bus pulled up full of old women, and Mom came in after them. She was wearing makeup and looked really gross. She came in and was sorting it out. I went to take the eggs out of the bag but it fell apart and they went everywhere. They said not to worry and I grabbed my water bottle from the counter. I was crying and said that ""I'm never coming here again!"" and I was thinking that I was never going to go the shop on my own again either. I woke up with tears in my eyes too."
"2531"	"(2008-12-16 (17)) Some people had some disease like thing. Supposedly, 85% of people had the initial stage of it, but only 17% of them actually had it. You got powers. I got tested. Later I was in a study with a girl. She asked if I had a sore stomach and I said no. I kept making that weird throat burping noise. She was worried that I'd gone through some door, but I didn't. I was then at a hotel place. This guy and I helped out there. He had powers. We were with other people like that. These three guys, who were kind of ugly, came and one of them looked at this girl and fell in love with her. To distract the hotel staff, the guy took them out into the woods outside. Because of this, I had to go back to Mom's. I didn't want to though because my computer was here. I went into my room there and I had Sims 2 loading on my computer and I turned down the music and then shut down Sims 2 because the people were just outside the window. I called Mom to say not to pick me up. She asked if Aster and Cody were there. I said I'd check. I knocked on the door of a room and Aster (Dexter) answered and I said ""I didn't even know you were here, you could have starved to death this weekend"". I started talking to Mom again but she wasn't talking. I then got a photo of her lying on the ground with vomit like stuff around her mouth. I had to leave."
"2532"	"(2008-12-16 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom was in a little on there and I went to a big one, like Big W. Reiner was following me and asked if I had money and I said no. He said he wanted to do some deal but they wanted to see money. He kept following me so I brought him to Mom. She sent him away. She was eating princess cake and saved some for me. We went to leave and went to the carpark. We walked down this slope, but it was the wrong platform, so we walked back up and around to the right one. The car was in the corner with a smashed car just near it. It had a hole in the back window and a dead cat shoved in it. Mom's car also had a dead cat in it. She said it was probably from some teenagers who I'd had a disagreement with. I said I wanted to get out of here. The eyes of the car were in the roof and we couldn't get it out. Then I was watching Grey's Anatomy. George looked different. This girl started waking up in different places and speaking with a Southern accent. Then I was watching South Park and Kyle saw this pregnant woman and decided he wanted an abortion. He took a tablet (which was how you had an abortion) and then there was a preview for the next episode of Heroes. Sylar was making funny jokes. I said he was cool in season 1, but was lame now. He woke up in a different time and saw a younger version of himself on a swing."
"2533"	"(2008-12-17 (17)) I was in a classroom looking place. Sayid (Lost) was teaching me and some others something. Locke (Lost) was one of them. Everyone else got bored and left, saying he was a bad teacher. I stayed and I thought he was pretty good."
"2534"	"(2008-12-17 (17)) I was doing a quest on Runescape. I had to fight this hard demon/dragon which hit like 18's at first. I couldn't log out while doing the quest, so I just left it logged in at this place for hours. I had my axe with me so I went back to the bank and couldn't find my whip or battle axe. Then in real life, I had to do an exam. I couldn't find the stuff I needed for that either. I had two pieces of vegemite toast. It was 38 minutes past whatever time, and I was late. Earlier, I was at home and Mom had been on my Runescape account and I asked her how she got in when she didn't know my password. She said she did and I said what is it then and she said ""I love Eugene"" and I went quiet and asked how she knew that and she wouldn't tell me. I said that I used crushes for passwords. Ezra and Dad were there too."
"2535"	"(2008-12-18 (17)) I was at Nana's. Poppers had gotten a car by ""ad-bibbly"" and it was blue. We were outside, in the patio area. Margarita was there and I think she mentioned some new song and I called her an idiot. I got up and she noticed I was wearing my Beatles shirt and she said ""Well, you like The Beatles!"" and I said ""Yeah, they're only considered the greatest band ever by everyone"". I was then watching Lord of the Rings, but it was different. Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen fell into some water. The others were trying to get over a mountain so they didn't know they had fallen. They were standing on a ledge just above the water. Viggo had a thing for the mountain. Orlando was complaining and then Viggo took down his pants and Orlando went quiet. They went into the water and steps inside a cave. It was then me and I walked up the steps and was then at a school with some others on a balcony outside a classroom. There were little kids with guns on the ground shooting, but not with real bullets but they still hurt. I hid behind a pillar. Later I was with Mom and Ezra in the car. A song was on and I was guessing the words but then realized it was a different version of a song I liked. I knew all the words. They put on some new song and it was a Snoop Dogg song. Ezra showed me the clip and Snoop just stood there waving his hands around. They also played Game of Love. I was then in a car with a guy and we were playing Warcraft, or talking about it. We were in a pro players game, but he was more of a noob than me. There were security guards outside."
"2536"	"(2008-12-18 (17)) I was at Mom's and there were kittens. I had to pick one of them from each lot. This was where we had gotten Cuddles and Gizmo (and when, it was in the past). There were four that I liked from one bunch and I ended up deciding on Gizmo, and then I was choosing Cuddles."
"2537"	"(2008-12-19 (17)) There was an amnesiac old woman walking on the street. Mom wanted to help her. I went home and looked up what to do with amnesiacs walking on the road. Dad's computer was turned off. Someone was playing some sex game. Dad was on my laptop and I remembered about my Chris Barrie desktop."
"2538"	"(2008-12-19 (17)) My notes are extremely messy and I can barely read any of it. The photos from school were back. There were photos of me when I was younger and we had group photos. I had pigtails and was laughing. Johanna was in them and was fat then too. I had to do this drama thing. We only had to do a little bit, but then the guy decided to make us do two. We had to do something with these guys. They sent us to a balcony to get to know each other. There were two lots of chairs and this guy went to my chair. There was a lady doing tricks in a plane, it caught fire and hit the ground. It exploded and just missed the building behind it, which a heap of people were in. Ezra was there. I said something about it."
"2539"	"(2008-12-19 (17)) I was in a shop. There were those big bouncy ball things that you sit on and bounce around. There were black ones. It had this weird plastic bit on it and I couldn't work out what to do with it. This Asian-y guy I was friends with was there. Someone said that it had that bit to stop people from molesting kids. The Asian-y guy said that it didn't stop him -- he had just gotten out of jail."
"2540"	"(2008-12-20 (17)) I was playing a game online. I was playing the trial version and it let you have a free copy of a book which had something to do with a shadow suitcase. I was watching this 'early' clip of Entourage that had Paula Abdul in it but she was really young and I thought it must've been from the 80's. Ari was played by some British guy who was hitting on some girls in a pub. Eric and Vince were the same. I said ""if Ari looked like that, I probably would have never watched it"" and I was thinking Jeremy Piven was hoter than that dude. The characters were boring which I thought was probably due to the lack of the real Ari. Mom was talking about Calvin and she asked why I never ""got friends off Autumn"". Ezra said something about I Want Your Love and then it was playing on the radio and I was singing along."
"2541"	"(2008-12-20 (17)) I was watching a movie called Dog Wars, sometimes it was real. It was night. These people were taken on a boat to a creepy dark place. They had a young girl who looked like Conchita Campbell and the bad guys took her away from them. I don't know what they did with everyone else. I was in a workshop like building in the middle of the bush. First I was alone in there with Robert Downey Jr. I had known him for a while and I was going out with Eugene. He had his shirt off and was trying to convince me to be with him instead. I went to the door to leave, but it was locked. He put his arm around me and kissed me. I pulled away, but his grip was tight, so I rested my head on his chest and couldn't decide what to do. Then there were these two guys in there and they had caught me and were watching me. I had been talking to them and they were hesitant about giving me up. Another bad guy was coming to check on them, so I rolled under this bed that was now there. He came in and asked one of the guys who'd he'd been with. He pointed to Robert, who was lying on a lounge, and said him. Robert smiled and battered his eyelids at him. It was then becoming daylight and the bad guys began running around madly, with fangs sticking out. I realized they were vampires and they were hissing and trying to get underground before the sun was all the way up. Conchita Campbell was under there and was now a vampire. She had dark hair and lips. She found out something about what they did to the others she was with, and she got angry and left. One of the head vampires pressed a button released all these monsters to capture or maybe kill the people there (including me). Conchita found it and turned it off, but it actually just released more. It was night time again. We made a trail leading them onto this boat. Most of them went into it and then we blew them up. A few strays were coming towards us. I had a lighter and I had to light this thing to get this monster coming towards me. I was too scared to use it and I was with a girl and she didn't know how to use the lighter, so I did it, but it was easy and I wasn't too close to the flame. We blew up the thing we were lighting up, but the monster backed away for a second and continued coming at us. It was only moving slowly as it was big. We were throwing stuff at it. It was then day and I was running down this street and I was trying to make cars hit it, but they swerved. I got to the end of the street and saw it walk up a driveway, into the garage. I quickly got around the corner and peeked around to see if it was coming. It came out and walked back the other way. I thought they were going to follow me somehow to find out where I lived, instead of just killing me now, so I walked down this other street. There was a park next to it. This guy called Wolf, who had a squishy face and looked like Sam Trammell, was there talking with some other guys. They had had two people in this swing at different times and both times they had escaped, so they suspected one of the bad guys was actually a 'spy'. They saw me and I had been another prisoner and escaped and they accused Wolf of being the spy. He showed them the swing and was proving to them that they had gotten out themselves. One of them then found sand under a nut on this metal bit, which meant it had been rigged by someone. I don't know if it was him though. I was reading the forum on IMDb later. Someone was asking some questions. One of them was that Wolf had said ""yesterday my father didn't exist"" and they wanted to know who his father was. A reply was that he was the guy ""kissing Medusa"" at the beginning of the movie and was turned to stone. The movie was made in 1994."
"2542"	"(2008-12-21 (17)) I was with Mom and Ezra in the car on our way to see someone pretty far away. All of a sudden she said ""Oh shit, SHIT!"" and I was wondering what the hell was going on. She was stopped on a patch of grass just off the road. I was sitting in the front and Ezra was in the seat behind me. A cop came to Ezra's window and knocked. Mom was hiding her stuff and then opened his window. He told us to get out because he was going to search the car. He handcuffed Mom to the car and we had to stand up against this fence. I didn't know what happened, but as we got back in the car Mom said he'd found some, but let her off with a warning. There was more in her shoe. The whole area was covered in cops."
"2543"	"(2008-12-21 (17)) We were in the car. I had some Red Dwarf shoes. Darren needed to do something with shoes because of something with his feet. My shoes were size 11 and his were 13. Mom was in the car too. Then I was looking at some Chris Barrie thing. He'd had an accident with another guy in the water. They had fallen in and he accidentally got an octopus killed and the other guy had hit two dolphins. I jumped in to save them, but all the animals were dead. Chris had lost his wedding ring. I saw it on the floor and the creepy crawly was near it so I moved it out of the way and picked it up and took it to the surface, although I really didn't want to touch it. Later, I was drying him with a towel. This person asked how we knew each other and we said ""friends"". He was kind of fat and had a couple of chins."
"2544"	"(2008-12-22 (17)) I, along with some others my age, had to do some Thank God You're Here type of thing. We were doing these interviews with Bill Clinton. He had a really strong accent and I could barely understand him. There were bright lights on us and there was a bit of an audience. I was really nervous. He asked a question and I said ""huh?"" and he repeated it and I thought it had something to do with driving and speed limits and the end was ""what would you do?"" and I didn't want to ask him to repeat again so I said ""slow down"", which would have been a good answer if I'd heard properly, but I hadn't, so they sort of gave up. I think I finished it, but I don't remember the rest. After we finished, we left. I ended up at this food place at the beach. Nana was there with some kids. There was water underneath the tables (like there were holes in the boardwalk). We followed Fido who was sniffing around, assuming he'd pick a safe one. A person had a tape of all the sketches we'd done and was showing Nana. There was one with a person who'd poke you and you had to say stuff. I looked under a curtain and saw feet. One that I was involved in was in a pet shop, and I was actually pretty funny in it. I thought the dogs were toys, but they weren't. At the end we did something else, but I can't remember. This guy had a mirror and made his shiny, which made mine black and I was trying to get the right surface back. At some point, Ezra, Mom and I were in a field like area. There was a shiny yellow creature and Ezra kept throwing it at me along with other stuff. I got upset and was saying ""you're hurting it!"". We went into a building and we had gone in there earlier disguised as workers of some sort to turn off an electric field. We were now turning it back on. I was crying and trying to wipe the tears off my face. We walked up the stairs and turned it on. Later, it was late and Mom and I went for a drive. We pulled over on the side of a short side street. It was dark and spooky so we locked our doors. There were towels. The lady came and Mom threw it into her car and she threw the money. It missed the window and went over the car and into a drain behind the car. The drain was on an angle and was big, so I reached in and managed to get it. The lady was amazed we had gotten it. We left and Mom was speeding and then she saw cops. She turned down a street and they came around another way. We drove into a shop and then back out onto the street. They were called to the shop, which distracted them, but we didn't realize and went back in, thinking they were coming back at us. We were knocking some clothes racks down trying to get out. Then I went in as a witness and they asked if the licence ended in ""251"" and I said no there was a 2 and a 3 and so they let us go."
"2545"	"(2008-12-22 (17)) I was at a shop and we were trying to spend the $50 gift voucher. There was a Runescape dictionary there, which was fairly old. I picked up some educational book. I was there with Mom. I had to go to the toilet. There were Eddie Murphy posters and stuff all around the shop. I turned the corner and saw Midge Ure and this black guy sitting at a table signing autographs. Midge had one ear pierced and his lip pierced which annoyed me, but I was excited that he was there and so I was going to get Mom so I could meet him."
"2546"	"(2008-12-23 (17)) I was at school, which was at North Midvale, in the classroom. The kids in the class were mucking around and nothing was happening so I put my head down to rest and teacher gave me a warning. I asked why and she gave me two more. I said that people were mucking around and I decided to rest and I get in trouble? She gave me a note to see the principal and I threw it on the ground and she said that I'd be better off walking home and I said that I was. She followed me until I got past the gate and gave up. I was then walking on the path and I was like 6 or so. There were other kids around that age watching Bob the Builder on the path. I was thinking it was lame. Eugene was there and said it was lame too. He was young as well. Some time later, we were at his house and I was going through some photos. His brother Rodney and father Abraham were there. I was hoping to befriend him now so I could go out with him in the future. There were photos of me too. I kept going to ask questions about computers, but remembered they weren't up to the same standard yet."
"2547"	"(2008-12-23 (17)) I was watching the third movie of a Will Smith trilogy. He was in some red armour suit thing and I was like ""It's Iron Man!"" He was protecting a lighthouse from some creatures. He was like, the last man on Earth or something. It would pretty much mean the end of the world if the creatures got to the lighthouse. Then it was Eugene. We had been going out, but I was dead now. He was in the building and there were sleep tanks behind him. The people in them looked burnt. He was upset and couldn't be bothered about the creatures. As a last resort he could use this thing to go into space and hopefully find a planet to live on. First, he broke this big statue thing outside and there was a bright light which made the creatures obey him for 40 minutes. He ordered them to get this thing ready but didn't tell them what it was for. Later on, the creatures noticed cars driving around and realized he was tricking them and decided to rebel. Eugene was in the building still, talking to me saying he loved me and missed me etc. Then there was a flashback. I went into an elevator. The doors wouldn't close at first. Then they did but it wasn't moving and I thought something was wrong. I banged on the door yelling ""Sandra!"" and I wondered why I wasn't calling out 'Eugene'. It started getting hot in there. I had discovered the creatures were actually dodgy and so they were trying to kill me to 1) upset Eugene and 2) get rid of the evidence. I realized it was the creatures trying to kill me so I quickly set to work. I had a screw in my pocket, which was used as a screwdriver and used it to unscrew the screws off this metal plate in the wall. I remember unscrewing each screw and it getting hoter with each one. I was sweating and wiping the sweat off my forehead. I took out some papers out of an A4 size envelope and was putting them into another one. There were about four of the big envelopes and the papers were evidence against the creatures. I was moving them so they would get rid of what they thought was the evidence, and Eugene would get the actual evidence. There was also a small hole in the roof, which could only fit a few fingers. Then it cut to Eugene. I wanted to be alive and since they didn't show me die, I was worried I survived and I said ""They can't bring me back to life!""."
"2548"	"(2008-12-23 (17)) I was watching a bit of Twilight. Edward and Bella were in the forest and I was thinking that the movie was lame [last night, I'd been flicking through it, thinking it was lame] . I had read something which Kristen Stewart who said that Robert Pattinson was a bad kisser. In an interview she was demonstrating the kiss. She made a noise, a pause and then a snotty sound and that's what the kissing was like. I was like 'ok...'."
"2549"	"(2008-12-24 (17)) I was walking down the street and there were lots of African kids were walking about. One of them, about three years old, hit me and said ""tag, you're it"" and I said ""I'm not playing!"". I kept getting tagged though. I was then at a shop and it had a section with a TV and chairs. It was called 'Cinema for Convenience'. People from school were there. Then there was a house or something there and it was getting blown up because there was a bad guy there. I had something there too, which was getting blown up. I was hiding behind the chairs. This girl got told a code and mimed it to me and I couldn't read her mouth and I asked her again and she whispered it, it was ""7355"". Some people noticed me hiding but were too busy dealing with the bad guy. I grabbed a big box of Ferrero Rocher and was going to pay for it with the school's money, since they were expensive. The thing got blown up and then we left. I grabbed a box of wafer sticks as we went out. I forgot to pay at the checkout and security came. I used the card to pay, using the code 7355. There was only a limited amount of money though and I couldn't afford the wafer sticks so took them back and got given a marshmallow chocolate instead. We weren't allowed back to the cinema and there was a wall in the way now. It was night. Mom and Ezra were waiting outside in the car."
"2550"	"(2008-12-25 (17)) I was on a computer and checking on my 'hot or not' quiz. Darren had been the last person to take it. The quiz wasn't the same though; there were actually a bunch of smaller ones, with say, 10 questions. Each question either had two pictures of the same person or two pictures of different people and you pick the one you like more. The one Darren had taken had some celebrity woman called Elene [insert foreign Greek-y name] . He had only answered two questions and had ended up with 4%. One of his answers was 'hot', the other 'not'. Mom was saying that Elene was pretty ugly. Then I was at home. Dad and Ezra were there. Dad had all this fresh breakfast food such as bread, but Ezra asked for McDonald's breakfast and Dad complained. My laptop was different. Dad had this ultra spiffy version which had 'toolbars' everywhere, which made it really confusing. At some point, we were in the car and Ezra was in the back. Ezra mentioned two movies from 2006, one of which was The Departed and I said ""Not only are they both from 2006, they both contain Matt Damon!"". I couldn't remember what the other movie was though. I was on a computer later, checking all the movies I watched in 2006."
"2551"	"(2008-12-26 (17)) It was the future/just different. People had to be under a certain level of intelligence [watched an episode of The Twilight Zone last night like that] . We had to take tests. There were lots of Asians around. There were a bunch of people who had cheated on the test and I was one of them and we were 'rebels' against the Government or something. I was in a taxi with Mom and Darren. We were all sitting in the back. I saw Samantha walking down a road, near her house (she had a 10-15 minute walk) and I thought they were going to get her, but they didn't. Ezra was now there and he asked why she wasn't at University and I said ""University hasn't started yet nub"". The driver was Asian. I had this male Asian friend."
"2552"	"(2008-12-26 (17)) I was at Nana's. Ezra, Dad and I were there. I could turn into Fido, but I don't know where he was [yesterday we went up there and we didn't see Fido at all] . Ezra didn't know about it. He was starting to get suspicious that Fido wasn't actually Fido though. There was a pond with weird steps scattered around it. I was sitting on it and he scared me off and I ran. I ran with my tongue hanging out as it helped to keep going. I tried to hide the female parts of the dog. Ariana was inside and had a box of toys. She almost knocked it over. I had to quickly run out of the house and ran out the front, as a dog."
"2553"	"(2008-12-26 (17)) I think a bunch of us were swimming. People kept dying. Someone would bring them to the shore. Sometimes it was a movie. This girl decided to bring this guy back to life. It cut to a few days later and he now looked old, say 50-60. It turned out if you brought them back to life they aged ""5 years a day"" (although he had been a teenager and it wasn't that long after). They were in a library and the girl was sitting down. Her father was pretending that he was his gay partner and he held his hand while they talked. I was thinking he was kind of hot, but mainly his personality. It was then a shop. I was there with some friends, including the guy. I worked there and I put some stuff on a counter and asked Autumn to look after it, but this guy went there and I said ""No, I asked Autumn"" but left. I wasn't wearing a bra so went to the aisle where I'd hidden it, which was in which the multiple power socket board things and grabbed one of them too and some other stuff. A lady there said ""Yeah, get your bra"". I went to an aisle near my counter to get changed. I moved two of the aisles into a V shape so no-one could see. This guy wandered into it though and grabbed the cord of the power board. I grabbed the socket end and starting hitting him in the face with it. Eventually he left. I was then standing with some friends, behind a guy on a computer. Someone asked me something to answer with and I said ""I like pretty chicken"". This guy thought it was hilarious and that 'pretty' sounded so ""female"". I said it must be because I have had Pretty Rave Girl stuck in my head. As I said it, I realized the guy on the computer, who was on Windows Media Player, had Pretty Rave Girl at the top of his playlist. A while later I was looking for something and the aisles had changed. A group of guys started following me on the other side of the aisles. They ended up cornering me and started attacking me (trying to take my clothes off and stuff). I yelled out a guy friend's name, which started with an 'S'. I was kicking and fighting and other people joined in too. I got away from them and we caught them. We had them tied up at two ends of the store, outside. The outside of the store, was actually outside. We were sitting under a tree with 6 of the guys and the other two were alone at the other end. One of those guys ran off, but we let him go. This lady came to us and she was really dodgy looking. She had black hair, black eye makeup and a weird accent. She asked to sit with us and if we let her she'd give us this oddly shaped banana. A guy friend took it and I shook my head at him as I thought there was a gun in it. I never found out if there was. She made us play this game, which played out live. It was very nice looking. You started on this ship thing which was on an island. I went into this building straight ahead of it. You fought monsters, collected gold and got experience etc. I was searching around for a while and I eventually got to a 'boss' fight. I had to fight a bunch of people. I killed them all and they dropped a special sword. I had to join it to this thin blue sword thing, which I found in a room in the building I was in. I joined them and it became useable. Lots of the people playing were dead at this point, including the girl who had invited us to play. Three of us were left now. I had a pretty high score, but was coming second. My character had spiffy armour and cape etc, which was all black. After beating that, I started at the start again and decided to go down this path. There was a big house on the left side and there were a lot of trees and plants on either side of the path and was very green. The house was spooky, so I kept walking. I walked to the end, where there was a little square patch with rubble of a building that was once there."
"2554"	"(2008-12-27 (17)) I can't remember what I was looking at, but it was either a picture or a video and Maggie Grace was in it and was very shiny and had a silver-ish tint."
"2555"	"(2008-12-27 (17)) I was watching a movie with Dad with was a low budget science fiction movie. This young explorer dude, who was ok looking, was in a desert like jungle. I don't know what the plot was. I was reading the trivia for it on IMDb and it said that he was the ""former front man of Poison"". I can't remember what it was name was, but it was three words. I asked Dad what it meant by 'former' as that would make him 16 when Poison was around, but this was right. The movie was made in the mid 90's. It turned out that Dad and Ezra knew him and he was still young. Then I was at 'school', on an oval wearing a cheerleading outfit, which looked like the Christmas outfit on Runescape. I was walking across to leave and wondering why I was doing cheerleading. I remembered it was because I hadn't done something else and so had to this instead. I was waiting in an undercover area near a carpark. Eugene was there. He said ""Mom"" and proceeded to talk to this woman with short, blonde hair and I got my phone out to take a photo of her, but silent wasn't on and as I turned it off, she walked off. She had a pram with a baby in it and I wondered what its name was. Dmitri poked his head around from the carpark. I walked across the carpark and was waiting on the other side looking for the Poison dude's car. Eventually he and Ezra came out, but the car was weird and I only had like 20cm to sit in, so he was going to come back and pick me up with a helicopter from the roof of my 'house' or building. So I wondered how I was supposed to get there. I got there somehow. I went inside and it now a game, probably Runescape. I clicked on the stairs to walk up and I got to the roof and said I could just teleport anywhere now (as I now had access to my bank and therefore my runes). We could decorate our roof, so he was checking all of them out. My building was called 'Hello' and had a word similar to hello with ""fuching"" in the middle of the word on the roof. Someone had an Invader Zim themed one. He said he liked mine. This dude on MSN called me ""the sunlight llama"". It was 2am. He tried to do webcam and/or microphone with me, so I put my status to offline. The Poison guy had to pick 7 out of 36 girls that he liked most and go on dates with them. I wasn't one of them, but he picked me."
"2556"	"(2008-12-28 (17)) I was playing some odd game. I had to climb up these tunnels, using pillows to propel me. The next area I had to go into, someone else was there and they were stuck. I didn't want to go in, incase I forgot stuff that I needed and got stuck. Then we went to Nana's and we were in the lounge room near the front door. It was night. She had a present there for Granny, but Ezra opened it and it had shoes in it and he sketched a 'gamer' insult on it. Nana was upset about it. We saw Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and Poppers pull up outside. We went to a shop. I was looking at the shoes, to replace the ones Ezra had ruined. Mom said she was going to a different shop for that. I was looking for the men's clothes section. Mom asked a guy and he said it was around the corner. Then it was no longer a shop, but a 'fun' place, like a museum/amusement park thing. There were rooms with different themed activities. Gizmo was in a room. Ezra was riding around on a little wooden bike, so I went and got one."
"2557"	"(2008-12-29 (17)) I was at Mom's. Ezra said that Samantha and some others were trapped in my room as the wind had shut the door closed. I went up and he got the door open and I was like ""What the hell are you doing in my room?!"". Samantha came out, holding a baseball bat, worried I was going to attack her. I had a metal pole and I hit her with it. Adelynn was hanging around my computer. I was worried Samantha had read my diary and knew that I liked Dmitri, but remembered she already knew anyway and I was thinking 'She knows about Eugene! No!'. I told Adelynn to get away and get out and I hit her with the pole. She slowly waddled out. I had been making ""breakfast, lunch, dinner, whatever you call it"" in the kitchen. It was cereal and in a black garbage bag. Samantha had put bottles in it, which ruined it. I pulled them out and some had stuff still in them. While I was facing the sink, Samantha splashed me with a little bit of it, sort of spitefully/bitchy. I wasn't supposed to have noticed, but I did so I splashed her back with a little bit, and then I found a bottle half full and poured the whole thing over her. I pushed her out the front door. Adelynn was in the hallway and I was closer to my room. She was teasing me because she was ""going to get work"" and I said sarcastically ""because you did well on your IB?"" (She didn't do IB). Then she said I was fat and I said ""look at you!"" and she started running out of insults and I pushed her with the pole and whacked her with it. I got her outside and she kept trying to come in. We had this barrier outside the house, which was in the middle of a field and the barrier was a fair way away, but she managed to pass the barrier."
"2558"	"(2008-12-29 (17)) I was at a cinema with Eugene, who was my boyfriend. I got up and went to the counter and you could buy raffle tickets there. You had to guess what Dean (Supernatural) had mimed, if anything, in an episode. The proceeds went to charity. I bought one and then went back. There was a guy and a girl behind the counter. A few minutes later, I discovered I had won. The prize was a million dollar diamond ring. I didn't want to get it, but since I could sell it, I went to collect. I said to the guy behind the counter, ""You can have it for $200"". I went back and the rest of the cinema found out. Some congratulated me, and some were eyeing me and I was thinking they were going to steal it. We were walking down the steps outside and this guy was walking towards us. He had been hired to pickpocket it off me, but I thought he was dodgy so I took it out and swapped it with something. It later showed him holding a box of tampons (what he had stolen) and said ""damn it!"". We were then back in the cinema, which was empty and the checkout people were after me. Eugene grabbed me and took me down between the seats to hide. Some time later, we decided to leave the country as they weren't going to stop. I left Eugene with the real one and took a fake one with me. I drove out to a lake, with the people following me. I called him and asked if it was all ok and he said he had the real one ""under the tree"" (It was Christmas). The people were catching up to me and I was on a bridge. I drove the car off into the water. It sank pretty quickly and I was holding my breath. I said a code into the phone which blew off one of the doors. I then said another code and the other door blew off and then the car glided quickly away. I swam up under the bridge, and there wasn't much space to breathe (I could pretty much fit my nose and barely my mouth). The person was nearby, as I could see her on my mini map. I could read minds. I swam a little bit away from the bridge and came out of the water and I said something and she jumped in. Now she was the French woman from Lost. She just went straight underwater and didn't come up, and I didn't get what she was doing. Then I was watching Pushing Daisies and the woman knew she was in a dream. Ned realized and managed to get out of it. I was thinking that it wasn't a bad episode. They had been copying popular stories for most of the show instead of making real storylines. Mom had made me a baked bean toasted sandwich. I had a cat on my lap."
"2559"	"(2008-12-30 (17)) I was with this guy I liked, who was Sam (Supernatural). We were in a forest and we had to get a snake out of this cage to prove who had killed someone. The snake cage was about a meter long and half a meter high and was inside a bigger cage, at the top. The bigger cage was made of a softer mesh and had plants in it, through the mesh and on the ground. It was very green. Before we could get to the snake, we had to find and get this lizard which was in the big cage. We finally found the lizard and Sam said ""go away monkey"" and it leapt off the fence and bounded away into the forest (it was actually a monkey). He said that Sawyer (Lost) must've come in here during the night and swapped the lizard with a monkey. Sawyer was the main suspect. I wondered out loud what the lizard had to do with the snake. Sam didn't know either. The snake cage was now up higher. Before, it was just above our heads, now we had to climb up these oddly placed boards. I accidentally climbed onto a board away from the proper ones. The drop below was pretty far and I had to jump across and it was a bit of a jump. I managed to get half of myself onto and Sam pulled me onto it. The snake cage was now back to the height it was before and we were standing on the ground. The snake was sleeping, so Sam opened it, grabbed it and quickly threw it out of the bigger cage. He stared for a second and then told me to run. We started running through the forest and the snake was chasing us. Then it was third person view and Dean (Supernatural) was also there. My back started hurting and Sam stopped and made sure I was ok. I freaked out about the snake and ran off and through this dark patch of trees, which was also quite clear (the trees were thin) because I didn't want to go in the light. We were then in a building. Dean got a 'hunch' and walked off but then he was Sam. He had a vision and the building slowly faded away and looked like a dark forest. This dark lady with bulgy eyes in a dress started talking to him. Back in the building, he was saying stuff out loud from the vision. What he said gave away the identity of the killer. But, the building was now a police station and they had already arrested the bad guy. The lady from the vision was actually a cross-dresser or something and was the killer. Then Sam was someone else and they told the police to ""check the panel van"" as in the vision he had seen the killer kill a wife and a daughter and had left clues of it being from a snake to cover it up. Then the guy who had seen the vision was shaking his head and saying ""I'm a cross dresser"". He thought he was wearing the dress the lady had been wearing, but he wasn't. I was like 'ok...'. Then it was episode of Kenny vs. Spenny, although I only remember seeing Spenny. I wondered what the competition was."
"2560"	"(2008-12-31 (17)) I was at school, which was different. I was there to repeat Year 12. There were lots of others there, including Calvin, Eugene and a lot of IB students were actually there to do a post-IB thing. Calvin remembered about Eugene suddenly and said ""Eugene Pritchard!"" and I was like ""damn it!"". Daryl was nearby and he knew about the joke and chuckled. Later, Eugene was sitting near me and his bum was close to my face. He had a black stain on his pants and I pointed it out to Calvin and he started joking behind his back and adding people to his city on My City (Facebook game). Eugene turned around and was like ""what's going on?"" but he was smiling and laughing a little. I laughed and said that there was ""only seven to go"" (only seven residents to add before we ran out)."
"2561"	"(2008-12-31 (17)) I'm not sure where I was. Eugene was there with some other people I knew. There was a game and we had to battle some weird monsters. In real life, went to a 'chemist' and no-one was there. From the door we came in, there was a shelf of chocolates to the right of the counter. This old lady came and was talking to them. I got two packs of M&M's -- a peanut one and a normal one and put them behind a small statue at the front of the counter. The lady went out and we saw her through the window talking to a guy and a friend told us to run, so we ran. We got to this pool thing, which had flat seats to sit at (like they usually have at pools, going up steps, except this one was just by itself) and as we ran in I hit my leg on the edge of one, which hurt. I sat on this ledge with a guy friend of mine. I had a dream in my pocket, which I was worried was going to fall into the pool, so took it out and put it in my book, which I put somewhere safe. It was hard to balance. Later, I wanted chocolate so I went back to the chemist. No-one was there again. The peanut pack of M&M's was torn open. I grabbed a normal pack off the shelf and threw it so it skidded across the floor and out the front door. No alarm sounded so I figured it was ok. Later, Ezra got in trouble for stealing a car. I was sitting down with headphones on. No music was playing, but it made everything a lot harder to hear. Mom was talking to me. She then said that she had been told I'd stolen a smoke from the chemist. I said ""What? I took a pack of M&M's"", she sighed, upset that I'd stolen, but then I said ""I left $3 on the counter because I figured that'd be enough"" she nodded and said it would've been enough. I said since no-one was there, that was all I could do."
"2562"	"(2009-01-01 (17)) I got a booklet in the mail as I'd signed up with some job site that sent alerts with what jobs were available. There was a job at Video Ezy in Innaloo and so I was going to call tomorrow about it. I was at home and it was late at night. Mom was there. We went to some place near the city. Daryl was there and he was talking to someone about how you can tell ""what someone watches"" or plays etc. They mentioned Smallville and I said that I watched it and they looked at each other in surprise and then asked about Supernatural and I said I watched that too and then some Anime thing and I said no and they nodded expectantly. They asked about something and I said ""yeah, I mean Pet Society"" and I said I didn't play it anymore. I told Mom we'd met ages ago -- when we were teenagers. I didn't know when that was though, and wondered why I said teenagers, since we were still teenagers and I got him confused with someone. In the distance, I saw a fire. It actually turned out to be close and was coming closer. We were then in the car with Mom and she drove up this hill to get away and there was more fire up there. We drove around for a little while and Daryl grabbed my hand at one point and I tried to pull away but he wouldn't let go, so I just let him hold it. We were then standing outside on a street. Lightning was randomly hitting trees. Mom was judging when they were going to fall and we'd run. We got to this oval and there was a building on it. People were playing sport, and it was raining but no-one seemed to notice. We climbed up the stairs on the building and then Mom said it was going to clear up. Daryl said that in the class we had next, to sit next to him. Then I was in this class. Ezra was in it. We were on the computer and the teacher was yelling at us. I had heaps of $100 notes to look after. The tables were really small. I think the teacher had her name on the board and I said ""your name's spelt wrong"". An 'I' was missing, then a 'C'. She got me a bigger table as I couldn't fit properly into mine. Ezra had been sitting next to me, but it was now Emery. We had to some thing in pairs. I can't remember properly, but we had to jump from these crates in the water. There were eels in there. I fell in and was trying to get out to get away from the eels. Also, I had to some swimming thing in a pool. Dad was there. It had something to do with IB."
"2563"	"(2009-01-01 (17)) I was at Mom's, in her room and Ezra opened the cupboard door and showed me Mittens sitting in there. I couldn't remember why she was here."
"2564"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) I went to the shop with Mom. She bought some expensive thing and I got a little hook thing for my wall. At the checkout the lady said it came to some amount ""plus 1000"". As we left I asked if my hook had cost $1000 and Mom said no it only cost $1.50. As we were going to the carpark, we walked past a black van that was pulled up on some grass next to the carpark which was for a radio station. I walked past to go to the car and Mom walked towards it. I saw Hamish Blake and another guy walking towards it. I looked back when I was almost at the car and they were looking over my way. I was then in the car and they came over singing to this girl, asking her why she didn't come over, and she was laughing and embarrassed. They came over to my side of the car and touched the door doing a funny dance, which made it lock. I discovered the other guy was Merrick Watts. They were messing outside for a while and I was trying not to laugh. I was thinking I should get a photo with them but I thought it seemed too dodgy to ask. They gave a girl from school some Cheeto's and Lillian asked for a couple and the girl just handed her the packet angrily. Lillian was like ""I'd love to get chips off them"". I was then at Mom's, which was different. I woke up and I went to get something to eat. I found chocolate biscuits and chocolate and stuff in the fridge, which I got excited about. There were Spongebob toys on the bench. Mom said they were cool."
"2565"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) I was at home except it had a lot of windows. We were leaving for school. I was outside and the car was on the grass. The window for my room was on that side of the house and I realized I left my light on. I asked Dad, who was inside, to turn it off. He complained under his breath. When he came out I said I'd get in the car when it was off the lawn so I didn't get prickles. Then we were all playing Warcraft, except it was totally different. Swarms would come towards you, but you had to protect houses on the streets from them. Mom and someone were taking the next spawn. I told them not to worry about it because the last guy would get them, but then I realized this spawn were 'elephants' (which were big blue elephant balloons) and they were coming towards our house (they bounced on the houses and smashed them). I looked in through the window and saw my computer and I was freaking out. I could see I was halfway through typing up a dream as well. They got them all though."
"2566"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) We had this really small rectangle patch of grass in the road to later build a house on. I was looking at it, trying to work out how we were going to fit any kind of house on it. I asked Dad what kind of house they could build and he mentioned a cartoon character, which was a reference to the latest episode of South Park that I had randomly decided to watch recently (in the dream). There was a path over it too and I asked if we were allowed to remove it and they said yeah. Mom's house wasn't too far away from it. I discovered Jeremiah lived in front of the patch. Dad had also left some Christmas presents out the front of Eugene's house. They came outside and he called out to them and they just looked at him funny and didn't say anything. I said they were probably wondering why you left them presents and he nodded in agreement. I was then at a house. I was watching TV and there was a knock at the door and I can't remember who it was. Mom and Darren then got back."
"2567"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) There was a new video of Sims 3. This guy put one of each different part to make what kind of Sim he was going to make when it came out (he got the head from one picture, the back from another etc). The back didn't blend with the rest too well."
"2568"	"(2009-01-03 (17)) I was at a cinema at the counter. Dad asked for two tickets to a movie and gave them to me and Ezra. He then got a ticket for himself for Hellboy II. I didn't know he was going off by himself and I said ""You haven't seen Hellboy II yet? I watched it yesterday"", but he wasn't listening."
"2569"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was watching a video of Youtube of Darius paintballing on the street. I was looking for Eugene. The group was him and his friends and they were fighting against each other. There were lots of cameras around and the video had been edited to show it from the best angles. They were spraying fake snow at random places, on the grass etc to make it look nice. This girl with them had a scarf with pink feathers around her neck. The title of the video had the names of the people involved, including Darius's plus a bunch of Macedonian/Russian sounding names."
"2570"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was outside at a school. There was some new thing to do with the Government and people were celebrating it. There was an assembly thing and I was carrying a big flag, which was folded up (I didn't know it was a flag at this point). When I got in the room, there was a smallish audience and there were people standing up in rows at the front. The door was near the front, and I ran behind the people and handed this girl the flag, which we unrolled while I ran back, and it was the American flag, but it was upside down. I saw Elijah in the audience."
"2571"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was watching outtakes from Twilight. David Tennant was in them and there were a few where he was talking normally and I was thinking it was hard to understand his Scottish accent. The outtakes weren't funny at all and I wondered why they even put them together."
"2572"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was at Mom's. My room was different. I saw this squirrel like animal run behind my desk. When I left a while later, Darren asked if I'd seen the squirrel and I said ""I thought it was a squirrel"" but that I thought I'd imagined it. They said they needed to get it. It was just a mouse looking thing. It bit my hand, which stung and Mom put some cream on it. Mom also asked me at one point if I'd worn a pad at all during my last period because ""there was blood on everything"". I was walking to the car and I passed Eugene and I put my hand out and our fingers touched. We were then both sitting in the back of a car and I can't remember where the drivers were going. Then I was with Mom and Ezra. Leslie lived next door to this person Mom went to see. She was holding her baby and it had a dirty face. I spat on my hand and was cleaning its face, while I was holding it. I handed it back, noticing that it was pretty heavy and almost fell back. We drove back in there at a later time, and there were shoes making up the line in the middle of the road. I was then reading a book or watching a movie and in it, this guy went into this warehouse like building (it was shed-like, but big). It had a roller door. He was looking for this guy. The guy was in there and he followed him through this tunnel underground. Then it was a game and I had to pick four out of quite a few options about what I wanted him to do (and in turn, what I thought would make the most interesting reading experience). The guy's thoughts were in the book and he was thinking that it had now been 18 months under there. The bad guy decided to get it over with and confronted him -- he was a demon looking thing [Clive Barker style] ."
"2573"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was wondering what The Beatles had thought of The Beatles. There was a picture of John Lennon holding an album and I was then like 'Hang on, they are The Beatles' and was confused about how I forgot they were."
"2574"	"(2009-01-05 (17)) I was at school and in the office because I was doing a private study thing there with Ms Pascal. It was night. There were other people in there. Someone joked about how clean it was, but I didn't get it so just went ""ok..."". Then someone went ""ew, gross!"" and there were three huge cockroaches on the ceiling. I remembered this happening before and the school had set on fire so I didn't unpack my stuff. I thought that maybe I should get Eugene. The biggest cockroach kept following me around. This boy on the net had ways to get rid of them (I think). Then I was at Mom's in the dining room. There was a small TV in the lounge room, but in front of the wall closest to the back of the house. Darren and Mom were there. Thank God You're Here was on and they were about to 'announce' the next person and I said ""Hamish Blake!"" and it was and for the next one I said ""Shaun Micallef!"" and I was right again. I had guessed them because they were two of my favourites."
"2575"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was watching a movie. This guy had quizzes on weird things. One of the questions on one was ""when did you first take pictures with an Aztec Camera [not the band] "". I was at Mom's, which was different, and we were in a big room which didn't have much stuff in it. There was a doll house with Barbie's. It was night. Mom was telling a friend who was there, called Chantelle, that she used to hide drugs in Barbie's. Chantelle left and then another friend of Mom's came. She didn't let her in at first; worried she had the cops with her. She was black and naked. Darren was there too. There was a bunch of little things to add to a car, there was a clock etc, and I was going to put them on my side in Mom's car but she said to put them in my car. Ezra was there and we were starting our diet tomorrow. Mom had made or gotten chips and some other fatty thing and asked if I wanted chips and I said yes, she looked at me oddly and said 'you sure?' and I said that I might as well, it's the last night. I was then driving. It was day. At a set of lights, which was a huge area, there were people stopped even though it was green. There were a few different lane options once you went through the light and you had to pick which character you wanted to be (although nothing happened). I thought for a bit but then realized it didn't matter and chose the Santa lane. The road wasn't very clear and I went over a hill and crashed. These cops came and told me to get out. Then I heard 'Well I Wonder' on the radio. I thought that this had happened before and I had reset at a certain point. One of the cops was dark skinned and he said something to me and then it reset and they came again. I said ""Now Barbarism Begins at Home will come on"", then I realized I'd said the wrong song, but Well I Wonder came on and they thought I'd said the right thing. They didn't believe me, so as they were talking I was saying what they were saying and they realized I was telling the truth. My car was now a rusty old metal board and I didn't know how to stop the loop. Then I was somewhere else and Dad had a joke about Pretty Woman on his Facebook -- something like ""he got the pretty, but what about the cake?"". The 'cake' meant Julia Roberts and it meant she was really ugly. Then there was a poll on Richard Gere and you voted for how cool he was. Then I was watching The Dead Zone and Mary was in a car with another woman, who was naked and they were kissing each other and having sex. The other woman told her to stop because she was bored and Mary said she was just trying something new. Either she or I was walking outside these shops on the sidewalk with a gay friend. There was a religious building next to an anal sex place. A girl in the religious place was trying to hand out brochures."
"2576"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was at Mom's and it was morning but I was trying to sleep. A girl friend of Mom's came over with a baby. They kept talking and doing things loudly and then two more came over."
"2577"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was out the front of home. It was on a different street and on the opposite side it is now though. I had a CD playing in this guy from across the road's car. He said something to Mom and she said to me that he'd said he liked ""12 female singers"". I was like ""ok..."". As we were getting ready to leave, it was now night, we heard sirens. Mom quickly drove into this driveway and did these quick, spiffy turns so she was facing out the driveway. The ambulances and other emergency vehicles pulled up in the driveway in the house next to the one we pulled up in. We drove off and there were teenagers playing at the park."
"2578"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was watching a movie. This girl was on her laptop, on the internet, talking to a guy who was going to give her a code for something off a computer. She was a spy and he was as well I guess. He said that it crashed and it showed him with the computer, which had stuffed up. Then it showed a split screen of the girl and the other was a guy at his laptop and they both said ""Damn it!"" at the same time. What had actually been happening was they were both trying to get the code off each other and the spy guy we saw was just her imagining what was going on. He said to her that he was going to try and get the code back, trying to think what the code could be. He went into his kitchen and this person came in and said ""bananas"" and then mentioned what they were having for dinner and said ""excellent choice"" and left. I thought 'maybe that's the code'. Later his mother mentioned it and said ""excellent choice"" again. He went outside and got in the car and his father was in the back and said ""excellent choice"" again and then he thought maybe it was the code and went back. Then I was watching Sleepless in Seattle [haven't it seen it yet] . Meg Ryan was crying at a guy (the love interest) and told him to get lost and he said ""I'll annoy you with something we both hate"", or something which was a friendly joke."
"2579"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was in a room, and there was a garden like setting behind a glass wall. Two people were in there because were zombie like. Calvin was telling me about Quarantine and I said you should watch [Rec] because it was probably heaps better [watched it last night, but haven't seen Quarantine] and because Jennifer Carpenter can't act etc. Eugene and his father Abraham were there. Mom had been going out with him. I thought it was strange that they did because Eugene and I were going out. The house was like Mom's. I went out to the lounge and his father was in the kitchen. We joked around for a few minutes. We then had to move the zombies and Calvin was the only person with the code for the door. He didn't want to put it in, but did. He told the zombies to watch [Rec] . The zombies switched between zombies and people, and they were more people like at the moment. Calvin had been bitten, I think. I was then in the dining room and my tooth hurt. I played around with it and then it came out. This other one was loose too and I pulled that and it hurt and was still attached by a string like thing. I grabbed the string and pulled it out, which also hurt. I put them on a tissue and showed Mom. I said that I thought I'd lost all my teeth and she said we'd go to the dentist soon and mentioned that people are always so scared of dentists."
"2580"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I had just gone to bed and noticed the light from outside was on. It was night. I got up and Mom was in the toilet and I asked her to turn the light off outside because it was too light in my room. [Mom woke me up straight after that and said 'It's so dark in here'] ."
"2581"	"(2009-01-07 (17)) I was at 'school'. School had just finished and we had to go back for a little while. It was only for a few weeks. Depending on which group of last names we belonged to, we were allocated two lots of a few days of holiday. The first one was A-D, but the next one started with D-something and I was in that one. We only had one set of holiday, which was like 3 days in the middle of the weeks. I complained to a female teacher as everyone else had longer ones and had two, so she gave us another one. I was then in a class with a new male teacher. He asked me to introduce myself and I shook my head, he kept saying ""I can't hear you"" and so I said ""Well, I'll just leave then"" and walked out. I called Mom and she said she couldn't get me because she had no, but she was out in the Mighty and I said ""You're in the Mighty! How have you got no car?"" and she was silent."
"2582"	"(2009-01-07 (17)) I can't remember where I was, but zombies came and we were bashing them. I think we were in a small-ish shop. There were these gates at the counters, that were just up to waist level and I was trying to lock a zombie out but the lock wouldn't work. It would turn and click but the door could just be pushed open. Then there was me, a guy I liked and others and we were staying in this other shop which was weird. There was this underground place we were staying in there and it had lots of pipes and it was creepy. In the main part of the shop, we had found a few people. There was a group of young teenage boys and they were pale and sickly. The zombie thing started with ""flu like symptoms"" and so I suspected they had been bitten. There was a computer thing in the shop, which was touch screen, and it would scan the place for infections and the people without the infection would turn up as green squares and those infected were red. I let it scan and there were about the same amount of green as there were red. I told the people who had been bitten or were sick that we'd have to put them somewhere else. As we walked them there I was saying we'd check on them now and then and give them food, and that some would turn earlier than others but we couldn't let them out and that it would get 'smelly'. We walked into this short hall which had a door at the end, which led to a huge toilet (it looked a bit like a change room). I was with a guy and he went in to check it out and others were still coming in. One of them changed suddenly and was coming towards the door and I told my friend that he had five seconds to get out. He got out and I tried to lock the door, but it wouldn't lock again, so I ran down the hall and closed the door from the hall and the zombie was like ""a closed door?"", which he just threw open. I pulled off this metal pole from this bit of machinery I ran past and I was also holding another blunt instrument. I don't know what happened then. We were then in the underground part. This woman had made lots of rows of these ropes, lying horizontally and they were fairly long. About every meter, there was a vial or a bottle of some sort of liquid, usually blood from an infected person. She thought it would work as a vaccine. We had to walk or crawl along the side of the rope and drink the entire thing. I didn't want to drink the blood, thinking it would just cause the infection so I just took a sip out of the water bottle, which was the second last one and got out of it. Everyone else drank them. Someone mentioned Dustin Hoffman being in lots of movies. Later we were all sitting outside and they all looked healthy and I realized the vaccine must've worked. We had to leave there. I think we had this other small shop place. We were walking down a road and the houses were 'Indian' looking (or so I was thinking in the dream). They were poor looking and most didn't have windows (just holes) and were white and had pointy bits on the roof. The whole place was desert-y looking. There were houses and plants, but the plants were very dry looking. The road we were walking on was a main road and there was a road to the left just before the block the other shop was on. On the right was a lot of dry grass and one of those houses down a hill. I was holding onto some stretchy blue stuff that was connected to something on top of a hill (the road went up a hill). A car came with a few people in it and I let the stretchy stuff go a bit loose so I could rest it on the ground and when the car drove over it, it wouldn't snap. I don't know where the people went. I walked up the other shop, but the guy I liked, who was now a young-ish Chris Barrie, and Ezra stopped at this patch of sand before it. They had decided to leave the other shop and use this patch as a new house. I thought the house was underneath the sand. They had a pile of bricks covered in sand in the middle and I asked how we got in and they said we don't. They were making a shop and had been just sleeping outside. I was saying there was no way I was going to sleep outside. I was also starting to not feel well, and decided I wanted to take the vaccine but we couldn't go back. The bricks were painted (to make a picture of the front of a house or shop when put together) and were light blue and white. I stood up and saw a zombie on the road and put a fist up. Chris ran down to fight him. I threw a brick at the zombie but it just missed. He was fighting him and he fell. I yelled ""Chris!"" and then ran down. I grabbed a stick with fire on the end and lit the zombie on fire, and then I threw the stick onto the dead grass next to the road, which also caught fire. I helped Chris up and helped him walk back to Ezra. I saw more zombies coming and so we all ran through the alleys and into a house. It was dark inside and we went into this room which had a bed and a cupboard. There was a window facing the street, which had a curtain over it, but I could see through it, and I saw a motorbike and an open army-like car drive past (which were what we were hiding from).We were waiting for a call from this guy who could help us make something so I didn't get sick and I told Ezra to put it on silent, but then it vibrated and it was the guy calling. He asked if I had all these ingredients and I said I did and repeated all these things ending with '-una'."
"2583"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) I was at school, which was different, with Calvin and we were delivering boxes to the office. There was some carnival thing. Samantha asked us to go and I think I said no but later said to Ezra that we should've gone. Then I was at the carnival in the ball pit, which was big. Margarita was nearby, sitting on the sidelines and called out ""Ugly!"" to me and was asking people if they thought I was ugly. I yelled out back ""Look who's talking you fat ugly cow"" and everyone gasped and I said ""Seriously, have you seen her face?"" etc. They left me alone after that. Then I was playing with Bradley. We were either in a pool or the balls still, and he couldn't see (had a blindfold on I think) and he had to try and find me. I was backing away trying not to give my position away and trying not to squeal or laugh. Then there was some clown thing and a pool full of dead clowns. It showed underwater and they were all floating vertically. One of them had a finger that was almost decayed off from the rest of it. I was thinking of some of the scariest clowns (no actual real ones). This guy had to choose an option and this guy was supposed to help him. It was like a game, and every option limited your next one and what would happen to you. He decided to opt for Option A as he wanted Option B (I'm designating names so it's less confusing). If he opted for Option B first it wouldn't go as well. One way was a 'bad' way. The guy got him drunk and he forgot and chose the bad way (it was good for him at first, but later it wouldn't be). I think before this, he entered the evil realm. This fleshy skin coloured 'monster' (it was like a long, thin cylinder shape) shot out at his face and the guy grabbed it and pulled it off whatever it was attached to. People were discussing it later and saying he should've ripped this thing out from inside its 'mouth'. This guy who was helping him was actually from the evil realm and it was a joke on the other guy. He apologized to his leader and was going to leave because he was bad or something."
"2584"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) Mom was going for a drive. She asked Ezra if he wanted to go. I think I wanted to go get something during the drive."
"2585"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) I was in the backseat of my car in the carpark at Midvale shops. This guy got in the drivers seat and a girl got in the passengers side. I was like ""Hey! Get out of my car!"", but the ignored me and drove away. I asked them to drop me off home and they thought this was a good idea and started driving up the road behind the shop and turning the next left. We missed it first and they turned and went down it. When we got there I took out this little hammer and hit him over the head with it, he was just like ""Ow!"" and I kept hitting him but nothing much happened. Mom came out and I asked her for a bigger hammer and she asked why, but gave me one and I started bashing him with it."
"2586"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) I got to Seabird somehow, but it was totally different and was actually in the middle of a city near a main road. I went to where our caravan was supposed to be, but it wasn't there. This guy who also used it was there and he said his was now in 'The Mercury'. I went to leave and was standing at the side of the main road, which was two lanes but they were both going towards me. The lane furthest away was busy but the other was empty. I walked out to the middle of the road and then realized it was too busy and went back. Then the guy pointed out The Mercury, which was hotel like and the windows all looked like they had blankets and towels on them. I remembered we had number 12 and I went into the lobby. Then this guy, who was me, had sex with these three girls. Two of them were called Eve and Gwen and Eve was black. He was lying with them."
"2587"	"(2009-01-09 (17)) I was somewhere with the school and I was with Calvin. Eugene was nearby and I noticed he had a piercing and then I noticed he was wearing a bracelet and a ring on the middle finger of his left hand and I was really annoyed by this. I was going through my bag and there were lots of notes in there, a total of around $500. It had been given to us ages ago but I'd forgotten about it. Then I was at this building with lots of levels and secret ones below. There were parties happening on most of them. One of them had these baths with special blue water. They were very shallow. I decided to use one. I lay down and then I wanted to call Mom to get me later and I left the building to call her. I went on an elevator to get back. They were dirty so I was cleaning it first. Then it wasn't as shallow. This bath was closest to the wall and there was a square 'drop' in the bottom of the bath, near the wall and there was a little fish thing. You weren't allowed to take it out but I got a cup to get rid of it and it went crazy so I put it back. Then I was someone else and I was lying in the bath and the fish grew into this huge monkey like thing. It tried to have sex with me and held me down. It was rubbing against me and got bigger and I told it to go smaller because I was a virgin and it shook its head. Later, I think, I was at this little hut place next to Mom's to help poor people and Africans or something. I was helping for the day. I had to sit at a desk and ask a few questions and send them out this door. I also was prank calling Charlene asking about her water pipes, talking in a serious voice, and there was no end joke; all I did was ask questions about the pipes."
"2588"	"(2009-01-10 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill and Brooke was working in a diner. She was serving food and getting flashbacks of war images due to something that happened to her. One of the foods was some sort of sweet pie. There was an old couple. The old lady asked something and this other worker girl said they would hurry. The old lady said to the old man that his pies were served too rushed and were ""put together with shaky hands"". He looked at her and cried. Someone tried to give a phone to this guy behind the counter and told him to answer it. The phone was actually bomb. Then we were in this bank and someone said ""get the transporter"". Then this guy suddenly spun around and kicked all these guns that were on the floor and sent them under these red lounges nearby. He did some other spiffy fighting moves and made it to the other side of the room. I said ""effects!"". He was handcuffed to some guy and was still fighting. This guy said ""why don't you take your handcuffs off?"". The guy, who was British, said ""I don't know ok!"". On Yahoo there was a thing about how Jeffrey Dean Morgan got a call from some woman about some ""exciting"" film role and mentioned him being a hallucination on Grey's Anatomy and something else."
"2589"	"(2009-01-11 (17)) I had thought that our leaver's jackets looked like some Year 10 jackets we had gotten at Whitehall High, although I was thinking that I didn't do Year 10 there. I was looking at some photos on my computer from that time and they were wearing the same jackets, except theirs were a lighter blue. I remembered that Liesl had been on the leaver's jacket committee at both schools and realized she just recycled the idea. I told Mom about it. I went to school for something. We were standing next to the PAC, facing the gym, which was a lot of bigger. They made us all gather somewhere and Autumn bumped into me, and I thought she was going to say ""Hello Sunshine"" but she ignored me. Ms Solomon asked us questions about Bella's 'sadness' in the Twilight movie. All the girls began talking excitedly about it. Then we were in a computer room. I was at a computer in a smaller part of the room, next to Elijah who was sitting to my left. He was typing, but at the same time pressing backspace so nothing would show up. I hit '69' and it showed up. He thought it was funny and asked why I pressed 69 and I said it was the easiest number to hit, so he hit '55' to show that was easier. Eugene was in the bigger part of the room and was to the left of me. He looked tired and grumpy and kept ruffling his hair and putting his head on the desk. He was also really pale. We were then outside and there was a parade going down this street. There was a car on the island in the middle of the two lanes and we hid on the side away from the parade. People were looking for us. People poured out of this building across the road and then some of them would come to the front and sing. Eugene came out with some other guy and he looked kind of chubby. I was with Calvin and I thought he was going to say something about Eugene but he didn't."
"2590"	"(2009-01-11 (17)) I was on my laptop and had my PowerPoint presentation open. I left the room and when I came back I was talking to Ezra on MSN and he had changed my font colour and background colour. The font was now a light blue and the background was yellow. He sent 'Bart rules!' and this colour change had something to do with The Simpsons. There was a movie on later with George Clooney and I laughed and said ""milk!"" and thought about the milk thing."
"2591"	"(2009-01-11 (17)) I can't remember it properly, but Calvin, Samantha and I were playing a real-life game. I brought this burger and we all had to share it and have a certain amount left over for the next part. It was really saucy and Samantha dared me to eat it and I couldn't resist it and took a big bite. I then put it down and went to talk to Calvin. When I came back, the burger was mostly gone and there were only a few bits left. I asked Samantha if she had eaten it and she said she had. I complained and said we needed to share it or we wouldn't get to the next part."
"2592"	"(2009-01-12 (17)) This girl got possessed by some purple smoke [happened in an episode of Torchwood I watched last night] . She became violent and killed some people. We were trying to find a way to save her. She took over Gizmo so we wouldn't kill her. Some stuff she had tried to gather was in alphabetical order, but also with numbers and strokes. I was doing a study thing like the MUPC and I had special study guides which were for after highschool only. Mom was somewhere. There was a quiz to see which guy from something you were. Whatever I got, 85% of others got him too."
"2593"	"(2009-01-13 (17)) I was out the back at home. I was cleaning around the side of the house. There were dead kittens under a slab which was resting diagonally against the wall of bricks. Mom was there. I was then at her place and it was night and her house was different and bigger. She decided to go see a friend of hers. There was a TV show called Hancock and along with some other torrents, I had it ready to download. I started getting scared, as I was alone, and called Mom. She asked if I wanted her to come back and she said she would come by and I said to not worry. I was jiggling the cord from the phone. I was then at someone's house and someone said the neighbour was nice or something. I was in a class and Dad was there, I think and the teacher was there. He gave me a pencil and told me he was going to get me to write a sentence to take these monsters ""out of the world and into words"". I said ""that doesn't really help"" (make sense). He said something and he was a monster/bad guy. People would realize they didn't come there by chance? Some time earlier I was in bed, sleeping. I woke up and Spaceman, Cuddles and Gizmo were on my bed as well as some people. I was trying to take a photo."
"2594"	"(2009-01-13 (17)) I was at Mom's old house. My room was different and someone put this thing on a tall cupboard I had. They went to bed (my bed, which was just a normal single bed) to sleep. I then tried to jump and get the thing but I couldn't reach and didn't want to stand on my chair incase I fell or broke it. Then someone said they had left poison at the back door (it was Santiago). I looked down the stairs and the front door was open and it was like early morning outside. It was too spooky to go down, so I checked the other doors on the second floor. I told Mom about the poison so I went downstairs and there were huge lumps of meat with a needle and stuff next to it. Simba came and I shooed him away. Ezra and I started to clean it up. I went up the hall and there were Christmas cards. I filled two out to Ezra because we gave one to people the day before as well. Then we needed to hide. Then I was this guy and he went into a room downstairs and it was messy and there were beanbags. He hid under them. Then it was me and the beanbags were quite heavy and I was trying not to breathe loudly so they wouldn't move up and down. The people came in and were talking and then they went quiet. It was a girl and a guy. The girl saw the beanbag and said something and then pulled the beanbags off and then I don't know what happened because I was then watching the end of House of 1000 Corpses. It was zoomed in on Denise's mouth and she was screaming and it zoomed out. It had all been a dream and there was actually another hour or so and the whole movie went for three hours. I was thinking that I'd forgotten about that."
"2595"	"(2009-01-14 (17)) I had a kid. The house I lived at was very small but was 2-3 storeys. I was talking to my boyfriend about it saying the kid needed more room. The kid was running and I called out ""Brad!"" (the kid) and I was thinking 'why did I call him Brad?'. He asked me if he could say some stupid words (maybe swear words in our world?) and I said he couldn't say them in front of anyone. Then I was at Mom's. There was a bed near the kitchen. We were all sleeping in those rooms (the house was different). I decided to use my 'proper' bed tonight and I forgot there was a big window. Mom suggested I put the bed against the wall under the curtain. I said it would be too bright. I was watching 24 and Jack was watching movies and doing some US test?"
"2596"	"(2009-01-14 (17)) We were outside somewhere. There were monkeys and they were talking, but it was like a different language. They started getting angry and I went up on the stage in front of them and started singing ""I like to sing-a, about the moon-a and the June-a and the spring-a"" and they were happy and started clapping. The third time, I forgot the words but found a ""mini-moose"" version. The song started off differently to the actual song. There was a fence around this place near by and there was a dog in there. I was on the outside and needed to get in, but this dog was following me so I couldn't enter. There was a lizard at one end. Then I was watching Supernatural, except it was real life. I was running away from some bad people and it was night. There was a petrol station thing. I was then some girl and her clothes had been ripped off and this guy was on the floor with a big fluffy jacket. I took it and put it on. It went down to my feet and was very soft. The bad guys were coming in and held a gun to the guy behind the counter and sent this other guy to get something. I snuck outside and tried to get in this car, which was locked and then I went to this other car and opened the door, but I realized I had no key anyway. The guy heard me opening it and shot at me. I ducked and then he looked up behind me and was shooting. It was a big black cloud and I ran into the petrol station saying that I'd seen ""the scariest thing"". They asked what it was and I was going to say Cerebus [cloud on Lost] but this guy said it looked like the black cloud from Lost. I said ""I don't know if I'm watching Lost or Supernatural"" saying there were so many people in each one. Michael Emerson was in the petrol station and was near me and I pointed to him and said ""he's in Lost"". Then I was watching it again. People ran somewhere else. The door was locked and they banged on it. There was a reflection in this bin of the people and this guy got picked up by the cloud (although the cloud wasn't shown in the reflection) and thrown away. The people unlocked the door and they ran in and started running to get under these gates (it was in this mall type of shop, like the markets) as the gates were closing. A group of people were in there. Someone said this girl was respectable. Her mother thought this guy was Spanish and then English. I said they only think she's respectable because they were being attacked by monsters and she was wearing a long coat. And also wasn't talking about ""clothes and hair"". Then there was some Jack Bauer (24) set thing. There were cookies, at home, and Ezra was taking some. Dad was there too."
"2597"	"(2009-01-15 (17)) I went to 'school'. Mom decided it would be a good idea to send me to the 'boarding' option there. I said no and to pick me up like usual (she also wanted to pick me up from this carpark, which was like inside). I ended up going to it though and they put this metal collar around my neck which had my name and an assigned number on it. I couldn't work out how to get it off. There were two sets of steps, one on each side, leading to these seats (which were steps) on opposite sides of the room. In the middle was just a space for something. There weren't many people. I went up the left one and there was no-one on that side, there were a handful of people on the other one. It was quite dark in there and was underground like (very cement-y). This guy came to my side and sat across from me on the same step. Then this girl sat a few steps below me and said hello to me and I told her not to talk to me. She had been here (or somewhere) last year and we had fought because she was really annoying. It was then quite full and noisy. There was a young boy down at the sign-in area and it was his first year and he had to pull something out of this thing and he got this floppy shoe (a bad 'prize'). The girl continued annoying me and I said loudly ""Leave me alone!"" and she kept going so I attacked her. The main leader guy told me to stop and I said that this was the same as last year. He said they had found ""foreign antibodies"" in me and I said ""you're saying this because I attacked her, she's a whore!"". She had been flirting with the guy earlier. Then Mom and I visited her old house. They had kept it and went back now and then to keep it tidy etc, although I hadn't been back. I lay down in my bed and put my phone on charge. My blankets were a bit dusty. Then I fell asleep. I woke up later and it was a different place. Mom was on the phone asking about this song quiz she had studied for. I had some helpful stuff so I brought it to her. They were playing recorded calls for drug deals on the radio. One of them had Robbie Williams. We were driving. I was telling Mom about dreams and that you can become lucid because the windows don't have proper reflections and we passed a bunch of windows which looked painted like and I used them as an example."
"2598"	"(2009-01-16 (17)) My dreams were now on DreamBank, but the site was different and it had more detail and articles etc. They had put ""new batteries"" in my calculator. I told Mom about it later. Ezra had mentioned being on it but I didn't realize until later that it meant he knew who I liked. I was then at home so I could watch a movie that was in the Top 250. It was oldish and boring and after six minutes I called Mom to get me. She said she'd be there soon and would get me when she came to get Ezra (which was going to be on Thursday). I yelled at her, complaining but then I realized it was Thursday. The movie had now been going for 46 minutes. I heard a high pitch squealing noise and thought 'bomb' and looked outside. There was a light in the sky and it came rushing towards us, it was an 'aftershock'. Ezra didn't notice and I told Mom later. Darren had a 3-way phone? We were in the car and in the back. I was in the middle and Ezra was in his normal spot. We were going to see some friend."
"2599"	"(2009-01-16 (17)) We went to the shop and I was waiting in the car. Mom went in. I locked the doors. Some guys came and one looked like Mark Wahlberg and one looked like George Clooney. Mark was at the front of the car and put his hands on the front windows on the side of the car and was banging on them. I tried to call Mom but her phone was in the car. They eventually left and Mom came back and I told her to check around the car, but she ignored me and unlocked the car. They started coming back and she got in and we quickly locked the doors."
"2600"	"(2009-01-16 (17)) I went to Whitehall High School but I don't know why. I went into a computer room and Tiana and others were in there playing Warcraft. Some of the other people called out to me and I stood still and concentrated and 'teleported', but I was still in the same place (they couldn't see me though). I was watching The Young Ones and Rik was sick in bed and there was another Rik standing over him and I said ""Rik, Rik"" in his 'conscience voice'. This guy nearby was watching and said ""you like Young Ones?"". There was a pool and a rake attached to a pipe and you had to control it and put it down. A lady was with me."
"2601"	"(2009-01-17 (17)) I was at a vet with Mom. There were kittens. The place caught fire and this fireman came. The kittens were near the fire and I tried to save them but the fireman sent me away because of the fumes. Mom was telling me about this trick that Santiago did with his dog, he would grab its tail and it would do something. A girl relative of his (she was about 12) tried it and the dog bit her hand."
"2602"	"(2009-01-17 (17)) I was at a two storey building/house. Each floor consisted of one large empty room. There was a party and lots of people. The host was a lady who looked like a lesbian. I can't remember it properly, but the lady took out a gun and everyone started running and screaming to get out, but she stopped the rest of us before I could get out. There were teachers there. I remember Ms Solomon and there was a 40 year old teacher lady who I also knew. I went upstairs with this girl, I'm not sure if I knew her. We were trying to escape. She took the fly wire off the window and climbed out onto this balcony, which went all the way around. I followed and put the fly wire back on. The 40 year old teacher lady was inside and we motioned for her to come out. This kept happening over and over. When it was the third or fourth time (only the girl and I remembered it happening again and again) we were all upstairs and the host lady was talking to us. I motioned to the teacher lady that the lady had a gun and made a shooting motion and told her to attack her. The teacher lady got the gun off her and said ""is this a gun?"" and the lady said ""yes"". The teacher said ""it's not real"" and aimed at the host lady and shot her in the head. The girl I was with and I were relieved and 'celebrating' and saying that was much quicker, but everyone else was shocked. I left and went to this shop and I had cereal for lunch. Nicolas was there and him and his mates called me fat, but were like 'see that girl over there, she's fat' etc. I said ""look at those guys over there, aren't they ugly and retarded"". They asked how many boxes of some food I'd eaten today and I got annoyed and said that I'd had one bowl of cereal and I kept stuttering. I mentioned I'd had one bowl in the morning and ""one bowl now!"". I also had had a mint slice later. I went to the toilet and there were lots of toilet bowls, but they were all different and scattered around the room and there weren't any doors, instead you put this thing on your lap to cover you. I went to this one I liked at the far end, but there was some brown liquid on it."
"2603"	"(2009-01-18 (17)) I was in a building and then a Rottweiler was outside and was trying to get in. Mom decided to let it in, thinking that would cause less damage. I climbed up this ladder thing to go to a higher floor, but it just went to this small cage thing on a platform. I went back down and onto a desk. The dog ran up the steps and we tried to catch it, but the cage was too small. It turned out it was half human or something"
"2604"	"(2009-01-18 (17)) I was at home. This model girl was in the games room and I drew her. She left when I finished. This other model girl, who was slightly Asian looking and really pretty was lying on a bed. I asked her to come here for a second and we walked to the living room and I asked her what she was doing and she said she was about to go to bed because she had to get up in 2 hours. It had something to do with her son and I remembered and told her not to worry and to go back to bed (I was going to draw her)."
"2605"	"(2009-01-19 (17)) This guy was in jail and was going to escape [started watching Prison Break last night] . I was then at Mom's and was going to have a bath. As I was undressing Mom asked ""Are you ready for your things?"" and I said ""I dunno"". I had died, I think and it was a documentary of me. I was talking to Ezra later. I was then outside this building. Ms Solomon was there and it was a game or something. She left and these people made jokes about her name. The jail guy had developed a habit of enjoying vomiting. His son or something ended up in there too. They would do something wrong so they would go to jail. At the end of the movie, his daughter also liked vomiting (it was a 'twist') and she stole something in a cop station and the cops came. I took a bite of this food thing and it was disgusting and I looked inside and it was all black and moldy like. I almost threw up. I was then at home and people from school were there, including Eugene. There were photos of everyone on the floor and I found Eugene's and it was a really nice photo. The teacher was using a photo as an example and picked up Genevieve', which was a really bad photo and it had gotten ruined and she couldn't use it. There was some guy dressed as a character, which was dressed in a soldier's uniform. I was thinking I would go as Rick (The Young Ones)."
"2606"	"(2009-01-19 (17)) Dad, Ezra and I were lining up for something. I was watching a Kenny vs. Spenny episode and Kenny was in bed with some girls and most of them were blurred. With one of them, he said ""ow!"" and another that wasn't blurred said she wanted a puppy and started crying. I laughed because it made no sense. There was a basketball thing in the games room at home. I set it up. Dad came. Kenny came through from the far wall. I was playing basketball with some people and the winner got something. I hurt my arm and I was playing this guy next, who was the last guy (the last round). I was playing with one arm, but doing ok. Then there was a team and the guy wanted to stab his friend on the other team. I took the pole off him so he couldn't. Some boy had drowned. Granny was packing stuff to move somewhere else. I was getting dressed to go to the shop. I put this tight-ish shirt on with this white see-through net-like material over the top and a pink hat. I decided to put a shirt over what I was wearing but my room was messy and I couldn't find a shirt. There was an episode of some show and I was trying to remember which episode it was from and then that episode was on TV. T-Bag (Prison Break) and others were on a street, and they would walk back and forth between these traffic lights (in a small area). He had batteries and was trying them on a light. This guy opened the one that had money in it and T-Bag went and flicked through his batteries and then walked away. He was twitchy and a thief."
"2607"	"(2009-01-20 (17)) I went to the Cat Haven [going to Cat Haven for induction today] . I was inside and it was quite big and was office/school like. All the people I saw there were women. My induction and first day were on the same day, but I hadn't called to tell them I couldn't make it. I found the main lady and I told her that I could only attend one, and asked some questions too. I felt stupid about asking questions. I was then back from it, but I couldn't remember what happened."
"2608"	"(2009-01-20 (17)) I was watching an episode of Doctor Who or something. They were at a hotel thing and there were prostitutes there. It was old fashioned. This guy had sex with one of them and he had disappeared. Now there were ghosts at the place. There was a list of guys that had been 'taken'. There were a lot more guys that had been taken abut this was a list of certain guys. I realized it was guys who had treated them well and had been nice and 'with love'. I had found this out because I said that it ""didn't seem like these were bad people"". The Doctor (as David Tennant) realized this saying that they were those who had been ""gentlemen"". He got 'turned' into a ghost and they were also wearing masks like in those masquerade balls and they had weird lipstick on. He started singing in this girly voice and then kissed this girl ghost who sighed and then disappeared and he was ok, because he was a nice guy. In the dream, it seemed like a pretty cool plot."
"2609"	"(2009-01-21 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different. She went missing and Darren, Ezra and I went looking for her. Her car wasn't there. I went to my room and I had a bunk in there and she was in the bottom one, sleeping. There was going to be a wedding, but I don't remember anything more."
"2610"	"(2009-01-21 (17)) Lately, Mom had been spending all her time in the dark. She never turned on the lights or went out in the day time. One night, she took me and Ezra for a drive. She left, but kept the car going slowly in a circle. I got in the driver's seat after a while and started driving. The seat was really low and I could barely see and then Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd (as the Back to the Future characters) flew past on those flying skateboards. Then I stopped and put the seat up. The steering wheel was really loose and it took a lot of effort to turn. I turned around and went back up the street. I tried to turn into the driveway at home and I thought Dad's car was in the driveway and stopped early, but it was just the garage door, and I was half on the grass and on an angle. Dad came out and then his van was in the driveway and he and some other guys were getting stuff out. I held the front door open for them, but they just stood there chatting and I said ""Come on, hurry up and one of you get in so I can go"". Dad said ""What?"" sort of angrily and confused and I said ""So you hold the door for the next guy etc"". I went to my room and 'I' was on my laptop with the fan right next to me (another me). I said ""hi mama!"" in that high pitched voice and then said it seemed weird asking myself what I was doing. But she just ignored me."
"2611"	"(2009-01-21 (17)) Mom mentioned having been at our school and talking to Alyssa recently. I said that Alyssa was a Year 12 and wouldn't have been there. Then Ezra and I were at school and it was different. We were going to leave and there were slugs with legs, which we walked around. Then there was a fairly big purple lizard in our path. We walked around that and then there were huge octopus like legs everywhere (like a meter or bigger thick and very long). We ran and I made sure to run undercover and it was taking people. I got to the end of the undercover parts and was at the oval. Lots of other people were at the start of it too. We all ran at the same time and people were getting picked off as we ran."
"2612"	"(2009-01-22 (17)) I was watching Torchwood. Their hideout looked like an office building. They had two females at a desk at the front to watch who came in. Two people came but they were invisible to them. At one point, Jack thought he saw someone but they made themselves invisible again before he got another look and he shrugged it off. Rhys looked a bit different and was less chubby. Gwen was cheating on him with someone. There was a dark room thing there and I can't remember what happened properly but Tosh went in and the invisible people were there to get rid of her. I think Ianto had a boyfriend and also liked to wear women's clothes?"
"2613"	"(2009-01-22 (17)) I was at school which was different. I was with Ramona. I was showing her my escape plan for wagging so you don't get caught. There were people around everywhere and there was a beach nearby. There was a platform on the beach where a statue used to be and I said ""I stood on there yesterday"". I was showing her how to dodge teachers, as they walked around in the same pattern. Ms Pendleton was there. I got to the end building and the door slammed shut. Then I was watching something like Dead Set. It had the UK Big Brother and Craig Charles was on it, except he was 'Irish'. I was telling Mom that on Red Dwarf, Rimmer had been on Big Brother. Then zombies came. There was a family and there was a brother and a sister who were teenagers and they could blow hard, which would knock the zombies to the wall. Their younger sibling came in. Then Mom and I went to her friend's house. It was in a fancy area and he was swimming in a big pool. There was a sign advertising a party at some other guy's house sometime. Hold on Loosely was on the radio."
"2614"	"(2009-01-23 (17)) I was on Movie Collector and had added Ocean's Eleven. Robert Knepper was in it, according to the cast list and I was thinking that I didn't remember him in it. He played T-Bag (Prison Break) in it though. They were also escaping from prison and some people knew so they were putting plaster around where they were escaping from so no-one could see it, but they could easily break it to get out. In 'real life', T-Bag had killed someone. I was getting married, but it was a fake, so I could get out of the country and we were going to England (it was weird though). The marriage was to Michael Scofield (Prison Break). T-Bag disrupted it and I yelled at him. Then there was a party and a fat girl was dancing. Then I was on Facebook and Salim had commented on a picture of my 'parents' saying ""no wonder your nose is so ugly"" or something like that."
"2615"	"(2009-01-23 (17)) There had been zombies or something. I was with a group of people and we were carefully wandering outside. We met up with two other small groups along the way. We were then at this zoo type place. This guy and I went for a walk and he showed me some stuff. As everything had been abandoned, some animals wandered around. There were quite a few wolves around and they ate the chickens. We walked past a monkey enclosure. The gardens and other flora around the zoo place were really pretty. We gathered some food and other stuff in a bag. The other two groups then had powers. There was a Yoda like creature sitting on top of a stick, which was standing vertically. It was asleep and then it woke up. It suggested we play some game with the stick. We were then in a building and there were beds in the building, but not many. We pulled out mattresses to a large room to all sleep together but we were then using the beds. My bed had a soft blanket with a picture of a white animal (tiger or something) on it. I originally took a double bed because I wanted to share with some guy I liked, but he got his own bed, so I took a single. The others turned on us. They took this helicopter but it crashed into the water. We ended up in the water too and the blades of the helicopter were still going and we were trying to swim away from them. The bag was in the water and it floated away and I figured we'd just get it later. Later I was in a car, driving with some guy. There were a few shops around, but also some park like places. There was a park thing we passed with really nice grass and I said that it was ""really pretty grass"". The next park thing had these big black rocks, and then there were a lot of them stacked on top of each other along the edge of this park. They looked like giant human skulls. I called Mom and Darren answered and I asked him to tell Mom to come and pick me up (I thought the guy I was with was dodgy). I didn't know where I was though and told him to tell Mom to call me when she got the message. Then I was in a small 'diving' shop (I thought it was a diving shop, I don't know if it was). I sort of knew the guy who was working there and I found out he had killed someone and had chucked them into this large body of water just outside. The cops came in and I think he or I snuck a towel into my bag, but they found it (they had been told I was stealing). I said I was buying stuff with it as I had no money. Then I was watching a movie, which explained the human skull rocks. The people in it were giants and they were all women and had no shirts on (possibly completely naked) and they were running, falling, fighting etc in slow motion, zooming in on their breasts often and I was annoyed at the amount of nudity."
"2616"	"(2009-01-24 (17)) I was at a shop. I was with Mom looking at the men's clothes. There was a shirt with a rainbow like thing on it and Mom suggested I get it and I said that ""rainbows are gay"". Then I was with others at the shop and we were vampires. It was hard to tell who was a vampire (they had small teeth, normal skin colouring etc). Everyone was feeding, but I had trouble finding someone. I found a lady with a baby, but then it was a guy. Someone took the baby and I tried to bite the guy's arm, but all it left was a little scratch and I tried sucking on it but no blood came out. I used some medical equipment and discovered he had no heartbeat and then he smiled and he was actually a vampire and was playing a joke on me. Owen (Torchwood) and I were sort of friends but argued a lot. There was a montage of us arguing. He was then rambling, as he does, and said we should have sex and I said, going along with it, ""oh we should, should we?"". Supposedly, vampire sex was really good. Then I was at a house. I was talking to some people and I said Mom was getting an abortion and they questioned it and I had actually meant getting her tubes tied but I couldn't remember what it was called and said she was ""getting her nuts cut"". Darren was related to Martin Sheen and I couldn't see the resemblance."
