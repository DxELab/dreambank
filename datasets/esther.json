    "description": "This series is unique in that it starts at age 12, the youngest starting point of any series we have, and continues in sporadic fashion to age 21. At first it reflects many young teenage concerns, such as rock stars, then it expresses many young adult concerns, such as boyfriends and ex-boyfriends.  It also has themes of kidnapping that may or may not be typical of teenage dreamers.\n\n(For more information about Esther, click here.)"
