"0001"	"(2016-09-05)"	"I'm in Honduras at some kind of border crossing. A wide corridor of thick fenced scrub is off on either side.. Everything is grim, sinister, ominous. A few peasants silently plod up or down the hilly earth. It's a miserable, gloomy place. Everything feels cloaked in darkness. I try going forward, but after a time, something says ""Danger, turn back."" Not taking the winding paths, I trudge up the steep hills, making the work twice as hard, like my first treks in Guatemala in 1992. At a hilltop, I begin to choke for air. I make gasping sounds, I'm suffocating, dying."
"0002"	"(2016-09-06)"	"I'm talking with a young Hispanic man. He's someone I know, or someone famous, Carlos Santana? This man is patient, loving, kind. ""You know, God loves you,"" he says. ""I suppose so,"" I say, ""if you accept that reality."" We continue talking."
"0003"	"(2016-09-08)"	"I'm part of a bomber crew flying over a European or Balkan city. We're flying low, 200-300 feet off the ground. At a designated signal, the bombs are dropped over a wooded, jungle-like area. As we fly over the dense forest, I can partially see the smoke and flames through the aircraft's small windows. I hear the bombs exploding. The bomber crew ""ooohs and aaahs"" enthusiastically. The scene changes. I'm hanging from the first story of a large brick building. Across the street, about 100 meters away, another man, much higher up, is doing the same. Through my pants, I feel and then see a long swollen welt, like a large worm, or engorged leech, attached to my thigh. I'm bleeding. I shout to the men in the plane overhead, ""Hey, fella's, I'm hit!"" My shout alerts the enemy. The other dangling man drops to the ground. It's a long fall. He's likely dead. I drop to the ground. In an alley, I run to a large wooden barn door, painted Army green. Is it locked? I manage to push or slide it open it as a blond muscular man chases me. I enter the building, a large and empty warehouse-like room, with tall ceilings and a smooth cement floor. The blond man rushes in. I try to escape but he captures me. Moments later, four or five other men, storm into the room. Dressed in great coats they perform a dazzling display of martial arts. Then it's over. I'm a POW. There's no escape."
"0004"	"(2016-09-08)"	"I'm with my friend Joan outside a large church-like building. We're here to see an exhibit or hear someone talk. There are many people hoping to attend. Before entering the building, we look at the plants and trees. I make a silly remark about a fan-like tree leaf and feel momentary regret. As the line begins to move, we enter a low, crowded hallway. A man, possibly a priest, appears from a door way. He's stern, brusque. He says there are too many people. ""If you've already been here, you have to leave. That will take care of the metrics."" Near us, a tall, handsome blonde haired man, wearing a suit and tie, appears visibly hurt by these remarks. Then Joan and I walk into a large room taken up by two enormous square tables ringed by folding chairs. It's hard to get to the seats. I look about. Where is Joan? I've lost sight of her."
"0005"	"(2016-09-10)"	"I'm living with roommates in the basement of a house similar to the home of my childhood friend Frank. My area has a bookcase, which is organized and neat, but all around me are the clothes and Christmas decorations that belong to someone else. A roommate comes by. I ask him, ""Who owns this stuff?"" He comes too close; I fear he will fall on me and harm my hernias. Dogs appear. One has my right wrist in its jaws. The other has my legs in its mouth. I can't see them, but hear and feel their growls, the touch of their teeth. I yell, ""Stop! Stop it!"" several times, each time louder than the next. The dogs aren't vicious. They appear to be playing. But I have fear. I'm yelling, ""Stop it!"""
"0006"	"(2016-09-10)"	"With Jacque my Swiss friend I'm in a house similar to my friend Frank's childhood home. We're downstairs, with one or two intimidating men. Jacque is naked; he asks me to examine him. Unembarrassed, he squats on his hands and knees, exposing his anus. Visually, I inspect it. I ask if he's been raped. He indicates one of the intimidating men. He says it went in six inches. He has pain. I tell him I don't see anything. I ask if he has a discharge. He says ""No,"" but a small greenish particle falls from his penis and lands on his nose. I say, ""We should leave this place."" We enter a car driven by John the VA therapist. He drives around the house and takes a tight turn too fast. We nearly crash into a neighboring home. I say, ""That would have been really bad."" We drive away."
"0007"	"(2016-09-11)"	"I'm in a foreign land. There's a war going on. I decide to escape and climb over a large, tall hill or dirt embankment. Just before I go, a wild looking Hindu man approaches. We talk. He asks my destination. I tell him I have parents but no home. He offers to help me find several Hindu cities and towns that are written on a map or large piece of paper. I need water. I'm thinking, I'll drink contaminated water and get diarrhea, but I need water. There is a meeting with four other prisoners. We discuss money. I ask if one's bank account is shut down if one escapes. No, it is not. We discuss dates. Each of us has a release date. Mine is October 6th, only thirty-two days from now. To leave or to wait. What to do. Leave and risk, or wait and endure?"
"0008"	"(2016-09-12)"	"It's night. I'm a guest on the top floor of a very large old house. The owner (someone I know) and I are waiting for someone, or something to arrive. He gives me a tear gas pen which has a small light. Later, I'm wearing an LED headlamp. My room, like the rest of the house, is piled with artifacts, furniture, many old things. There is a sense of foreboding, of vague danger. The lights go on and off. I go to a room where my mother is sleeping and ask her what's going on. Next, I'm speaking with the owner. We agree no one is arriving. On a table in a hallway crowded with bric-a-brac, I see a book. It's by a Russian author, a collection of poetry, or a play, or short stories. It's been translated, or is a hybrid of English and Russian. It must be 3 or 4 a.m. The owner says his friend is going out into the night. He uses a phrase that connotes seeking sex. I do not go with him."
"0009"	"(2016-09-14)"	"I'm walking in a familiar neighborhood and decide to enter a house where the family, who are lively, active and happy, trust me, though I have other purposes in mind. The husband and wife, a young couple, are preparing dinner as I nonchalantly walk in. The wife, who is tall, young and beautiful, is wearing a long light-green gown. We watch the white silhouette of a large lobster swim in the clear water of a lake or aquarium. The creature swims about looking for food. How does it eat? Suddenly it darts upward and snares a large moth. I'm the first to see it, and tell the husband and wife. We're excited, but I have others purposes in mind. I'm young. I feel very alive."
"0010"	"(2016-09-15)"	"I've been traveling, and am now in Switzerland at a posh mountain hotel. I'm with other people in a large spacious room, a kind of hall; the walls are made of glass. There's a dance or social function taking place. I'm with another man, a friend or acquaintance. I'm wearing very colorful jeans, clothing I would not ordinarily wear. I begin talking to an attractive woman with short blonde hair. She remarks about the jeans. I say, ""I saw them and had to buy them."" A criminal-like man enters the room through its glass doors. He is unctuous, intimidating. At one point he socializes with us, then becomes angry at my friend, lifting him up, almost fighting him. My friend owes him a gambling debt. I intervene, telling the intruder to leave. He backs off, appears to go, but loiters outside, before slinking back to the glass door. I walk over to him. In the doorway, I say, ""I'm warning you. I'm going to hurt you."" He leaves, but not for long. The woman has left. I want to find her, and go outside. It's beautiful here. I'm relaxed."
"0011"	"(2016-09-16)"	"My brother and I are in an airport. We've just returned from a trip. I realize that I've lost my baseball cap. My brother has lost his too. A kind old woman says to me, ""I bet it's under the dresser."" I walk toward the dresser. I say, ""What makes you think that?"" She says, ""You'll see. Just look."" But I'm reluctant to get on my hands and knees."
"0012"	"(2016-09-16)"	"I'm in a room with other Vietnam vets. We're young, in our late 20s or 30s. The plan is to meet here weekly. I'm talking with one of the vets. I say, ""We can share a ride. I'll pay for gas if you have a car."" I don't tell him I don't drive. Another vet, who seems familiar, who is robust and mature, asks about my dog tags, which I'm wearing around my neck. Happily, I tell him, ""I'm wearing them because of today."" The other vet immediately chokes up and turns away. I know enough to refrain from speaking."
"0013"	"(2016-09-18)"	"I'm working in an office and meet a mature girl at a nearby bakery. She's very pretty, friendly and kind. I buy bread from her and forget to leave a tip. Then I do, at first counting out the small change, then giving all the coins to her. ""Just take it all,"" I say. Dave, a best friend since college, meets her. She must choose between him or me. She prefers me. It's because of my fine body, she says. I introduce to the girl to my grandfather. ""This is my grandfather,"" I say, momentarily forgetting his name. He introduces himself. The girl says she likes movies, plays and museums. My grandfather gives her subway directions to New York's theater district. The girl is anxious. I tell her we'll find it. At night, she and I walk down a country road. I tell her I know this road. I know where it leads. I point out its center lines, now faded, barely recognizable, as if paint sprayed from a distance. The scene changes. We're in a pup tent. Something is wrong. The girl complains; the tent is missing stakes, rope and the poles to keep it upright and taut. And there's no ground mat; only the bare earth. And the weather is bad. There is tension. Dave, or whoever gave us the tent, is at fault."
"0014"	"(2016-09-19)"	"Lying on my back, I'm in-between wakefulness and sleep. A large presence is groping me. I'm struggling to ward it off. Then I see it. A large tube-like phallus above me. I have fear. I have dread. [The dream occurs several times.]"
"0015"	"(2016-09-19)"	"It's night. With other men, I'm in a house in a residential area. Each man is stationed at a window. We're waiting to be attacked. We'll shoot them as they attack us."
"0016"	"(2016-09-19)"	"I'm in an enclosed, grim, third world market made of cement. I'm standing in front of a large counter, talking to someone. My mother is nearby. There are several phonographs behind that person, perched high on a shelf. The records play one after the other, hooked up in synch. Even the old time wind up Victrola, whose needle follows the spiral groove. I over hear my mother talking. ""When I was 17, I learned to ride horses. I never thought about sleeping with anyone."" I say to the person behind the counter, ""Yeah, right. Seventeen and never thought about it."" I'm hungry, and buy noodles from a Japanese man wearing a food vendor's cap and uniform. I point to the type I want. He puts a portion in a small porcelain bowl, then pours something on them. At first I think it's sauce, and nearly tell him to stop, then realize it's water to cool the noodles. He hands me the bowl and waits for money. I linger a moment, and instead walk away without paying."
"0017"	"(2016-09-20)"	"I'm in a large bedroom. It's dark and quiet. Someone enters the house. The presence approaches the bedroom door. It's the mother of my friend Frank. She's talking to me. She's very cheerful. I wonder about her sex life."
"0018"	"(2016-09-20)"	"My mother says, ""You never got a B.A., so you never got a good job."" I say, ""You never pushed us (my brother and I) the way other parents did. All you did was offer emotional support. You never taught us to be ambitious."""
"0019"	"(2016-09-20)"	"I'm in a very large and bright hangar where an Army ceremony has taken place. Hundreds of soldiers are present. It's like the hangar at Bien Hoa airport in Vietnam. As if we're in a circus big top, we're told to put our pizza boxes into garbage cans. I wonder where they get the pizza and pop corn when they are traveling. How do they get resupplied? Do they buy massive quantities when they can? They are a large part of the demand for corn crops. After we're dismissed, I ask a familiar looking soldier if I can leave something with him. He says yes. I run to my room for a sweater. A man is digging up the hallway floor, though instead of wood there are long earth-colored tiles. In the room, similar to my last apartment, I grab a sweatshirt from the closet. Back at the hangar, I see a black soldier stealing my .45 and pistol belt. I run after him."
"0020"	"(2016-09-20)"	"In a college or writing workshop, I recognize one of the women attendees and ask her what she's reading. She says a short story by the writer William Joiner. I know this shy pretty woman. She is Charlotte, from 5th grade. I tell her about my crush on her. She is stuck up in her reply. I speak with two other women, a blonde and a brunette. Both are pretty and friendly. Both are married. I'm attracted to them. I talk to the blonde. It's disappointing to hear she's getting married. I ask a familiar looking man to point out or describe her fiancee. He's vague, so I jokingly ask him, ""Well, does he have three eyes?"" and make another remark. He says, ""She's getting married to William Chase."" Waking, I say, ""Well, whoever he is, he's a lucky man."""
"0021"	"(2016-09-21)"	"I'm walking along a country path near homes and old garages. Someone has stashed a key, an engraved silver Zippo lighter, and a small roll of one-dollar bills in dry foliage. I grab the money and hurry along. I don't want to get caught by the persons who put it there."
"0022"	"(2016-09-21)"	"I'm in the country with one or two other men. I've taken the lead. It's winter, and I'm surfing down a long sloping trail on a board or door. It's fun."
"0023"	"(2016-09-21)"	"I'm on my way to the apartment building of a girl I've just met. I see a man I know. He's young, handsome, dark haired, possibly of Indian decent. I tell him, ""I'm going to see if I left my coat at her house."" I tell him that if I find it, we should get together. If not, I'll go home. He cheerfully says, ""Now I feel good,"" or ""That makes me feel good."" I don't understand why he said that. I go to the floor where the girl lives but can't recall her door. I enter an apartment, a bar, and sit on a stool. A stocky man, wearing a suite and tie, with 1950s swept back duck's-ass hair, taps my shoulder. When I get up, he takes my seat. I say, ""I was sitting there,"" but he ignores me. I push him off the seat and he falls to the floor. I say, ""C'mon, let's fight."" Dazed, he stands up, crouches and puts up his fists. This surprises me. Not showing my fear, I say, ""No, no. I don't want to fight. Look, I was sitting there."""
"0024"	"(2016-09-22)"	"I'm in a dimly lit room that holds the spirits of my ancestors. The dominant colors are dark and amber; everything appears in thread-like decay. The spirits are tall vague forms that barely move. I'm paralyzed and filled with fear. The spirit of my maternal grandmother is present. I'm calling to my friend from Vietnam, John N., to help me. I'm calling but I can barely speak his name. My words are unintelligible. Over and over, I struggle to be heard. Am I groaning in my sleep? I see a dark arm bone coming near me. I yell ""John! John!"" louder, faster. Finally, he seems to hear my calls of alarm."
"0025"	"(2016-09-23)"	"I'm walking, and from a distance, see an attractive woman from behind. There is something about the shape of her long brown hair. I wonder who she is and would like to meet her, but feel it will never happen. I walk into a large bedroom that is similar to my childhood home. The woman has been walking behind me. When I turn around, I recognize my friend Joan. From behind, I embrace and hold her, which she allows me to do."
"0026"	"(2016-09-23)"	"I'm walking outside and meet two slender young attractive girls. I begin kissing one; she lets me continue kissing her. Then, on a train, a young man joins us. Now we're on an island clearing the jungle. Everyone is happy. We're building a place to live."
"0027"	"(2016-09-24)"	"It's dark. I'm on an island inhabited by powerful warriors. I escape from them and head to the shoreline. I see two or three dead men staked to the ground under tee pee poles. The warriors are near. I have to make it to the sea. Just as I'm spotted, I lunge into the dark water and swim underwater, thinking, I'll barely outdistance him. The scene changes. I'm on dry land in a suburban town. It's still dark. Fifty or so yards away, one man calls to another. He tells him to be on the lookout for me. He comes close but I avoid detection. Now other people are hunting me. I enter a building that is similar to my grammar school. It's dark inside. I fight with an athletic man. We fight like characters in the movie The Matrix, performing fantastical martial arts moves in mid-air. A state trooper arrives. I see him as he peers around a corner. I see his Smokey the Bear hat. I call to my dog. She's appears at the far end of a hallway. She's hesitant to come to me. I have to escape. The state trooper yells ""Stop! Stop!"" I yell back, ""I want my dog. I want my dog."""
"0028"	"(2016-09-25)"	"I'm in a room with three women competing in a yoga competition. One woman acts as a judge. It's clear that one of the two other women has superior shape and form and will win the contest."
"0029"	"(2016-09-25)"	"I'm a passenger in a car driven by a very ugly black man. He's making conversation. Periodically I say, ""Yeah."" At one point he turns to me and says, ""Stop saying 'yeah.' "" He says it easily. It's what he thinks and feels. I'm reminded of a similar experience at work. I'm a little angry at the black man, a little embarrassed. I want to ask ""Why?"" but consider that I'm over reacting, and that he's likely right."
"0030"	"(2016-09-26)"	"In a barn or bunkhouse that is dark and dimly lit. There's sexual tension between an older man and his wife. Few words are spoken. Where he is urgent, she is struggling. Neither the man nor the woman is attractive. She begins taking off her necklace, slowly undoing the clasp. The necklace itself is nearly invisible, as though it were made of fish line monofilament. It's as if I'm watching her from behind, as if others are watching her, and the woman knows it. Now the couple is in a dark lit restaurant. The woman, wearing a full-length evening gown, has arranged her hair in a French bun. They, though especially the woman, are welcomed by a dozen or so seated diners. It's like a Broadway musical: they are formally dressed, loud and boisterous, extending their hands in theatric sincerity. Only the seated persons are smiling. Their arch enthusiasm discomforts the woman. She is bewildered, distraught."
"0031"	"(2016-09-26)"	"I'm in an upscale clothing store. The clothing is displayed on racks, and in bookcase-like cubbyholes. There are many items on shelves in grocery store-like aisles. Four men wearing tan shirts, dark pants and Sherlock Holmes hats arrive. They appear to be brothers, each with a distinct personality. The store becomes crowded. I'm in an aisle next to an athletic Hispanic man. Just as I turn, he turns into me. I see this as an act of aggression and push him away. One of us says, ""What are you doing, man?"" Then we are both trying to keep calm. He's somewhat younger. He doesn't know I'm much older than I look. He talks about a man who kept trying to cheat the store out of a discount. On the third time, he was caught. The Hispanic man makes a good will remark and at that moment I shake his hand, then walk away. The Hispanic man is puzzled, unhappy at how things ended."
"0032"	"(2016-09-28)"	"I have to execute a man by decapitating him with a knife. I put the blade to his throat but the flesh and bone are tough and the cutting is slow. The man groans in agony. I am the one causing his suffering. Someone else witnesses the awful event."
"0033"	"(2016-09-28)"	"With other people, perhaps a family, I'm on a large pyramid shaped sofa. We're playing a game. I'm being asked questions. At my turn, I make sexual puns about someone else on the sofa. But a young boy can't take it. Instead of laughing, he is sullen."
"0034"	"(2016-09-28)"	"My mother helps me to move. She's driving her big beige car from 1962. A double-parked black car is blocking her from parking next to the curb. She calls to the driver, ""Excuse me, 'hon. Can you move?"" The driver, a friendly youthful looking man with a 1950s haircut, agrees, but my mother inches past and parks. We begin unloading the trunk. My belongings are in plastic grocery bags. My mother wants to join me. I say, ""No, wait here with the stuff."" I enter an elevator with an elderly couple and a maintenance man who is re-painting the elevator. I look for the number two elevator button but can't find it. The elderly woman talks to her husband in a New York accent; it's very familiar. Where have I heard it before? ""Two,"" she says, and I search but can't find it. She pushes the button, which is obscured by old paint. During the ride up, I say nothing. Everyone exits on the second floor. I look out a hallway window. The grim urban view has a rustic quality. I say to myself, ""I like that."" I have the silver key ready, but my apartment door is opened by the elderly couple. I can see that it's warm and friendly inside. Just as they welcome me in, an activist student, Lisa, arrives. I put the key in my mouth in order to shake her hand. I recognize the woman's accent when I see her husband. ""Come in, come in,"" he's says. It's the American historian Howard Zinn. He hugs me. I kiss him. ""Its so good,"" I say."
"0035"	"(2016-09-29)"	"I'm in a beautiful landscape. A child's fantasy of armored knights in battle. Two knights on immense horses swing swords, one clearly outdoing the other. I witness a skilled knight who rides to the rescue of the man being defeated. The large swords swing and clash. When the rescuing knight is about to deliver the coup de grace, I turn to the physician Susan G, who is dressed as a princess, and say, ""He's about to do a podcast."" She compliments me for a witty joke or phrase I did not make. It's so modern, so witty, she says. In that moment I decide to let the oversight pass."
"0036"	"(2016-09-29)"	"I'm sitting at a table with a black woman who resembles my own mother. She wants to sell me collectible pennies. She has never done this before. I'm patient with her. She's too thorough, almost protective, and will not let me inspect the coins. I tell her this is not how it's done. I tell her the first principle of business is to inspect what's on offer. We settle on the price. She has fifty coins and will charge me two dollars. She reaches into her purse and nonchalantly places a packet of tampons on the table. Inwardly I try to calculate the math but am confused. We go back and forth. I realize I'm obsessing over a small sum of money. Waking I say, ""It's not a lot of money,"" and will pay her."
"0037"	"(2016-09-29)"	"I'm at the AMC movie theater in the nearby big city. The theater auditorium is dark and empty. It's closed and I'm trapped inside. There's a man on a tall ladder in front of the blank screen. I call to him, ""Staff...staff..."" but he does not answer. I walk out of the theater and into the main corridor, where hundreds of people sit at tables or mill about. I have to be somewhere and hurry so I won't be late."
"0038"	"(2016-09-30)"	"I'm in a college dorm room. There's a party going on. The lights are out. There are soap bubbles everywhere. Police detectives arrive. One of them grabs my arm. I ask him, ""What's going on?"" It's hard to hear him over the music and noise. They're arresting us. In the darkness a cop punches me in the stomach. I imagine not feeling pain. I imagine saying in a mocking voice, ""What was that, man?"" and goad him to hit me again. I imagine pulling him to the ground and taking his weapon."
"0039"	"(2016-09-30)"	"It's night. My brother and I, both young, are sleeping in the bedroom at the apartment I lived in from 1964 to 1969, I'm groaning in my sleep. Suddenly I let out a ferocious scream. My brother comes to my bedside and wakes me. I tell him I'm having a bad dream. He says, ""I'll say."" It's raining outside. The windows are shut but the wind enters through the drafty gaps and rattles the room. I tell my brother it's raining really hard. He says he's glad he brought his sweatshirt inside. One of his little toes is unusually long, like a finger, and nearly broken in half."
"0040"	"(2016-09-30)"	"I'm in a crowded classroom. The venerable teacher asks us the meaning of the word ""shostakopus."" A nearby student has a dictionary. I want to answer but he reads it first. The definition is academic, not what I anticipated. A different word, illustrated with a houseplant that I like, catches my eye. The two sentence spiritual meaning is similar to that of a Sanskrit phrase."
"0041"	"(2016-10-01)"	"It's windy. I'm climbing in an open pit mine of gray white stone that is similar to granite. White dust fills the air. I climb over the terraced ledges to a Spanish-like plaza where there is shelter from the wind and a place to eat. I sit at a table with a young boy and an old woman. When they leave I realize they've stolen my daypack and baseball cap. The pack contains nothing of value, but it's mine. I can't believe they've stolen it. I run after them. Then I lean forward and fly. I'm about ten feet off the ground, flying down a blacktop country road that winds through a wide-open town. I fly past shops, past a few people on the road, past a woman on a bicycle, past a large store selling plants and flowers. Has my pack been stolen, or is this a dream?"
"0042"	"(2016-10-01)"	"I'm a member of an Army unit stationed on snowy mountains in a foreign land with soldiers who are not Americans. We're not in danger, just waiting to move out. I walk around and say hello to a few men I know. A very large man wants to grapple. Soldiers gather to watch as I use Judo to steadily dominate and out maneuver my opponent. I throw and push and pin him down but he won't give up. A beautiful Weimaraner runs by. Then a different dog. I want to watch them. I tell the larger man I want to stop."
"0043"	"(2016-10-01)"	"I'm young and in a crowded classroom of Russian schoolboys. We're annotating books for purposes of espionage and propaganda. Everyone watches as the teacher shows us how to jot down notes in an organized manner. Then we sing a Russian song. I don't speak the language so I try to lip synch the words by watching how the boys move their mouths. A boy next to me watches to make sure I'm singing. The teacher too. Everyone sings with enthusiasm."
"0044"	"(2016-10-02)"	"I'm seated at a table at a popular restaurant near where I sent to college, flossing my teeth. Two girls seated across from me think I'm staring at them because I'm flossing my teeth, but I'm not interested in them. In walks Larry M, a high school pal. His once thick and wavy blonde hair is thin and white. We make eye contact and he walks to my table. I stand up. Larry asks, ""Aren't you from Resort Town,"" where I lived in 1969. I say I lived there but only one year. Larry recalls one or two other details about me. I want to embrace him but he hasn't changed. He is still strident, macho, stoic."
"0045"	"(2016-10-03)"	"I'm in my old house on Highland Place. Outside, it's raining hard. After the storm, I enter the bathroom to find that one window has a chipped corner, the window screens have been blown out; the room is wrecked. I go to the backyard to retrieve the screens and reinstall them. My mother joins me. To hook the oblong screens on prongs at the top of the window casement requires skill. When my mother succeeds, she says, ""I did it!"" in her hapless way. I tell her the windows are old. I tell her the landlord should replace them. I tell her she doesn't know the law, and mention the law of habitability. My mother doesn't want to hear about it. She doesn't want the trouble. I wake up saying, ""They really should be replaced."""
"0046"	"(2016-10-04)"	"It's a bright sunny day. As an adult, I'm attending a ceremony on a grassy hill at my grammar school. I'm wearing a jacket and tie and talking with a friend. A casually dressed obese young man with long frizzy hair approaches me. ""This is for you,"" he says. He hands me a two-foot strand of thickly woven cord, one end of which is unraveling. I put on my sunglasses. It's time to say the Pledge of Allegiance. I will stand without reciting the words or placing my hand over my heart. I'm thinking, if anyone asks or bothers me I'll say, ""I know what war is and none of this is true."" Afterward, as the frizzy haired man and I walk across a hilly lawn, he asks, ""Why do you have so many banks?"" I say, ""How do you know?"" He says, ""I just know."" I say, ""I have four banks. So what?"" We enter the school and walk to a room near a staircase. The frizzy haired man hands me a textbook. ""This is for Miss Tonner's class,"" he says. He makes sure it's the right book, the right class. There is something about the books texture and heft; its grim bulky cover which resembles a film negative. I don't want it, but to avoid conflict, I say nothing. Back on the lawn, I tell my friend about the question I was asked. I wake up saying, ""I have four banks. So what?"""

After leading a religious ceremony, I walk quietly up the aisles, touching the outstretched hands of the parishioners, who are mostly older, poor and black. I've put Dr. Wood's Soap on my hands. I'm telling the people it's holy soap. I feel uplifted. The people need me."
"0048"	"(2016-10-06)"	"I'm in a large but cozy room with several people and several beds. I'm talking to a young boy who resembles Mark P from Elk Grove Camp in the early 60s. Naked, he's kneeling on the bed. He's calm, confident. I ask him many questions about how he falls asleep: Do you lie on your left side or your right? Do you put your hand under the pillow? Do you lie on your back, then roll on your side? The questions arrive one after another; each rings poetic. Unexpectedly, I notice his female breasts. Calmly, he says 'no' to all my questions. When he lays down, he falls right to sleep. Playfully, I say, ""I don't believe you,"" but regret the remark, which is overheard by a woman in an opaque nightgown sitting near me."
"0049"	"(2016-10-07)"	"I'm in an American Midwest desert. There are one or two familiar people scattered about. In the midday heat, the sun and sand make the desolate landscape intensely bright. From a distance, I walk past a woman who resembles the actress Faye Dunaway. Draped in white, or covered in white dust, she is seated on the ground and seems part of the bleak landscape. Her eyes, rimmed in black, stand out, making her strange. As I walk near her, Faye Dunaway asks, ""Where are you going?"" She asks other questions. It's as if we're flirting. The others listen. In playful jest I say, ""To a synagogue."" She replies, ""Are you really?"" Instead of saying ""Does a bear shit in the woods?"" I say, ""Does a fish have fins?"""
"0050"	"(2016-10-07)"	"I'm young. With my dog, I'm part of a small group walking a country trail. We pass a group of people. Far in the distance I see my former girlfriend Karen. I want to be with her but we have to keep moving. I wave to her regretfully. Does she understand? As we walk, a man leads a reluctantly trotting pony with rope tethered around its body. There's been a car accident. Many possessions are lined up on the side of the trail. Concerned men stand about. We keep moving and, finally arrive at a large one-story house with white adobe walls and dirt floors. It's more like a barn or large hut. Inside, I talk with Lewis, the younger brother of a college best friend. I say, ""It's pretty simple here. Almost like a college dorm."" Lewis says, ""Yeah, I guess so."" I don't like this place. It's too casual. I want order. I want things to be orderly and clean. I'll have to get used to this. My dog runs through the house. She's playful yet nervous. There's a small pile of pot on Lewis's bed. She runs over the pot, disturbing it. She drinks water. I ask Lewis if he can deal with the dog. I tell him she's my dog. I wake up talking."

I'm terrified and call out to my brother, ""Donald... Donald... Donald."" He hears me. He knows what's happening but he does not get up to help. I wake up fearful and groaning."
"0052"	"(2016-10-09)"	"I'm a silent witness to two plays performed by a white man and a flat-chested Asian woman. In the first, they are seated at a table in a small room, expressing their mutual love. There is tension. The woman suddenly doubts the man loves her. The man is bewildered. It becomes clear the couple is mentally unstable. In a graveyard, the woman doubles up in pain. She thinks she is pregnant. A short, husky, curly-haired man wearing a white shirt says she needs a ten second surgery. After the play ends I remark that the dialogue and acting in the second play were poor. I wake up mumbling how the first play was so much better."
"0053"	"(2016-10-10)"	"I'm in a field, a firing range. The ground is ravaged, torn, ripped apart. There's an explosive charge that I want to detonate. Its texture is like the thick crust of pizza. I set the timer, then crawl into a large metal or cement pipe. The warning sound, a tocsin like that of a submarine about to dive, fills the air. Nothing happens. Should I crawl out and reset the timer? Am I far enough away? Suddenly, a tremendous blast. I feel the shock waves rip across my body. The explosion blows apart the pipe. Shock waves or shrapnel impact my body. How bad am I hit? Terrified, I startle awake."
"0054"	"(2016-10-10)"	"I'm walking in a place similar to New York's Central Park. I see two little girls, one wears a square-cut Central American blouse. I feel a kinship to her. Where did she obtain the beautiful vest? We talk. The older girl is antagonistic. I tease her playfully; she remains sullen."
"0055"	"(2016-10-10)"	"I'm on a crowded airplane with my former girlfriend Karen and her friend Johanna. A stewardess demonstrates a breathing device. A red-headed man has his own apparatus, which resembles a water pipe. He puts one or two tablets into the water-filled plastic bottle and inhales. I tell Karen and Johanna, ""Watch this. He's going to pass out for a second."" The stewardess hands me the bottle. It's necessary to inhale deeply before using it. I inhale the vapor, choke, stop, and return the bottle to the stewardess. ""I just can't,"" I say, and wake up gasping."
"0056"	"(2016-10-10)"	"I'm in a college dorm with men I know. They are rowdy, nonintellectual. One man exits, then returns with a holstered .356 Magnum. I ask him if that makes him feel better. Another man offers me cocaine. I say, ""No, I don't want Mr. Cocaine. I don't want it."""
"0057"	"(2016-10-10)"	"I'm with Jimmy, my maternal grandparents' porter, in his basement apartment. It's grim here, the essence of poverty. A plywood door hangs off its hinge. The floors are cement. Jimmy wants to make something out of wood and asks for my help. His friend is skeptical. Jimmy hands me a long thin piece of wood set in a tubular black metal mold. At the same time, he discretely hands me a chocolate chip cookie."

"0059"	"(2016-10-11)"	"I'm walking down a city boulevard. A man and woman, balancing their son on their shoulders, block my way, but I walk past them. I'm riding a bicycle down the same street, which leads to a shabby area, much like New York City's 14th Street in the 80s. A young Spanish girl standing on the corner eats a sandwich. A pit bull lingers in front of her, hoping for scraps. But the girl is a lure. Two young Hispanic men try to rob me. I shoot them, grab the girl, hop on the bike and ride away. I will rape her. She does not resist."
"0060"	"(2016-10-12)"	"On a clear dark night, with a crowd gathering, I'm standing at the corner of two prominent streets. The mood is festive. The people are excited. But at any moment a loud explosion will occur; a war will begin. The young person I'm standing with asks me many questions. Do I like this? Do I like that? What was that sound? That smell, which has the fragrance of banana cinnamon? I wonder when the explosion will blow up the night."
"0061"	"(2016-10-12)"	"After hauling my possessions up a flight of stairs, I enter the anteroom of a Chinese prison. It's grim, dank, empty. Kneeling, I pencil on the floor the best spot to set up a defensive position. It covers the stairwell door, which leads to the office, where a Chinese woman sits at a desk. A white woman and her family, having left the prison, enter the room. As they pass me someone asks her if she's seen a dog. The woman hesitates. She's only seen a big blue dog. She's lying. When she and her family have gone I walk across the room to the office door. Around my ankles, a large white rag hobbles my steps. Before entering the office I turn and look for my possessions. They're gone. Did the white woman steal them? I talk with the grim Chinese woman behind the desk. Suddenly, screams from the stairwell. I say, ""There's been an accident."" The Chinese woman is silent. Two or three at a time, I run down the stairs, my toes touching only the edge of each step. A pretty young girl, with pimples and a pony tail, leans against the stairwell banister. She cries softly. In my role as medic, in my comforting voice, I ask her, ""Where does it hurt?"" But the girl is all right. She's worried, nervous, but unhurt."
"0062"	"(2016-10-13)"	"It's night. A friend and I are walking down a wide indoor boulevard made of wooden slats, similar to the Atlantic City boardwalk. We're young, happy-go-lucky. I have $100,00 in my pocket. My friend sees a drug dealer he knows. The dealer, a short thin Italian looking man, with a 1950s haircut, asks us to play a game with his cronies. We're to lick cardboard puzzle pieces suspended from a string. At any moment they will taste like vomit. I hesitate as long as I can. Does the dealer know I have so much money? My friend and I know he will steal it. The scene changes. In daylight, the dealer takes us to his small cramped apartment. It's sunny inside. There's a palm tree in one corner. He talks about dealing drugs. He says to always destroy any evidence of transactions. Discreetly, I reach into a small trash can and steal a fistful of paper scraps which he has written on. The tension is unbearable. Is he toying with us? At the right moment, not waiting for my friend, I run from the apartment. My friend chases after me, the dealer behind us. We find our way through a mall, push past a chrome glass door, and escape. It's night. We're running down the wide indoor boulevard, my friend shouting encouragement so we are not caught."
"0063"	"(2016-10-13)"	"I'm to be honored and am talking with other vets. We're waiting for the ceremony to start. I meet Dayl (my Vietnamese writer friend), we've not seen each other in years. Surprisingly, he's not enthusiastic. I say, ""You want to hear one? I came here almost naked."" I imagine going home to Highland Place, naked, the people staring, nodding, ""Yes, that typical of him. He's a little crazy."" I imagine someone gives me a white shirt, a jacket and pants. I imagine that as Dayl and I are talking, a dignitary comes by, tells me to keep it down. I'm not angered. I feel my power. He does not know I'm the guest of honor. He does not know about my combat medals. The scene changes. I meet my friend Dave since college days. We're lying in a large bed, talking. I recollect the Upper West Side church in Manhattan where we met women in the 1980s. I tell him, ""Along those lines,"" and talk about our relationship. About love. He grows impatient with this saccharine talk. I say, ""It's too bad we didn't meet sooner. You could have met my former girlfriend Karen."" I begin crying over the end of my relationship with her. I'm thinking, This is what everyone goes through in life. In this, I'm normal."
"0064"	"(2016-10-14)"	"It's night. With several schoolgirls, I'm in a crowded church in France. We're in the gymnasium, which has a movie screen on the far side of one wall; speakers are placed either side of it. I question the symmetry but the design is right. I look out a dark wooden or metal portal onto a beautiful country landscape; in the dim light, it's raining. Sitting in the pews are school children, mostly girls, who begin singing in French. When the service is over I look for my coat and pack, but it's dark and hard to see. Where did I put them? There they are, fallen behind one of the folding seats, which are like those in movie theaters. I try on several sport coats. The one I select makes me look strong. After pushing my First Cavalry pin into the lapel, I'm the last person to leave the darkened church. It's scary. I find the door, walk through a well lit hotel or mall, and past several modern sculptures--thin wood boxes with a layer of many solid colored beads atop them, which are meant to be touched. A father and I watch his two young sons bury themselves in sand, then re-emerge, pushing their way out. Something pulls me into the sand. It's hurting me. I begin to moan, ""Ow...Ow...Ow..."" I wake up."

I decide to walk to a restaurant for ice cream but become lost. I find my way to a house on a high rocky cliff, which overlooks the sea. The owner, a cranky old woman, spots me. As I leave the house, she begins to complain. I take to the air and float down the rocky orange colored cliff, slowly soaring down. The old woman raves at me: ""Have you been drinking? What do you want? You'll see,"" she says, ""I'll call the cops."" I land and enter a suburban house, find a bunk bed and lay upon it. A man wearing a trench coat and fedora enters the darkened bedroom. As he stands near the bed he doesn't see me. I'm bleeding, and wipe blood on the sheets. I say, ""Excuse me, sir. Is this your bed?"" The man becomes angry. I get up, leave the house through the back door, walk quickly over a show car wrapped in plastic, jump to the ground, and keep walking."

I play a general in charge of a half-dozen guerillas, shouting out rhetorical questions to inspire my men. ""Are we going to fight this war?! Are we going to win this battle?!"" I'm doing this for their sake and to excite the audience. At first the guerrillas are unenthusiastic, but the second time I rouse them they are more high-spirited. ""Who's going to fight this war?"" I yell. ""We are!"" they shout back. ""We're going to war!"" I yell. "" Let's kill some of those bad people!"""

In a crowded way, we're walking to a political event. I see a ten foot tall rectangular black board stuck in the ground like a tombstone. Upon it, the words ""101st, 36 or more,"" are written in chalk. I climb up the sign and try to call my Vietnam friend John N, but it's dark and I can't read the numbers on my phone. We continue walking toward the theater where the event will be held. Everyone is carrying a table or chair. I have the rectangular sign. There's an old brick wall we must climb up and over by steps made of stacked and bound newspapers. George Stephanopoulos says we must take the newspapers with us. At my turn, I walk up the newspaper stairway, which is water-logged. A brick column is broken. Stephanopoulos says to dislodge the bricks from the mortar and carry them to the other side. He impatiently waits for the work to be done. The column is too heavy. I wake up saying, ""What do you want me to do? I've had three hernias, George. I'm not doing it."""

In the morning, we look for a train back to the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012. At the station Karen is sure of the way, but enters and exits twice. Without thinking, she blocks the way of a waiting passenger, a mysterious man. A train arrives but we miss it and walk in the country. Karen stands high up on a dirt ridge while I'm on lower ground. In the distance, I see a man who appears to be armed. Is he a cop? When the man turns, I see it's a shotgun, not a pistol, he's hidden inside his long tan coat. The man is angry. Karen, who does not see him, drinks water from a paper cup, and throws the empty cup down the ridge. I loudly whisper her name to warn her but she doesn't hear me calling. The man walks toward Karen, bumps into her, pushes her. I'm angry and start walking toward him. I will kick this man in his throat."

Instead of jungle, we're in an urban area with many tall apartment buildings similar to Sycamore Hill, the apartment complex I lived in from 10 to 12 years of age. Entering a complex, I struggle to sling on my pack, which is made of many fibers, like a humming's nest. We're making too much noise; the Vietnamese know the American' are here. The platoon enters a building and splits up. I'm alone, running down empty hallways, peering into apartments. I fear being seen or shot by the blue-collar inhabitants. In some rooms, the lights are on, or the doors are open. It's as if no one's home, or no one cares to be safe. I've had enough, and skip down the cement stairwells two steps at a time, triggering an alarm. At one of the landings, I see Ba repairing a water leak in the hotel he ran in ?Vietnam in the 1990s. I make a remark as I jump past. Ba says, ""Did you ask the officer about hunting?"" I wake up saying, ""I forgot. What do you want me to say?"""

I take a drink of water from a metal beer mug. The leader of the group, a powerful man who looks like Tom, a summer camp counselor when I was age 7, grabs it from me. It belongs to him. Then it's my turn to speak. I go around the subject, I tell him you push and you pull, you shoot and you slash. My father says, no. He tells me I really get into it when describing war. Several group members complain they don't like this subject. Tom walks away. He returns with the metal mug. Handing it to me, he vomits all over me. ""You fuck!"" I shout. As the puke swirls down, the color is wrong, and it doesn't stink. I tell Tom that maybe I have a good puke response. I tell him the puke didn't look right. ""It didn't have the right conglomeration of flecks and lumps of undigested food."" I say, ""good try,"" but I don't get angry. The anger begins right there. I tell Tom and the group the real question is what happens to anger? Where does it go, or not go?"

Trump enters an upscale private first floor lounge occupied by hotel staff. The tent-like roof raises to allow views of the stylish hotel grounds. I'm seated next to Trump, who is standing and sullen. A corpse in a coffin is carried into the room. One at a time, I share hors d'oeuvres with Trump, who scoffs at the body. The scene changes. Trump and I sit on the floor of the hotel's first floor utility closet; his family is the roof. It's dark in here. I'm holding Trump's hand, which is shaped like a wooden spoon. I ask Trump if he's afraid. He says that earlier he'd done building repairs and now wants to leave, but first, he must tell his family. I say, ""I'll call them.""

For a few minutes I ignore them, hoping they'll leave. Finally, knowing I've been caught, I walk through the darkened house and answer the door. Out back, there's a cab waiting with passengers.

She says I dated her because I was lonely. I say I didn't know that. She says maybe she will marry me. I say if she does, she'll have money. Melinda wants to go upstairs to visit her brother.

Dirty clothes and garbage are everywhere. The blanket is not here. The scene changes. I'm standing in a large foyer, much like the one at the Brand Theater where I worked in 1972 as an usher. In a thick British accent, an older Englishman with a 1950s haircut peppers me with questions. ""Do you have a cigarette? Do you have a light?"" On and on he goes. Whenever he speaks, he lurches forward suddenly, causing me to flinch. Is he drunk? ""Do you have coffee?"" he asks.

It's hard to tell if he's drunk or disabled. Mike asks for help with his school assignment. The subject is veterans, but his difficult speech and muddled thoughts make it hard to understand him. The teacher, who stands behind us, says she would like us to write an essay about the document that is given to soldiers when the leave the army. How has it helped us? How, in good ways, has it determined or shaped or changed our lives? I listen patiently, trying to see her point of view, but I'm thinking of the ways it has not helped.

This upsets the professor. Siding with the woman pilot, I press the question. Waking, I say, ""Doctor, what is the problem? I mean, isn't it the right thing to do?"""
"0086"	"(2016-10-27)"	"I'm chewing a piece of bread while standing by a corner of the playground fence at my grammar school, which is now an Army base. In the distance, I see a Caribou transport plane waiting for troops to board. A Huey with armed soldiers revs up, and for several hundred yards skims inches from the ground, then lifts and flies off. I see the front end of a 1940s German staff officer's car, which is painted red and green and has a BMW hood ornament. A few soldiers loiter about. I'm an outsider, but part of me wants to join them. If they ask what I'm doing here, I'll say I'm a Vietnam vet. An ambassador, a very tan, short, middle-aged man, dressed in suite and tie, comes up the cement steps and walks past. We talk. I tell him my landlord knows him, but momentarily I can't recall his name. Then I say, ""Bryan F,"" the name of my landlord."
"0087"	"(2016-10-27)"	"I'm lying on my back. A woman resembling Dot, a writing instructor in a veterans' workshop, approaches. She leans over me on her hands and knees. ""Have you done your homework?"" she asks. I say, ""Oh shit, I forgot. I was at a party."" She asks me where. I say, ""At a house in the city where I went to college from 1972-1974. She becomes more provocative. I become aroused. ""With those big lips, I thought you were a bedroom man,"" she says."" ""I was,"" I say. She's being coy, but are they big? She leans low and kisses me on the mouth, but her lipstick does not conceal her age. Still, I hope she'll take off her top. I want to kiss her breasts."
"0088"	"(2016-10-27)"	"By phone I'm talking to a hospital nurse about my father. She tells me about his talks to women. I ask her when he will give his next talk. I tell her my talks are about Vietnam. I'm flirting with her too."
"0089"	"(2016-10-27)"	"I'm in a small windowless office with three young men. We answer phone calls about VA benefits. A vet calls asking about freebies offered by stores, restaurants, and hotels, for veterans over sixty. A seated worker handling the call asks me for info. I tell him the vet should dial the VA 800 number. He ignores my advice. I talk to another worker, who is staring at the yellow wall inches from his face. I talk with Vincent B. The seated worker taunts him by saying ""Dick...dick...dick."" I want to show them my .45 pistol, which I have in my pack, but this would cause fear. I imagine the guards at the metal detectors. I imagine saying, ""I have to go back,"" and I would turn around, so that I won't be caught."
"0090"	"(2016-10-28)"	"I've had an emotional crisis. Various people have tried to intervene. Walking through a bad neighborhood, I take a wrong turn and enter an abandoned house with many rooms with swinging doors. Squatters have occupied several rooms. I'm looking for someone, but sense danger, and look for an exit. Just as I find it, a short middle-aged woman walks past me and enters the house. We ignore each other. As I walk down the street, my phone rings. A man with a foreign accent asks many questions. I say, ""Who is this? Who are you?"" When he doesn't answer, I interrupt him, saying, ""What do you want?"" Finally, I say, ""Tell me the reason you're calling in ten words or less or I'll hang up."" He keeps talking; I hang up. The phone rings again. A man with a subdued official-sounding voice asks to speak with me. I ask if he's with the VA. No, he's from social services. He's been contacted by Mrs. Danville, the nurse who tried to help with my emotional crisis. City noise makes it hard to hear him. Waking, I say, ""It's noisy. It's hard to hear you. Please call back."""
"0091"	"(2016-10-29)"	"With a group of military prisoners, I'm standing at parade rest. Two or three officers are present. We've been told to direct questions to one particular inmate. After a man has asked his question, an officer loudly repeats it, the inmate answers, and the process is repeated. The men ask banal questions. The answers are equally predictable. It is all done quickly. I know that the man being questioned has committed arson. At my turn, I ask him, ""Did the crime you committed put you or anyone else in danger? If so, what did you do, and why did you do it?"" The other prisoners grumble. His tone is mocking as the prisoner says this is the best question, and he is asked it often. Sneering, an inmate asks me, ""What about you? What did you do?"" My provocative answer has put me in danger. Later these men will try to attack me. I imagine the warden will put me elsewhere in the prison. My crime was to throw hand grenades into barrels of shit."
"0092"	"(2016-10-30)"	"I need bullets for my forty-five pistol. I visit a store where a female worker reminds me of Lisa, the student activist I knew. She says it's not likely the store has bullets but there's a box of used blue jeans which might have ammo. I don't understand her logic. As the woman takes out the jeans, she says she doesn't like them. They look familiar to me. When I realize they're mine I say, ""They're all worn out in the same place."" Going through the jean pockets, the woman finds loose change, which she holds in the palm of one hand. When she holds the jeans upside down, more money falls out. I say, ""Wow,"" and comb through the coins she holds in her hand. ""Look at this!"" I say, ""a 1944 silver quarter!"" (like the coins I collected as a child). But no ammo. The woman says she's sorry. She says I should go to the VA. I reply, ""They probably don't have ammo. They would say it's too dangerous."" I thank her several times. I'm very grateful to her. I embrace this woman. I kiss her. ""I've learned so much,"" I say."
"0093"	"(2016-10-31)"	"I meet My former girlfriend Karen outside Hulu, a popular cafe now located in a large busy mall. With three or four other people on her bike, we ride around inside the cafe. It's great fun, and I meet the actor Michael Cain. Dapper, dressed in a suit and tie, he takes a romantic interest in me. I let him know we can bicycle around the mall, but only as friends. After we ride, he parks the bike, blocking a busy walk way. I move the bike, and tell him to take the lock key. Cain kisses me on the back of the neck. I let it pass. We walk to dinner."
"0094"	"(2016-10-31)"	"I'm on a bus with a handsome young black man. His face is gaunt, like the older jazz poet Gill Scott-Heron. In the past, he's had trouble with the law, and he tells me about a woman he loved, a drug addict. As we talk, I comprehend the meaning of inner strength. I want to tell him this, but listening, not talking, is right. When we part, I tell him to be strong. I'm aware this means recognizing one's inner strength. The scene changes. It's cold and dark; there is snow on the ground. I walk to the house of a woman I know. Standing in front of the house, in a notebook, in large letters, I print one word. If I stand here much longer people may complain. In the foot high snow, I walk to the house where a family rents me a room. In thirty minutes a young white man will visit me. I wash up before he arrives. He surveys the room. With its brown walls, it is cramped and crowded with furniture and clothes. I tell him I've lived in many places in the past few years, some of them real dumps, this one is not so bad."
"0095"	"(2016-10-31)"	"To complete a project, my brother and I, in our twenties, ride a trolley to the library, where I've reserved a room for privacy and quiet. We're about to start when a distraught young man, bearded and with black hair, approaches. He asks if I have any problems, then launches into a forceful series of mixed up questions. Clearly, he's mentally ill. At first, I'm patient with him. Then firmly, I say, ""No. I'm not interested, sir. Stop."" Holding up my hand, I say, ""Just stop."" My brother envies my self-assertion. When the man departs, I ask my brother where he wants to begin work. Here, or at another desk? He's ambivalent. I take charge."
"0096"	"(2016-11-01)"	"I'm on the bottom floor of my old house on Highland Place. Completely empty and gutted, the walls, ceilings and trim have been painted white. I'm puttering around, fixing a few things. The landlord will complete the repairs. The scene changes. An older woman shows me around her enormous apartment. There are rooms and more rooms, corridors and stairways, some like the foyer at place I lived as a pre-teen in Resort Town. The room where she lives is the size of a Broadway theater. Large upholstered chairs, like thrones, are arranged on a balcony, which skirts the four walls of the room. Beautiful brass and wood musical instruments lay on the floor. There are shiny tubas, French horns, old cellos, violins. I say, ""You live here? Just you?"" but I'm thinking, All this space for one person?"" The woman says, ""Yes. This is where I play."" I imagine as an artist she has subsidized rent. I ask, ""Do you have pets?"" She says no. I say, ""You could have parrots. Or monkeys or dogs. The parrots could fly around."" I recall the green parrots soaring over a volcanic crater in Masaya, Nicaragua."
"0097"	"(2016-11-01)"	"In bright daylight, with a group of construction workers, I'm sitting on a street curb. As the traffic crawls past, a bus stops directly in front of us. ""What a view!"" I jest to the man next to me. When the bus engine starts up, it spews black exhaust all over us. The workers grumble, as if to say, ""This is how we live."" I hold my breath. I squirm and duck to avoid the filthy fumes. I'm running out of air. I'm desperate to breathe. Finally, the bus pulls away and I inhale fresh air."
"0098"	"(2016-11-01)"	"I'm in a crowded room built like a theater-in-the-round. I know the group in attendance. We're here to discuss cases. The lighting, the seating, the atmosphere, it's a bit like Dr. Tulp's anatomy class as painted in 1632 by Rembrandt. At my turn, I say, ""The woman was not suggestible."" In fact, she liked being listened to, and spoke easily. Others give their opinions. One person disagrees with me. I'm aware that what I've said is shallow, that the patient is a woman I'm dating. There is an apple with teeth marks on a table. Dayl the Vietnamese writer is present. He's wearing a straw hat with a colorful cloth band and a large yellow flower stuck in front. The scene changes. The group is standing at a crowded bar. A doctor says he's discontinuing the antibiotic therapy of several men who are present. He says the drugs are not effective. They contain the same toxins as they did in 1957. The scene changes. It's night. I'm walking to an old empty house. Inside, it's dark and wet and slippery. I imagine falling, and breaking my leg. It will be numb before there is pain. I climb to where another meeting will take place. Someone gives me Dayl's straw hat. I try it on. I say, ""This isn't me."" Someone asks to see the hat. I hand it to them."
"0099"	"(2016-11-01)"	"Two mafia brothers are to be executed. One is apparently shot inside a building. The other still hopes to escape. Wounded, he hobbles down a residential street, which resembles Highland Place. He sees Mafiosi sitting outside a house one block away. They see him too. The wounded man hobbles to a side street. A Mafiosi car draws near. When the wounded man steps into a station wagon, the Mafiosi exit their car, casually aim their rifles, and lay down a furious barrage of fire. I imagine the bullets piercing the station wagon door. I imagine the wounded man trying to evade the barrage."
"0100"	"(2016-11-01)"	"Very enthusiastically, I'm talking to Hillary Clinton and one of her aides about a marijuana-like drug. Hillary and her aide ask about its effects. ""It can only make you happy,"" I say. The aide asks another question. I want to avoid the negative response, ""I didn't understand what you said,"" but there's no way around it. Up to that point, I'm happy. The dream repeats itself, this time with less enthusiasm. I tell the aide there are no side effects. The aide asks where to park."
"0101"	"(2016-11-03)"	"After work, a man who is my father gives me a lift home. I get out, walk to a partly frozen river, walk out on the ice, and call to the young Europeans on the other side. They offer fifteen cents for a pack of cigarettes. I shout back, ""In the US they cost at least a dollar fifty."" They're surprised, but agree to purchase one pack. With a friend, I walk to a store in an area much like a famous amusement park. The man in front of me buys a lotto ticket. I hear the numbers he's playing and write them down. I buy a scratch off ticket, a pack of cigarettes. I'm excited. I'm feeling lucky. There are colorful blinking lights, old fashion entrance trestles, the noise of the amusement rides overhead."
"0102"	"(2016-11-03)"	"I'm in a class room where people receive test results. The teacher walks down the aisle, patting each student on the shoulder, announcing the result aloud. Sternly, in a scolding voice, she says I have cancer. When the class ends, I leave with everyone else. I'm thinking, So this is what will finish me off, and I am not afraid. I consider asking a young woman I know if she can see my scar, but decide to feel the scar with my fingertips. There is a swollen patch of skin at the back of my neck. Once at home, a small two room apartment, I set my blue pack on the floor. I sit at a desk and start my computer."
"0103"	"(2016-11-04)"	"I'm playing catch with two men in the plaza behind Old City Hall. We've formed a triangle; one man throws the ball to me or my opponent, a young black man, who is big and clumsy, like a man I knew from work. The man who throws the ball has poor aim and continually throws the ball to the black man. I tell him to aim more towards me. Flailing his hands, the black man lumbers left and right trying to catch every ball that's thrown. It's inevitable that we'll collide. I'm frustrated, not angry."
"0104"	"(2016-11-05)"	"I'm talking with several young women at a bar or social gathering. I'm attracted to one woman in particular. She's pretty; her long brown hair, the inviting turn of her mouth, make her sexy. Desire is not the only factor. I'm no longer ruled by impulse, but it's clear she's not interested. Still, it's a friendly group. Or is she interested after all? We leave the bar for a walk outside. It's dark out. The woman has a dog. Brown and black, it's furry, friendly. Somehow it wanders away. When I find the dog, the woman expresses deep thanks. From my heart, I tell her I know how much the dog means to her. I tell her I love dogs too. The woman is so pretty, so lovely. But like the old days, I'm scheming. If not her, there is always her friend."
"0105"	"(2016-11-07)"	"I'm in a room where many young people lie asleep on beds. A nearby woman talks aloud in a dramatic way. She's annoying the man near me, who lies prone on his bed. I say his name. I tell him not to be bothered by her. All the beds begin to move and converge. The prone man, who is handsome, inches toward the woman. There is tension. At any moment, they'll fight. When they are face to face, with violence imminent, they kiss passionately. To give them privacy, I move, bumping up against another woman's arms or legs. Jokingly, I say to her, ""What was that? Oh, that's better. Much better. Thank you so much, whoever you are."" The first woman and I walk across the street. She's wearing blue slacks. Her straight black hair covers her forehead; like an ancient helmet, it protects each side of her face. As we cross the street she says, ""Oh, I know you."" I'm initially attracted to her, but she's old, not as beautiful as I first thought."
"0106"	"(2016-11-07)"	"I'm riding on a city bus to downtown near where I went to college in the 1970s. When the driver lets me know to get off, I ask how much further he's going. I want to get closer than where he's stopped. Up to this point he's been friendly. Now he's annoyed and let's me know it. I ask if he's at least going to Berry Street."
"0107"	"(2016-11-07)"	"I'm with a couple who own horses. We're out in the woods, in a small meadow, walking two horses in a wide circle. We take the animals to a small lake. The male owner says it's good for the horses to swim. He says they work hard. They'll enjoy the water. And they do. I've been holding the reins of one horse, and let go. I tell the owner what I've done but he's not worried. The horses swim about. They seem to be playing. One horse becomes too excited. There's a bit of danger. The scene changes. I have one horse in the living room at Highland Place. The other horse may be sick. I'm concerned about the noise; the landlord may hear it in the apartment below. I'm aware that horses can hear one another approaching from a mile away. The horse in the living room lies on the floor. It's become pale and small. Its face is hidden. What will I do when the other horse returns?"
"0108"	"(2016-11-07)"	"I'm in a hospital. I have cancer. A nurse tells me that after I've gained weight they will send me home. Angrily, I tell her, ""I'm dying and you're sending me home? That doesn't make sense."""
"0109"	"(2016-11-08)"	"I'm on a WWII ammo ship. A Japanese artillery barrage rains down, detonates the ammo, which explodes from bow to stern. An enormous black cloud of thick billowing smoke wells up, obscuring the ruined vessel."
"0110"	"(2016-11-08)"	"I'm with a group of young people hiking in the mountains. We're staying at a large dorm. It's rustic, like the old Works Progress Administration buildings in national parks. On the way to her room, my former girlfriend Karen walks past. She's wearing dark gray jeans. She doesn't see me. Does she want to be together? I miss her so much. The scene changes. With a dozen young people I'm seated at the far end of a long table. About ten people sit on one side; two or three sit opposite them. I'm so hungry, and the food is at the far end of the table. Finally, it's passed to me, but there's only corn on the cob. Small chunks of wonderfully golden, buttered, crunchy, corn on the cob."
"0111"	"(2016-11-08)"	"I'm in the ocean standing on a small rectangular platform made of black gray rock that sits one or two feet above the water, which is calm and dark. In the distance, I can see and hear two or three seals. One seal pops up directly in front of the platform. Now other people are present. Suddenly the seal jumps onto the platform. It's yelping, looking right at me. Does it want food? Should I pet it? Will it bite? The seal looks so friendly, but I'm aware it may bite."
"0112"	"(2016-11-09)"	"I'm in a bedroom freshly painted white that is similar to the bedroom at old home on Highland Place. I lie down but hear something, a man's voice, coming from a radio. I get up to look for the source. There's a ventilation shaft with a wood shutter. The noise is coming from the floor below. I try to jimmy the shutter closed."
"0113"	"(2016-11-09)"	"John N from Vietnam days and I are driving on a winding single lane country road. Overhead, a flat bright sky. A pond with geese to our right. I wonder if the geese fly to other bodies of water. John says yes. He says there's a pond on the other side of the road."
"0114"	"(2016-11-09)"	"I'm in a foreign country, possibly India. There are two places to stay. One building has many rooms reached by small winding steps. As I walk up the steps, a small blonde woman squeezes past. I find a room and lay down. Other people are here. Twice, I'm groped by a dim presence. Python or octopus-like, it slowly pins me down, though I manage to break free. The second time, I wake, moaning. In another room, I ask a young American man about fireworks. He introduces me to a Thai woman, a former opera singer. She steps to a wall and begins to sing a low mournful song. The other rooms are a succession of tents made of light blue cloth in the jungle. It begins to rain. I wonder what it's like to stay dry in the tents, where the water is absorbed by the cloth."
"0115"	"(2016-11-10)"	"I'm in a basement packing for a trip. There are pages of music one person will like. A half-dressed man, who resembles my father, suddenly appears. I say, ""Wow."" The man has lost weight and gained a physique. He explains that he has just cheated on his diet, that he will be reprimanded. At a meeting he asks me to be his therapist. I say this would not be a good idea, one Nam vet counseling another."
"0116"	"(2016-11-14)"	"I'm at a meeting with several people. Inadvertently, each person states their name and branch of service. A thin, handsome, young-looking man, tall with dark hair, identifies himself, then says, ""Marines, in the 60s."" At my turn, I give my name and say, ""Infantry medic, Vietnam, Cambodia 1970. "" At the far end of the table sits an attractive woman who resembles Michelle, a therapist I knew. There's a mutual attraction between us and I want to impress her. The scene changes. The woman and I are slow dancing. The Marine asks to dance with her. It's annoying, but each time he asks I keep calm. I tell him we're involved. I tell him the woman and I are falling in love."
"0117"	"(2016-11-14)"	"I'm in the front seat of the truck owned by my friend since Vietnam, Walter. We're driving down a road in a working class neighborhood. At first, it's unclear who is driving, causing tension between us. Suddenly Walter speeds up, steering the truck toward a house. We pitch up the steps, and plow into the front door; the upended truck hangs ten feet in the air. As we climb out and drop down, I say to Walter, ""Now we'll be arrested."" We run down a dirt path. Walter turns to the right. I run forward. I think about returning for my pack, then keep running."
"0118"	"(2016-11-15)"	"I'm playing touch football in a large field similar to Elk Grove Camp I attended in summers as a youth. Everyone is in their twenties. My team has the ball. I anticipate that the opposing team will send a man to rush the quarterback, and step back to block him. At the hike, we try to fake each other out. The quarterback throws me the ball. I run down field, out pacing or dodging the opposing players. Everyone watches as I run toward a playground, where men wait to jump from the swings and tackle me. But my feints succeed. I continue running. Someone says, ""I can't believe what a good play this is."" Nearing the goal, wondering what gesture to make, I raise one hand in the air. I've done it. I've made a great play that everyone has seen."
"0119"	"(2016-11-15)"	"With another soldier, I'm walking in the woods, patrolling for Germans. A German civilian will not join us. This happens several times. A platoon wearing black uniforms comes in from patrol. I say, ""What's the status?"" When they ignore me I repeat the question, adding, ""We had activity. What's the status?"" The platoon forms a line. I turn to Walter and ask, ""What's with actor Nick Nolte?"" A reporter present resembles the actor. The black clad soldiers wipe down their weapons. I wonder whether to point my M16 barrel up or down. A ceremony will be held for having bested another unit; the platoon will receive a star."
"0120"	"(2016-11-16)"	"A man on an island is captured by natives, who dress him in a prisoner's pelt, harness and tie him to a rock next to a female lion. When the prisoner moves, the lion growls as if to bite. The man yells, ""No, don't you even! No!"" He is thinking, Is this how it will end? and directs his will to escape. The man frees himself, frees the lion, shoos it away, but the lion stays near the shore line, or tries to crawl between rocks, until it's finally shooed away. A baby lion appears, a small, innocent cub. When it paws the ground to urinate, the man yells, ""No! Don't you do that! Don't you do that!"" This happens by the shoreline, where the water is calm."
"0121"	"(2016-11-16)"	"I'm at a spiritual retreat. The building resembles a college dorm. There are monks here. They give each person a cell phone and a wooden paddle, to be used as a fan. Their only job is to make beds. This is their way to enlightenment. I have a bed in a large room shared with others at the retreat. I see an attractive woman and make conversation with her but she's snooty. Before I leave, I remove my shirt so that when I walk past her in my tight fitting, ripped jeans, everyone will see my athletic body. In an empty room, I unpack my things and rest. I call my father on a black landline phone. We discuss where he will pick me up. I'm indecisive. Finally, I say, ""On Osborn Street,"" where he lived. He says he will be there in thirty-five minutes. I want more time to hang out, to get something to eat. In a worried voice, I say, ""One hour?"" We lose the connection, but I'm speaking into the wrong end of the phone."
"0122"	"(2016-11-17)"	"Prior to a guitar gig, I'm staying at a large hotel. As I go to my room, another musician enters. She's overdressed, wearing a folksy costume and heavy make-up. When I ask her name, she answers in an accented voice, ""Uneh."" She says, ""Give me your number. My musicians need it."" I don't understand her request, but accede to it. The scene changes. I'm walking down a wide street, similar to the driveway bordering my grammar school. Twice, I'm clipped by a skateboarder. The third time, I turn to the rider, a woman who resembles my former girlfriend Lucille. I say, ""What the fuck? What's going on?"" The woman is meek, frail, still beautiful. She used to do everything, she tells me, and tells me the things she once did."
"0123"	"(2016-11-18)"	"I'm in a field much like Sycamore Hill Park. The old gang is gone. A new gang, much younger, has picked sides for a game of touch football. I'm standing, watching them play. The quarterback rears his arm back, whips it forward, launching the ball into the sky. I feel like an outsider. If they ask me to talk or play, I'll stay silent. The scene changes. I'm lying down on the grass next to a pretty girl. We talk about movies. I tell her I don't know that film, I'd need to see a still photo, or see the dialogue. I put my arm around her, gently embrace her. ""Are you OK with this?"" I ask. ""As long as you care for me,"" she replies. I tell her I do, and hold her close. She nudges her blouse open. I begin kissing her breasts, pull down her jeans and panties, and go down on her. Someone watching would think how quickly it happened. ""That was fast,"" they would say. But I like this girl. I really like her."
"0124"	"(2016-11-19)"	"I'm in a building similar to the Sycamore Hill Apartments, talking with a woman. She motions that someone is at the door, which is half open. It's a woman named Maryanna, who asks me a favor. In jest, I say, ""I'm a virgin."" In fact, she's scared of a robber inside the building, and points to the hallway. Just then an old dark black woman with gray processed hair, walks by. She's blind; her eyes are completely white. I walk up to her. In a disguised voice I say, ""Hey, I'm putting you under arrest. We've been watching you. Don't move."" I motion to Maryanna to call the police. Later, we talk about space travel and mail delivery. Will it be called ""interplanetary mail,"" or simply, ""space mail?"""

After arguing with a passenger, I throw a toy train carriage out the window, hoping the police, who are several hundred feet below, will look up. It's too far to jump out. The scene changes. In darkness, on the ground, I'm talking with a woman sitting in a bleacher. I ask her what movie she and the others are watching. What's it about? She says she isn't sure. It seems like a conflict, in black and white, a silent film."
"0126"	"(2016-11-22)"	"Attempting to stage an accident, with two young thieves, I jump into a car that hurtles down a road and deliberately crashes into a wall or barricade. The crash is greater than expected. The two thieves are injured or dead. The police are coming. I escape, disguise myself, and hide in a house where a young black man, handsome and light-skinned, talks to me. Suddenly, he appears in a black belt judo gi. I tell him, ""A friend of mine is always looking for a sparring partner."" The scene changes. I'm changing clothes in an alley outside the house, leaving a large pile of clothes on the ground. Nearby, a happy young boy plays with a paper cup. Twice, he asks, ""What's the number for pumpkin?"""
"0127"	"(2016-11-23)"	"On a beautiful island, hardly touristed, I meet a tall light-skinned black man with processed hair. I know this man. We're neighbors. When I ask where he's been, he says out of the country. We continue with small talk and he invites me to his place for dinner. By the cut of his clothes, his stylish manner, I ask if he's gay. He says yes. Immediately, I tell him I'm straight. ""That can be fixed!"" he replies. I say, ""No,"" and begin walking away. The black man is apologetic, but I'm walking away."
"0128"	"(2016-11-24)"	"It's dark. I've left a college cafe and head home, but soon get lost in the woods, where it begins to rain. I find my way to a field that resembles a rice paddy. I keep falling down in the water. I'm not angry or afraid. There's a comical quality to my antics, even as close passing cars, racing by, do not see me. I find a country road and walk to a candy store tucked below a hillside. Two husky middle-aged men emerge from a doorway. One appears to be the owner, the other man, a customer. By their manner and appearance each resembles my father, or the type of men he knew. I ask the customer for directions. He's pocketing a gold colored scratch off ticket. ""How do I get to city C?"" I ask. As he gives me directions, the owner and two other men gather round. The customer, who is mentally slow and friendly, asks me if I worked for the VA. He asks many questions. I say yes, and tell him I worked for the state. Humorously I ask if he worked for the PTA. I ask if he fought in WWII, though it's clear he's not old enough. They're a good bunch, but I half wonder if they'll turn and kill me."
"0129"	"(2016-11-24)"	"I've met two black men; they've set up an office in a dilapidated building, where we spend time together. The older man mentors the younger, a tall handsome and light-skinned research scientist, who expands his office to a second area but Spartan, disheveled room. When the scientist shows me where he will place the shelves and desk, I say that I'm happy for him. Offhandedly, in a sinister voice, he says it's time for another amphetamine fuelled weekend. The older man asks if I'll stay. At that moment, everything changes. I say no. That's it. I'm leaving."
"0130"	"(2016-11-26)"	"I'm with a platoon on patrol in jungle that resembles the jungle of Song Be, a province in Vietnam our unit patrolled, and the North Mountain Nature Preserve in the USA. A K9 team and a woman accompany us. We move at a fast clip. At some points the jungle thins, then thickens. Overhead, a jet flies constant air support. We're not scared, but there are dinks in the area. The woman believes there were North Vietnamese soldiers a few meters back; she retraces the trail, but not far enough. Suddenly I'm aware that I don't have my M16. I'm terrified, but the grunts don't seem to care. We find two foreign soldiers hiding in the bush and take them prisoner. I run back to find my M16. The scene changes. I'm in the rear. An officer yells at me to pay for the lost rifle. I refuse, yelling, ""I want to go back, but I'm not paying for my fucking weapon."" The officer throws me in jail; he sends two soldiers to beat me up. When they enter the cell, I fly into a rage, beating them with a small wood bench, with my fists and feet. One man dazed but standing, tries to leave. ""Where do you think you're going?"" I yell, and grab him by his shirt. I will beat him to a pulp. I will beat him to death. I begin beating him down."
"0131"	"(2016-11-27)"	"I'm alone in a penthouse apartment teaching myself to play the trumpet. I accompany myself by recording a track, then replay and record over it. No one can hear me; if they can, I don't care. The music is similar to early Miles Davis. I want to expand it, vary the tune, but can't seem to find the way."
"0132"	"(2016-11-27)"	"I'm in a bedroom watching a mother trying to coax her young daughter to speak. The woman lays atop the girl, who sits in a child's wagon. The mother is patient, loving; the girl is reluctant to talk. When the mother leaves the room I say to the child, ""If you speak, I'll listen."" The girl, curled in a corner to avoid me, is silent. Suddenly, she begins talking, as if telling a story."
"0133"	"(2016-11-28)"	"In a nearly empty bar out West, I lie on a table, trying to sleep. The only customers are a man and a woman, who lie next to me; they cuddle and chat. The man, brisk and macho, appears to know me. From time to time he seems to speak my name. It's as if he's taunting me. At any moment we will fight."
"0134"	"(2016-11-28)"	"I've just watched a strip show and lie in bed, talking to a man the next bed over. We're both armed. The man, a member of Al Qaeda, is young and handsome, with erotic blue eyes. At first the conversation is pleasant. Then we argue about the stripper. I tell him, ""I'm sorry, Bob. No. That's complete bullshit."" He becomes angry, confused. Clearly, at any moment he may kill me. I consider how I will shoot him first. It's in his eyes. They hold hatred."
"0135"	"(2016-11-29)"	"With other people, I'm on the roof of a building watching an anti-war rally unfold. The street marchers hold placards. One protester holds a painting. Everyone chants anti-war slogans. I'm happy. I'm clapping my hands to the beat of the chants. I'm encouraging everyone to do the same."
"0136"	"(2016-11-29)"	"Miss Gerber, my high school English teacher, sits at her desk in front of the adult education class. My glasses make her appear close. She has just asked me what I meant. We stare at each other. She's pretty. Are we flirting? For a moment, we seem to romantically connect. I look away, and answer her question with a half-truth. ""Good,"" she replies, ""because tomorrow you'll ask the exam question."""
"0137"	"(2016-11-30)"	"My brother, mother and I are overnight house guests, sleeping on the black carpeted floor. My mother and I inspect white porcelain fish filigreed with gold leaf and shaped like slippers. I want to show my mother the owner's name, which is stenciled in gold inside the slipper. I tell her, ""It's here somewhere,"" but can't find it. Only the word ""Florida"" is visible. As we prepare to sleep, my mother says, ""And tomorrow we're getting up at 2 a.m."" I say, ""Like hell we are. You don't tell me what to do. What the fuck is that all about?"" When she doesn't reply, I say, ""Go ahead, be silent."" There are no sheets or blankets. I arrange my pants to sleep on them. A young man and I start to get up at the same time. We both have to pee. I motion him to go first. He does the same. I get up to pee."
"0138"	"(2016-12-02)"	"I'm walking down a snowy path beside a highway. The snow is high, hard packed, icy, which makes the trek difficult. In addition, I'm wearing my blue backpack, which weighs me down. Out of frustration, I fling off my jacket and pack. Two hundred yards later, I decide to return and fetch them. In the distance, I see a man and his dog walk past my gear. A woman seems to stop and look. I have to get to my things before they are stolen. On the way back I realize I'm wearing my jacket. I hitch a ride in a car resembling a WWII German staff car, sitting in back with a young boy. A father and his other son sit in front. The car has no roof, but wire frames prevent me from jumping out when we approach my things."
"0139"	"(2016-12-02)"	"I'm walking down Lincoln Street to buy a scratch off lottery ticket at the local market. A young black man, wearing a floppy purple hat and fur coat, walks toward me, his face in shadow. As we approach each other, I stare at him. I expect him to ask, ""What are you looking at?"" If he does, I will kick him in the throat. At the store, I sit on a stool in front of a rack of newspapers, pick up a paper and read the headlines, half blocking the customers who come and go. I get up, walk to the counter, ask the clerk, ""Do you have...do you have...any soccer balls?"" Behind the counter, a confident Hispanic or Italian looking man listens patiently as I stumble my words, unable to express myself clearly. He has seen this many times. Calmly, but quickly, in a business-like manner, he says, ""We don't have any soccer balls."" I did not want one, but something like it, but could not describe what it was. I had wanted to play some kind of game."
"0140"	"(2016-12-03)"	"I'm on a fire base that was overrun in Cambodia that resembles the open grassy landscape of Fort Sam Houston. Important people have come to visit. A woman asks about the base. Was it always like this? I tell her at first it was all jungle. I point out soldier Sammy C, who flexes his fingers in rage and fear. Soldiers walk the area, on alert for an attack. As the dignitaries approach, I look up the length of a super immense redwood tree. High up, barely visible, a speck of a man. ""Sniper!"" I yell. ""Sniper!"" and point to the dark speck against the amber bark. The soldiers raise their rifles and open fire. As the sniper falls hundreds of feet through the air, I begin to methodically clap and shout, ""Good...bye...mother...fucker!"" When the dead man hits the earth we soldiers whoop and cheer."
"0141"	"(2016-12-06)"	"Having just finished acting in a Greek play, naked, I walk across a room populated by several spectators. A distinguished looking older woman with long white hair, garbed in white, addresses me. ""Mr. X,"" she says, ""except for one small detail, it was a successful performance. If you had omitted the part about the bull with no ears...""She is kind but direct in her faithful critique."
"0142"	"(2016-12-06)"	"I'm walking down the street with a young black woman. She is pretty, upbeat, and wears her hair in a large Afro. ""You walk fast,"" I say to her, ""but he walks faster."" Ahead of us walks Mr. Rogers of TV fame."
"0143"	"(2016-12-08)"	"I'm in a war zone with another person, possibly my brother, walking along a moonlit, snowy path. We pass a wide-open snow covered field. I say to the other person, ""Hey buddy...hey buddy.. .just keep walking."" I'm aware that at any moment we may be shot. Each time I say, ""Hey buddy..."" the other person tries to crowd me off the path. ""Hey, buddy... Hey, buddy,"" I say, pushing back, ""Just keep walking."""
"0144"	"(2016-12-10)"	"I'm helping someone open a package. It's as if he's teaching me how to do that. Carefully, I use an Xacto knife to cut open the box, which contains an explosive, and another parcel. When the person leaves, I open the parcel, thinking it contains blasting caps. But inside are chocolate roosters on sticks mounted in cardboard. I must re-fold the packaging back together--this package which came from Amazon."
"0145"	"(2016-12-10)"	"In the country on a sunny day, I decide to walk down a steep hill to a small variety shop, and leave my blue pack at a crossroad decorated with stones and flowers. I begin walking, then suddenly realize someone might steal my pack. From twenty yards away, I levitate, and fly back to fetch it, then fly to the store. The scene changes. I'm in a car with my dog, who is driving along a city street. There are sirens; cars pull over. I tell my dog to go faster or slower, left or right. The busy street narrows. My brother is confused. I tell him to go straight but he wants to turn left. I say, ""But we're going back to the city."""
"0146"	"(2016-12-11)"	"My brother and I sleep at opposite ends of a bedroom much like the cottage in Green Meadow Lake. Outside, red lights flash. In the dimness, I call to my brother, who does not answer. At the window, I have only a limited view, but there is no police car, no ambulance. I walk upstairs to another room, thinking it's mine. But this sparsely furnished apartment, with its beige rug, dresser and typewriter, much like my grim apartment in years ago in another state, belongs to a woman who is not here."
"0147"	"(2016-12-12)"	"With two or three people, I talk about climbing trees, and the view from the tree tops. I describe a park to a woman new to the area. It's a good place to climb, I tell her. ""Have you been to the oceanfront and amusement park? I ask. She says no. I tell her that a mile from town there is a park that has a lake with ducks. The lake borders on a university. I tell her there is a playground, and wide open spaces, and many trees. I describe the trees in detail, how the branches are rigid, hard, and do not bend. I tell her that when I first visited this park, I thought, ""I can shimmy up them, just like in high school,"" but no, I could not. Two months later, I could. Waking, I say, ""You can climb the tree, but you always have to get back down."""
"0148"	"(2016-12-12)"	"I'm in a school room with Susan E, a noted painter married to a friend of mine. She's involved in a family dispute over inherited jewelry. I ask her the estimated value. To mask the amount, she writes down several numbers on a cardboard cylinder and rotates it until it arrives at the number six. The jewelry is worth six million dollars. She tells me the complex circumstances of the dispute, and what she will do. I tell her that for around two hundred dollars, she can talk with an attorney for about one hour. He will give her good advice. Susan E. is angry, upset, crying. When she rejects my idea, the discussion ends. I grab an armful of men's suit jackets and walk to a classroom that is small and cramped and has only three or four wooden ink well desks. As I stand there wondering what to do, a teacher, a handsome light-skinned black man resembling a famous investigative reporter, Robert Knight, enters the room. He is cheerful, friendly. I extend my hand and tell him my name."
"0149"	"(2016-12-13)"	"A large presence under the covers lays in bed with me. It is solid black or brown and shaped like an enormous pupa. Every so often it moves against my body; I'm powerless to push it away. I know I'm dreaming, but whatever it is seems real, alive, intelligent. Finally, with great effort, I force myself awake."
"0150"	"(2016-12-13)"	"My brother and I are in a large room furnished with 19th century drapes and heavy dark furniture. A play is being performed; we stand close to the stage. A slight breeze ruffles the thick pages of a large book that are brindled like cows. A male actor, dressed in period costume, gives an opening speech. During a pause, softly, I say to him, ""Hi."" The actor gives me a stern look, then continues. When a second actor arrives, I turn to my brother and say, ""Now you try."" During a pause, my brother gently says to the actor, ""Hi."" The first actor scolds us for interrupting the play. All the while, an actress, dressed in a grim gown, a sword at her side, stands imposingly silent. I imagine a play where the actors gradually dispense with lines and blocking, until they improvise the entire event. At first entertaining, under the weight of chaos things fall apart."
"0151"	"(2016-12-14)"	"With my brother and two small girls, I'm in a small room shaped like an A frame bird house. Outside, where it's cold, wet and muddy, there is work to be done. We're waiting for my father, in the next room, above us. I ask one of the girls to wake him. She crawls into a round perch hole near the roof of the room and calls to him. ""Mr. X...Mr. X,"" she says. My father answers that he doesn't feel well. ""I always have to get your mother coffee in the morning,"" he says. ""This is the only time I can sleep."" I'm aware of how true this sounds. How well it describes his character."
"0152"	"(2016-12-15)"	"During a mortar attack, I'm in my bedroom at the house on Highland Place. As the shells drop closer and closer, I wonder, ""Where will it hit? Where?"" I try to squeeze myself into the earth. I try to disappear. Somehow, I'm in radio contact with my Vietnam friend John N. Neither of us is shouting or afraid. As we talk, I hear the shells falling by him. When the attack is over, I find a two-foot piece of shiny purple plastic with the US Air Force emblem--the tail end of a cold war jet. John N. says it's from an American surveillance plane. ""A real souvenir,"" he says."
"0153"	"(2016-12-16)"	"In the American west, actor-producer Robert De Niro leads another man in destroying a large amount of territory. They stand in front of a tall mesa, where the water soaked earth at its base has begun to collapse. De Nero tells the man to move closer, to complete the decay. As he does so, the muddy soil, like a melting glacier, suddenly buckles, creating an earthen avalanche that threatens to swallow the two men, who run for their lives."
"0154"	"(2016-12-16)"	"I'm a guest in an old mansion. The spirit of a boy, crying for help, comes running up the steps to my room. ""I have stuff all over my face,"" he says. ""Help me. Help."" It's dark. I have to find the light switch that I know doesn't work, and turning it on wouldn't help; the boy is invisible. The spirit says ugly punks did this to him, then he runs back downstairs."
"0155"	"(2016-12-16)"	"I own a horse and am learning to ride it in the open land out West. My dog is with me. I want to tie her to the horse with my green nylon cord, but the horse says it's too short. Even when I double the length, it's short, so I abandon the idea. Sometimes I let the horse go and it runs far away, kicking it's heels, rippling its neck and head, happy and free."
"0156"	"(2016-12-17)"	"My brother and I are in our bedroom on Highland Place. He's asleep; I'm awake. My brother has a vagina and I mount him, attempting to make love, but my mother will enter to wake us soon, and I stop. Today we're going on a camping trip. I should pack but I really want to stay home this weekend, to just hang out. A woman enters our room, mistaking it for the bathroom. I make a sardonic remark and she leaves. Then Richard, the program coordinator from the Joiner Center, enters. He's here for the camping trip, and going to Australia too. When I ask which part, he says, ""Speakers."" ""How long will we camp?"" I ask. Richard says just for a day or two. I say to myself, ""It's such a long drive for so little time away."""
"0157"	"(2016-12-17)"	"I'm with several criminals walking up a steep road in a wealthy suburban neighborhood. While talking with the men I realize I'm not wearing underwear. I walk quickly up the hill, returning with ten pair, black, though not the brand I typically wear. I talk to a short, scrawny, bare-chested man who resembles my boyhood friend Larry R. I tell him to reach for a tree branch as if performing tai chi, and show him how. I don't like him, and there is tension between us. I talk with a burly, pitted-face assassin who is wearing a suit and holding a balled pair of black socks in one hand. He's threatening. There is tension between us. The scene changes. Actor Paul Newman lies in a queen sized bed with an old man, who he asks to guard his .45 pistol. Newman hands the gun to the old man, tells him to put it under the covers near his foot. The old man takes the gun but is careless. Where did it go? Paul Newman looks under the covers, then the two men wrestle for control. They become entangled. At one point Paul Newman's head is caught provocatively between the old man's legs. After Newman recovers the weapon, two beautiful, young lesbians, wearing sport bras and panties, lie down in the bed and make out. Paul Newman reaches around the woman nearest him and begins to finger her vagina. The entire scene is a movie being filmed. When the action is stopped, Newman continues to finger the woman. The three of them enjoy the foreplay."
"0158"	"(2016-12-19)"	"I'm in my second floor apartment on Longborn Street in the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012. My father is in the narrow stairwell, handing me clothes, telling me what to do. He's worried, anxious. I say to him, ""Don't bother me. I'm just putting away clothes."" He saunters off. I don't care if he's hurt. I realize that's how it's done; speak your feelings in the moment. Don't hold them inside. In the background, I hear my mother arguing."
"0159"	"(2016-12-21)"	"I'm at an office in the town I lived in from 1982 to 1984, speaking with a medical doctor about new medical records that I've obtained. I want to file them with my existing records and ask another doctor how that's done. He doesn't know, but asks me questions: What category would the records be filed under? What last name? Was I in the military? In another office, I speak with an older Italian female clerk. She's puzzled by my query. Finally, I ask her where is the main hospital located in the town. The Italian woman says she doesn't know. I look it up on my cell phone. It's one or two miles away from here heading west."
"0160"	"(2016-12-21)"	"On a bright sunny day, I walk with my dog along a wide, hilly corridor of grassy land bordering a highway. I pass oak trees cut and stripped to six feet high for no apparent reason. Suddenly, in the distance, I see enormous amber colored buttes that reach into the sky. ""Wow,"" I say. A hundred yards to the right, in a thicketed tree line, a man calls to his friend, ""There's a UFO in here!"" His friend emerges from the nearby woods. But where is my dog? ""Rusty...Rusty,"" I call to her. Is she lost? Ten minutes later she emerges from a straw covered marsh, frisky, wagging her tail. The two men are approaching. I want to leave."
"0161"	"(2016-12-22)"	"With several friends, I'm watching hawks ride the thermals. Suddenly the great birds shift their bodies, tilt back until upright, like the eagles on the reverse side of Washington quarters. I say to my friends, ""Look, it's like they're hovering."" There is something about these two hawks; they have intelligence. I fly up towards them, but the hawks, hovering in the clouds, or vertically flying fast, stay out of reach."
"0162"	"(2016-12-23)"	"I'm walking up a pitch-black stairwell with my brother, who's drunk or very sad. It's nearly impossible to see where we're going. From the top of the stairs, pounding music blasts from an open apartment door. It's dark inside but light escapes from beneath the closed bathroom door. I knock on the walls several times. I yell, ""Hello...anyone home?"" But my voice is weak; I'm unable to talk loud. A young tenant, who resembles computer expert Edward Snowden, opens the bathroom door. I say, ""Turn it down, man."" He's friendly, obliging. ""OK. Sure,"" he says. My brother and I leave and walk to my apartment. When we arrive I say, ""Karen (my former girlfriend), I just want you to know that I love you."""
"0163"	"(2016-12-24)"	"It's night. From the bottom of a hill I'm crawling up a narrow spiral tunnel. My coat and canteen continually snag on the hard dirt walls. I'm frustrated and get lost. Crawling backwards, containing my fear, I decide to descend. When I emerge in the dark, I run down from the hilltop. Two young women I know, a blond and brunette, are waiting. The blond woman wears a full- length denim jacket with many zippers. I say, ""Just like Michael Jackson."" I say, ""Guess who I have a date with?"" The women are excited, curious to know who it is. I tell them, ""Melinda,"" my Honduran friend."
"0164"	"(2016-12-26)"	"It's night. I'm in a road tunnel, standing behind a curve in the wall, shooting an automatic weapon at someone fifty meters away. I aim the bullets at the road, hoping the ricochets will hit them. They return fire. I hear roaring gun shots, see flashes of light. I have endless ammo but can't see my targets. In the darkness, I shoot at people running past. The scene changes. In my darkened bedroom, I mount from behind and make love to a large shapeless creature, a body of black jelly, male or female, I can't tell. I talk to it, tell it my desires."
"0165"	"(2016-12-26)"	"I'm a guest in a house with three gay men. They've just redecorated the bedroom where I'm to sleep. The once bare floor is covered in yellow fabric that blankets the walls half way to the ceiling. The bed has been pulled away from the back wall, not flush, as it was before. A Siberian husky sleeps beneath a cubby-like shelf. Sitting on the bed, talking with someone, I reach awkwardly back to pet the dog; it prefers to be let alone. A man across from me watches as I undress in the dark, struggling to pull my pants off, which continually catch at my ankles. In the next room, a smiling Japanese girl with a black stick-like prosthetic arm shows me a primitive drawing she's made. With effort, I tell her it's good. Her proud mother and sister show me a device the girl uses to assist her. I say, ""Oh, it can project."" Too late, I realize that's not what it's for."
"0166"	"(2016-12-26)"	"An old ex-convict has an influence over me. When asked to write down my social security number, at first I refuse. Ultimately, the first digit I write down is false. Very slowly, I say, ""I'm not sure why, but it's connected to you."""

I wake up in the living room of our neighbors (Mr. and Mrs. M, when I was a boy) in their house at 55 Birch Street; several people are perched on stools or sit on chairs. Carefully, I try but can't see past the long curtains of the front window into the lamp lit street. A car pulls up. I step back, walk near Mrs. M and say, ""I couldn't sleep past 4 a.m."" She replies, ""I always go to sleep by ten."" Outside, several people, formally dressed, walk by, to a party or gathering. I say to Mrs. M, ""It went by so fast."" I'm thinking of our lives, how they're coming to an end."
"0168"	"(2016-12-27)"	"It's night. My friend Walter from Vietnam days and I are sleeping in a tent in the jungle. With a flashlight beneath the blanket, I read long thin strips of paper, the words a mix of English and phonetic Chinese. I'm concerned about the light. I turn it off so the North Vietnamese soldiers won't see it. The scene changes. Walter and I are in my bedroom. Someone knocks at the door. I have fear. I say, ""Don't answer it, Walter. Wait till I get my gun."" I search in the bureau for my forty-five pistol. Where is it? Who's at the door, friend or foe?"

"0170"	"(2016-12-29)"	"I'm in a very large classroom, much like school I attended for fourth grade in Resort Town in 1959. At the blackboard, the male teacher, who wears a suit and tie, outlines his lesson, A...B...C...D with a piece of chalk. All the students obediently take notes. After a time, I have to pee. I get up from my chair, leave the classroom, walk down the old stairwell. But where is the bathroom? Seeing that I'm unsure where to go, a teacher points to a floor number above an exit. ""It's easy,"" he says, in a gently mocking tone. Outside, in the large schoolyard, spaced several meters apart, I see four or five urinals, each with a raised stepping stone directly in front of it. But I'm barefoot, and each stone that I walk past is wet with urine. Finally, I stand behind one stone and pee. To my great surprise, the stream is powerful, and several feet long."
"0171"	"(2016-12-30)"	"I'm standing alone in a large familiar room rented to hold a dance, which appears to be ending. As people depart, a short, brown-haired, boyish looking man, wearing a suit and tie, grabs my arm and tries to hustle me out. I push back, grab his neck, thoroughly rough him up. The boyish man begins to cry. I walk him to a corner and ask, ""What were you trying to do?"" I tell him I think he wanted me out because I frighten people. I tell him it's true. I've been to war. I frighten people. I tell him that's what he's not saying, but I've heard it many times. At first, I was angry at him, but now I'm not. As I walk toward a group of people a wolf attacks and tries to bite me, to drag me down. I have no fear and fight back, punching the wolf as it bares its teeth, grabbing its snout, banging its head and body against a wall. Afterward, I rejoin some people at a crowded bar. ""Do you have my check?"" I ask someone I know. ""Quite a night, huh?"" I say to someone who helped me, who was also attacked."
"0172"	"(2016-12-31)"	"While reading a magazine at an airport, I strike up a conversation with a familiar looking man. He's bald, with a wide oval face, broad forehead, high cheekbones, a narrow angular chin. Though not conventionally attractive, there is something appealing about his plain Midwestern looks. In fact, his photos are in the magazine. I wonder about his lack of hair, the tell-tale ripples that cover his scalp. Jokingly, I ask if the baldness is fake, a form of Hollywood make-up. But no, he says, that's him. ""Why haven't I heard of you before?"" I ask. The bald man begins to tell me his life story. In addition to modeling, he makes money stripping. I wonder if he's gay. If he's hitting on me. How can I help this man? I tell him I could mention him on my website, though only a few hundred people would see it. ""What with the economy the way it is, that would be very good,"" he says. He's desperate. It shows in his face and voice. As he continues talking, I check my watch. I don't want to miss my plane."
"0173"	"(2017-01-01)"	"I'm the teenage friend of a short scrawny black youth. We meet at a vacant city lot, our usual rendezvous, hoping to find our way into a nearby strip show, but today the usual route is blocked. Construction workers have built a beam too high; we can't climb to the roof. The black teen says it doesn't matter. From a car accident, he has titanium in his skull, arms and legs. But he's afraid of being caught. People will kill him for the metal if they know it's inside him. Instead, he takes me to a dungeon-like basement where he works. The next time I see him, a wide black leather band encircles his chest. He says he's busy now, setting bones in place, and keeps walking. An old, heavy-set black man ambles up to me. He asks what I'm doing here. I tell him I'm just about to put on my clothes and leave. Outside, on a hill overlooking a large field of dry grass, a young white man yells at his tan dog to obey his commands. After putting its paws on the man's head, the dog whimpers. I say, ""I don't need to see this,"" and walk away. Back at the city lot, I meet a group of happy black kids, mostly boys. Taking their hands, I run across the grassy field, challenging them to keep up. A belligerent boy, tall and thin. with long skinny legs and large spiteful eyes, stares at me. ""Oh yeah?"" he says, and easily sprints ahead."
"0174"	"(2017-01-02)"	"I'm with my former girlfriend Karen at a college cafeteria. I tell the cashier, a medical doctor, ""I want a carton of eggs."" ""What do you mean?"" he asks. I tell him, ""I want fresh eggs. I've done this before."" He asks how I want them cooked. ""You don't understand. I want eggs in a carton to take to my room."" The doctor puts his hand to his chin, looks up, turns his head, as if thinking the matter through. I tell Karen, ""I've stumped a doctor."" A person nearby says the doctor is very bright, very busy, and known to be rude. In fact, he's been disciplined for rudeness. At first surprised, I understand the doctor has played a joke on me. If a hearing is held, I will press charges against him."
"0175"	"(2017-01-02)"	"In a forest, with my mother and brother, I'm holding a small white dog or seal pup with the face of a Labrador Retriever. We're standing in the rain, impatient for someone we know to bound up the beige colored trail, smooth and hard packed, as if for a movie. I say, ""They did that. The water isn't pooling. It's flooding the path."" When the person appears and heads toward us, I say, ""He's going to slip and fall...now."" But the person does not fall, and the four of us run in the rain up a hill toward a shelter. Reaching a patch of dry, bleached earth, I set the animal down to walk on it's own. But the animal, sick, or weak, or afraid, does not move; after cries and whimpers, it talks to me. With deep feeling I say, ""I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. What can I do?"" The animal says to be gentle. I've handled it without care."
"0176"	"(2017-01-02)"	"I'm sitting in an aisle seat in a small darkened and nearly empty theater. My left knee juts into the aisle, but not too far. On the screen, a clever cartoon parodies cartoons. I comment aloud on how funny it is. In the first scene of the feature film, a mock musical, young men and women dressed in costumes similar to the film ""Grease"" walk from a baseball infield, which is painted on the floor, to a facsimile dug out. The young women wear pink dresses. ""I get it,"" I say, ""It's roller baseball."" As the movie unfolds, a woman asks to sit in my aisle. Raising up to let her pass, I see that the theater is nearly full, and that a young woman is beside me. ""You were sitting here all this time,"" I say to her. She says yes, and describes the noises and gestures I have made while watching the cartoon and movie. The people behind us, mostly young women, watch and listen as we talk. The woman next to me, who is thin, with luxurious brown hair, is not particularly attractive, but she is happy, vibrant, sincere, qualities which make her quite appealing. I'm aware that our voices might disturb the audience; I imagine a confrontation. I turn around, and begin to yell, ""Gun...gun!"" and shoot the man who has tapped me on the shoulder to be quiet. The audience stampedes. I lay down in the aisle, playing wounded or dead. But someone who has witnessed the event may decide to shoot me. Better to shoot the man and continue talking to the woman, as the movie continues uninterrupted."
"0177"	"(2017-01-03)"	"A grim army slogs through Sycamore Hill Park, which is covered in two feet of snow. At first we march down a path of thick frozen ice, but the path becomes a small canal of clear icy water. Trudging through it, I look ahead and say to myself, ""Get used to it. This is winter in the North."" The scene changes. I'm inside an enormous hollowed out log with several men in costumes and made up to look like cavemen or savages, but who talk and act normally. As the log slides forward it creates a walkable path through the thick ice and snow. When the log comes to a stop, we're covered in mud. A man says to get out."
"0178"	"(2017-01-04)"	"While riding up an escalator in a busy department store I see Justina, pretty, carefree, she waves hello; approaching to talk, she looks at my forehead. ""Do you have baby stains?"" she asks. What does she mean? Bird droppings? My own excrement, or that of someone else? As J smiles, I behold the elegant halo of her curly brown hair, the allure of her clear almond eyes, her maiden-like skin and lips. By the tone of her voice, the touch of her hand, she is radiant, loving and maternal as she dabs away the thing upon me."
"0179"	"(2017-01-05)"	"In broad daylight, in a residential neighborhood, two criminal gangs are shooting it out. I watch as a hooded man enters a house, looks out the front window, wondering where his foes are. In the stillness, a shot rings out, hitting the man in the chest or gut. Moments after he falls to the ground, a truck smashes into the room, crushing him. Two large hillbillies, wearing jeans and sweat shirts, emerge from the truck to look for the body. Deep in a pile of dry leaves, I lie on my back, hoping they won't see or hear me."
"0180"	"(2017-01-05)"	"I've turned off a wearable blood monitor. My cell phones rings. It's L the receptionist at the VA clinic in the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012. ""Have you been using your blood monitor?"" she asks. ""No. I had it turned off,"" and I tell her the reason. ""I'll be turning it on soon."" I say these things aloud, while sleeping."
"0181"	"(2017-01-05)"	"I'm at a museum with a Chinese woman. We're admiring a beautiful red and green abstract painting. She asks me what it's about. I tell her the subject is Quan Yin, and that many people misunderstand her, thinking she is... ""...Old,"" says the Chinese woman. ""But she's not old,"" I say. ""She's infinite."" Upon reflection I say, ""And old, too."" The Chinese woman smiles. All these things I say aloud upon waking."
"0182"	"(2017-01-05)"	"At the last stop I get off a large black city bus, walk around it, and witness a curious site. A young woman, somewhat flat-chested, similar to last night's waitress, reunites with two children, who emerge from the forest. They've broken free from their captor, who staggers about. The tearful woman embraces the children, kisses them. I imagine kissing this woman; despite her small breasts, she's caring and strong."
"0183"	"(2017-01-06)"	"I'm at a hectic big-city subway stop. Latino and Asian imposters, dressed as electrical workers, have surrounded the token booth and turnstiles with a chain link fence. To enter, they charge passengers three dollars cash, making money hand over fist. Angered, I walk up the street, looking for police. I think I've spotted one, but no, it's a man in an Air Force uniform. Heading back to the station, I sense a commotion behind me. I turn around; in the distance, a long fire hose. From its brass nozzle, water streams skyward, up tall buildings, then falls upon me. A policeman arrives and arrests a large rabbit spray-painted blue and red. The frightened animal pleads with the cop, it's done nothing wrong. When the policeman leans close to the rabbit, the rabbit bites his nose."
"0184"	"(2017-01-06)"	"In 18th century England, I'm with another man in a small high ceilinged book shop. Painted clouds and blue sky decorate the tops of each wall. The owner, an elderly man wearing a wig, short pants and waistcoat, declaims about our enemy, the Japanese, who've made a linguistic breakthrough, and they are headed this way. The elderly man becomes unsteady. He speaks gibberish and nearly faints. The other man and I brace him, then decide to locate a room for the next two nights. Afterward, we'll leave the country. We talk with an inn keeper; unsure whether to stay at his lodge, or commute between him and the book shop. There is tension, since the Japanese are coming, and will seek us out."
"0185"	"(2017-01-07)"	"A steam locomotive train, packed with Civil War soldiers, speeds through the countryside. In the summer heat the men have removed their heavy shirts. Packed tightly into the railroad cars, thrilled to be heading home, we ignore the sullen guards posted to each carriage. My friend Walter from Vietnam and I stand together in the front car. As he plays his harmonica, I ask him, ""Why don't you play Camptown Races?"" When Walter begins playing the jongleur's tune, almost immediately the entire train of exhausted filthy men erupts into song. Above their beautiful voices, past the singing clatter of the railroad tracks, the singer and actor Paul Robeson's resolute voice sweetly sings the minstrel tune."
"0186"	"(2017-01-08)"	"I'm in an Army barrack crowded with young recruits, gear and bunks. Everyone watches as I fight with a man who is helpless before me. It's as if I knew karate, judo or kung fu. Each time my opponent tries to hit or grab me, I counter by hitting, or lifting, or throwing him down. ""C'mon, motherfucker,"" I say, ""c'mon,"" as I taunt, and hit and throw him down. The packed barrack is flush with excitement. How long before the sergeant arrives? As my opponent wearies, it seems natural to relent, but instead, I step up the attack, hectoring him with merciless blows, kicks and curses. It's immensely satisfying."
"0187"	"(2017-01-09)"	"I'm one of several passengers in a small plane flying high above the rice paddies. Everyone is excited, nearly festive. From this height, the land has a retro video game quality. It's two dimensions are flat, and composed of hundreds of small colored squares. I lean out the side door window to watch the falling bombs. As the plane speeds forward, the first bombs disappear from view, as if headed off course. They reappear, falling faster, closer to earth, narrowing on their targets. Suddenly, hundreds of bombs begin to explode and the paddies light up like a fireworks display. But instead of bursts of orange flames and black smoke, or circular shock waves and smoke filled craters, on the grid of tiny squares the destruction is simulated in bright pastels of blue and green. Somehow, I hear the shrieks and chaos as the peasants and villages are engulfed in flames. I say, ""I can't look at this,"" and crawl back into the cabin, where the passengers are transfixed by the horrible site. Someone says, ""It's like a giant sequoia."""
"0188"	"(2017-01-09)"	"I'm attending a social function in a large white room. My chest distends in a bulbous mass two feet from my body. My belly has grown grotesquely round and large. Is it weight gain or some insidious disease? I want to know. I don't want to know. [93]"
"0189"	"(2017-01-10)"	"At night in a forest, a soldier on a firebase receives military honors. A clumsy man, he's gotten lost on patrols, but even as he stumbled and fell along forest trails he evaded the enemy. To his credit, he created or discovered something of great military value, and for this he is honored. As the ceremony concludes, the enemy commander, Joseph Stalin, as if in a comic strip, flies directly overhead. With supreme contempt, he fires a burst of energy at our commander, TV host Jimmy Fallon. Ignoring all danger, Stalin flies directly over Jimmy, as if to say, ""You have no idea how advanced we are. You are completely outmatched."""
"0190"	"(2017-01-10)"	"At a party held on a mountain, I'm seated at a table overlooking a wide lush valley. Several available women are present, including Debbie M, a former neighbor on Highland Place, who sits near by. There is an awkward silence between us; I'm avoiding her glance. Instead, I'm completely taken by a captivating woman who resembles Liz L., my first love from long ago. She is lively, carefree; I can't take my eyes off her. And this woman, sitting with a man whom she loves, remarks that whenever they see each other, they have sex. She says this without guilt or conceit. I much admire her for these qualities."
"0191"	"(2017-01-11)"	"It's night. We're being hit by artillery and machine gun fire. Dozens of men, spread out on the ground, hug the earth for cover. Far ahead, a rescue chopper has landed. All around us, the shells explode, white tracers and lightning illuminate the pitch black sky. I'm worried that if I crawl forward I'll be shot in the head. What to do? What? I make up my mind and crawl forward."
"0192"	"(2017-01-11)"	"In a crowded white room many people rise from sleep. We're gathered here to depart for a trip. My brother and an older Asian man with bushy gray hair, possibly by author friend Nguyen, who works at the William Joiner Center, are nearby. They've chosen to be drunk. My brother talks gibberish. The Asian man, pretending to be a mouse, lies curled on the floor and makes squeaking sounds. My mother enters the room. ""Alright, everyone,"" she says, ""I'm going to get clothes. I'll be back in fifteen minutes. Start getting dressed."" I get up and open the draws of a pine bureau. The white towels are in disarray. Try as I might, I can't fold one properly."
"0193"	"(2017-01-12)"	"I join a roomful of soldiers, 25 to 30 years old, who sit around a table discussing each others emotional make up. When it's my turn, a soldier resembling Matt Taibbi sums up my participation in the group. [98] In a friendly but firm manner he says that I never talk about myself. He mentions my remarks on Joe D. [99] It's a friendly group and I don't feel threatened, but my initial reply is sardonic. Waking, I say, ""Well, I think part of it is..."" and I'm aware of my faults the group knows to be true."
"0194"	"(2017-01-12)"	"A young black woman and I discuss how to organize a grass roots movement. In particular, how to speak to crowds at demonstrations. The woman stresses her ideology. ""You have to express your feelings,"" I say to her. ""If it's just the facts, people get bored."" The scene changes. I'm riding with three or four people on a small yellow school bus. I'm aware that an old woman with white hair, petite, thin and fragile, excites me. She has a speech impediment, and seems disabled. We don't speak. After a time the driver pulls to the side of the road. We have to wait, he says. This is a charter bus, and according his contract, during civil rights demonstrations he cannot drive. As he speaks, I point to the passing cars and trucks. I tell him there are no demonstrations, and that not driving makes no sense. The driver exits the vehicle to buy items at a candy store under an elevated subway across the street. I exit the bus, cross the street and peek in the shop window. An attractive woman, wearing a flouncy dress, begins dancing to 1960s pop music with a man in a black suit, white shirt and bow tie. The woman is hectic and ungraceful. Back in the bus, the driver gives a weak excuse for why we can now go on our way. Before he left, I said I would get off and find a local bus, and imagined a long arduous journey."
"0195"	"(2017-01-13)"	"It's daylight. I'm part of an airplane crew testing a new weapon, firing it while on the runway. We're attacked, and the new weapon will not fire. I scramble out of the plane and activate the weapon, yelling into the radio handset, ""Direct fire!...direct fire!"" [100] A sudden bright flash grows increasingly brighter. The weapon is out of control. The intense light sweeps toward us. At any moment we'll be immolated by the intense heat."
"0196"	"(2017-01-13)"	"I begin riding a bicycle around a large circular track, confident that I will overtake the other riders. My cycling is smooth, strong, graceful. However, as we come into the stretch the peleton pulls even further ahead. Cycling off the track, I bike down a steep narrow alley, confident of my skills to avoid danger. At the last second I stop at a blind corner, by inches avoid being hit by a car."
"0197"	"(2017-01-14)"	"At night, on my hands and knees, I crawl up a large dangerous hill composed of ruined buildings made from white bricks. The area has the look and feel of Barrio Casamata. [101] At any moment I may be shot. Exhausted, I reach the summit, roll over the edge to safety, and stand in front of the apartment of Muhammad Ali. Ali opens a glass door and welcomes me inside. I'm bare-chested and fit. The champ, punching a heavy bag, is young, handsome, ebullient. ""Here, I made a drawing for you,"" he says, and hands me a booklet composed of well-drawn simple human figures which convey happiness. As I turn the pages, a picture story unfolds. A man and a woman--my wife and I--are in bed. Ali joins us, followed by his wife. In the final scene, four people, a joyful family, only their heads visible, snuggle beneath the blanket. This is how Ali sees the world."
"0198"	"(2017-01-16)"	"I'm walking down a stairwell in my grammar school, talking to Jay K, suggesting he have his teeth cleaned. [102] Jay asks what's involved. I explain that the dentist will scrape debris from between his teeth, then polish them. Jay asks if that's all that's done. I tell him 'yes' that's it. With anger and contempt Jay says that's good, because a dentist inserted a small lab in his mouth that contained mouthwash, and when it ran dry he had the lab removed. It's then that I realize that a female dentist, while discreetly palming objects in her hand, had done the same procedure on me. When I close my jaws to activate the mouthwash, nothing happens. I'm alarmed that the lab must be removed."
"0199"	"(2017-01-17)"	"In the game room on the top floor of a large school building, I sit on a tall wooden bench reading a book by John Williams. [103] The room has the look and feel of my grammar school's gym. A policeman enters. He seems to recognize me and asks a one word question that's hard to hear. I answer in Spanish, then realize he's asked if I'm from Salem, and answer, ""Si...Si. After the cop leaves I hear the approaching whistle of a train and ask Dave Cline, ""Is that the last train?"" Cline? [104] He say yes, and I race down a stairwell, forgetting my green Army field jacket and book, thinking someone will likely take them. Several times I go up and down the steps, unable to decide whether to catch the train or return for my things. Lost, I walk into another game room where three heavy set young men stand around a pool table playing billiards. I ask one of them for directions to the room I had left."

[105] I push her away and scold her. She's incensed and wants to leave. I tell her, ""It's all about the tease, Phil. It's all about the tease."" Hovering over me in her loose fitting pajamas, she decides to stay. We begin to neck and slip off our clothes. A nurse enters and leaves the room. I ask, ""Do we have privacy?"" Phyllis says no, but at the hospital where she works, in an hour a room will be available. A woman is having an operation there. She's read the plans. Preparing to make love, I kneel behind Phyllis as she presents her derriere. We've abandoned privacy."
"0201"	"(2017-01-19)"	"I'm at a country resort with my family, behind my father as we walk up a crowded trail. He's concerned about debts. I think, ""Oh, please. How old are you, eighty? You're going to die soon."" But I realize it's a matter of dignity. When we reach the main grounds, where many people gather and mill about, my father hands out money. First, to my cousin Marna, a few dollars not covered by the insurance. Next, he fans out $100 dollar bills, and asks, ""Where's Jerry?"" his older brother. As my father walks away a severe looking older black man jokes, ""I thought he would only give Jerry five dollars!"" My mother is concerned about the money she is spending to support the family on this trip. She asks if my brother has left receipts. She asks to see my pocket notebook. Next time, I will lie that I don't have one."

However no one is here, and the tents low roof makes play impossible. ""Is there any open sky?"" Sylvester says yes, and we both run pell-mell through the long pitch-black tent. Then we are lying on the grassy ground; I'm embracing Sylvester, spooning him. Repeatedly I ask, ""What do you want?"" But the question is for me. I want Sylvester to undo my belt, unzip my fly, pull down my pants and stroke me."

[107] Inside a busy supermarket, near the exit, from where I'm standing on a ledge, I easily drop down one story. To break and guide the descent as I slowly fall through the air, I grab the edges of reams of printing paper. Outside, I jump down a large pile of mattresses or similar objects, stepping rapidly from edge to flexible edge. As I descend, a middle-aged woman caught in slow moving traffic stares at my athletic body. I think, ""Good, check me out."" Behind the supermarket, I comb through a pile of rubble. The classified section of a newspaper has an article on Los Desaparecidos but there no text. [108] A body has been found and discreetly removed."

A middle aged couple, educated, accomplished, self important, sit down next to me. The man wears a luxurious dark blue overcoat and black scarf. The woman is fashionably dressed, her hair is formally styled. She reads a magazine article about food and tells her husband the names of restaurants which cook and present meals to her liking. Inadvertently I put the Vietnam profile on the mans swept back and neatly combed hair. Immediately I remove it, but say nothing. I hope he's seen it. I hope he's seen that I'm a Vietnam vet."

But he's letting me hit him."

When the fire is blazing, the signal will be given to sing ""Happy Birthday."" The flames pick up speed and height. They begin to roar, breaking out in small patches of dry grass. At first the people are unsuspecting. Then the fire runs out of control. I begin singing ""Happy Birthday"" but it's too late. In the retreat, the man in charge, who is young, handsome and thin, calmly asks, ""So, what do you think?"" I tell him we should have begun singing sooner."
"0208"	"(2017-01-23)"	"I'm on a firebase that's being attacked. A chopper lands, but it's difficult to scramble aboard. Finally, with other grunts I hop on the trembling bird. The heavy fighting continues. It's like a movie, larger than life. As the bird lifts off I wonder if we'll be shot down. To another grunt I say, ""The last time I flew..."" and tell him it was after an ambush. We lift away."

When she gets up to pee, awkwardly I half grab, half embrace her. ""Oh, C'mon now. You promised,"" she says, and slips away. In her absence I inspect three small jars of food I bought elsewhere. They resemble jars of baby food; each is less than half full. The green soupy contents, similar to pureed peas, are off color. Have the bottles leaked, or been opened, or not sealed properly? I disregard caution and sip from each. I'm thinking, ""What will the girl say if I tell her, 'I don't think this is going to work out.'"""

For World War II, we are pressed up against an earthworks. Just before a shell hits, there is a faint clicking sound. A drop in air pressure. A long thin piece of shrapnel lodges in a makeshift shield I hold in front of me. The same noise and air change precede the second shell. The moments before the blast take forever. The shell explodes to my right. So close I barely hear it. There is a brightness. A soft surrounding thud. I check to see how bad I'm hit."

A couple of doctors are present. As I begin to read, a man asks, ""What book are you reading from?"" Everyone is annoyed; I've already explained my subject and source. I start again, with a dream which has the word Jamestown in its title. Someone comments, and the head doctor gets up and chastises that person. I begin a third time, am interrupted, and this time the doctor throws the offender out. As I start a fourth time, a bespectacled man, a former highschool student named Pat, assisted by a black swagger stick topped with a gold crown ,walks down the aisle toward me, asking an irrelevant question."

Everyone except me wears protective equipment made of banded clear plastic. I argue with the officer in charge, who resembles Vice President Pence. I tell him I will not work without proper clothing, and that changing my uniform will take three hours. I tell him by then the job will be done. The officer listens patiently but insists I obey his orders. As we talk, periodically a man being chased runs by. I say, ""Who was that?"" Finally, I agree to the task, but repeat my demands.

Or they can sit on the floor, upon which she can light candles. Suddenly a stocky young man with thinning blonde hair, scar, and wearing white food service garb, enters the room and rudely criticizes my remarks. We continue talking but he dominates the group, saying we should move the practice from Newark to Chicago. In a stern confident voice I say, ""Hey. Hey. You gotta get out. It's not you. It's me. I'm a bad person. Now get out!"" My former girlfriend Karen and the two other people stare in awe, but I tell them he was taking over. When the stocky man departs the meeting resumes. A moment later a short thin young man with lanky brown hair, and who resembles Jackson Browne appears in the doorway. [109] He's looking for the man I've just kicked out. ""He just left,"" I say. The short man says, ""Thanks,"" and departs. The meeting continues."
"0216"	"(2017-01-29)"	"I'm young, attending a party. An attractive woman is staring at me. I pretend not to notice, and turn my head this way and that, showing off my profile. It's exciting to know that someone is interested in me. In the large slate floor bathroom, which has only one urinal, I look in the mirror. I have blonde hair and blue eyes and resemble Robert Redford. [110] Outside, there is another woman I want to meet. She has long brown hair. She is beautiful and vivacious. In just the right way I tell her why she is irresistible, that I'm in love with her. She feels the same toward me. It's so invigorating to be in love."
"0217"	"(2017-01-30)"	"In the jungle, brightly lit, an elderly professor lectures on political theory and history to a class of earnest students. The professor speaks ardently about his subject. ""Hegemony equals..."" he says. And on and on it goes. I find his talk complicated and boring and fall behind. I take notes but understand little of what they mean. We will have an exam tomorrow. I realize I understand almost nothing of the first half of class. The scene changes. Beautiful and elegant older women, with white hair, and dressed in flowing white evening gowns, have caught their rich husbands in a palatial whore house whose many rooms and corridors are lit with soft florescent light. The women wander from room to room, express their disgust in quick cutting remarks, and walk out."
"0218"	"(2017-01-31)"	"Leah and I are in a bustling European city. [111] War has been declared. In the excited panic we seek shelter, hurrying from one site to the next. Past an enormous tank blocking the street, we enter an old office building. As if nothing matters people come and go. By a stairwell beneath a skylight, a loud falling noise explodes in flame and debris. With two or three people, Leah and I run to the exit, jumping through flames. Since we have nothing to keep warm, I consider running back up the stairs to steal a blanket. Instead, Leah scurries up a high ledge, spreads her arms, then swan dives over a large room, floating gracefully down over the busy office workers. Hoping to be seen, she is also looking for someone, possibly My former girlfriend Karen. Moments before, I had asked Leah, ""Will you marry me?"""
"0219"	"(2017-01-31)"	"I'm at a country retreat, standing on the side of a hilltop large grassy field. Many young men, mostly Asian Indian's, have gathered here to play soccer. I'm a bystander, rejecting myself from joining them. Near me, two brothers, perhaps eight and ten, with pug noises and lofty brows suggesting Irish descent, silently stare at the players, then taut them with clown-like antics. But the young men cannot organize themselves and eventually leave, as do the brothers, who have been flirting with two freckled girls, one of whom says, ""They were so cute, but weird."""
"0220"	"(2017-01-31)"	"I have two hours before class, but is it time enough for breakfast? I walk down from the field to an old wood building that's pleasingly dilapidated, weather beaten, the green paint on the front door curling and flaked. As I walk up the porch steps I grasp a small latch by a window to swing upward, nearly hitting the middle-aged blonde woman behind me. She looks at me strange, her green eyes wide with awe. Upstairs, I sit down at a long wood table; instead of a place setting, a horizontal pile of strawberries and crumpled pancakes. Behind me, a wall mounted flat panel monitor airs a TV show. A handsome young Asian Indian man, whose thick black hair is brushed back, sits down directly across from me. ""Is this how the food is served?"" I ask. He says he doesn't know. We strike up a conversation, which somewhat surprises me. I think, ""So, this is how people meet."" The Indian man talks fervently about the TV show. Have I seen it? No, and he continues, rapidly describing the plot, recent episodes, the current dilemmas. There are legal problems, he says. There is litigation. I listen attentively, but have no idea what he's talking about."
"0221"	"(2017-02-01)"	"In a darkened hotel room with half a dozen strangers, I'm in bed with a woman I do not know. Because the heat is on high I pull down the covers. Waking, the woman scratches her head on her feet. Two people in this small bed make it uncomfortable, so I shift to my side, put my arm around her. When the woman asks what I'm doing, I tell her, and why. I'm aware that another woman is watching us, and that my bare chest is visible. The woman next to me asks about the heat. Can they (hotel staff) turn it off? Will I turn it off? I say nothing; I don't know where the thermostat is located; I don't want to get out of bed. The woman, who is friendly, tells me about herself. She is here with a guest. They've flown down from Cincinnati. She's going to pay for his law degree, which, because of a scholarship, will cost one thousand dollars. In the darkness I wonder if the woman is pretty. When there is light, I turn to look at her. She resembles Debbie, a large anxious girl from grammar school, who wore her chestnut brown hair in a '60s bouffant. This woman is happy. She kisses me on the cheek."

[112] I hold up the phone and say, ""I called you twice."" When I get up to go leave, Greg gives me an angry look. Back in my apartment the bathroom light is on, the water in the sink is running. Who's in there? It's curly haired John from Ft. Devens. [113] He says he has stomach troubles. He has bacteria and diarrhea. But I shouldn't worry, he's been washing his hands. But what has he touched? I don't want his sickness."

"0224"	"(2017-02-04)"	"Before I go upstairs to the apartment on Highland Place, I check the snow covered drive way, where a large pizza is partly buried under snow. I dig it up, to eat later, then go to the front door to walk upstairs. I look into the darkened first floor living room; the apartment door is open. Vladimir, aged two or three, sits on the carpeted floor, wrapped in a blanket, sucking his thumb, staring at the TV. [115]"
"0225"	"(2017-02-04)"	"I'm in a large basement cafeteria. It's spartan, abysmal, empty. The cashier, Paul [116] , stands at a counter top window which is cut into a white wall, and framed by stainless steel. He's set a glass of milk for me as I approach with my food tray. I have ten dollars ready, but someone has left a ten dollar bill at the window. Has the person behind me seen it? Does it belong to them? To someone else? What to do? I take the found bill and hand it to Paul. Eyeing the glass of milk I say, ""Thank you, Paul. Perfect."""
"0226"	"(2017-02-05)"	"I'm in a small rectangular room with five or six people trying out a new game. We're tossing small glass or plastic bell shaped discs like frisbees between opposing teams. But the discs are too small, the field too narrow, the game does not work."
"0227"	"(2017-02-05)"	"Seated in a small but comfortable hotel room, I'm watching a movie on TV. A middle- aged woman sits behind me. Behind her, a very old man with a full head of white hair, who has survived the Holocaust; her father. As he mumbles about the Germans, the camps, the gas, I ask his daughter if he has seen this, and show her a circular white postage stamp bearing the names of concentration camps and nearby towns. The scene changes. I go up to my room; before sitting on the toilet, I close the blinds, so the middle-aged woman won't see me. The bathtub is full of hot clear blue water, which drips from the floor mat draped over the edge of the tub. Stepping into the tub, I lie back in the water, recalling the advice that soaking benefits the mind and body."

My mother needs help running her store. I tell one person I'm in Beverly, and it's too far away. When another person approaches, I pretend I'm sleeping.

The husband hands a hotel concierge wearing a black tuxedo a glass globe mounted on a white base. The objet d'art is from Europe, possibly Austria. The concierge takes it to be appraised. In that moment the husband trusts that it will be returned. When the concierge later returns the globe, he tells the husband it's valued between $1800 and $2000. ""You've done very well,"" he says. After telling his wife that her mother would be proud, the husband wipes his mouth on a white towel, leaving blood in the shape of a bite mark. But this blood and the bite mark are mine."
"0235"	"(2017-02-09)"	"With other adults I walk to a meeting at a spacious high school. I don't have the white sailor cap with black letters that everyone else wears, and would feel foolish wearing it. Even so, as we walk down a dim narrow stair case I ask black man wearing a blue jacket and tie for one of the hats. He doesn't hear me; I feel hurt. As we walk, I imagine students loitering in the bathroom, making it unsafe to use. Finally, we reach the area where the meeting will be held. Looking out from a stairway, at a small plaza, seated in brown leather upholstered chairs, I see my mother and her friends, here for the event. I walk over to my mother and ask if she would like to join us. She says no, it's more comfortable where she is. I say, ""That's what I thought,"" and return to my friends. Among them is Bruce, an enthusiastic black youth from my high school fencing team."

I think, ""I want to make love to her."" As I get into the front seat of the car, a heavy set dark-haired woman in the vehicle next to us leans forward as she adjusts her seat belt. Her blouse opens but I turn away. As we pull out of the parking lot the driver asks if it's safe to turn. I tell him, ""I can't see, Frank. The angle is strange."" The driver is Al Pacino in his role as Frank Serpico. [121] Someone gives the all clear sign; we drive away."

[122] He's younger, handsomer, his hair is stylishly cut. I shake his hand and say hello. It's really him, kind unassuming Dan. I sit next to a young woman whose hair is cut short like a soldier or Buddhist monk. As we talk, an older woman comes at me with a three bladed weapon, a sort of fencing pitch fork. It's lethal; she means to impale me. Afterward, as I resume talking with the first woman, she relates surprise at the older woman's prowess. ""She was a gym teacher,"" I say. The young woman sighs, ""Ohhhh..."" Seeing that she understands, I say, ""Now it all makes sense."""
"0241"	"(2017-02-14)"	"I'm a medic in a war zone hospital, where a team of war weary doctors will euthanize a severely wounded man who lies an operating table unconscious. At a signal, the lead doctor will plunge a screw driver or similar implement into the dying man's chest. A diagram, similar to a football field playbook, will guide him to the fatal spot. As the doctor raises the implement over his head, he looks to me and asks if I'm ready to watch. At the last second I shut my eyes and cover my ears, but in the eye of my mind I see and feel the killing thrust, the spattering blood, and horrified, bolt awake."

At first all goes well, but the stocky, round-faced, balding vet suddenly ducks past the salesman to get at the office records. The salesman and the secretary, caught off guard, are stunned; both exclaim, ""Whoa!"" I intervene, attempt to calm the vet down, but the salesman hands me a sheet of paper. He tells me that like the vet, I'm unwanted here. Banned. I try to read the dialogue on the typed page but have trouble reading it. The situation nears a tipping point."

At first it's simply small talk, but I like this girl. The scene changes. We're in my bedroom in the house by Seton Hall, laying on the bed, talking. [126] I ask the girl her name. ""Ruanne,"" she says, but I don't quite hear it, and ask her to say it again. Afterward, I ask her what Liz has said about me. ""That you fucked her,"" she says. We continue talking, but during a lull I draw close to her, we kiss, I mount her. As we make love, smiling like Liz, who she so much resembles with her long chestnut blonde hair and alluring features, Ruanne says, ""You're crazy."" It's because while I'm inside her, I have one finger in her bottom, and another diddling her vagina. As in life, I can't believe I'm inside this beautiful girl."

I have a club or police baton and repeatedly try to hit the man in front of me, but can't manage to correctly swing and strike him. The scene changes. With several strangers I'm in the stark white painted hallway of a house or apartment building. The police or army arrive and with guns drawn are commanded to fire at will. Like the strangers I'm with, who are one dimensional and solid black, I throw myself on the floor and keep entirely still. As the armed men swarm, someone screams, ""Don't shoot! Don't shoot!"""

"0248"	"(2017-02-20)"	"Two men, the size of children, circle and dodge inside a fight cage, each wary of the others power. The crowd becomes impatient. The scene changes. I'm at my apartment in the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012. My mother has re-arranged all the clothes in the bedroom walk-in closet. In place of my five identical blue shirts and equal number of tan pants there are dozens of colorful shirts from my adolescence. On the wall, she has hung her dresses and bras. Seeing the shirts, I say, ""What! I haven't worn those in years,"" and begin taking them down. Next, removing my mother's clothes from the wall I think, Her breasts were inside these bras, but this doesn't excite me."
"0249"	"(2017-02-21)"	"I'm in a town similar to Blangkejeren in Northern Sumatra. The buildings are simple one and two story wood structures; the streets are wide and uncrowded. There's a crime underway. A group of young people run for cover while a sniper fires hundreds of BBs at them. I watch as a dozen fleeing youth, entering a narrow alley, buckle and fall when hundreds of metal pellets shower down, wounding them. I run down a wide street, completely exposed, passing a truck selling WWII surplus green canvas pouches. Seeking shelter, I burst into a ramshackle house, where Maryann Paul [129] is a therapist. When she invites me into her office, I tell her, ""I have to take a leak,"" and ask where is the bathroom. Maryann says it's down the hall. She says she has to leave but another therapist will see me at 2:30 p.m. At that, she introduces me to a young and good- looking petite brunette with a ponytail. On the way to the bathroom, thinking of this girl, I say, ""This is good."" In the bathroom there is feces in the toilet. Seeing this, I think, Offer someone a place to shit and this is what they do."

My friend and fellow Vietnam vet Edward selects one among the many pastel colored packets on a vertical display rack. Afterward, I ask to see what he's purchased. I'm wondering, 'How can this be a wall calendar, it's too small for that?' In fact, the calendar consists of square numbered sheets, one for each day of the year, all hand made, of high quality, as is the artisanal cardboard box. I turn to Edward and ask him about the source of the materials, hoping they don't pollute. An individual resembling Ernest Hemingway, who misconstrues my question, says the calendar merchant is a pilot. He says the government has investigated him over the calendars, and that as a result he has nightmares. I ask if the pilot has sought treatment, a cure for his poor sleep. I sincerely want to help him, this man who does not at all look deeply upset."
"0251"	"(2017-02-25)"	"While walking in a semi-forested area I meet 12 year old Michael M. He's with a nerdy young Englishman with a school boys haircut, and wearing gold colored corduroy pants. At first I prefer to walk alone, even when invited to Mike's house. However we meet again, the three of us now walking through woodland that's oddly sparse, not thickly populated, like a real forest. As we go deeper into the woods, I've never to this part before, a quiet Asian girl with exotic hazel eyes, joins us. Now, in place of dirt paths there are cracked, broken and crumbling sidewalks; the ground is littered with trash. In the distance, an old apartment building in a shabby neighborhood, where young people congregate. Fifty meters to our right, several young people with a pit bull loiter and chat. There's something ominous here; while Mike and his friend are intrigued, the girl and I enter an abandoned house. I'm tempted to take advantage of this plain looking girl who is fearful, unsure of herself, but my role is to protect her. She looks left and right, debating to herself what to do, her entrancing eyes, like those in a dolls head, shiny and clear. Finally, she steps sideways to the door and is gone."

[131] At the last minute I realize that he's thrown the frisbee, which flies toward me low and perfectly straight. I catch the flying disc, and trot a few steps forward. As L's team run down the field I rush forward, staggering bursts of speed. Nearing the goal I look back. My opponents are nowhere near me. They must be thinking they've never witnessed anything like what I have done."
"0253"	"(2017-02-27)"	"With Robert M and two other men I'm attempting to find a way up a small steep ledge that borders a ranch-like house. There is nothing to grab onto, nothing to push off. After Robert figures a way up, it's my turn. As I struggle to reach the top he offers to help, and twice, firmly, I tell him no, stop, get away, until reluctantly he does so. Wanting to do this on my own, without help, I tell him, ""It's the only way to feel pain."" When the third man has clambered over the ledge, we enter a large modern office building. Robert and I walk down a long narrow corridor filled with sunlight. It's busy here, much construction is underway. ""Do you know where there's an empty office?"" I ask Robert. He says ""yes"", and we arrive at a door resembling a bank safe, which is surrounded by wood or cardboard boxes. A thin young doctor seeks to help Robert open the door, but I shoo him away. The scene changes. We enter a busy office, where a pretty girl with a beehive hairdo, apparently in charge, works in back. She doesn't interest me, and I'm certainly not her type. Abruptly, we leave. On the way out, a short pudgy woman stops me at the door. ""You were trying to steal something, weren't you?"" she says accusatively. Is she serious, or flirting? Since she doesn't believe me when I say ""no"" I telephone her boss. ""OK,"" I tell him, I'll take (steal) three dollars."" We walk past the accusative woman; once outside, in a small grassy valley, bordered by tall rocky cliffs, someone's phone rings. It's a dark blonde woman with all American looks, who I'd seen at the office. ""OK, you can kiss me,"" she says, in reply to my wanting to meet her. John W [132] and Robert fumble about, but I need to go back to the building. I really want to meet this girl."

In darkness, immediately I become lost in a maze of high walls of impenetrable tree bark. I press my hand to the coarse wall, attempting to keep to one direction, but it's hopeless. Even with the bit of intense light, I'm hopelessly lost."
"0256"	"(2017-03-02)"	"At Su Casa, I leave the main building and walk to a deserted wood which no one else knows or cares about. [134] Past an old chain-link fence, an abandoned road made of large flat stones spaced apart like railroad tracks. I jump the fence, walk down the road, and come upon an Appalachian-like neighborhood, a lost world of crowded wood shacks, hundreds of old junked cars. I imagine the people living here prefer their ornately weathered derelict homes to modern prefab apartments, so identically dull and drab compared to the outlandish wear and tear, the jury- rigged nature of these tragically beautiful run down shacks. In truth, this is the silent face of abject poverty that stubbornly declares to visitors, ""Keep out."" I crawl through a shack's first floor window. It's huge inside, each room filled with hundreds of collected objects, all neatly arranged on shelves. Kitchen appliances, stuffed animals, clothing, shoes, tools etc. are everywhere. In a bathroom, I meet a pretty girl. Drunk or waking, she is happy and affectionate toward me. At first quietly, so as not to wake the inhabitants, who must be asleep upstairs, I continue walking from one room to room, looking at hundreds of objects. Gradually I become noisy, then lost. Retracing my steps, I still can't find my way out. Finally I succeed, but at the wrong end of the street. I'm completely lost. I'll hail a cab, but at first can't recall the name of the resort where I'm staying. Back at Su Casa, it's dark. I'm alone, standing near a palm tree. Knowing three girls are nearby I remove my black long underwear. Seeking to return to my room, I walk up the wrong hill, which is thickly wooded and soggy. Other people behind me have made the same mistake. At last, I see the lights and low flat roof of the motel-like building where my room is located."

When the sergeant begins to question him, the recruit wallops the sergeant's ear, and he drops to the ground unconscious. The shocked trainees stare in disbelief as the recruit repeatedly stomps his heavy boot to sergeants head. MP's arrive, arrest the attacker, drag him to a jail cell, beat him. The prisoner recruit says this only makes him stronger. A commanding general orders the recruit to be tormented by waking him every hour, dousing him with cold water, stunning him with a cattle prod, and eventually, killing him."

I tell him that writing down his experiences will ease his tension. I tell him that his writing, informed by his character, will make a favorable impression. When I tell him these things, he shuts his eyes; his face almost literally goes blank. Is he crying? Holding back his emotions?"
"0259"	"(2017-03-03)"	"I'm in an enormous building, a sort of jail, with walls painted aquamarine. I leave my cell and walk about. Looking up at the next tier, I see young men and women being coached to play volley ball or a similar game. If the coach, a very large man, sees me and asks me to join them, I'll walk away. I watch a nearby group of teens, waiting to play, wonder what to do. They adhere to group norms: they have one leader, many followers; all wear jeans and sport unruly hair. I walk to very large round room with a tiled floor similar to the surface surrounding indoor swimming pools. At one end, a small chrome plated fountain pulses clear water. In my stocking feet I mimic ice skating on the slanted tiles. Sitting off to the side, a glum man watches me coast and turn about. Afterward, I walk past him to what looks like a small shop. In the small curtained display window a very short black mustachioed man, of Indian descent, with an enormous head like a fireplug, lies on his back. Is he sleeping? He's dead, lying in state in a small casket, a garland of flowers encircles his neck. I stare at his blackening face, at the crystalline wound on his embalmed cheek, at his shiny preserved facial skin, then leave."
"0260"	"(2017-03-04)"	"I meet a man in New York who resembles the young David R. [135] He is tall, slender, with fine black hair and Middle East features. We walk to his building, which has a large red awning; upon it, the name ""Pirro"" is lettered in white. In his studio apartment we sit and talk. This man is kind, knowledgeable, caring. I tell him his studio is similar to David P's, and describe the single oblong room, the small bed against the wall, the flat screen TV mounted near the window. [136] Afterward, as I walk down the street, I open the envelope he had given me. It contains a half dozen certificates which I mistake for one hundred dollar bills. In fact, they're savings bonds in amounts from one hundred to fifteen hundred dollars. He has also gifted me a small construction helmet, imprinted with bonds. I'll give these to a child. The scene changes. I encounter a large group of tourists who are encouraged to enter a large raised platform, gated by a surrounding wood banister. Here, they will be seated and entertained. As the tourists enter, I hesitate, I don't want to be penned in; I may have to pee. But there are empty seats and I enter the platform. Later, I encounter a large field and a performance sponsored by a New York man, apparently a mystic. Lined up in front of the audience, who sit on the bare ground, itself regulated by a strict grid, a dozen dark complected musicians, who appear to be Hispanic. Behind the audience, thirty yards away, several devotees of the mystic occupy a large tent. In front of the open tent, I talk with a devotee who seems in charge. Wearing a turban and billowy white clothes, he speaks in riddles. Periodically he kisses me. At other moments, just when he comes near, time snaps forward. When I ask about that, he responds cryptically, to which I reply, ""That's like having oral sex with a tooth brush."" He laughs, which makes him human."
"0261"	"(2017-03-05)"	"I arrive in England and stay at the quaint brick house of Levin D, where people have gathered. [137] Something has take place. There are wood boxes full of 7.62 mm bullets and ammo clips. There are old small caliber unjacketed rounds. Several children play with the ammo. In a corner, I see Levin's wife, once glamorous, now older, matronly, and wearing a Jackie Kennedy veiled hat over a frumpy hairdo. I walk to her but at first she doesn't recognize me. ""Oh, hey,"" she says, and begins to ask what happened; it's clear Levin is dead. ""But we'll get to that,"" I say. ""How are you?"" She comes close, unable to speak, clearly wanting to be embraced. I hold her in my arms, imagine being overcome by lust. Quietly, I pat her back. Outside, as we sit on a brick stoop, she says, ""Here we use the word 'kanad' for man. I say, ""It's such an old word."" From where we sit, we view the massive chimney of the house, which is half blown apart. I've read or heard that Levin had placed an AK47 inside it."
"0262"	"(2017-03-05)"	"There are ghosts in this room, angry and spiteful, but I'm unafraid. Instead, I assail each with words. ""What are you? What have you made of your life? You whore! You bitch!"""
"0263"	"(2017-03-06)"	"In the Canadian wilderness, I'm with two women in a large log cabin. It's very cold outside. Suddenly, a polar bear tries to enter the cabin through the fire place. No one panics. Instead, one of the women aims a vacuum cleaner to fan the embers. The white sparks, blue flames and high heat kill the groaning bear, or cause it to leave. The crises ended, I walk from room to room, looking for a place to pee. My plan is to urinate into a wood bedframe, but instead I find a toilet. One of the women says the Park Service had closed all the cabins but recently re-opened them for public use."
"0264"	"(2017-03-06)"	"A pretty young woman is standing outside two of the log cabins from the previous dream. I ask her a question, we strike up a conversation, soon we are lying on the ground, the woman stroking my arm. I tell her that's very nice. We talk a bit more, I embrace her, holding her close. After a third variation of the dream, I wake, saying, ""I don't recall those details, sweetie, but I'm going to write the others down."""
"0265"	"(2017-03-06)"	"At my old high school, I walk past a thin ornery student standing by a running track, who purposely swings a thin baseball bat, nearly hitting me. In denial of what has happened, I continue walking and enter the school. Once inside, I have fear, and want to press against the door to prevent the ornery student from walking up behind me. However a tall athletic and confident student enters, and strides past me. Dressed in jeans and my blue sweat shirt, I walk to class. Who cares what the staff or students may think. [138] Before entering the room, I peer though the doors small vertical window and recognize several students. The small class will be lead by Mr. Catello, the short balding middle-aged authoritarian music teacher. Where is my notebook? I don't care. As I walk to my seat, Bobby G asks if Steve S is attending classes. [139] I tell him I don't see why not."
"0266"	"(2017-03-08)"	"Arms folded across my chest, I'm standing off to one side in a large darkened auditorium. Musicians or actors span the stage, but I'm hoping the girls on my left will notice me. What's this underfoot? A cross between a skateboard and a horseshoe crab, as the girls titter, I try without success to kick it away. I know that this board, this thing, has life, and slowly, as I stand upon it, it raises off the cement floor, hovers, and Segway-like moves in the direction I tilt or lean. Soon, I'm skyward, speeding through brambles, which I duck or push away, then flying in open space, the clouds below, the horizon before me. Holding my arms up like a champion, I say, ""Look, everyone! Look! I'm flying!"" I'm aware that certain places are better to pass through than others. At an airport or shopping mall, after hovering in a wide-open space, I touch down. A short thin man or woman, a sort of trickster figure, nags me from behind. Whenever I try to hit, or pin and crush this figure against a wall, it cleverly defeats me. The scene changes. With three crones, I'm sitting high up on a white shelf, braced to a white wall, overlooking the malls open space ahead and below. Each crone wears an ornate disguise, a mask cleverly handmade of cloth and fabric and knitted yarn, that fits snugly over the head. ""What are you?"" I ask one woman. ""A fox,"" she says. And it's true. Her mask has a vulpine snout and ears. ""And you?"" I ask a woman who resembles the salesgirl at a local grocery store, and who in life resembles actress Diane Keaton. ""A cucumber,"" she says. ""Oh, you don't look like a cucumber,"" I reply."
"0267"	"(2017-03-10)"	"I'm with Leah. In broad daylight we run from Judy, her angry girlfriend. Neither of us is scared. In fact, this is fun. Like parkour athletes, we clamber up a tall chain link fence, jump down, about ten feet. I land hard on one leg, injuring it, but I tell myself it can't be that bad. I have pain, but keep running. We enter the basement floor of a large Spartan house. To hide, I duck into a small cement room, where a folded piece of canvas hangs loosely in the door's empty window. Slight breezes let bright sunlight enter at the fabric's edge. Leah joins other people in the next room, a cavernous dark hall, who also hide from Judy. I see Judy run past, filled with rage, looking for Leah and me. Will I fight with her if she finds me? I know that Leah is safe. Judy returns, going the other way, then she is gone. I walk to the room where Leah is hiding. Someone asks if we'd like something to eat. I think, Yes, I really want a cheeseburger."
"0268"	"(2017-03-12)"	"I'm with another man who I seem to know, a lanky and lighthearted, friendly and intelligent man, with a father-like bearing, who wears spectacles and parts his hair high on one side. In tandem, a few meters apart, we're bicycling on a highway. As we near the city, he seeks to pass me. I pedal faster, almost maniacally, and speed ahead. There is the airport. Viewed from behind, there are the large planes, parked in a row that borders the highway, their enormous tail fins, like monuments, arching into the sky. But is this Newark airport or JFK? I need to know how to get to New York."
"0269"	"(2017-03-12)"	"It's morning. A bright sunny day. Vendors arrive at fairground that resembles the city park where I live. Most have unloaded large boxes and containers of used clothing, books, appliances. I go up and down a row of sellers, looking at whatever items are on display. Many people arrive, as if headed to work. A haggard and frantic middle-aged woman, wearing a cloth coat with a fur collar, runs up to and past me. It's as if she stepped out of a Degas painting. ""T"", she shouts, raising up both her arms. Other people join in. ""T...T...,"" they are shouting (i.e., the city's word for ""subway""). In the distance, the train station."
"0270"	"(2017-03-14)"	"I'm in my grandparent's apartment on her street in a NJ city. A writer's group is just concluding; everyone stays the night. My Aunt Annie, a favorite of mine, sleeps in the bedroom; the participants, all young people, remain in the living room. In the morning they trash the place, throwing whatever is at hand. Glass shatters, metal and wood clang and crash; the room is a cacophony of objects falling, smashing, breaking apart. Then panic sets in the melee stops: Aunt Annie will be upset. I hide in the double door clothes closet, pull the folding doors shut, hold them tightly closed. Bunched up childlike on the floor, I'll look foolish if I'm found. The scene changes. The melee is reported on TV by an attractive young woman who wears her black hair in a ponytail. She describes what has happened, how she was badly injured, sliced in the chest by a large knife. Her gaping wounds, apparently cleansed, are clearly visible. Speaking eloquently, purposefully, she's dying. A handsome young man with black hair also reports the event. The pair alternate their commentary. As the woman goes to a commercial break, telling the audience she and her partner will be alright, the man, also mortally wounded, says, ""Meg...Meg. You're wonderful."""
"0271"	"(2017-03-14)"	"After a bomber air raid, at low tide I walk on the beach with two men. Burnt up fixed wing aircraft and ruined boats litter the shoreline. Further off, a replica Spanish galleon lies stranded atop a sand bar. I wonder ""what is that doing here?"" but I say nothing. A survivor tells us how he narrowly escaped being consumed by a wall of flames. I imagine being caught in the fire, telling rescuers to just let me go (i.e., let me die). We have another day or so to walk about, but I'm depressed. I just want to sleep."
"0272"	"(2017-03-14)"	"I'm sharing a bed with the daughter of a writer friend of mine. Mindful of my friend, I'm on my best behavior. ""Are you OK with this?"" I ask. She says yes, and we continue reviewing a recent terrorist attack. As we talk, our toes inadvertently touch. By chance? On purpose? I disregard it. Somehow, we're able to reproduce the attack. Terrorists in a Humvee draw close, firing an M60 machine gun out the window. The two GIs they hope to kill, standing on a mound right next to the vehicle, simply lean back and duck slightly, allowing the bullets fly past. I imagine grabbing the barrel of the machine gun, or chucking a grenade thru the window, but grabbing the barrel would only burn my fingers; the GIs have made the best move. At least I now understand the attack. Suzanne wanders by in a bikini. [145] With her back to us, she stands still, framed by a palm tree, an azure ocean, a pristine shoreline. A yellow belt made of braided nylon hangs from the small of her back."
"0273"	"(2017-03-15)"	"My brother and I trek in dark thickly wooded mountain terrain. We arrive at a deep narrow gulch and decide there's only one thing to do. Fearless, we excitedly jump down the long dark narrow space. Will the landing be hard or soft? At the last moment I see water, and plunk down safe. We continue climbing. Later, my brother writes down our falling experience, and reads it aloud to a person whose joined us. It's good writing, but not great. Rather than spoil the moment, I listen and smile."
"0274"	"(2017-03-15)"	"The dream repeats itself. This time, however, I'm with several others hiking the area. Among the hikers, an obese young woman in a wheelchair who resembles my neighbor Lizzie from when I lived in New Zealand. Resting, I take carrots from a wicker basket. Who has left it here? We are guests of culture, of a person or group who care for the mountain. Another hiker, a short young man, sensitive and intellectual, and with short hair and a Semitic noise, makes me aware that I'm taking these things, simply taking them. I feel bad not leaving money or in some way showing respect. How will we get the large woman down the gulch? She says that she's driven her wheelchair four to six miles to Boston before, but does not wish to take the easier route again. A huge, lumbering, almost muscular woman, her arms and legs bulging with fat, she gets out of the chair and begins climbing down the gulch. Later, I meet the shorthaired hiker at his home and ask what birthday gifts he's received. A rowboat, perhaps? No, a football receiver. I ask if it's similar to the one he had, and tell him where the basket hoop is nailed to the wall. He's surprised that I know this, and describes his new gift as a variation, a receiver for another team."
"0275"	"(2017-03-15)"	"In a small white tiled bathroom, I've filled a large old-fashioned tub, nearly to the brim, with clear water. When I touch the drain spigot, it sounds a brief alarm. Accidently, I drop a small hairbrush into the water, pluck it out, set it in a small window or shelf. Elsewhere in the house, which resembles 39 Ivy Street, a kind older man or woman offers to talk with me between such and such hours; we agree to meet."
"0276"	"(2017-03-16)"	"I'm in the mountains, possibly Colorado. There's a meeting taking place. A man points to a higher spot across the plain. ""It's impossible to live there."" he says. The mountain he points to is partly covered in trees, partly in boulders and rock. I tell him that's not true. I tell him I lived in a village at 10,000 feet. I tell him it's cold but you have to get used to it. I tell him the rainy season is worst. He asks about food. I tell him the indigenous cooked traditional meals. I tell him a guest house cooked three meals a day. I tell him about a peasant and his wife that I met, who lived near the top of El Sur at 12,000 feet in Guatemala. He must have had farm land below, but lived far above the village. I tell him at the very top, on the Altiplano, it looked like the moon, and was incredibly quiet. I tell him about the peasant's wife, her infant daughter, her weaving and her loom."
"0277"	"(2017-03-16)"	"By an open invitation, a great many high school students have gathered outside a large modern building, whose exterior first floor is painted white. I've met the person who lives here, am older than the students, and do not fit in. What to do, sit on the modern white metal bench or go inside? The students look so young; they must be freshman. My fears are exaggerated."
"0278"	"(2017-03-17)"	"I'm in a small field. It's spartan, bare bones in nature. There is almost no vegetation. An older light-skinned black man scoffs at a younger black man, who has tried to taunt him. There's tension here; I leave with a man for his spartan house. One of two in the area, built of long horizontally placed rectangular panels of unfinished wood, the front of the house is broad, high and flat, and without windows. We enter, climb a steep narrow staircase (I have locked the door with a small hook and eye, and a button device), which leads to a small narrow bedroom very similar to those at the guest house in Guatemala I often visited. A young black girl, seven or eight years old, with a large Afro, and who is precocious, lies awake in bed. I ask her name. She tells me it's ""Syria."" I try to think of other Mideast countries to call her, but only Jordan comes to mind. So much for attempting humor. Sitting near her, I try to play a simple stringed musical instrument, but with little success. Outside the house, amongst a small crowd, I duel with a superb athlete dressed as a Greek or Roman warrior. Armed with unpointed spears--he has already broken mine in half--with incredible agility, he evades, parries and defeats all my attacks. Finally, I defeat him, and he turns into a water bug that I chase after, hitting it with my spear, forcing it to crawl into a piece of clear plastic membrane at the edge of the house, which leads to the basement. The insect borrows through the plastic, into a clear gooey bog, where presumably it may die."
"0279"	"(2017-03-18)"	"I'm on the phone with my high school acquaintance Barry F's mother, having located a woman who may help pay for her dental work. This is the second time I've called; there was no answer the first time. When she picks up, I say, ""Is this Mrs. Frantz?"" With a startled tone, she says yes. I explain the call, noting I had earlier spoken with her husband. Silence. I keep talking. As I look out onto the stormy seacoast, onto the wharf with its weathered boards and creosote tarred poles, there is the sound of the stormy sea, the white capped waves."
"0280"	"(2017-03-19)"	"I'm in the hypnopompic state before awakening. It's as if images are being projected onto the wall and windows of my bedroom. Suddenly, as if projected by a dull laser light on the walls, in the air, people are fighting, shooting, running. The room turns chaotic, messy, a blur of objects rush toward and past me. I control fear by telling myself I'm invincible. There's a toilet full of mucus and vomit. Things are thrown about. Suddenly, though the laser images continue, it's quiet. Then, a droning sound. Is it me? Am I snoring? Moaning? Can everyone in the building hear it? Is it a stifled scream? I wake up."
"0281"	"(2017-03-19)"	"I'm in a house testing small car-like toys, which run on powdered fuel (possibly marijuana), magnetism, or glide on a specially constructed green carpet like surface. A heavyset young woman urges me to test the toys at a park. I tell her I'm not interested. I tell her it would be like watching a wind-up toy moving in a straight line. I tell her I'm interested in the toys that run on powdered fuel."
"0282"	"(2017-03-20)"	"At night, I'm with a group of people seeking to escape and hide. We are not criminals. We've done nothing wrong. We're more like activists, or people seeking sanctuary. I lead the group through a wealthy neighborhood, similar to a village somewhat near where I live. Cautiously, with a white muslin cloth draped over all our heads, we enter a large house. I open a door, which leads to the spacious and ornate living room. We continue walking. There is soft music. Danger. Someone is near. The group hides behind furniture. In the dim light, I stand still, trying to blend in with a desk and chair. A short woman, talking to someone else, comes by. I pretend I'm invisible, she sees me, continues talking, as if she wants me to respond. She leaves, but from a stairway, her teenage brings us cardboard canisters of food. ""I would have brought more,"" he says, ""but I'd need three hands."" I thank him, and pass the food to the group, though stepping down from a table or platform I almost fall. This family, knowing who we are, have risked helping us. Modest and calm, they have helped us."
"0283"	"(2017-03-22)"	"Having spent a long day at college, I'm walking through a building similar to my grammar school. In a long corridor, two professors walk behind me. I want to be alone, walk faster, and imagine meeting David B on campus. How long has it been? We will stand silent in front of each other. Who will speak or move first? My eyes tear up. I want to tell him I'm sorry. I will move first. He will keep still, will tell me to do the same. One of the professors and I converge at a stairway. A tall distinguished looking black man, wearing a suit and tie, his demeanor is similar to Morgan Freeman. [152] As we descend the long staircase, he says, ""And now for the next event."" He means the next academic venture. Instead of walking, from the top step I jump and float slowly down. I say to myself, ""It's like a pinball machine, people and events knocking into each other, bumping off, a constant stream of interactions."" Waking, I continue talking about the interconnectedness of things."
"0284"	"(2017-03-23)"	"A game of football is underway. The field is similar to the yard at My old high school, though much larger: a long black rectangle with permanent white lines. The opposing teams' kicker, a large burly boy, immediately spirals the ball ninety degrees out of bounds. A member of his team walks the ball to us. With a teammate, I talk to him; there is confusion over who has ball possession. My partner and I take out our cell phones and my grammar school."
"0285"	"(2017-03-23)"	"I'm at a playground similar to the one at School, running about, looking for someone. Carefully I circle around a small cluster of tall thin male college students. One student photographs another student; all are dressed in long flowing black coats. Turning a corner, I enter an area similar to the yard at My old high school. Hundreds of people, mostly high school students, are here to attend Army Day. A very large group, composed of students and somewhat older people, walking five or six abreast, march toward me. Others line up by the twenty foot high chain-link fence, waiting to speak with Army recruiters. Is that a Cav patch logo on a boys T shirt? [153] No. I want to meet someone, but there's no one here that I recognize. I'm alone."
"0286"	"(2017-03-24)"	"I'm a passenger on a commercial jet. Dressed in a white shirt and neutral colored vest, a young steward, who is slightly bald, somewhat short, very professional and confident, walks down the aisle, checking tickets. At my turn, he makes pleasant small talk, then takes what remains of my ticket, a small ball similar to the center of an onion, from which I've picked nearly all the outer skin. The steward inspects the object, tries to read it, then asks for supporting documents. I give him medical records. In particular, an ophthalmological report. He seems happy with this, then wonders if my father has seen it. I tell him my father is dead. And my mother? She too is dead. It's clear the steward suspects fraud, but maintains his polite inquiring optimism. I show him other papers. I tell him if the VA issued the eye report he should contact them. Otherwise, contact the private doctor. I tell him other ways to confirm my identity. I'm not worried, I'm telling the truth, but it's clear the steward suspects the ticket or documents are fake, and that I'm someone else."
"0287"	"(2017-03-25)"	"I'm walking in the country and come upon a small group of adolescent Asian girls who are trying, like acrobats, to stand, one upon the others shoulders. One girl, standing on a platform, reaches her arms and hands up to the sky. Next, I pass a large group of college students who are trying to adhere themselves to a billboard covered in thick carpet and two swirling colors. By grasping the tufted fibers, laying flat and contorting their bodies, the students hope to assemble in a spiral pattern. Whenever a student loses his grip, he falls, colliding with another student, who also slides down, creating a chain reaction, which results in the spiral being continually rebuilt. This is the fun of it, which the students very much enjoy; I would be afraid of getting hit in the face. The scene changes. I'm with Dave B, sitting immobile on the floor in a room where other people mill about. Someone challenges me to fight. I stand and raise my fists, but respond in a slow measured pace, which allows the other person to taunt and hit me. Sitting back down, I turn and twist my right leg until I hear it snap. I say or think, ""I've broken my leg,"" then stand to test it, expecting that I'll fall or have intense pain. But I'm able to walk as if there's nothing the matter."
"0288"	"(2017-03-25)"	"Outside, in a lush tropical country, I'm attending a party or gathering. When no one is looking, I pick my lower lip, and am surprised to peel off the entire first layer of chapped skin, which is shaped like a butterfly. I place the object on an end table or bureau, along with a small folded note which contains a message or personal information. Hoping someone will find these things, I watch as a young South American boy, with bowl cut straight black hair, and a broad Mayan face, discovers it. At first he thinks the insect is real. The scene changes. In farm country, I'm with the South American and two other boys. We're talking about the best places to go swimming. The problem here are the tractors, which create dust and noise as they plow or harvest the fields. Only the pool higher up on the hill or mountain is a good place to swim."
"0289"	"(2017-03-26)"	"I've been traveling and am now in the country, on the ground, resting. Hoisting my backpack, I'm off. At Bob and Patti's, I bunk with their ten year old son. [154] It's crowded and dark here and I crawl carefully from the top bunk. Heading home, at a train station, many people sit nearly right on the tracks. I sit next to the conductor, an obese man wearing a visored cap, blue chamois shirt, suspenders and black pants. He watches to be sure everyone's feet are clear of the small flat brass tracks. I move my feet at the last second, the locomotive barely missing them as the half-sized black steam engine passes slowly by. As I look downward, two or three trains speed past. Something has happened. I get up to see one train carriage toppled beneath another. ""Oh my god,"" I say. Instead of steel wheels, the carriage is on its side has black rubber tires. Calling out, ""Women and children first,"" I help to evacuate the passengers. Later, standing by the track, I ask the obese conductor, ""What happened?"" but pretends not to hear me. ""Now what?"" I ask, and ""How do I get to New York?"" But my timing is awkward; he further ignores me. What to do? I will have to find my pack, which contains a green wool Army blanket, and return to the M's. But the pack is heavy; carrying it will cause my side to hurt."
"0290"	"(2017-03-28)"	"In a college setting I meet a young woman who resembles a college girlfriend, Sally. She is tall, thin and self-assured, attractive and sexy. I give her a psychedelic drug. The next time I see her, in a wide open area, she is walking slowly, almost standing still, apparently tripping. I approach slowly, say hello, but curb my need to embrace her, fearing she's not alright. In fact, she's in control, and must leave soon. ""It's called business class,"" she says, making a sour face. I feel guilty. She's tripping, and I don't know and don't tell her how long it will last. But at least she's well, and my fears are unfounded. I refrain from embracing her when we say goodbye."
"0291"	"(2017-03-31)"	"A military man is talking about a cement cellar located near a firing range. Its wall are just sturdy enough to withstand a bullet, though perhaps not. The scene changes. In a cramped wooden house, I'm the third platoon medic, looking at a album of 8x10 photos. [156] There's a picture of myself, barely recognizable: a grunt hung in a tree, not the iconic photo taken in Song Be. [157] Someone knocks at the door; another GI, a tall athletic and confident man who resembles Bill W. [158] I tell him I'm the third platoon medic. He mumbles a question. ""What?"" I ask. The exchange happens twice. ""Do you have any clothes?' he finally asks. Clearly a transfer, not an FNG, I lead him up a steep narrow staircase, whose steps are like the rugged switchbacks encountered when climbing from Todos Santos to a nearby hamlet, T'chpukla. As we ascend the stairs I reflect that he's a unique person with an individual life story, but grunts are replaceable, disposable, like the dead Marines in body bags I had viewed the day before. [160] I tell him there are clothes in this room. Any questions talk to the NCO. [161]"
"0292"	"(2017-04-02)"	"I'm in a movie theater, sitting in the back, watching the feature film. Behind me, a young light-skinned black couple periodically whisper comments. Frustrated by their voices, I turn around, but it's pitch dark. I imagine being a plainclothes policeman, like Frank Serpico. [162] With authority I will turn and tell them to be quiet. When they ignore me, or heckle me, I will shoot them both in the head. I continue watching the film. The black man, who has Native American features, stands up, leans over, grabs my arm in a wrestling hold, pours something on my arm. I can't move. There's nothing I can do but call out, to scream in the darkness, ""Help! Someone call the police! Help! Help!"" The black man is stunned and frightened. I continue calling, and wake still mumbling for help, not sure if I'm sleeping or if my voice will disturb the other tenants."

"0294"	"(2017-04-03)"	"I've befriended a dwarf. We're playing hide and seek in an attic or basement. As he (or she) looks for a place to hide, I say, ""I bet you can't talk fast without stopping,"" and speak word after word that comes to mind. The dwarf, entering a light green pup tent, says, ""Don't look in the tent."" Humorously, I say, ""OK. I won't look there."" Later, as we walk, I notice the dwarfs long dark hair is covered with droplets. He tells me not to worry. He knows what it is. The dwarf complains that his feet hurt from the leather of his shoes, which are similar to those worn by toddlers. He takes them off, flexes the cheap thin plastic soles. When I ask why he buys this type of shoe, he mutters inaudibly. ""How much do the shoes cost?"" I ask. ""Let me know and I'll buy you new shoes."""
"0295"	"(2017-04-04)"	"I'm traveling down a river with several people, a sort of family, on a large powerful speed boat. We pass through high water, calm water, water that's dark or shallow. At times I feel I'll be left behind. Speeding through deep and dark, almost black water, we make one last sudden turn, causing a large black wave to roil behind us. Slowing down, the boat enters a sleepy backwater encampment hidden by trees and brush. A tall smiling man, holding his son, comes out of a boat to greet us. We're late, but he welcomes us to spend the night. I want to give to him a bundle of handwritten letters I have saved for quite some time."
"0296"	"(2017-04-05)"	"My college friend Lynda is in my room, which is somehow haunted by the supernatural. [163] She's naked; I'm admiring her tall thin body, her loins. Red drops falls from my nose while I press it upon her sex. Lynda departs, but there on the floor, a beige patent leather high heel shoe. Whose is it? The room feels haunted. The scene changes. I enter a busy mall like open space. ""Miss... Miss,"" I call to an unattractive middle-aged woman; her straight brown hair frames her face like a Roman helmet. ""Is this your shoe?"" Patient, focused, concentrated on what I've asked, she transforms into a stocky, pitted face man. ""No...no,"" he says, and impatiently points to his right. Is he telling the truth? Getting ridding of me? Something supernatural is taking place. My dog has been here all this time. I'm petting her, loving her, though worried about Lyme disease and ticks."
"0297"	"(2017-04-06)"	"Young and handsome, I'm making my way inside a large dim lit split-level club, circulating amongst the lively crowd, hoping to meet someone. On a balcony, a young man sits at a table with several attractive women. How do they do it? Socialize, meet people. Everyone appears at home, at ease. I wander past a short brunette woman, and for an impulsive second feel attracted to her. We make small talk. She and her look-alike sister are taken aback. ""You're a man!"" she exclaims. ""And you have a mustache!"" I say, ""My sisters have mustaches too!"" And still they marvel; it's clear these women are developmentally disabled. To my left, three young men, their cousins or brothers. ""There are more of them, "" I say, attempting humor. In truth, I feel superior and guilty."
"0298"	"(2017-04-06)"	"Sitting in the back of a deserted theater, I recognize an Italian mobster who stands toward the entrance. A police detective arrives. I try pointing out the mafiosi without giving myself away. Then I raise my arms. Then I point directly at the mobster, a handsome mustachioed and powerful looking man, wearing a white shirt, with curly swept back hair. What does it take for the cop to understand? Is he also in the mob? The Italian walks to the back of the theater. He leans over me. ""Frank...Frank,"" I say. ""Don't do it."" He slowly collapses on me. I feel a cold liquid on my arm."
"0299"	"(2017-04-06)"	"I'm in the ocean, far from land. Only flat calm water is visible. A flat square piece of orange plastic, about the sized of a note book, pops out of the sea. Several times I yell, ""Help!...Help!"" but no one can hear me. Somehow, easily, (is it by my former girlfriend Karen?), I'm saved, back on land. All the while, I've not afraid, but aware how ordinary it is, the possibility of dying."
"0300"	"(2017-04-06)"	"In a busy building, I'm taking S to court. By accident I leave a favorite book in a bathroom. When I return, it's gone. I hurry to a four-foot high cinder block bookcase arranged in a square. To obtain another copy of the book I must climb over the ledge, but my side hurts. Instead, I grip one ledge, lean down, hoist my legs atop the short wall, pull myself up and over. In the court hallway I meet S, who wears a baseball cap. He's visibly aged, is frail, thinner, smaller, wrinkled. Instead of hostility, we greet as friends. The scene changes. I'm late to court, crawling on hands and knees down a cobblestone hallway, imagining Russian spies may look to thwart me."
"0301"	"(2017-04-08)"	"I'm in a darkened cozy bar, similar to Club 55 in Greenwich Village. A middle-aged black man sits near me. He begins playing a small trumpet or bugle. When he's finished the song, with deliberation, to show true respect, not to patronize him, I say, ""I like your music very much."" We talk a bit. The bar gradually empties. A cop approaches me, a burly state trooper, who discreetly tests my backpack for drugs. It's similar to the border crossings in Guatemala in 1992, and Mexico 1994. As in life, I'm not afraid. I don't have drugs. Not long afterward, preparing to leave, as I put on my cap and coat, I ask the cop, ""Have you seen my pack?"" He looks under the bar, nearly pitch black; it's not there. ""Shit,"" I say, and tell him I'll check up front. I imagine seeing someone hoping to walk out with my pack. I imagine confronting the thief."
"0302"	"(2017-04-08)"	"In a sandy area two young brothers with black hair collaborate on producing a film. Repeatedly, after each simulated explosion, sand splatters the face of one man. Conventional films, says the older brother, don't interest him. He wants to strip away the ego, to show the real person, the person as he is, not the outcome of thinking."
"0303"	"(2017-04-09)"	"Outside Ed Svasta's office I learn that long ago Bob and Janice M lied that I had stole things, lied about another event too. [164] [165] When I challenge Bob, he begins to physically fight back. Without an appointment, I enter Ed's office just as he's saying goodbye to a patient, a tall man with swept back hair. Afterward Ed says to me, ""I can see you for a moment."" But when I enter his therapy room, instead of chairs and Bioenergetic equipment, Ed sits behind a lunch counter, making a sandwich for a customer."
"0304"	"(2017-04-09)"	"On a clear moonlit night in New York I'm walking home through an alley similar to that at my grammar school. By chance, I'm beside a woman I may know. ""Are you..."" I ask, then stop; there's no need to descend to fandom. It's Sasheer Zamata, who is beautiful, her face radiant, her Afro hair tied with a red bandana. [166] As we walk together, she continues to look straight ahead. ""I'm not trying to pick you up,"" I tell her. ""I live on Eastern Parkway."" [167] She does not reply. I tell her how people mistake me for F. Murray Abraham, about leaving a message on his answering machine, about the message he left on mine. [168] But Sasheer Zamata will have none of it, and remains silent, even though I assure her it's just polite conversation. The scene changes. I'm with someone, possibly Dave C, inside my building, whose pleasing well-lit interior now resembles the grim halls of Ivy Hill. [169] I point out to Dave the dismal sameness of each floor: the dark, narrow hallways; the shoddy tiled floor; the grim cement stair fire exits. I tell him that on this level the glass window in the fire exit door was likely broken by the same long haired youths who yesterday peered through my first floor window, looking to break it, until I unholstered and brandished a pistol."
"0305"	"(2017-04-11)"	"I ask two burly K9 cops about their German Shepherd. When confronted by a suspect, when do they approach with the dog leashed, and under what conditions is the unleashed dog sent to attack a perpetrator? In reply, one cop asks what I know about K9s. I tell him about the incident in Cambodia. [170]"
"0306"	"(2017-04-13)"	"At a grim New York hospital I find my way to an office for radiation therapy, but the clerk tells me I can't just enter as I please, and directs me elsewhere. At the right office, after I lie upon an exam table, a nurse places needles in both my arms, and draws blood. I must hold my arms behind my head until the treatment is done. The scene changes. At a busy restaurant, when I go to pay the check, I see Rosanna Arquette and another woman, who I can't take my eyes away from. [171] In the meantime, Rosanna talks with a female manager about finding work. As the manager relates in detail where she must go to apply, Rosanna, who appears desperate, interrupts her. ""OK, I'll go there,"" she says. Immediately, she and her friend leave. It's clear my staring has made her uncomfortable. Someone else, possibly Bob M, expresses interest in Arquette. I tell him her gimpy walk hints she's a drug addict."
"0307"	"(2017-04-14)"	"For the excitement, one after another I enter the unoccupied homes in a wealthy and forested suburban neighborhood. After entering the kitchen of one particular house, an old New England dwelling with low narrow doorways, low ceilings, thickly painted walls, detailed panels and trim, I can't find my way out. Finally, I open a door, which leads up a small stone or cement stairway to a densely wooded yard. As I'm walking away, a small boy comes running down a narrow path and waves hello. I do the same. But from here, how do I find my way home? The streets are vaguely familiar, but I don't know where I am."
"0308"	"(2017-04-14)"	"I'm an actor in a science fiction movie. It's so odd to see how movies are made. Scenes with dialog are filmed separately. Actors speak their lines to the camera. Skillful editing creates the illusion of two people conversing. In my scene, with a female actor, we fire a laser weapon, or one is fired at us."
"0309"	"(2017-04-14)"	"At night, in the rain, I bid a woman goodbye. Having inherited real estate, she's now a landlord. ""You're set,"" I say, and ask to be in touch. I may need a place if I move. She asks what sort of apartments I've rented. I tell her mostly middle end, not luxury. She gives me her business card, a folded piece of paper with her name and address on one half, the names and email addresses of many people in a social group. I want to tell her such information should not be on a business card, but I say nothing."
"0310"	"(2017-04-16)"	"On an island a woman in 19th century garb has conspired to have her husband murdered. She stands looking seaward; behind her, an ironing board. Far out at sea, on a large ocean boat, a worrisome man wearing a straw hat sits in a small boat fixed on a gangplank above calm water. Worried but resigned to his fate, he tells a pair of crew members to release the boat from the plank. Back on land, the ironing board falls away from the woman; a shimmering cloud descends upon her. An older woman, possibly her mother, comes by. The two women witness a wooden plank rising from a cylindrical hole filled with boiling water. Standing near the hole, the older woman chants, ""Talk to us, spirits. Talk to us."" A ghost like figure begins to form in the steam."
"0311"	"(2017-04-17)"	"On a sunny day in a well lit college classroom a female Marine officer teaches the Vietnam war. I make a comment about Larry M, telling her and the class that Larry, from the South, is a good person, but his reports on Vietnam are based solely on internet searches. He means well, but that's not how it's done. The teacher approaches me when the class ends. In her WWII olive drab uniform, smiling, friendly, she hands me a well-used leather-bound bible, one of several she has in hand. She says the Marines call it the (un-recollected). She turns to talk with another student. But why did she give me a bible? I wait for her to finish talking, then interrupt her. She says the bible was a gift for my comments about Larry."
"0312"	"(2017-04-18)"	"To buy movie tickets my former girlfriend Karen and I go to New York's 42nd Street. It's busy here, bustling and crowded. But something is different. The tickets are sold by a red haired woman who sits in a small storefront booth. Her makeup and hair are styled after actress Rita Hayworth. I give her money, she hands us tickets and change. But I've given her fifty dollars and she hands Karen only $9.50. At first, when Karen complains, I think she's wrong, and count the bills. But she's right; I complain too. The red haired woman says we've overlooked the $3.50 service charge. I do the math, and wrongly conclude she's correct. We leave, walking to the theater by way of a Russian war zone. Karen has walked this way before. To enter the theater we must run down a wide dirt road, jump over a cement barrier. The moment we dash forward, a machine gun opens fire. I imagine being hit, the bullet lodging in my leg. Karen easily crawls over the barrier to safety, but it takes me several tries, where I'm vulnerable to being shot. Inside, the sprawling movie complex is nearly deserted; the low ceilings hint we're underground. We meet up with a couple who had joined us earlier. I walk to a desolate bathroom, with a hand iron press a white hand towel completely flat. I confront Karen, who seems to no longer to care for me. She says she's sorry, she's tired. We enter the small crowded theater, where her spirits pick up. ""Karen, do you have the tickets?"" ""No,"" she says, ""I didn't bring them."" I'm angry, disappointed. Karen has done this before. With Anthony I go to buy tickets. [173] When he locks himself in a room, I become frustrated. ""I'm out of here,"" I say, and decide to leave Karen, to leave this entire bad day behind. Calmed, I ask a uniformed older woman where the tickets are sold. She points to a deserted area, and to three off duty women. I approach them, ask to buy two tickets, put down a wad of bills. An older woman customer appears; there is confusion over her money and mine. One of the ticket women, observing my funds, says she can't take Euros. The scene changes. With the other couple, Karen and I are passengers on a train that winds through a forest, but speeds through sharp winding turns. While the others enjoy the ride, I'm fearful of vertigo. The train goes too fast."
"0313"	"(2017-04-19)"	"I'm in the country with Dave B; a festival or event is taking place. While everyone watches what's taking place, I look to the tree tops. High among the branches, a dozen or more Aborigines, clustered like macaques, sit half hidden, silently watching the scene below. As I tell this to Dave, the festival goers stop to hear what I've said. To them I say, ""When I talk, everyone listens."" Without my camera I can't take photographs. Dave lies on the ground. As he speaks, I look into his mouth. He's missing a front tooth. ""I had a great surgeon,"" he says. Where I would be worried, embarrassed, Dave is unconcerned by the disfiguring gap. I want to talk about the Aborigines; calmly, Dave talks about his tooth."
"0314"	"(2017-04-20)"	"In a bunker in Vietnam, an officer leads several medics in an effort to decipher the radio code for the portable radio transceiver. At my turn, I tell the officer I don't know about this sort of thing. I tell him I did eights months as an infantry medic, worked a few months at a dingy aid station. I cover my eyes to hold back tears, begin to weep. I don't care that the officer and medic's see it. Inside the grim bunker, I release my sorrow, tell them of loss, deep loss."

When we first meet, the man looks in a cabinet or bureau for a trophy won by the dog. Once the animal and I are acquainted, I love this dog, and the dog loves me. Sitting on the couch, the mutt curled beside me, I can't help but to pet and love this intelligent animal, and turn down a chance to live elsewhere."
"0317"	"(2017-04-22)"	"Barefoot in a derelict building located in a run down city, I have cuts on my feet from glass and rubble strewn on the floor. Two porn magazines lie open. One reveals the beautiful face of a young woman casually looking over her shoulder. The other reveals a vagina photographed close up. While I dress the cuts with ointment and small bandages, I ask my brother to guide me. As we do this, a newly arrived man wants to know my education. I tell him, ""I have a masters in Obscene Literature."""
"0318"	"(2017-04-22)"	"I have a room in a college dorm. A long-haired man, handsome, tall, powerful, shows up at the door. I know this man. Has he stolen something from me? He says, no, he's here to explain. I don't care. I stand up to him. I argue. When I taunt him, yelling, ""You hurt me! You hurt me!"" he patiently curbs his anger. Hiding my fear, I say, ""You should go,"" shut the heavy wood door, turn the metal latch. But the door doesn't lock; the man pulls it open. My roommate hears him, but without seeing who it is, speaks taunting words. Waking with fear, I forcefully say to the long-haired man, ""You should go."""
"0319"	"(2017-04-23)"	"A college party in South Orange, NJ has ended, but with several other men I'm trapped in a room with a drunken man armed with a loaded 38. snub nose revolver. Everyone is tense; the drunk threatens to kill first one man, then the next, by shooting each point blank in the head or face. Some men crack under the pressure and beg to be shot. Slowly, the drunk falls groggy as a brave man waltzes him around the room, at the same time seeking to disarm him. When he finally succeeds, he calmly hands me the pistol, gingerly lays the drunk on the floor, edges me out of the room, shuts the door. In the stairway with another man, I take out my cell phone. ""What's the address here?"" I ask. He knows only the street number, which is 82. We go outside to a sizable square yard with a black footpath and well kept garden. Just as I'm about to call 911, two young women and an ornery man with a full head of hair arrive for the party. The full-haired man directs an ominous remark to the man with me. There's tension. These people are out for trouble; unaware, they head inside."

Filthy, stinking and sweaty, clothed in WWII gear, we lie on the bare rocky earth. Our morale is good. I talk to Pete, telling him who I think should stay in the squad, who should go. ""Ernie is trouble. He could get everyone killed."" [175] I feel bad saying this, and tell him anyone could get us killed. Other men arrive. There is Melhop, the stern machine gunner and sergeant. Someone opens a bag of salted sun flower seeds, offers them around. Taking too many, I try to put them back in the small hole cut in the corner of the cellophane packet. A naive young girl, happy and high spirited, tells us she likes to ride in a convertible. I say, ""I've got some Compazine. [176] Wanna go for a ride?"" I look to the men in a fraternal way. For a moment everyone laughs."

At a house where my family lives, I take cheese from the refrigerator, sun screen (zinc oxide), a canteen of water, though I have to look hard for my canteen belt. Thinking I will take her with us, my dog, here a black lab, growls excitedly, and follows me about. Impatiently, I say to her, ""No."" My mother says, ""She doesn't follow you anymore."" Waking, I say to my mother, ""You're so fucked up."""
"0323"	"(2017-04-26)"	"I join or follow a group of people on a long walk, thinking we're all headed to the same place. Instead, we enter an immense church; a wedding ceremony is underway. I walk near the bridesmaids, sexually aroused by one young woman in particular. Young, tall, thin and beautiful, she wears a modest calico dress. It's clear to others that I want to look up her skirt. A dozen young girls in folk costumes stand on a circular platform. A sort of parade float, it has several levels, like a birthday cake. The girls are happy, smiling. I'm aware they will remember this occasion for a long time. The scene changes. I'm a guest at a house run by Aunt Zani. In the kitchen I talk with a man about the nearby gigantic front-loading washing machine that resembles an old fashioned coffee roaster. I reflect that my mother had a similar machine in the basement on Ivy Street. The man is replaced by two girls from the wedding float. We talk while sorting wash. ""I haven't done drugs in thirty-seven years,"" I tell him. There's a knock on the front door. I go to answer it, but the door can only be reached by a room filled taut pastel canvas sheets. Standing near the door, I ask who is it. A woman responds with a fearful diatribe against drugs. I tell her I haven't done cocaine in thirty-seven years, but I understand why people do. Cocaine makes you feel good. It increases creativity. Many recreational users are neither addicted or harmed by it. I tell her I don't do use cocaine because the quality of street drugs is untrustworthy. I'm recalling the cocaine given to me by an upstairs neighbor in the town I lived in in 1982. Cut with speed, it caused me much anxiety."
"0324"	"(2017-04-28)"	"I come upon a horrific scene: hundreds of people, trapped in buses by the Army or police, lay massacred. One man is held down, his head run over as he screams, ""Wait!"" I run to a cluster of crowded shop fronts and push open a glass door. An official looking middle-aged man, with thinning blonde hair, and wearing a jacket and tie, stops me. ""Where do you think you're going?"" I say, ""I work here."" A handsome younger man, with boyish tousled hair, and wearing jeans, a white shirt, says, ""Oh yeah? What's your honor code?"" Of course, I have none, but to return outside is a death sentence, which both men know, and is precisely what they want."
"0325"	"(2017-04-28)"	"In a dreary warehouse, atop a dark green steel locker, which I reach by standing upon a chair, I find four Glock pistols and two automatic rifle magazines; all are loaded. I'm excited, and look elsewhere on the locker, but find only used or broken eye glasses. Who has left theses things here? For some reason, I think of Alan, who lost his leg in a motorcycle accident in the 1970s. I walk outside, and trek across a large soggy lawn, which reminds me of a park in Blackburn, Australia. Here, the earth curdles like fresh shit. Two hundred yards away, from atop a French colonial building, two police or intelligence agents hail me by name. ""Hey, Marc. Come over here, we'd like to talk to you."" But I know this tactic, and keep walking, hoping they will not come after me. I reach a small grove, and look for a place to dip my muddy hands in clear water. Everywhere, the water is fouled by mud. A man appears in a second floor doorway. Then he is gone. I can't enter to wash my hands, and keep walking."

"0327"	"(2017-04-29)"	"With two other people, I walk in hilly woods, when suddenly a Centaur gallops past. He is huge, dark complected, with a stark round face, boyish tousled black hair, and remarkably agile and swift. Where has he gone? Moments later, not far away, through the brush and scrub, we see him on high ground. As we continue walking in the rugged woods the centaur nimbly gallops down the hill. Half concealed by leaf and branch, he stops only twenty yards away, staring straight at us. Slowly, I approach him. The creature is wholly alert, prepared to bolt at the first sign of danger. But I mean no harm."
"0328"	"(2017-04-29)"	"It's night. I'm in a dilapidated basement, about to do my wash, waiting for another man, a large man who resembles Greg, to finish his laundry. When he's done, I clean up the area, then run the water, which begins to flood the machine, running over the sink, spilling onto the floor. Panicked, I call Brian, just then waking up. The connection is poor, but I can hear Brian's wife in the background. I tell Brian there's a problem. I tell him the water won't stop. I'm aware the ceiling below will have water damage. Brian, patient but annoyed, says try turning the water off. Since the faucets are old, rusted and creaky, I'm surprised this works. I tell Brian the problem is solved, then clean up the water, which has puddled on the faded white linoleum floor."

Outside, there is only pitch black space and countless white stars."
"0330"	"(2017-05-02)"	"At night, I'm on a large base in a mountainous country. The base is more like a fortress than an LZ. We come under attack. Where are they? Smoke and haze, sparks and fog obscure the landscape. I grab my M16 but it won't fire. I grab an M60 and begin shooting at enemy soldiers who are dressed like Taliban. The machine gun may jam but I concentrate on sweeping the bullets from left to right, cutting the enemy down. Fifty yards ahead, crawling forward, a man with a black mini-gun. I shoot a burst that topples him. Another burst, he is not dead but writhing, severely wounded. A young man on our side, dressed as a civilian, appears on my left. Tall, powerfully built, with thick black hair, and wearing a white shirt and black pants, he is relaxed, confident. I continue firing across the landscape, not caring if the people are civilians or soldiers. In fact, I like what I'm doing. I'm shooting people. Killing them. The black haired man, whose has watched without judgment, says, ""It's like a video game."""

But when I approach the truck, I see that it's more like a piano than a refuse-hauling vehicle. The four-man crew, proud of their work, keep the truck neat, polished and clean. One man, wearing an old pair of Eastern Mountain Sports pants, recommends I put on similar clothes, rather than what I'll wear the rest of the day. The crew can tell I've not done hard labor; my pale feet are uncalloused. I'll wear what I have on, a pair of jeans, my usual outfit."

A thin grey-haired old man, who resembles Jack, my landlord in the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012, sits at a child's school desk, asking me questions about my brother. What kind of work did he do? How far did he drive? Etc., etc. I don't know, I tell him, because I haven't seen my brother in ten years. [179] He's become someone I don't know. A second old man, clearly fragile, shuffles by. He doesn't see the pair of leather slippers in his path; I say nothing to prevent him from tripping. He steps on them, continues walking."

I take a turn, hawking a large colorful carving, a stylized man or woman of African or Mayan descent. A middle-aged Mideastern man, wearing a Taliban-like turban, tries to steal my statue, but I catch him, and we fight and tussle as he tries to escape. From fifty yards, on the same street, glimpsed through passerby, I watch as my American traveling buddy in Laos, Adam, and other men pummel the thief, shout at him, Adam atop the man, beating him, demanding that he confess. Half naked, I approach this scene, holding in either hand two pair of black smudged baggy pants made of cheap cotton fabric. In plain sight, I put on one pair of pants, and say to Adam, ""How goes it?"" He says the man has a son and for that reason would not talk; he let him go."

She describes at length how as a child I would pick my lips, which would then imparted a foul odor, which everyone attempted to ignore. A Filipino woman asks about sunburns; I tell her about a $12 patch used in childhood, which changed color after too much sun exposure. The scene changes. I've run out of medication and am at the VA, talking with two people. There is a woman who I refer to as my childhood surrogate mother, who asks about my brother. There is an Israeli man to whom I explain the meds I'm taking. I show him a brown bottle containing several dozen tablets. When they're gone, it cannot be refilled. I decide to request a new drug."

Choppers fly close overhead. Tanks fire their cannons. I'm with Lieutenant Sharp, who is fearless, and one or two other men from the platoon. Enthusiastically, I recount these things to a man I know, but when he asks where this event took place, I struggle with the name. Then I tell him, ""Quan Loi, in northwest Vietnam."" [181] He shows me several plastic avatars of the men in my platoon. There is Sharp, with his fiery red hair; I recognize a few other men. At first I don't see my avatar. Then I spot it. I'm wearing my army baseball cap, the one from Devens, whose visor, with Magic Markers, I had festooned with the gold leaf brocade of a staff officer. [182]"

When I make myself known, a large student, who resembles a bully from high school, lumbers toward me. I throttle a punch that tumbles him down. With the heel of my boot I stomp the flat of his ear. I want to kill, not hurt him."

Though few students are present, several teachers, including my friend Professor Roger S, write on large white boards. The scene changes. I'm in a dorm bedroom, lying on my bed, and begin talking to another conference participant, a stocky plain looking balding young man. I ask if he's written anything. I ask what sort of writing he pursues. He says he's written just one story. He asks about me. I tell him I'm writing a story that will incorporate dialog from another story I've written. As I tell him these things he puts his hand up my pants and tries to fondle me. Repeatedly, I punch him in the face. With each punch I'm yelling at him, ""Why? Why? Why?"""
"0338"	"(2017-05-08)"	"I'm hiking in the woods, walking down a steep marshy path back to where I left my large New Zealand backpack. Two dogs, a German Shepherd and a mongrel, charge me. The Shepherd comes perilously close, nips the air in front of my face, and rushes past. The mongrel tags behind me, then tries to bite me. ""No! No!"" I yell at it. When I return to the area where I've left my pack, the area has become a vast clear lake. What will I do? My pack contained my only pants, shirts and towels. I begin walking the opposite way. I take off and discard my pants and wade in the clear clean water. Reaching high ground, I see that the trail leads to a cabin-like convenience store, where a woman who resembles actress Sondra Locke, wearing a billowy old-fashioned cotton dress, stands outside. [184] I'm immediately attracted to her. In the store, I buy a cup of coffee, then walk around the cabin porch, past an open lot, back to the trail. I'm now fully dressed, and wearing my colorful windbreaker. Passing the woman, who sits in a rocking chair, her open legs poised as if ready for sex, the windbreaker catches on the leg of a nearby chair, causing me to spill coffee. Annoyed, the woman says, ""What's wrong with you people? Give me back my chair."" Feeling foolish, I free the windbreaker and leave, coming upon a crazed looking young man; from the look of his clothes, a mechanic of some kind. We are nearly face-to-face when he removes from his shirt pocket a gun barrel like object and tries to shoot me in the head. My fear gives me strength. Using my arm to grapple with him, I manage to hold and push his arm, but am shot in the shoulder. I'm bleeding. The man pulls another barrel from his shirt pocket, but I wrestle with him, and manage to aim it at his head, and fire, wounding him. With a third barrel, he shoots himself in the eye and mouth, pressing the barrel into teeth and gums, the bullets firing like inky injections. All the while, as he tries to shoot me, I'd been yelling, ""No! No! No!"""

"0340"	"(2017-05-09)"	"I'm young, attending a gathering in a large building where everyone sleeps in rooms where mattresses in orderly rows lay on the floor. A young woman has mistakenly put her toiletries on my mattress, neatly grouping her items with mine. When I point out her mistake, she says she will find another mattress. When I return, she has taken the mattress and sheets to the other side of the room. I must replace the sheets; obsessed I run around, frantically searching, dimly aware this is fruitless, unimportant. I can make do. This is so for shaving as well. Without my kit I can't shave. I've got stubble. I won't look perfectly clean shaven. So what? In a corridor I meet Robert Farjam, a youth known from summer camp, whose bullying I stopped by picking him up and tossing him out of the bunk house, to the surprise of everyone. ""Which room are you in?"" he asks. I say, ""This place is like an insane asylum."" I tell him all the rooms are the same. I almost say, 'I feel like I'm home.' Having gone outside, wearing new tan colored carpenter's pants that fit well, I run across a wide cement and flagstone plaza, back into the building. Barry Baldwin, a confident youth from high school, walks past in the opposite direction. He is sullen, silent, uncommunicative. I'm feeling confident, athletic, and rip off a gimmicky piece of fabric from the side of my new pants."

After a time I watch my left leg rise into the air and bends at odd angles. I feel it being pulled this way and that. I begin to moan, then scream. The persons nearest my bed watch helplessly. Someone comes over to offer help. As my arms flail, as I call out, ""Help me! Help me!"" they stand over me, tentatively offering me their arms to hold onto. Out of fear, this person withdraws his (or her) arms. The process is repeated several times. I need this individual to hold onto, but he or she is unwilling to help in a consistent way."

Our seats are on a ledge, a sort of balcony, and my seat is different from hers, but we have no choice and we sit. The teacher, a tall, older stern looking woman, goes from person to person, checking visas. Karen presents hers. At my turn, I tell the teacher I'm a veteran. I tell her I've applied for a visa several times, but the application is always returned. The teacher says I'll have to leave. Calmly I say, ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" She becomes upset. ""Leave or I'll call the police,"" she replies. I take out my phone and say, ""I'll call them."" I say to the operator, ""I'm a veteran. I'm being abused by a professor. Send a SWAT team. Send an ambulance."" I say this calmly. I want to frighten the teacher. I want to punish her. The ambulance is for her."

As I turn to leave, a presence, a sort of beast-man, grabs me. I'm frightened, but grab back, yoking the thing in a headlock, and intentionally fall down the stairs, hoping to injure it. The presence talks to me, moans, resists, as it tries to escape."

As I walk past a bedroom, I see her, half naked, sprawled languidly on the mattress. I ignore my sexual impulses and continue walking as she continues to shave her alluring legs. I pass a room where a shy obedient pit bull obeys the man by lifting its rear leg and setting it down. I meet his girlfriend on the staircase, which resembles the staircase in the family house of my father. Completely naked, she is tall and thin; being flat chested, she has the body of a young man. Lonely and sad, I say to her, ""Hold me."" Instead, she tries to passionately kiss me, and I push her away. ""Just hold me,"" I tell her. She can do this, she says, but her movements are awkward, unnatural, unsatisfying. Not what I want. Not what I need."

As we press forward, over the loud speakers, an old man who resembles Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces a bayonet drill. The scene changes. I'm alone in the hallway, now darkened. A young athletic female in black body armor hurtles sideways across the dark floor. My job is to attack her and I dive upon her. As we grapple, nothing is off limits and I bite her hard on the hand. We continue struggling, each trying to defeat the other. I let go her hand and kiss her hard on the mouth. She struggles against me. I don't want to fight. I'm trying to kiss her hard on the mouth."

Slowing to a walk I ask her, ""What's wrong, sweetie?"" My dog replies, ""I'm not used to this,"" and further tells me she has not been training to run in this manner. I'm deeply hurt and feel deep guilt. ""I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry,"" I tell her, and repeat these words upon waking."

When a passing car momentarily stops I say to her, ""We have no cover,"" and I drop to the ground. But Carrie has an escape plan. She will hop the fence behind us and go into the trees. The scene changes. Carrie and I are walking in a sparsely wooded area. As we pass by a tree-shaded stream, a cop car pulls up fifty meters behind us. We can hear them talking. I take the lead. It's better to keep moving, to pretend we're not worried, to show we've done nothing wrong. After crossing a wide shallow stream the cops pursue us and we become separated. Running from the cops, I leap thirty, forty, fifty feet at a time, and glide above the water. Now I'm running, and Penny and I enter a large empty building, a warehouse with immense empty rooms painted white. Trying to outrun the two cops, we become separated. Alone, I glide across the immense floors of an empty room as fast as I can, the two cops right behind me; I'm barely out of sight. The chase continues in a wide hallway, where again, I'm ahead of them, but barely out of sight. They are almost upon me. When I slow down I see that the nearest cop resembles Judge Greg Mathis of the reality TV show."

Periodically an older, dark-skinned Indian man encourages me to walk. Finally I do. My dog is here. She's happily running about, a kerchief tied around her neck. I'm concerned that she might be cold, but she's not shivering. She's running about, as I walk behind her. My brother is nearby."

The conductor explains that the center of the wooden floor is made of glass, it will not support the heater I've brought. No matter. I will lend it to the man who has asked to use it. One, two or three weeks at a time he can take it wherever he likes. We arrive at a summer village, which the girl belongs to. Several times, as we walk down a dirt path bordered by chicken wire, I ask if the area is safe. The girl assures me it is, and points out several dark green wooden rowboats tied up to the shore. With these, we can take lessons in a specific rowboat technique. When we sleep next to each other, we talk, and several times I choke up. It's the war. I'm thinking how awful things can get, but I do not tell her that's what bothers me. When we arrive at a busy amusement park there are people crowded by entrance. A woman who looks like a woman who resembles Chris D elbows the girl several times. In the slow moving melee I lose sight of the girl, who has entered the amusement park. We haven't made emergency plans; how will I know where to look for her, or she for me? It's as if everything is lost. However I decide to stay put and wait for her. I'm so happy when she returns. I really like this girl. She is my friend. I point out the woman who elbowed her. She seems an angry woman. Angry at life."

In the morning, someone says the dining room has free food. I'm hesitant to enter, but go inside and look about. The scene changes. I'm in the dinning room, now closed, with another boy, my brother. We hope to steal a pair of audio speakers the size of trucks. Each speaker has a clear plastic covering, the interior, filled with white foam, is illuminated by white light. I'm inside one speaker, my brother hides inside the second. A narrator explains that suspended by ropes, we've spent the night inside the speakers and plan to carry them away. As I work inside the speaker, a guard enters the immense room; a fat, slow slovenly man, he see's us. I don't want to go to jail. What to do? In this moment of every man for himself, I run, find a door which leads to a narrow L shaped passage, which leads outside. ""I'm free,"" I say, but without my wallet I have no money or identification. As well, I've emerged on the wrong side of the building, onto a country road where heavy construction has overtaken the residential homes. And my brother? He will be caught, there's nothing I could have done for him. To get to the other side of campus I re-enter the building. Alarms go off. Smoke fills the night air. Bright lights illuminate the smoky haze. Hiding in thick bamboo I determine that if a polar bear finds me I will stand and fight with a bamboo pole. I clamber on to an immense roller coaster like pulley. Where is it taking me? Will I be crushed to death? I fall asleep and wake up in a squad car.

The car begins rolling forward. I don't know how to drive. Where is the lawyer? What to do? I get out and use my feet to stop the car, but now that it's speeding on the highway nothing I do can slow it down. Somehow, the lawyer appears at the wheel. I tell him, ""You should let me inside."" The scene changes. The lawyer and I have entered an immense building, a car factory. With other men, executives, we walk up a narrow and smooth cement staircase. From behind me, an effeminate young man, who resembles my grammar school classmate who became an actor, Jimmy D, announces that he has millions of dollars. Both he and the muscular man behind him are armed guards; they wear blue uniforms and each totes two canvas satchels of money. Because the staircase is narrow, and the executives are wealthy, the guards trust them. I lose sight of the lawyer. At an elevator, I see two scantily clad young women, and a young Russian couple. I ride the elevator with them to higher floor, where I sit on the gray metal desk of a young man wearing a suit and tie. I've found food in three saucers the size of thimbles. There is ground coffee, there is chocolate pie. I eat the pie. How will I find the lawyer in this immense building? Will he call me over the PA system? I'm concerned but not worried."

As we talk at the table, periodically I make immature jokes, which backfire, especially on the woman. While talking about the dog in the house one of the doctors mentions it weights three hundred pounds. Making use of something he'd said, I remark, ""It's his sperm."" Instead of laughter, silence. Later I see physician couple holding hands. Only then do I realize they've fallen in love. The male doctor knows Kevin, the Vietnam vet I know through his role at the William Joiner Center ""For how long,"" I ask. ""A long time,"" he replies. ""About just now."" He suggests going to a writer's conference or related event. Mistakenly, I think he means the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012."

Around us, many dogs try to catch small animals in trees by repeatedly jumping a few feet up the trunk, or scampering a few yards up the tree, only to fall down. The scene changes. I'm standing high up on a wood scaffold. The dogs have become powerful. A hound dog repeatedly jumps forty feet high, coming right near me, dangling momentarily mid air, before plummeting down. Finally one dog, a Weimaraner, vaults gracefully over the scaffold. Later, by a campfire, a friendly dark colored Husky-like dog comes close and stares at me with inquisitive eyes. I pat his head. ""I'm sorry. I don't have anything for you,"" I say. The dog's face is so human, kind, endearing."

As if it were yesterday, there is the well-worn red earth, the trampled bamboo leaves, the narrow track snaking its way through the canopy. When the trail becomes faint I lose my way. Finding it, I walk into the house, passing an old Asian woman who asks me a question. I tell her I'm going to my room first to change my clothes, which are sopping wet. From another room I hear what seems to be a party or gathering. With several other men I change my clothes while sitting in a sort of locker room, sheltering my body as best I can. The scene changes. I'm in shower with two brothers, seven or eight years old, both very intelligent. The blonde haired boy has the build of an athlete. Behinds us, off to the side, many colorful clothes lie heaped on the floor. I'm aware of the boys being curious of my naked body and I turn from them. For the brothers, showering with an adult is a game, a time for fun."

They sleep atop me, upon a large dark blanket; palm leaves and colorful wool fringes protrude from its edges and tickle my nose. As I can only lay on my back, the sleeping arrangement is uncomfortable. But the boys are falling asleep so I don't disturb them. The scene changes. In an empty hotel room, from a distance, on a bed, I see an thin attractive young woman kneeling on all fours. Between her upraised buttocks I see the soft alluring cleft of her vagina, which I walk to, kneel to, nose and kiss. The scene changes. The hotel room is empty. Naked, I walk about, heading downstairs. A very beautiful young woman wearing a stylish dress and stockings walks by; she works here. I can't believe how beautiful she is. My things have been moved. I must sleep in a smaller bed. Before anyone returns, out of the shower, Robert arrives. He wants to have sex. But where? There is no privacy. I suggest his old bedroom, upstairs. He agrees.

Past the brass framed glass door, with three attractive and talkative women in front of me, I walk up a series of steps. Instead of a business, it's as if I've entered a well kept home. In fact, the stairway resembles 79 Ward Place. There are many medium sized and well appointed rooms where the couches and hangings, the rugs and chairs, are quite comfortable, welcoming and home like. In these rooms small workshops are underway, a few people attending each one. The mood is light, upbeat. In a spacious split level area, remarkable for it's broad parquet floor, I see two women practicing midwifery or CPR on a life size and human-like latex doll. But where are the books? Fifty yards away, I see rows of book shelves, a library in fact, on a separate lower level, which appears to extend to the buildings top floor. I walk across a wide open parqueted area fitted with comfortable chairs and sofas upon which people sit and read. A petite brunette woman lies splayed on a rectangular flat couch, as if she is at the beach. I consider that here the business model is luxury in service to sales. I head toward the books; arranged like an opulent archive, the carefully placed volumes inhabit floor upon floor. I consider the unspoken wealth that inhabits the building.

Eventually he hangs up, we talk, and he shows me one of his paintings, the style for which he is known: a long panel depicting a group of children, which in small ways he renders strange. It becomes apparent that I don't know his name. ""That's social skills, "" I tell him, referring to my friend, who is alone in a nearby darkened room. The artist laughs heartily. We talk about the servants. But what about my work? My writing? We do not discuss it. Now that it's late, he offers me a place to sleep on the linoleum tile floor. Amongst the bric-a-brac, he points out a chrome plated coffee maker. There are brambles and bugs here. I see a scorpion scurry away. I can't sleep on the floor. It's not safe. When he leaves, I decide to return to my house, a half mile away. I will take my purple towel and backpack, but due to the weight leave behind the sheaf of copy paper. I head home through a narrow high walled street. Much like the old quarters of European cities, the street is crowded with people and movement is slow. In fact, it's a dead end, leading to an elegant waterfront promenade where many wealthy people lounge and congregate. Along the waterfront, beneath tall white canvas tents, beautiful young men and women, wearing bathing suits or ballet costumes, energetically perform a popular new dance which I think is silly. Heading back, I pass a fat young girl; unembarrassed by her appearance, she dances by herself. What will my friend or the artist think when they see that I've gone? I don't care. My decision, to leave the house, feels right. My objective is to return home, which is safe."
"0369"	"(2017-06-03)"	"I'm at a restaurant sitting at a table with other people. A large German Shepherd, lying on its side, soaks up the affection as everyone pets it. Another dog appears. A diminutive black mutt, part Lab, part spaniel, it seems to belong to someone else, but whom? I like this dog, and it follows me around. When I pick it up in my arms to care for it, the dog is gentle, nearly submissive, as if it has been emotionally injured. I head home, walking down Highland Place, wondering what to do. I like this animal, but do I really want this unneutered female with her extended nipples and long black penis? As we near the house, I'm torn. If I do not keep the dog, who will take care of her? She will sleep outside. She will be hungry and cold. Keep or abandon? I decide the latter, and it seems she has disappeared, but she emerges from an alley continues to follow me home. Near my house, I see two neighborhood friends with small frisky dogs which limp. Their left rear legs have been amputated or shaved, it's hard to tell, though it's due to recent vaccination. In the stairway of the house are several middle aged women about to go up my apartment. Pointing to the black mutt, I say, ""That dog stays here."" The mutt has changed color from black to white. She looks so sad. I'm torn. Should I keep or abandon this poor needy dog?"
"0370"	"(2017-06-03)"	"I'm walking in the woods when overhead I see a small Halloween witch flying on a broomstick. ""That can't be,"" I say to myself. I run to the spot where the witch has crashed into the upper branches of a tall tree. Suddenly, to my right, a roaring noise; in the distance, heading this way, an enormous bomber or cargo plane appears in the sky. Almost immediately, three to four hundred feet overhead, a futuristic spaceship, silver, aerodynamically shaped like a race car, with smooth curved edges. A Chinook helicopter appears; next, a boxy satellite. I've happened upon a coordinated space event. With hundreds of people, I'm part of a large line walking towards a large building or area where the event will be held or explained. Waiting to enter, a young woman who wants to meet men speaks to me. She is not particularly attractive, her teeth are pronated, but she is happy, ebullient. I offer her words of advice and encouragement."
"0371"	"(2017-06-04)"	"With a half dozen other young people I'm in a barn-like room. We take turns performing theater roles or reciting poetry. At my turn, I improvise a religious chant, which is received with much applause. Apparently the young people don't realize I've made it up, it's not memorized or authentic. There's a second go round, but at my turn I decline. Mistakenly, I say that I have completed my obligation. The remark is met with silence. Next, though my part is unclear I'm included in play rehearsals. As I lie on the dirty floor, bare chested and filthy, a girl who resembles the waitress Rachel wonders about a theatrical phrase. I clarify it for her. ""The bull in the yard."" Is she ready to perform outdoors in a Western to a few dozen people? She is, with likely an audience of two hundred. We begin flirting. I come close and press myself upon her as we begin to neck."
"0372"	"(2017-06-04)"	"At night, on a high floor in a large house with many rooms and occupants, I look down onto the busy street. Groups of rowdies roam among the jammed traffic. There are shouts. A man in plain clothes, a large ornery man claiming to be law enforcement, enters my room, takes a pen from my desk. He's looking, he says, for hooligans or immigrants. The scene changes. I find myself with two men trying to escape to Siberia. We're lost, walking the streets not knowing where we're headed. A handsome man, a natural leader, enters a crowded restaurant to ask directions from a waiter or chef. Afterward he relates the directions to me and I become angry and critical. I tell him the directions are wrong. Like in Mexico, the chef or waiter did not understand his question; they simply 'yessed' him. I'm aware of being too harsh, too negative. The handsome man suggests we buy a map. It's a brilliant idea. Why didn't I think of it? What common sense! At an upscale bodega we purchase a map similar to those I put on the wall of my apartment in Northampton. [199] The scene changes. As we sit on the second floor of the bodega the handsome man asks what bothers me. ""It's a long story,"" I tell him. I don't want to talk about the war, about my life afterward. I notice that being an immigrant has turned his complexion. In places it's blotchy or red. We continue walking, now only the two of us. At an intersection I anticipate when he will turn, but he changes stride and direction, and cuts me off. Pointedly I ask him, ""Why do you always to that?"""
"0373"	"(2017-06-04)"	"I'm on a busy city street waiting for My former girlfriend Karen. When she doesn't show up I decide to leave. But now I'm naked, wearing only white bed sheets around my body, and carrying my black and white bed spread and two pillows. I don't care what people think. I begin walking, careful not to drop the things I carry."
"0374"	"(2017-06-05)"	"I'm capable of flying by rising up slowly into the air and floating. In this way, spreading my arms, squinting my eyes., I leave my grammar school's little playground. A short husky man wearing a tan trench coat, who I assume is CIA, watches me. In the sky I met Jay and a woman. They refer to me in a code which means I'm in a specific category of individuals capable of flight. I tell them the CIA knows this. I tell them, hoping they will offer help, that I've just seen a doctor for headaches."
"0375"	"(2017-06-05)"	"I'm attending a sporting event in a wide open field where many people are present. From a distance, charging toward me on a large brown horse is my mother. She pulls the horse up to the tall clear plastic barrier, a sort of large window pane, behind which I stand. My mother has something to tell me. ""Closer,"" she says, meaning she does not want anyone to hear, I should move closer to the barrier. The horses large head knocks against the barrier, which in turn hits me. I'm angry, hurt, and my mother does not know it. This is just like her: nagging, pestering, ruining the moment. My mother tells me about fencing practice. Where to go to be on the team. I'm only hurting myself, but to hurt her, I walk away, even as she calls me to come back. The scene changes. At My old high school, where the practice is held, I enter the wrong stairway, which leads to the chem lab. ""I always do this. I never get this right,"" I say. What to do? It's a long way to the other side of the school. Being on the team requires practicing three times per week. I'd rather go home and watch TV."
"0376"	"(2017-06-06)"	"My former girlfriend Karen and I are walking along a quiet street. While counting the money in my wallet I notice a one dollar bill with spectacular printing error: the reverse side appears on the front and back. We stop at a small stamp and coin shop, where I ask the owner, a short stocky balding man, what the bill is worth. I note the embedded laser anti-counterfeit image, the old time hand pressed office stamp, the Treasury Department's unique currency paper. As we review the lengthy serial numbers he looks for a specific numeric combination. ""Is it worthy anything?"" I ask. His reply is vague, non committal; but then he makes a modest offer, and I suspect the note has significant value and ask for it back. When the owner pretends he no longer has it, I tell him I'll call the police. He does nothing so I make the call. ""My name is Marc Levy. I'm a Vietnam vet. I'm at a store..."" I tell the 911 operator I'm getting angry. I tell her there could be trouble. ""Do you copy?"" I ask. Neither My former girlfriend Karen or I know the address and approximate it. When I hang up, the owner hands me the bill. ""Too late,"" I tell him. ""The cops are coming. I hope someone forgives you. If I had a gun..."" My former girlfriend Karen and I leave. The scene changes. At a dance for wealthy people who are dressed in formal dinner wear, I spot an object someone has dropped on the floor. Discreetly, I pick it up, nonchalantly walk through the dancing couples, and leave. My former girlfriend Karen and I catch a bus. The bus and the road we travel on are identical to An Loc. [200] Soon the authorities or bank robbers arrive. To escape, I jump off the bus. When it's safe, I emerge from the jungle, walk back to the road, frequently call into the jungle, ""My former girlfriend Karen...Karen...Karen."" But she does not appear or reply. I meet and talk with two American's dressed in dark suites and ties. They're interested in the object I've found; it's a passport case, they tell me, not a wallet, as I had hoped. Is it worth money? I ask. When they try to steal it, I shoot one American, then the other, first in the head, then the lungs. I do this several times. Each time with satisfaction."
"0377"	"(2017-06-09)"	"At night, in my underwear, I walk in the woods. From behind me, I hear voices. Turning round, through the bracken, I watch a family ride past on bicycles. I begin walking up a steep trail that's muddy and washed out, letting myself slide backwards, as if skiing in reverse. After finding my way to the water, which is vast and clear, on the way back to the road I'm surprised to see how the water has risen. I wade slowly forward, pushing in front of me a sandbank that acts as a dam, but also accelerates the overspill. Once over the dam, I enter a grim flooded warehouse. The water here is nearly black. It's necessary to walk past a parked bus; at my approach it starts up. The driver, who doesn't see me, comes too close, forcing me to stand clear. The water becomes deeper, swirling, filthy. Hip deep, I wade past a mechanical buoy shaped like an oil barrel. Tethered to a chain anchored to the floor, spinning slowly round, the buoy is capable of dragging me down. Don't the people in charge know any better? The fast moving water, which is filthy, black, polluted, becomes neck deep. Struggling to keep my head above water, I half swim, half tread to a wall, which has banisters I can grasp. I'm not afraid. I can do this. I will not allow myself to drown. The scene changes. Having escaped the warehouse, I descend a narrow stairwell; ahead of me, a Mideast mother, father and child. There is tension here. The cranky child slows them down. At a stair landing the woman stops to tie the child's shoe. When they resume walking the father speaks to his wife in an English accent. When the woman stops a second time I grow impatient. ""Excuse me, Miss,"" I say, wanting to get past her. But she does not move. ""Miss, excuse me."" Angered by her ignoring me, I imagine pushing her down the stairs, watching her tumble."
"0378"	"(2017-06-10)"	"After walking through my grammar school's little playground, turning the corner after the place for the game ""bombardment alley,"" and walking to the long wide corridor that leads to the street, I see a young boy and mistake him for someone else. I shoot him. ""No!"" he screams, then tumbles down. I can't be bothered, and continue walking and enter Ivy Hill Park. From one hundred yards, I spot the fencing team at practice. But now that I'm old, these can't be my team mates. Or are they? Is that coach Joe Scalamoni? Is that Tommy Praino, Ritchie Blonna, Marc Volpe, Bruce and Steve? I continue walking, but now with the pistol grip of a fencing foil in my right hand. A brawny policeman stops me, asks for identification. It's clear he suspects something, wants to make an arrest. I take out my black nylon wallet, show him my drivers license. He says to repeat the process, but this time show him something with my social security number. He moves closer, trying to intimidate me; he has an enormous cartoon like head. We are face to face, nearly touching, but I do not back down. I show him my military ID card, too late realizing it does not have the number he wants. The scene changes. I'm in a deep lake. Menacing crocodiles slither up and down in the dark water. I call for help. A huge crocodile attacks and bites me. At first I have fear and call for help. But the bite, though powerful, is not painful; the beast is made of flexible green nylon fabric. Still, I can be dragged down. Repeatedly, I punch one beast, then another, on the snout or head. ""Help!"" I'm calling. ""Help!"" But no one comes to my rescue."
"0379"	"(2017-06-11)"	"An agreement has been reached between the residents of a village and the occupying Germany army. Without fear of retaliation, the citizens can approach a German soldier and say whatever they like. A pretty young girl walks up to a soldier who wears a high ranking officers cap and cape. She begins to read from a prepared statement, though first saying to loudly to herself, ""Go, Rachel. You can do this."" Moments into her statement, the German tells her to stop, which causes the villagers to boo and jeer. The scene changes. It's night, raining. There is lightning. Rachel is seated in an alcove similar to 39 Ivy Street. There is the heavy rounded top wood front door; in it, or the walk-in closet outer wall, the small round window. I tell Rachel, for her age strikingly mature and intelligent, that she had fallen asleep, that several hours have passed. She believes me. There, I've done it. I've fooled this impetuous little girl. But I'll have to tell her the truth."
"0380"	"(2017-06-13)"	"From above, I look upon a vast deserted shoreline. On the beach, someone with a guitar plays folk music. In the distance, I see Bob, Florence and Rocco M, and reflect that Bob always stayed with his parents, though I know this isn't true. [202] Someone watches as I lie on the hood of a car while a man resembling Jeff approaches. [203] As this man and I make small talk he begins to fondle me. I say, ""What are you doing?"" push away his hands, fold it backward upon itself. He winces in pain. I say, ""You'll be alright in a week or Jew."""
"0381"	"(2017-06-13)"	"I'm the only male in the office of a small enterprise staffed by two or three women. From the second floor a woman bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs. Oliver enters the well-lit room. [204] My phone rings. The caller asks about the film playing today. I have no idea, and via stream of consciousness tell the caller the film is about the Khmer Rouge, that it was made in Boulder, Colorado, and depicts Siem Reap, and how the Khmer Rouge exploited its factory workers. I say the word ""Cambodia"" several times. [205]"
"0382"	"(2017-06-14)"	"In Switzerland, I've found my fifth-grade teacher at my grammar school. She gives me food, allows me to sleep on the wood parquet floor of the little apartment she shares with a friend. I'm as quiet as possible. Alone in the apartment, we talk. It's Kara. It really is. With her long brown hair and her warm sad face, she is still beautiful. As we lie on the floor, she allows me to press myself upon her to kiss her. We talk about the monthly VA check I had signed over to her. She still receives it; $244 per month. What to do? Kara and her friend do not make much money. About $1200 per month. But what about me? And what if the VA finds out? We talk about helicopters. How to co-ordinate the flights so we can continue to meet."
"0383"	"(2017-06-15)"	"At a large and grim college I enter a twilit room. On my bookcase, in a light green plastic bag, someone has left two books. Who is here? I follow a drunk male student and sit with him on a couch. The student is friendly, harmless; when he shifts his body, I see that he's sat on his brown potato chips. Leaving the room, in a high walled dungeon like corridor, I meet a good-looking middle aged brunette. Though I'm immediately attracted to her, she is wary; she thinks I'm following her. ""Excuse me, Miss. Can I ask you a question?"" Happily, she says, ""Yes."" I ask, ""Are you single?"" She is, and even before I ask her out, my mood, voice and demeanor reflect my abundant well-being. I ask, smiling, laughing gently, ""Would you like to have coffee with me?"" She agrees, but we must hurry to where she must go, and race down the corridor, where momentarily I lose sight of her. After looking left and right, outside, down a narrow garden-like path that leads to the street, in the distance I see several women, but not her. I turn back, slide down a steep wet cement embankment that leads to an enormous mediaeval double door made of wood. I hammer my fists upon it. It's no use. She's gone."
"0384"	"(2017-06-15)"	"I'm in a small living room crowded with men who have gathered for a group Civil War re-enactment photo. G has given us instructions. [207] We'll break for a few minutes, then return for the photo. From the corner of my eye, I catch sight of Pete C walking up a narrow staircase. [208] I tell G I want a pistol, not a rifle. He motions me to a small square bedroom, furnished only with a large bed topped with white sheets, a dark wood antique chest of drawers. So this is where it happens. [209] G hands me a slim black and white antique catalog. He tells me to choose a weapon, but the solid black pistols look more like beetle specimens than hand guns. ""It doesn't matter,"" I tell him, ""but next time, I want a sheriffs badge."" Enthusiastically, I say, ""Yeah, I'll be a sheriff."" We enjoy this clever funny thought but without laughter. Back in the living room I re-join the uniformed men; crowded together, they instinctively point their rifles in the air."
"0385"	"(2017-06-17)"	"In a crowded dimly lit night club, near the bar, I'm wrestling with a man or woman who resembles my brother. We're tussling, lying sideways. Slowly the wrestling becomes sex. I'm behind him/her, grabbing breasts, entering. It's so exciting, pleasurable, intimate. The scene changes. I'm standing behind a petite young woman. She's bent over; her rump raised in the air, we simulate sex. After I've turned and walked away a young man with a slight beard, long hair, and wearing 70's disco clothes, approaches me. He is the girl, distressed by what happened. I leave him to go to my nearby apartment, but the way is blocked by a microphone, musical instruments, electric cords. A seated young couple watch as I try to step past the obstacles, slowly topple them to the floor. I enter a barn-like building where a Golden Retriever, quite old, excited to play or eat, continually nips and nuzzles me. Past a floor strewn with garbage (chicken wings are abundant) I enter a kitchen cluttered with an array of vegetables, sorted in neat rows laid out on the floor. In a small darkened broadcast or recording booth, a young fashionable Asian woman, a singer or DJ, ignores me as I try to step past her."
"0386"	"(2017-06-17)"	"At night, in a city like New York, My former girlfriend Karen and I walk up the street. In the dim light I recognize a tall heavy set man wearing a bulky black full length coat. I know this man. I know him well. ""Donald, I want you to meet a friend of mine,"" I say. ""This is..."" I can't recall My former girlfriend Karen's name. To them both I say, ""Oh shit, I'm having a memory slip!"" At last, I say, ""My former girlfriend Karen, this is Donald Trump."" He shakes our hands. Silently, I wonder where he's going for dinner, and hope he might ask us to join him. But Trump is busy and ambles away."
"0387"	"(2017-06-18)"	"At night, my grandfather drives my brother and I to White Meadow Lake. We are six and seven years old, the three of us seated together, my brother in the middle; I sit by the passenger door on this two hour drive. After a time I ask my grandfather, ""Moe, you doing all right?"" In the darkness, I hear my grandfather say, ""Yeah."" His voice is distant, depressed, like my own. In the next lane a car slowly passes by. I expect it's someone I know, but it isn't. I imagine being shot at close range. A large metal plate, covering the window and door would protect us. Down the long winding highway my grandfather drives fast and steady, in complete control. How does he do it? I would crash, as if destined, and imagine colliding with a guard rail, flying over an embankment, falling into a ravine, smashing into a tree. I imagine the moments before impact, before death. I imagine the three of us mangled and dead. ""Too bad they weren't wearing seat belts,"" the investigators would say. We arrive at White Meadow Lake. In moonlight, through a forest, the three of us walk up a steep hard packed dirt trail. My grandfather falls behind. Closer to us, a man or woman pushes a grocery cart, which continually rattles. ""I forgot my shirt,"" I tell my brother. I tell him returning to the car is too much effort. The people who live here must know to avoid extra trips. Finally we reach a grassy embankment and need to carefully step down. I tell my brother, ""There's a ledge here. Step on it."" In response, my grandfather pats me on the shoulder. Entering the house, my uncle Shelly greets us. With a garden hose he sprays clean a row of flooded toilets. To avoid inhaling the mist I hold my breath and hurry past. Inside the house, his daughter Marna walks up to me. Should we kiss or embrace? We shake hands. ""I saw your books,"" she says. ""I'm going to get them."" I express surprise and indirect caution. Framed by a door, Uncle Shelly stands twenty feet behind her. He is young, full bearded, handsome, and has an impressively hairy chest. An old college friend, Ronnie Weinberg, in his late twenties, enters. Forthrightly, in his easy chuckling way, he says hello as we shake hands. He mentions the four POWs. I have heard of them but only vaguely. I tell him the mainstream media intentionally limits the news. Ronnie is surprised. It's on the news, he says. Their jet slammed directly into (unrecalled). They're being held by guerillas or a militia. The mood in the house is upbeat."
"0388"	"(2017-06-18)"	"It's morning. I'm in a bunk house similar to the CIT bunk at Elk Grove Camp, with its timber walls, steel frame army bunk beds, the wood plank floor. I'm lying on a top bunk, beneath a wool army blanket, reading a book. I look to my left, out the front door. What is that noise? Suddenly, hundreds of wild horses, like those painted on cave walls, enter the bunk house, galloping over the beds, round and round, a beautiful carousel. Somehow, there's no danger, only the sight of the whirling animals, only the sound of their trampling hooves. Round they go. Then they are gone."
"0389"	"(2017-06-21)"	"I'm in a long crowded hallway crowded where many dying people lay on a long narrow bench. Rushing, pushing past the dead, I'm being chased, grabbed from behind. When I yell or shout, my voice is stunted, weak. At the corridor's end, I enter a dark apartment living room. Mockingly, I ask ""How is everyone?"" It's a scene out of a concentration camp. Even in darkness, I see corpses stacked everywhere. A girl wearing a surgical mask approaches. I know this girl. She is somehow infected. I don't want to be near her. I try to push her down dark steps. As we struggle, she attempts to bite my hand, to lead me to others, to her parents. I resist. I don't want this. No. I don't want it."
"0390"	"(2017-06-22)"	"I go walking in the woods, confident that even as it grows dark there will be enough light to return. Soon I'm lost. In darkness, after making my way through a thick pine forest, then up a steep hill, I scamper up a clearing, only to discover it's the open lens of an astronomic telescope, similar to Mt. Palomar. [210] ""Nice,"" I say in ironic despair. I slide down the wide glass lens, run down a hill, and find my way to a familiar small town. The wide main street is lined with 1950's mom and pop stores. I will call a cab. I will find out where I am, choose a store, and call a cab to the store's location. But I don't have a taxi phone number. I continue walking, and am behind a tall attractive middle-aged woman. She's worried and begins to run. Is it me? Doe she think I'm odd or strange? At a long overhead awning which leads to a luxury apartment building, she turns left, and talks to a young woman about ""the girls,"" possibly her young daughters. It has nothing to do with me. I walk to a golf driving range. A large sign heralds its name. There are tall vertical barricade nets and individual driving booths. There are tall poles with field lights that illuminate the grounds. I will call a cab to this familiar friendly place."
"0391"	"(2017-06-24)"	"I'm sitting in a booth at a well lit uncrowded diner. Two tables away, a happy young couple, clearly hungry, tuck into their full plate meals of meat, potatoes and veggies. I want this food, but order something simpler. When I'm done I spread a paper towel upon the table; with another, I wipe my mouth. My waitress, who resembles Sophia Loren and Ester Greenspan, has laid her arm upon the table. [211] Her open hand awaits the napkin but I simply don't see it. The waitress is smiling at me. A brief exchange. Is she happy and good natured? Or are we flirting? I really like this woman. I would like to ask her out."
"0392"	"(2017-06-26)"	"Without warning a boy suddenly stabs the man near me, a painful, unmerciful thrust that kills him; a terrible way to die. With someone else, I hunt the boy down, do as he had done, and he falls to the ground, in agony holding his side. As he bleeds to death, we leave him. The dream repeats itself. This time the boy is skinny, dark completed, possibly from India. He sits at a table in a basement restaurant, carving small wood bowls. I begin talking to him, this quiet intensely intelligent child. When he tries to stab me I block the blade, call the police."
"0393"	"(2017-06-27)"	"Something bolts onto the wide bright green lawn. I stomp on it, but afterward can't shake it from my foot. Finally I flick the dead rabbit away. Have I been bitten? No. Still, I tell a young girl to get help."
"0394"	"(2017-06-27)"	"I've met a woman. At the M's house, after dinner we plan to make love. At a bodega, we look at cans of food, at one type in particular which has concentrated protein. Back at the house, the woman sits next to a charismatic man. She's clearly more interested in him then me. I sit to the right of them, forming an awkward triangle. On the table, a large carrot cake. Is it the one bought by Florence? No. I'm angry, sad, disappointed, but try to be happy for the new couple. I will leave. I will leave the table and not return."
"0395"	"(2017-07-02)"	"Half asleep in my bedroom, I hear someone nearby. Outside the window, looking in, a man obscured by a burlap curtain. We grapple and I pull him inside. He and Dave B have done construction work on my bedroom. The man, who has a DA haircut, says they've done two jobs here without my knowledge. I yell at this man. I tell him that's not right, grab him by his clothes and begin to slam his head against the wall. My first attempts are awkward, but I get the knack and repeatedly bang his head into the wall. As Dave watches, the man breaks free, escapes my room, runs fifty meters across a courtyard, climbs into the window of an old brick apartment building. ""Dave. Your friend got away."" He doesn't care to answer. I think about going after the escaped man."
"0396"	"(2017-07-02)"	"I break into my grammar school, run down the hallways to the gym, to other areas, to a secret darkened third floor room. Twice, I do that. On the second time I forget my pack. When I return for it, janitors are present. I hear their voices, their cleaning movements. To reach the third floor, I enter unknown corridors and stairways, which lead to small well-kept living quarters. Outside, I must climb a flimsy string ladder to get back to the third floor. A janitor approaches. I must climb quickly, but it's difficult, there are only a few strings to grab hold of. ""Excuse me,"" I say to an attractive middle-aged woman who passes by. In a kind voice, she says the same to me."
"0397"	"(2017-07-02)"	"It's morning. My dog sleeps in bed with me. I'm so happy to see her. She whines a bit. Is she sick? Restless? Does she need to go outside?"
"0398"	"(2017-07-03)"	"At a college or Y orientation, a well dressed Harvard student, thin, somewhat arrogant, tells me he's leaving. The program or position he wants is not on offer. I go into the black and white tiled bathroom, don a jacket and tie, remove the tie. Back with the students, I'm bare chested. Secretly, I want them to view my body, which is firm and trim. The scene changes. In a small darkened room, along with dozens of students packed like sardines, I lie on my back, bare chested. I want to be seen."
"0399"	"(2017-07-04)"	"A young couple, having lost their way, spend the night on the first floor of the house I share with my girlfriend. Something about them is not right. Are they drunkards? Thieves? Addicts? Do they have guns? As I lie in bed on the second floor, the man, I imagine it's him, taps gently on the first floor walls. Or is he drilling holes with a nail? I've had enough. I'm calling the police. ""I want them out of there,"" I will tell the 911 operator. ""I want them out of here."""
"0400"	"(2017-07-04)"	"At a small once well-stocked book store, two twelve year old girls peruse the shelves. I consider telling them there were more books to select from, now there are less. ""Mister, can you take us to a dojo?"" one girls asks. I tell her no. I tell her, ""You can go to a dojo and ask to sit on the sides and observe. That's the way to do it."" She insists. One of the girls attempts to touch my crotch. I start to leave. I will call the police and tell them a young girl has tried to fondle me. I hope the police will believe what I say, not place me under arrest."
"0401"	"(2017-07-07)"	"I'm sitting in a studio with several young people, in a building similar to Ivy Hill. The room was once part of a larger apartment. From the pair of futon beds that occupy most of the space, I can tell that two people live here. There is hardly anything else, only the built-in wall cabinets, a translucent plastic cabinet on the floor. In Brooklyn, this is what it has come to. At night, in the darkened hallway, I meet two loud, crazed older men, tenants, possibly high. Each man tries to intimidate me, but I'm not afraid. Instead, I will tell the landlord not to rent to persons of this type. Eating a sandwich, I walk outside to Ivy Hill Park. After circling the building, I return to the room, but all the young people are gathered outside on a large wood porch. Suddenly, the lights go out, but no one panics. Back at the room, I talk with people who look familiar. I ask a man if I've shown him my dream journal, and check to make sure it's still in the plastic cabinet on the floor. But this isn't my room. I will return to my apartment."
"0402"	"(2017-07-08)"	"Underground, I'm in a long line waiting to buy a subway ticket. I ask the tall young bushy haired man in front of me, ""Is this the way to Boston?"" He says yes, but he's drunk. The people in the line walk down a long beige painted corridor to the ticket booth. I walk quickly, ahead of everyone else. The door to the booth is open but there's no one inside. On the hazy window, a small poster advertises an independent record album. From a back door, a light-skinned young black woman enters the booth. She prepares her desk, then steps to the window, looks at me, and says, ""Yes?"" I tell her, ""Round trip to Boston,"" and pay for the ticket in cash. The scene changes. In a large underground corridor, I'm standing with a man and a woman, waiting for the subway. A distinguished light-skinned black man, wearing a sport jacket and bow tie, arrives. Confident and erudite, he asks if anyone likes poetry, and from a book begins reading aloud. The book's cover has the identical circle/triangle symbol as the poster in the window. When he's done reading, the man remarks that THIS is poetry, or NOW you've heard poetry. But he's actually read from 2600. [212] Abruptly, he departs. In disbelief, the woman looks at the man near her, as if to mockingly ask, ""What was THAT?"" Or has she understood that the three of us have witnessed an enlightened event?"
"0403"	"(2017-07-09)"	"I'm lying in bed with a beautiful black woman. She's slender, with straight shoulder length hair and full plump breasts. Kneeling over me, she fondles my cock. I tell her to lean closer, so I can suckle her breasts. When she does, I say, ""Yes, just like that."""
"0404"	"(2017-07-09)"	"I'm sitting in the front seat of a car being driven by my grandfather. He has mangled the genitals of a black man. ""Are they going to sue"" I ask. He says yes, the family will sue."

"0406"	"(2017-07-11)"	"In the woods, as it grows dark, my friend Joan and I walk down a dirt trail. As we head toward a mall to shop, we talk about technology. To learn Spanish Joan wants to buy captioned DVDs. I tell her that's really cool. I tell her that when DVDs first came out, to be able to switch languages, to change the channels by remote control, was amazing. ""I hadn't had a remote control in 20 years."" Joan says, ""And you just sit there and change the channel. I know. 'Click-click. Click-click.'"" A male jogger, with unruly black hair, and wearing red trunks, runs by. A car winds up the road; I step to one side."
"0407"	"(2017-07-12)"	"Late at night, with the wife of a friend, we return to a large hotel or mansion and continue to play at flirting. When she goes to a kitchen cupboard for something to eat, to freshen my breath, I tear off a fragment from a large cake coated with chocolate. But the cake is not chocolate and I'm disappointed. My friends wife reaches into a shelf for a bag of rolls. As she stands on a cobblestone floor, she stumbles, nearly falls, climbs to a small cubby atop the cupboard. From there she watches a kitten repeatedly jump at me, claw its way up my sport jacket, like a stubborn goat bang its head into me, bite me, fall to the floor. This happens several times. The biting becomes vicious, painful, causing me to struggle, to yell, ""Stop! Stop!"""
"0408"	"(2017-07-13)"	"A group of young people play a game lead by their teacher, an old man who resembles Eric Remarque. [213] He tells them whoever wants to can improvise a brief nonsense song or dance. Marc V enthusiastically spreads his arms several times and utters a sing song phrase. The effort is interesting but uninspired. A moment later, with similar results, he tries again, heedless of being impolite. Another boy volunteers. As with Volpe, his effort is avid but stale. These are my impressions, my judgements. As for me, I'm too shy to perform, though I could be much better. The scene changes. Marc V, wearing a 19th century military uniform, is lead from jail. So that he does not run away, the teacher accompanies him, protects him. As part of his punishment, Volpe carries a half-size M16, a small fan at the barrel tip. As he walks forward, his face filled with despair, I consider that by force of will he can overcome the annoyance of the small weapon and fan."
"0409"	"(2017-07-14)"	"In Vietnam, years after the war has ended, another man and I come upon a sort of warehouse in the countryside, stocked full with beautiful handmade wood bowls, tables and cabinets, desks and chairs. I'm about to go up a narrow stairway when the other man, on the second floor, tells me, ""There's nothing here."" After looking about, outside we find more wood products, and spread upon the ground like skeletons, yokes and harnesses made of thick plastic rope, likely worn by slaves. In a dank workshop basement a man describes a Vietnam vet who drove USO girls to various rear bases. [214] He says we knew this man, and shows me his tarnished medallion, the words inscribed upon it illegible. We leave the workshop to walk through a village, where I meet, or imagine meeting Ba. I ask Ba what the Vietnamese do upon finding the remains of their war dead. It must still happen. What do the Vietnamese do?"
"0410"	"(2017-07-14)"	"Inside a pitch black cave made of coal, I'm digging. Except for gravity, it's impossible to know which way is up or down. I know that every so often the coal will fracture, break apart, creating space and air, but the risk of cave in, of being buried alive, is constant. I keep digging, unafraid, hoping to find a way out."
"0411"	"(2017-07-15)"	"I enter the second floor of Dave B's apartment. Among the people present, I see Michelle M, stretched out on a black wood board. [215] A dark husky-like dog sits up, but not, as I expected, to greet me, or approach when I call it. ""Here, babe,"" says Michelle, offering me a joint. But I don't want it, or her, and passive aggressively sit by the dog. After saying hello, a thin young man with unruly black hair, who might be Mike E, says, ""I heard you weren't feeling well."" [216] ""That was something else,"" I tell him. ""This is different."" ""I think you're a cop,"" he says. He's lying but wants me killed. Concealing my fear, I tell him, ""That's your perception, pal."" I have to leave this place. These people want to kill me. I wake with fear and dread."
"0412"	"(2017-07-19)"	"At night, on a country road, I find my way to the M's house, which resembles the home where my father lived with his large family. A truck appears to be heading this way, it's headlights glare in the darkness. I have fear but wonder, who is it? What do they want? The truck idles, turns round, leaves. Even so, I run to the front yard, push past a scaffold of moveable steps, causing it to lean sideways, run a gauntlet of tall grass and shrubs, finally enter the house, where a party is just ending. My cousin Marna, who is young, appears dazed. She is also Patti M, with two children: a beautiful infant, possibly Justin; a toddler, possibly Travis. Whereas Justin happily thinks the world revolves around him, Marna is unhappy. Is this the woman Uncle Shelly (her father) deserted? A third brother, a teenager, arrives. Marna complains to him that the toddler is the center of her world. After an awkward pause, she and I walk up a narrow staircase to find the party guests. For an instant, I see my neighbor wandering the hall. Discovering the room we wish to enter is locked, we go outside; someone has left the front door open. Entering, we walk upstairs to the large crowded bedroom, where an erudite black youth tells me he once stood near a female rock star."
"0413"	"(2017-07-20)"	"I'm happy, walking down a residential street, similar to Highland Place, headed toward a familiar wood. A young man with two off leash terriers heads my way. In my good mood I hold a pretzel up to the running dogs, which run and jump for it. But the pretzel is too salty. I withhold it. Further on, I pass a tall brick building. From an upper floor, two boys throw water bombs which land not from me. I look up. A horses head and long neck hang from an open window. I imagine calling the police. It's hot. I take off my beige canvas pants, leave them on the sidewalk, go on my way. Near the military-like water front I'm aware there's a choice to decide. Take the ferry or continue on foot. I'll walk. Suddenly I realize I'm wearing only a T shirt and underwear; my phone, keys and wallet are in my pants. Panicked, I head back to Highland Place. On the sidewalk I see a large heavy cart, and push it along. When it gains speed I'll hop on; the carts momentum will power the trip. But the cart belongs to a building contractor who's searching for tools inside his VW van. I stop the cart just in time. A collision would have crumpled the VW's side door or fender. I continue walking. My pants might still be there. Or someone may have rifled the pockets. I mull over cancelling my credit cards, replacing my phone and keys."
"0414"	"(2017-07-22)"	"In a basement similar to 39 Ivy Street someone demonstrates the properties of black crayons adaptable to floor tiles. The family dog, a young Shepherd Setter mix, begins to lick the black residue from the tiled floor. I tell her to stop, but the chalk is sweet and flavorful, and she will not listen. Finally, I grab her. Anticipating being hit, she rolls on her back. But I hold the dog, nestle her to my neck, pet her, love her, to the point where I become aroused."
"0415"	"(2017-07-23)"	"In a cozy auditorium, My former girlfriend Karen and I attend a poetry reading organized by people we know. A man wearing a short brimmed cap steps to the stage. He has chiseled features, a compact build, a sureness about himself, much like a man known from actual poetry events. High on the wall to his left, hangs a bust of himself; I consider it odd. The man describes his book, talks about what he will read. The next thing I know, the lights come on, people are clapping. I had slept through the reading. The man now describes the woman who paid for the bust, which is incomplete. He relates the animosity between them, how he put a pin in the sculpture, how she retaliated. In some way, this all relates to the Civil War. As the man starts to leave, I wonder if he noticed that I had slept. My former girlfriend Karen asks me, ""What would you like to do?"" I tell her there's a store across the street where I can buy a snack, but I'm really struggling with whether to say, ""I want to be with you,"" or ""I want to stay here with you."""
"0416"	"(2017-07-24)"	"Evening. In a parking lot near the woods, I'm with two young men, about to complete a drug deal. One of the men, who is black, and armed with a forty-five pistol and money, is in charge. I grow impatient. What are we waiting for? The black man orders one of the dealers to hand me a Luger-like long-barreled twenty-two caliber pistol. I stand up, walk about, clear my throat. Finally, we leave, but other men are approaching. ""Allah!"" they shout. ""Allah!"" the young black man shouts in reply. ""Hey man, I'm not messing around,"" he says. But something is not right. Who are these men? I imagine they may kill us with shots to the head."
"0417"	"(2017-07-25)"	"Out in a field, under a sunny blue sky, in the distance, a woman I want to meet. I can tell that her bear is tame, and I'm not afraid to call it. Even so, I start to run. ""Come on! Come on!"" I yell, as the beast, like a huge shaggy dog, trundles toward me. Closing in, I see its huge sharp teeth, its foamy white spittle, its slobbering pink tongue. The woman runs toward us, trying to calm the bear, which verges on play and attack. At the last possible moment, the beast slides to the ground; I begin petting it. I have no fear, but I'm fully aware of my close call with danger."

With his back to the audience, Senator Sanders stands at a bookcase stocked with books on law. A black bound volume falls to the floor. Immediately the other books tilt left and right. Someone says, ""You know where this is going."" As the moderator continues his query, Senator Sanders collapses. I lean over him, touch his carotid artery, say to him, ""Bernie... Bernie..."" He seems dead, then starts to breathe. ""I'm sick,"" he says. I yell to the audience, ""Call the police! Is there a doctor here? Call the police!"" Someone yells, ""I'm trying. What's the room number?"" I don't know and it doesn't matter. They should make the call. The police or EMT will figure it out."

I have trouble breathing, several times clear my throat. Finally I get up, walk to the door. The woman, wearing pajamas, lies upon her bed, splayed provocatively. ""You too,"" I say, and sit next to her. ""Oh, no you don't,"" she says. I say, ""Look, Pauline..."" ""Toots,"" she says sternly. ""Call me Toots. And don't try anything."" I tell her I'm not hitting on her, but she's probably heard that before. Calmly, I say, ""You're a good- looking woman. Guys probably hit on you all the time. I'm sorry if someone hurt you. I'm not into that."" She remains wary, defiant. I say, ""Here is the cliche part of the movie. Beneath that hard exterior, you're a nice person."" She is gruff, but less so. I like this woman. I really like her."

After the meal the family lines up to say goodbye, and I look forward to their hugs. But the two son's offer only brief embraces. Finally, the father a tall distinguished man, his leathery face a warren of crags and valleys, towers over me, holds me gently to his chest. At parting, in a jocular way, he says he will contact me about his next protest action, at a jail. Waking, with deliberation I say, ""Thank you for dropping by."""
"0421"	"(2017-07-28)"	"I'm in Rowley, where Hilary Clinton went to college; I keep expecting to see her. In a large empty classroom, on a wide desk, I set up my computers: an old Apple desktop, its boxy monitor, my HP laptop. I want to view porn but students arrive. I have to pee. Returning from the bathroom, I find the desk empty. Is this the right room? I search several nearly identical classrooms. I should have known better. My wallet, the computers and peripherals, my flip phone are gone. I'll feel angry later. Right now I'm disappointed in myself. I should file a police report, and contact the credit card companies, but without their 800 numbers I'll have to call a friend to avoid the 411 fee. Walking through cavernous halls similar to New York's 42nd Street subway station, with its circus like gaudy stores, long grim passages, I ask a student for directions. Go straight, he says, then left. In a cramped stairway I struggle to climb over a pastel painted bannister. An sickly looking old man helps me, but several times grabs my crotch. What's wrong with him? Where are his boundaries? Finally I meet two male students. ""And they got the Iron Key, too,"" I tell them. ""What's that?"" asks the handsome boy with long dark blonde hair. ""It's an encrypted thumb drive."" ""Oh,"" he says, ""you really have to be good to have one of those."" I tell him I'm not technically savvy, but as we walk through a dark blasted landscape, littered with debris, he doesn't hear what I've said. ""Why would anyone at this school steal my computers?"" I ask. ""They could have been vodking, or doing kratom,"" he replies. [217]"

[218] He fears being caught in a mortar attack and asks the quickest route to the barrel/box commode. I tell him, ""My idea is less logical but more practical."" Pointing to the green sloping lawn that is no-man's-land, I say, ""You practice sprinting fifty meters and back. Do that three or four times. Rest twenty seconds. Do it again."" The fearful FNG listens to my every word. The scene changes. Pointman Larry Roy and I walk through the base, a grim desolate wasteland of battle worn equipment, forlorn bunkers, upturned earth. As in life, Larry is talkative, energetic. ""What's with Rudy and water?"" he asks in his high pitched voice. I tell him Rudy and the other grunts are obsessed with water. I tell him about the FNG. We pass a REMF bunker with a private latrine. [219] I say, ""I need to use this place."" ""Sure,"" says Larry, as we enter, ""we can keep talking."" There are two toilets either end of the decrepit latrine. I take the near one. Larry sits on the other, twenty-five meters away. ""I haven't done this in a long time, "" I tell him, recalling the communal toilets at Fort Sam. We proceed to talk and defecate."

""No more with them,"" I say."

Soon, just thirty or forty feet off the ground, I'm speeding down a country highway. Passing the mangled body of a crushed cat stained by blood and gore, I say, ""I'm sorry."" Next, I pass the large crumpled body of an Irish Setter. A flying motorcycle, I'm going too fast, losing control. As if the bike was a living thing, I coax it to land. ""Easy. Easy,"" I say to it. A small young Hispanic woman, unattractive, dismounts from the machine. Diminutively, she says, ""Soon, stomach is regular."" I take this to mean her period has ended. In a fatherly way, I tell her, ""Good. Good."""

""Seven fifty,"" says the waitress, an attractive, chatty, gaunt brunette who wears a paper tiara in her 1940s style hair. She places two large glass soda bottles and another item into a white paper bag, but I've forgotten the Danish, which sits on the counter, obscured by the napkin holder. ""And this too,"" I tell her, picking up the savory. Her large brown eyes dart back and forth as she bags the Danish, adds up the total. ""$3.20,"" she says furtively, which seems over priced. As if reading my thoughts she says, ""I gave you another."""
"0427"	"(2017-07-31)"	"A man from my platoon gives me a computer tablet. Later, I boot up and find a dozen photo portraits of men in the platoon. In these 1969 close ups, each man stares directly into the camera, expressionless, unsmiling. Round faced or oval, pie faced or square, they are hollow, empty, grim. I recognize the barb wire and sand bag bunkers which appear in several snap shots, and imagine kneeling in front a blast wall, as though it was an alter. I must give these 1969 photos, of men before my time, to Mike W. I will email them to Jerry, who will show them to Mike."
"0428"	"(2017-08-01)"	"In Washington, DC I'm in a posh hotel room with three fellow reporters. Our story assignment cancelled, we've decided to stay the night. The Frenchman, an acetic looking older man with a shaved head, in a thick accent, asks, ""Does anyone have any stories to tell?"" But there are concerns about security; the room may be bugged. Warily, the other's leave, but I stay, feeling somewhat guilty to depart this luxurious room with its costly drapes, expensive bed and fine furniture, its landscape views. Outside, on the trail below, an athletic girl runs past. Soon after, I hear two or three people approaching; they walk up the slate stairway, which is similar to my grandparents summer house. These reporters think they're late to the story. ""Entrez...entrez,"" I call to them through the screened windows and door. Seated tableside, everyone jovial, I tell them how you sit and talk, are assigned a number, so that, for example, you are number five, and everything you say, you write down, they know it's you by your number. ""And the more you talk, the more you are digging your grave, paragraph by paragraph."" I relate these things quickly, in a humorous manner, which the reporters find funny."

Motherfuckers."" I'm fearful of the falling bullets. When my brother urges me to keep quiet I seek shelter in his arms. The enemy ignites skyrockets that soar up, bursting harmlessly over us. My brother says that a man he knows has killed two men, and that he is emotionally distraught. I want to know more, but my brother won't tell me. The scene changes. It's dark. I'm near an enormous black dumpster, where an amorphous black creature, partly obscured, tries to attack me. I trap the creature inside the dumpster, and lock shut the heavy metal door. As the creature rails and struggles to escape, gleefully, I yell, ""You can't get out! You can't get out!"" But the creature manages to climb half way out, and we begin grappling. I'm afraid, but rally myself to face this protean black thing, to abandon my fears, and fight the monster, grab and fight it."

At one point I embrace Karen from behind, and press my loins into her. From beneath her flowing skirt, I press two fingers to the cleft impressed on her panties, and gently massage it. Karen says, ""It's getting wet. Don't do it. Stop."" And I stop, telling her, ""You're so beautiful."""

On the floor, as if thrown down and abandoned, sits a white wood shutter, the two panels, at right angles, glued in place. But all the windows have their shutters. Who put this one here? My dog saunters into the room, hopes up onto the bed, sheltering herself f in my arms. I talk to her, asking her what she wants. Outside, it's raining, stormy. When I open the door to my mother's room, I behold an extraordinary sight. In place of the white walled cubicle, with its triple window pane, compact twin bed, the little faux antique desk and ice cream parlor chair, the brown veneer bureau, there is instead a great dark hall, filled with exotic furnishings, foreign curios, fine costly rugs, travel souvenirs from around the world. Close by, completely still, with a towel or white cloth or veil covering his head, my brother sits quite and erect in a wing back chair. I look at the round clock high up on the wall. I say to my brother, ""Dave, it's nearly 2am, and she's not here."" ""Don't worry,"" he says, ""She'll be here."""

Flat on the ground, the oblong headstone consists of translucent flower petals which form Monroe's black silhouette upon a background of white. Nearby, spaced a meter apart, the living graves of several young women, college students, who are dressed in white diaphanous gowns, and who lie upon their backs. A slim and pretty girl says she's bored with this summer job. Several girls note the pay, low at $8.50 per hour."
"0433"	"(2017-08-05)"	"In a foreign country, near a railroad station, hundreds of people gather in a large open field; a dance or celebration is underway. I meet a dark complected middle-aged Indian woman. She is sad and serious, and I ask her to dance with me. As we make our way into the crowd, she sees her husband with a much younger woman, and becomes upset. ""What do you want to do?"" I ask her. ""Do you want to confront him?"" She says yes, we head to where we last saw him, but I lose sight of the Indian woman, find a place on the sidelines, sit and watch people. Fifty yards behind me, on a quiet street, stands a dilapidated building, its rotted rattan shutters, which appear blackened from fire, and which bow outward, as if any moment they will collapse, occasionally are stirred by wind. Or are young boys inside the abandoned building? Little thieves. ""I see you fucker's,"" I shout. Not wanting my back to them, I stand up and begin walking to the end of the field. Soon, my pants, which are made of a single piece of winding cloth, start to unravel. I hitch them up, ignoring the two young men behind me, who have seen this happen many times. I cross a ravine, climb a small hill, arrive at the far end of the field and gaze at the people. In order to pee, I step back down. Just then two young women, American hikers, walk past. I sit on the ground and lace my boots. One of the women, a bit of tom boy, attractive and fit, sits next to me. She asks if I have any antiseptic, and points to the long scar that winds down her leg. The large wart on her kneecap is in the same place I have a puncture scar from fighting with my brother. I tell her, ""I'm sorry. I don't."" I like this woman. She's friendly, open, sincere. Someone approaches: a man with a clean shaven head and prominent nose sits behind me. I sense trouble, and imagine trying to hit him in the ear to put him off balance. When that fails, grappling, he tries to pinch my nose."

We decide to return to the hotel, but she will meet me there. After waiting in the spartan adobe-like room, with its sharp angles and perfect shadows, I grow impatient and leave. Careful not to be seen, I walk through a sun drenched adobe walled alley bordered by shrubs and trees, which leads to a verdant field. I levitate, at first rising inch by inch off the ground. Finally, gaining speed and height, I'm flying, following the path of railroad tracks a hundred feet below. In the distance, coming towards me, a train locomotive shaped like the fuselage of a C-123 cargo plane. [220] There is the roar of its mighty prop and jet engines, the sight of the immense black sphere painted on its nose. As we rush toward each other I let out a whoop of joy. Somehow, we do not collide. Once home, upon opening the door to my apartment, a grim, low ceilinged prison-like cell, I find my bed, nearly all my possessions, are gone. Where will I sleep? I'll have to buy a new futon. As well, the toilet has flushed all this time. Filthy water fills the deep ruts in the equally filthy cement floor. I walk out and enter the next door apartment. Windowless, but roomy, with a broad parquet floor, a spacious white painted bookcase, pastel painted walls, it resembles my Brooklyn apartment. A stocky light-skinned black man, his back toward me, busies himself straightening things up. ""I'm sorry,"" I say, ""I thought this was my apartment."" He doesn't mind, but grimaces when I tell him the apartment needs windows."
"0435"	"(2017-08-07)"	"In a bathroom similar to that at Highland Place, a tall woman, slender and attractive, her golden hair tied in bun, says she's my mother. Undoing her white terrycloth bathrobe, she bares her breasts. Immediately I want to suckle them. But she is cold, haughty, and leaves. Standing there alone, I'm frustrated, confused. The scene changes. On a bright clear day, at a field track whose seats are supported by white roller coaster-like scaffolds, which curve inward, like immense inverted ribs, I run laps. The golden haired woman runs close behind me. In a Dylanesque way I sing the words, ""Well, I don't mind...this whole 'Viet Naa ahm waaar.'"" To make running easier, I begin taking off my pants. Reaching forward, the woman helps me remove them."
"0436"	"(2017-08-08)"	"A baseball game is under way in a partially overgrown field similar to that at Elk Grove Camp. Fifteen or sixteen years old, I'm at bat, determined not to swing unless the ball is perfectly thrown. There is tension each time Steve Shack winds up to pitch. This time, slightly high and to the right, the ball roars in. I lean slightly back and downward, letting it sail over my head. Everyone waits for the umpires call. Full count. The next two pitches, intentionally low, skim the ground. Hurriedly, I trot to first base, which is partially obscured by tall grass and scrub. There are men on base. There is tension."
"0437"	"(2017-08-11)"	"In the shapeless night things have fundamentally changed. My father moves slowly towards me, his large leathery face deeply lined. He's sightless. ""I'm sorry,"" I tell him, and ask his forgiveness."
"0438"	"(2017-08-11)"	"Everywhere is complete darkness. Hearing someone, I make my way toward them. ""Where is everything?"" I ask. What is that scraping noise?"
"0439"	"(2017-08-12)"	"On a beach in a foreign country, I walk up a tall sand dune, hoping people will look at my firm abs. Sitting on a skeletal wood platform, the life guard calls out in Spanish. Is he talking to me? He is not, but I would have ignored him anyway. From the top of the dune, hoping to see land, I gaze upon a half dozen gray sandy inlets where several families casually swim in pools of clear water. With no land to cross, I turn around, descend the dune by sinking two feet into the sand; my body's momentum carries me down hill. On the level wet shoreline, fit men and boys in swim trunks speed past on motorized surf boards. One man, racing towards me at 30 to 40 miles an hour, passes by within inches. I think, ""These things are totally unregulated."" I walk down an alley, past several soccer playing youth. Moments later, as two players, a man and a boy, give chase, their colorful green ball rolls past. Half-heartedly I try to stop it, then continue walking, searching for the street. It's no use, the graffiti sprayed alley is walled in, a dead end. ""Where's the exit,"" I ask the older player, a man wearing blue coveralls. He motions in the opposite direction, glancing at his friend; he indicates he thinks I'm stupid. We walk a few meters, he stops to open a padlocked door, beckons me inside. I will not enter this trap. Sensing imminent danger, wanting to run, I walk away. Waking, I have dread."
"0440"	"(2017-08-13)"	"In a foreign country, I'm a front seat passenger in a car driven by a short black haired Indian man. There's little space between the front seat and dashboard; we're both nearly pressed against it. Two other short Indian men sit in back. At a cross roads, a sizable American car from the opposite direction veers head on into us. The moment of impact, so plain, so factual, unfurls in slow motion. After the loud jarring crash, the driver and I, the two men in back, exit the car, unhurt but shaken. The persons in the other vehicle require medical help. Who has a phone? Who is calling the police, the EMT? Where are we? What is the address? I walk about. The landscape, with its seaweed choked oasis and tall palms, seems prehistoric. A passing black woman, her face serene, aristocratic, her high hair wrapped in a turban, ignores my pleas. Walking down a muddy embankment, careful so as not to fall, I lose my footing and slide into the murky water, which is back lit by the sun. A large sleek fish, half shark, half trout, which I had seen before falling in, gnaws steadily at my hands. I struggle to push it away, and wake with fear."
"0441"	"(2017-08-14)"	"With two homeless women I share a below street level spartan room. There's tension here. Our belongings are scattered all around the cement floor. I reach a breaking point, go berserk, lift the women, their possessions, off the ground; like rag dolls toss them repeatedly down. One woman, cocooned in a tangle of dark curly hair, clothes and blankets, lays motionless, dazed. The other woman stares aimlessly into space. Outside, a woman from next door runs past the street level window. I start to leave, to walk up a long ramp, past the aimless woman, to tell our neighbors what I've done."
"0442"	"(2017-08-14)"	"My brother and I walk along a sandy shore, much like Jetty's Beach on Nantucket. Suddenly, enormous seals rise from the water, repeatedly dive down, as they swim to land. Huge sleek animals, dark rose in color, the intelligent creatures have small narrow mouths, sharp pointy teeth. I take off running, jump over the water, fall short, manage to pull myself up to the old wooden dock. With strength and agility, I grasp a windows safety bars, contort, wriggle, work my way into the darkened house. Anyone watching will have noticed my strong fit body, my tight firm abs."
"0443"	"(2017-08-15)"	"On a cold rainy autumn night, I'm walking down Highland Place, heading home. The lights of the second floor living room stream past the slatted blinds. As I walk up the staircase, the outer glass door swings loudly shut. The neighbors must be used to its annoying metallic clap. My mother stands in the open upstairs doorway. ""Oh, hi mom,"" I say, entering the apartment. ""I bought some things for dinner,"" she replies. My dog wags her tail excitedly. An expectant look fills her face. Out. She wants to go out. I will do anything for this dog."
"0444"	"(2017-08-15)"	"I'm with my squad on patrol in a North American landscape of forested hills and valleys. Suddenly we're caught in an ambush. The roar of weaponry is overwhelming. There's little cover, nowhere to hide. I shelter behind the dead and wounded. I'm thinking, ""So this is how it ends. I'm going to die."" I pluck a full magazine from the bandolier of a dead or wounded soldier but in the chaos I keep pushing it into the magazine well the wrong way. The scene changes. With little cover, we're setting up a perimeter on a dark earthy hill. I'm neatly laying out the items in my wallet, a few things from my pack. Fifty meters ahead, a grunt tosses a frag near the mouth of a cave. There is the fiery blast, moments later dust and bits of sharp blow toward us. I can tell they're harmless. In a kind voice I say to the grunt, ""I wish you hadn't done that."""
"0445"	"(2017-08-16)"	"On a cloudy day, in a grassy field, I'm seated in the cockpit of a WWI biplane, trying to operate the controls. Rudder, clutch, joystick. I can't make sense of anything. It's so discouraging. I want to learn how to fly. The scene changes. In a larger grassy field, Skinny Bob and several men from my platoon sit inside a space ship. The craft resembles a large upturned copper kettle, its entire surface, like tooled leather, pocked by hammer blows. Set in brass sashes, small circular windows gird its sides. I sit nearby, watching, offering encouragement. Initially, things look well. The craft lifts up, slowly circles the field. It begins to wobble. ""Straighten out,"" I yell to the men inside. The unsteady space ship makes several dips, lazily falls to the ground, tumbles to a stand still. At once, I rush to the overturned thing, call out to the men trapped inside, collect the delicate brass gears, unbroken pieces of glass which lie strewn about. The precious parts can be used to repair or rebuild the damage craft. The men inside are unhurt."
"0446"	"(2017-08-17)"	"In a dark walled corridor similar to My old high school, my brother and I reach for bags of food sitting atop a small shed. ""Who brought those here?"" I ask. My brother names the person. Each paper bag or cellophane sack contains a type of bread. There are fluffy rolls, white loaves, soft round pita, scraps of twisted salt pretzels. When I open that bag, the crumbs fall to the green floor, into the shed. Except for its white speckled linoleum tiles, inside the shed, which resembles the M's unfinished Ivy Street basement, it's dark, dank, forbidding. I kneel, pick up the scraps, which include squashed peas. Who will clean the floor? Sweep and mop it?"
"0447"	"(2017-08-19)"	"Young and confident, I walk down the aisle of a large room filled with women, here to meet men. Large women, tall women, old, pale and plain women, fill the student chairs with their cumbersome arm rests. They are talking, hopeful, slightly anxious, looking about. Toward the right front of the room, I see an attractive, dark haired, fit and buxom woman wearing a fashionable solid color knit skirt and blouse. She is the one person here I want to meet. To her left sits the young Italian, Joe F. As in high school, he is tall, dark complected, with a swimmer's athletic build. Though not handsome, his large black eyes dominate his skull; his black hair, neatly slicked back, is rakishly parted to one side. As in life, he is haughty, conceited, arrogant. The woman, slouched in her chair, avoids eye contact. ""Anyone sitting there?"" I ask Joe, pointing to the empty seat to her right. In his smug way he ignores me. I repeat the question, this time louder, insistent. Still no answer. Drawn by the threat of conflict, I sit next to the woman."
"0448"	"(2017-08-20)"	"At a summer day camp, I share a bunk with my brother's counselor, recognizable by his widow's peak, cleft chin, his stocky wrestler's build. In the darkened room, beneath the green Army wool blanket, as we sleep in the small bed, when Bob's arm touches mine, I inch away, imagine sex with Susan. The scene changes. I'm alone in a tiny room similar to one rented in Todos Santos. Is it the wind, is someone trying to enter through the single small window? I imagine hitting them while they're caught in broken glass. The next day, in the forest, on a dirt road, I'm trying to ride a too tall bicycle. The trick is to wheel forward, step on one pedal, then hop on. ""I'll get use to it,"" I tell myself. I pedal up a steep hill, coast down, then ride fifty yards down the straight road, back to Bob. But train tracks have replaced the road, and I imagine speeding up, trying to avoid the train behind me. I imagine being flattened, crumpled to death. I thank Bob for using the grunt photo taken in Song Be. I tell him that by placing it at the end, some people will connect the image with the other pictures of myself. Those few people will understand the deeper meaning of his film."
"0449"	"(2017-08-21)"	"On a cold rainy night I sneak into Nan's big warm comfortable house. [221] The lights are out. I step quietly, telling myself Nan must be upstairs; old or sleeping, she can't hear me. By touch, I make my way to the kitchen, tuck a long cylindrical paper bag into a cabinet. I think, ""When she sees this she'll wonder, 'How did that get here?'"" then ignore it. Cat-like, I retrace my steps through darkened rooms, past the hallway with many dark colored wide brim women's hats, each artfully hung on the wall, out to the back yard. But I've forgotten the chain link fence which surrounds it. With no supporting poles, the sagging fence is hard to climb. I manage to grab hold of a shiny white painted tree root and haul myself up, though nearly slipping onto the wet earth. Past the fence, I walk through a peninsular field similar to a boyhood moor on Nantucket. Down below, a petite young woman dressed in a brides white gown, walks this way. She hasn't seen me. I imagine calling out, ""It's the bride of Frankenstein!"" and walk towards her. Seeing me, she turns left. Oh well. From this high ground, I'll jump and fly home. How long will I stay aloft before landing in the sea? From high above a marina, looking down, the boats and walkways resemble beautifully patterned pastel quilts. I'm drifting. Which way is Salem? I'm not sure. Right. I need to go right. If I land in the ocean, I'll call someone, give them a sense of where I am."
"0450"	"(2017-08-21)"	"Two or three times over several weeks four out of town women have inquired about purchasing the house next door. In fact, I learn that they live close by. There they are, with friends, crowded around a large oval table with friends, excitedly talking, eating, being served by middle- aged light-skinned man who resembles Alberta, my grandmothers mulatto maid. Wearing a white plastic apron, he carries a large metal tray filled with hot dogs immersed in water. His catering business is called Dawgies Hot Dogs. Annoyed, I walk toward him, pick up a similar tray, and walk past the crowded table, intending to dump the hot dogs in the garbage can behind the house. How can I do that without being seen? The scene changes. I walk past a tall thin attractive young woman lying on a beach chair on the side walk. She wears a tight fitting green knit dress; her legs are drawn up. I know this woman from college. I say, ""Behind me, sitting at the table,"" and tell her all the above. Waking, I say, ""Anyway, how are you?"""
"0451"	"(2017-08-22)"	"The writer Rod Serling and I discuss writing. [222] He describes how he analyzes each word in scripts sent by fans. Taking my notebook, he confidently draws multiple diagonal lines across the page. ""Like that,"" he says. Detailing a recent story, he tells me, ""Look. A man is interlocked with a peach."" Surprised, embarrassed, I ask, ""Do you mean the guy's having sex with a peach?"" ""Yes,"" he replies, matter-of-factly. ""With a peach."""
"0452"	"(2017-08-23)"	"While my mother stand immobile at the kitchen sink my brother and I put garbage into bags. Among the debris, a long strand of black co-axial cable, which might be useful elsewhere. Both our parents, my father stands next to her, are dying. Somehow, my mother says, ""You know, Marc, there are standards of care..."" I tell her I don't care. I look in the sink, expecting to see vomit and urine. It's empty. My brother says he wants to stay. I tell him, no, we're leaving. I have no feelings for her. Not even anger. I have hatred. [223]"
"0453"	"(2017-08-25)"	"At the top of a tall, darkened staircase I confront a mysterious man or woman, dressed in black. As we rapidly descend the spiraling steps, I shout repeatedly, ""I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!"" The scene changes. In a low lit singles club with Jeff as I walk through a dark crowded hallway, a young man provocatively touches my palm. [224] To his whispered code word, I say, ""No,"" and continue walking. A large blonde woman ignores me. Through a glass double door overlooking a garden, Jeff and I watch a dozen off leash pedigree dogs nose and push forward a frightened Husky pup. To keep them out, I lock the door. Somehow they enter, and I find myself sitting on a brick ledge, beside a black Saint Bernard and a German Shepherd. The scene changes. I'm driving a motor boat through a wetland forest. When another boat, driven by a gay man, chases after me, I speed up. Above the engines' roar, in this game of cat and mouse, I hear him laughing. Entering a residential area of homes and narrow winding channels, I accelerate, taking the turns fast, trying to slip away. In wide open, calm water, the chasing boat draws near. Instead of a man, the square gray head of a one eyed toy robot squirts water at me. We talk. I say, ""I like girls."" ""You mean women,"" the robot corrected. I say, ""Girls, women. I don't care."" Waking, I say, ""I don't care."""
"0454"	"(2017-08-28)"	"With a community of men and several women, I'm living in an old brick castle-like mansion. We're doing laundry, communally sorting and washing clothes. Somehow my wash is folded and placed neatly in my laundry bag. A man tells me about a medicine he has used that would benefit my urinary problems. I tell him the cause is and enlarged prostate gland. As we fold and stack light green towels, I have trouble folding; over and over I can't get it right. I begin tethering an American flag to a Russian flag. I ask a man what he thinks. He says it's not a good idea. Far down the hall, two men struggle with a gigantic American flag, which they hope to hang inside. Just then, the young woman in charge, who is attractive but heavy set, begins to weep and wail. I'm thinking, ""If you lose fifty pounds you'll be prettier, and your health will improve."" The first person to reach her, my impulse is to throttle her, but at the last moment I lay beside her, put my arms around her, talk comfortingly to her, kiss her partially exposed breast. She says a man tried to knife her. Is she talking about me? The scene changes. At night, on flat land, I stand outside the mansion. From out of the darkness a thin young woman, followed by her two children, and two greyhounds, walks by. The happy children are carefree; the dogs, friendly but shy. Diminutively, as she passes, the woman says, ""Hello."" I walk to a brick balustrade overlooking the street. A group of rowdies is approaching. Loudly, they half sing, half chant, a bawdy or militant song. So as not to be seen and likely attacked, I duck down, peering out from spaces between the brick work. Across the street, a young woman, colorfully dressed as a scarecrow, pets a large friendly cat. Seeking affection, the animal is almost human, tenderly pawing the woman, rising up, curling itself into her. As the rowdies pass by, there is nothing to fear. They are young male office workers, with short black hair, dressed in slacks and white shirts, chanting a protest song."
"0455"	"(2017-08-30)"	"A man bearing a likeness to Donald Trump calls us to his large office building. He wants to somehow change it. No one agrees; we ignore him. A burly female cop, wearing a deep blue uniform, tried to boss me around. With ju-jitsu, I will throw her to the floor and pummel her."
"0456"	"(2017-08-30)"	"The sparse jungle offers little camouflage. Hiding here, the NVA will find me, will take me prisoner, march me down stony trails, causing my feet much pain."
"0457"	"(2017-08-31)"	"On a desolate farm, in a dirt lot, a very dark young Indian man, with intense, almost unmoving eyes, attempts to keep up with a frisky chestnut foal. As the energetic horse rears up, kicks, bucks, gambols, the Indian tries to mimic the animals unbounded frolic. The foal changes, becomes part kangaroo, its face, especially its emotive eyes, almost human. I imagine saying, ""Talk to me. Talk."" A few bees circle around us. Then a swarm of yellow jackets, their distinctive yellow and black abdominal bands clearly visible. While some people panic, I repeatedly swipe the air with large books or mats, which scatter the insects, and leave faint corkscrewing clouds in their wake. Close by, the moment a short older man and his wife depart from their 1950s house, something enters my ear. As if I'm underwater, my hearing becomes muted. The man asks if I'm OK. I tell him sort of, and shake my head to clear it, which helps to restore my hearing, though not quite all."
"0458"	"(2017-09-01)"	"At night, in a foreign land, I go from one restaurant to another, searching for someone. In each place, there are groups of men, exhausted, blank-eyed and bloodied, seated around a table. Above them, perched on a corner shelf, curled like a cat, a bludgeoned man near death. The men are cage fighters, fresh from the ring. As I walk past one such table, a man calls out, taunting me. His peers, like blood thirsty goons, join in. ""Who are you? What do you want?"" they growl and heckle. ""I've seen you before."" One man, with a shaved head, lean and muscular, younger than the rest, resembles the cage fighter Rory MacDonald. ""Oh, bullshit,"" I say, in reply to his jeers. We begin circling each other. I out feint him, strike past his guard. Outdone, he hides his fear. I have none, but to win this fight, I must take nothing for granted, keep vigilant, on guard."
"0459"	"(2017-09-01)"	"In a town like the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012. I meet a tall thin middle-aged cop who is tired, sleepy, and wants some place to rest. I know this man. He's a local cop. I tell him the library is close by; the staff will likely offer him an empty room. I lead the way, as we walk up and down the city's balmy streets. Again and again, I take the wrong turn. When the cop wonders where we are, I tell him the library has to be near. This happens several times. I'm thinking, ""He must be frustrated; at any moment he'll complain."" Yes, I tell him, they will let you lie down, but where is the library? I keep taking wrong turns."
"0460"	"(2017-09-03)"	"At night, as people leave, I'm standing in a field, a pasture, part of a large dairy farm. I've said good-bye to Chris D, to other friends, tried to pet the exotic dog, part Dalmatian, part hound, with its tufted orange ears. For their presentation, the new farm team, the family who oversee the farm, quickly assemble a barrier constructed of flat wood. As people gather in front of it, I look about. In the once empty field, twenty or thirty cows stand twenty or thirty meters apart. To no one in particular I say, ""Cows everywhere."" Dressed in blue overalls, a stocky, muscular woman, the mother of the family, the boss of the farm, who resembles Lisa K, though her features are shiny and hard set, like molded plastic, begins to speak. In a dramatic voice, she describes a ferocious cow. As she continues, from behind the wood wall, a half dozen doll heads, impaled on sturdy wire, rise up, to the accompaniment of suspenseful music. The scene changes. I'm lying on a mattress with a much younger woman who resembles Lisa K. The farm family, though they wonder about our age difference, have provided this bed. In fact, there is nothing between us. As we lay beneath the warm blanket, the stars overhead, vividly, the girl recalls the man who seduced her, having seduced another woman moments before. After a time, losing interest in her complex story, I say, ""I'm sorry this happened to you."""
"0461"	"(2017-09-04)"	"I'm in an airplane flying high over the earth, which is veiled by a cirrus cloud sky. Something terrible has taken place. A body, as if seen from a distance, falls from the plane, and I know who it is. The pilot begins a mournful dirge. Two young people doggedly sail past, snow boarding the air. From far away, a long black scarf plummets to earth. In these moments, realizing that this is how the dream will end, I say, ""That's the end of John."""
"0462"	"(2017-09-05)"	"As an adult, I'm living at home with brother and mother and two new siblings, a boy and a girl. The problem is there are rats. I find one on the bed, another that has dug a hole in the dirt where my new brother and sister are at play. I charge into the small square kitchen, where my mother, who is black, and standing, smokes a cigarette. ""Where is my white sweater?"" I yell at her. She is flustered, angry, then quiets when I tell her, ""We have rats. Not mice. Rats. The size of my fist rats!"" She becomes tearful. ""You take care of it. You're going to live here,"" she says. ""No,"" I tell her. ""I'm not going to live here. We have rats!"" [226]"
"0463"	"(2017-09-05)"	"I'm part of a bombing mission over India. As we approach the target, the mission changes. What's happening? Why? All at once, the bomb bay doors open, like bowling pins, the bombs drop. I see the earth engulfed in a bright orange cloud, but there is no noise, no expanding shock wave. The bomber lands. The bomb bay doors open. On the ground, I speak to an Indian man who asks if we'll be back. I tell him no. I tell him that HQ says the images are good, they have given us a new appreciation of India. Looking directly at this gaunt middle-aged man, I tell him, ""I'm glad we met. I hope the war ends soon."""
