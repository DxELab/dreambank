    "description": "Samantha is a college-educated woman in her twenties who volunteered her dream journal in September, 1999. It is first of all of interest because it is one of the most contemporary dream journals we have from someone under 30. It is also of interest because the dream narratives are often longer than in many journals. We purposely know nothing about her.  Samantha's relationships to the named characters in her dreams are listed at the end of each dream report. All names have been changed, and they are consistent throughout the series.  (E.g., \"Walter\" starts out as an ex-boyfriend and later becomes a boyfriend, but it is the same person.)"
