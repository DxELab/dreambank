    "description": "These 35 dreams were collected over a six-week period in the spring of 1995, by a mother who had her 10-year-old daughter say her dreams into a tape recorder each morning.  The result is a very unique and rich series that seems more believable than most dreams reported at home by young children.  They compare well in content and structure with dream reports from this age group in David Foulkes's Children's Dreams (1982), which is based on laboratory awakenings. This series can be usefully compared with the dreams of girls of the same age in \"Bay Area Girls,\" and also with the dream series from 7-year-old \"Melissa.\"  (For more information about Vickie, click here.)"
