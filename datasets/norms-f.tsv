"0001"	"I dreamed it was next summer and that I was going to be married to my boyfriend at home. Mother advised me not to, but said she would not stand in my way. He had very little money and George, after finally convincing me not to finish school, said maybe mother was right. I had made up my mind, however, and would not hear of a postponement. The next part is after we are married. Although I did not see the ceremony, I knew it was very simple. Someone asked where we should go on our honeymoon and I can't remember where I said, but they thought it was the place in Europe named the same. I was embarrassed when I said it was not. Then I thought maybe I should have married another fellow I know who would have taken me to Europe, but I immediately dismissed this from my mind. Mother said then that the place we were going was very nice, although neither of us had previously been there. This made me feel much better. Next we were sitting in a large dining room. George was drinking a beer and I had a coke. All of a sudden it struck me that this was my wedding night and I got nervous and sort of afraid. I then asked George to order me a double shot which I never did get to drink because I woke up."
"0002"	"I was at home but it was not our house. I saw my little brother (2) first and he looked as if he had just had a haircut. Then I went into what seemed to be the living room and my mother and cousin (29) Jack were there. Jack was planning a vacation to Canada. I told him he was foolish to drive all that distance since it was snowing so hard. As I said that, I walked to the window, pushed back the curtain, and watched the snow flakes, which were extremely large, fall to the ground. Complete change then. I'm in front of a mirror shaving under my arms, but the hair seems to be at least 6 in. long."
"0003"	"I was in water like a lake up to my waist and my sister (16) was with me. We were striving desperately to get away from a large Negro man, but the water was holding us back. I feared that he was going to rape us, but then I realized he would not."
"0004"	"I was riding a bicycle with a boy who is a student here at school and we were going to the movies. The surroundings were unfamiliar and we both suddenly realized there would be no place to put the bikes, so we returned. On the way back, however, he had to cross a bridge and when we got to the middle of it, it opened like a draw bridge, only too fast for us to get off. We both fell into the water, which seemed to be a canal. The water was very clear ad green like in a swimming pool and it took a lot of effort getting to the surface."
"0005"	"I was in biology lab and had a bag of cookies and a bag of after dinner mints. I put them on the desk and said everyone was welcome to help themselves. When I went to get some, they were all gone, so I went around to each person in the lab and made them put some back. I was perplexed because they had taken advantage of my generosity and disgusted because some of them had made such pigs of themselves."
"0006"	"I dreamed that Norma (18), a girl who resides in the same dormitory as I, and I decided to change rooms. I was going to take the room I had last year and she was going to take my present room. I packed some of my things in a suitcase and went down to my old room. However, the present occupant of the room hadn't removed her things from the room. Since I had no place to put my things, I took my suitcase and went back to my present room. There I saw Norma had already moved in. She had changed some of the furniture around and was standing by the window ironing. I told her I couldn't get back my old room and she only laughed. I started to take her clothes out of the drawer and to put them in her suitcase. She had a lot of money lying on top of the dresser, which I also removed and put in the suitcase."
"0007"	"I dreamed I owned a red Ford. Since I couldn't drive, I asked a boy whom I thought was Jimmy L. (22) who married a friend of mine, to drive the car for me. We got into the car and he put his arm around me and started the car. We got to a railroad crossing and I suddenly realized the boy was not Jimmy L. but a stranger. I told him to get out and give me back my car. He refused. I became frightened and ran out of the car over to a railroad employee who was standing on an elevated platform. I was afraid the stranger who had my car would shoot me or run after me, but he didn't. I yelled to the railroad man to get the license number of the car. He did, but as soon as the stranger drove away with the car, he changed the license plates so that the police couldn't locate my car. Finally seven years later I got my car back."
"0008"	"I dreamed I was in the shower one evening around 10:000 when I heard my name being called on the dormitory intercommunications system. I put on my housecoat and ran down three flights of stairs to the telephone. The person on the other end of the line was Howard M. (16, a boy whom I date). He said the reason he called was to tell me that a drugstore had opened up across the street from my father's store and would take away a lot of business from my father. He hung up then and I went upstairs and told the girls that I was very disgusted because Howard had called me up just to tell me that my father had competition from a drug store across the street and didn't ask me to go out."
"0009"	"I dreamed I was sitting in my room at my desk. The room did not look like mine, but rather like Doris' (18, a girl who lives in the room next to mine) room. As I was sitting at my desk looking out the window, I noticed a pen on my desk which was situated in a dish of ink. I knew that a man was in my room and I immediately ran out of the room. I asked one of the girls (I can't remember what she looked like) to come to my room and see if anyone was in the closet. We both entered the room, whereupon she opened the closet door and shut it again. Then she said I saw a man in the closet. As we fled from the room, the closet door opened and an old man darted out. We ran down the stairs, closely followed by the old man. Suddenly the other girl stopped and extended her foot. The old man stumbled over it and fell down the stairs."
"0010"	"I dreamed I was sitting in a dark car when an unidentified man opened the car door and asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I can't remember what I told him. The next thing I remember is picking up a copy of the Reader's Digest and discovering a two-page article about myself. The first paragraph of the article said that in an interview with me, it was found that I had 2/10 Presbyterian blood, a Presbyterian father and was psychologically and culturally a Presbyterian. The article then went on to describe my character. I was very angry and disgusted because of the false statements the magazine had made about me and furthermore I couldn't understand where they had received their information because the unidentified man had only asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I gave the article to Dottie, a friend of mine, to read. As she read it, I complained about the inaccuracies and lies that magazines and newspapers printed and how you couldn't believe what you read."
"0011"	"I dreamed that I went to bed in a hotel room between the boy I go with (19) and his father (50). In the middle of the night I sat up and bent over to kiss the boy I go with. I woke up to find myself kissing my girlfriend (20) with whom I was sleeping."
"0012"	"The boy I go with (20) and I were being chased by a policeman (do not remember why). As he (policeman) rounded a corner, we were way up the street. The policeman however took aim and shot my boyfriend through the back. No blood came out, but I could see the holes in his sweater which were singed around the edges. Bullet went through his shirt. He sat down on steps leading up to a walk of a house. I was hysterical - kept screaming I love you. Policeman came up and led him away. He (boyfriend) could still walk, although I could not see how bullet could miss puncturing his spinal cord."
"0013"	"I dreamed I was to be married to the boy I go with (20) when he appeared. However, it was not him but his father (50). Everything was very confused. I remember emptying my father's (48) suitcase in my bedroom and then hurriedly putting everything back in again, remembering asking my girlfriend (19) whether the wedding announcements were sent out. Then I remember having rings on my finger. Father of the boy I go with changed into boyfriend. Rings were large and black made of wood and etched with gold. I thought them very strange."
"0014"	"I was going up a high slippery slope on a motorcycle. The boy I go with was driving the motorcycle and I was on the back. There was a great deal of snow on the ground. When we arrived at the top of the slope, we got off and sat down under a tree. I was watching him and suddenly his face seemed to change and he looked at me as if he didn't care for me anymore. I was very disturbed and asked him what was wrong. He didn't answer, but got up and started to walk away. I was very upset and felt that I had lost him."
"0015"	"Dreamed that boyfriend's (20) mother (46) was married to Clark Gable. She was one of his ex-wives. This was a great surprise to me. Dreamed that I was in a bedroom. Clark Gable and present wife (not Bs mother) were sitting on a chair. She was dressed in a bright red suit and was on his leg. She was about to die. She looked over at me and stared. She had large brown eyes and they were so frightening that I woke up. (She was about 26 with blond hair.) Then I remember walking out of room with boyfriend. We were in a hotel corridor. Said to him, ""R put on the lights so no one falls down the stairs."""
"0016"	"I dreamed that I was running up Antisdale Avenue pursued by a large black dog with fantastically long whiskers. No matter how fast I ran, the dog was always right behind me, and his whiskers tickled my legs. I saw my sister standing on the lawn of one of the houses watching me, and when I asked her to help me, she laughed."
"0017"	"I was walking along by the side of the road in the country. The landscape was barren and deserted and it was raining. I kept stepping in puddles. The few cars that went by would not pick me up, but rather splashed water all over me. Then an army car stopped and the driver offered me a ride. I recognized him as a man I had worked for, when I worked for army recruiting. He was a colonel, in his fifties, of whom I had been quite fond. Just as soon as I had gotten in the car and closed the door, the rain stopped and the sun came out."
"0018"	"I dreamed that I was walking up Euclid Avenue on a shopping trip. I was going into the small specialty shops such as Quinn-Maah's, Milgrims, etc. looking for bargains in lingerie. In each store there was a counter with a large pile of pink slips with fancy lace trimming and in each store, after looking through the pile and disarranging it, I walked out. Finally I came to an unidentified shop operated by two elderly women. There I found what I was looking for at a much lower price and selected several yellow slips and a pair of gold handing earrings. I was quite satisfied."
"0019"	"I was at a large party which seemed to be a New Year's Eve gathering. It took place in the Hotel Carter Ballroom and the place was jammed with people in formal dress. I was dressed in a disreputable outfit of blue jeans and a dirty shirt, and every time I tried to make conversation, I was completely ignored. There was a tall, dark, handsome young man whose attention I was trying to attract, but he too ignored me, so I went to a building across the street where there was another party. After going up in several different elevators, I arrived in a long, narrow hallway also crowded with people in formal dress, who likewise ignored me."
"0020"	"I had a part in a play, but put off learning the lines. I kept thinking about the part and kept putting it out of my mind. Finally I was backstage, surrounded by black velvet curtains. I couldn't find the opening in the curtains to get to the stage, and I was also panicky because I had not learned my part. Just at the moment when I was supposed to go onstage, my older sister went on instead and took my part."
"0021"	"I dreamed an elderly man, an old friend of mine, came to visit me at a house in which an aunt lived at one time. We were standing in the kitchen and he seemed to want me to read a letter. He held it in his hand, outstretched to me, but I was more concerned in looking into the other rooms to see if anyone was there to see him. I was rather anxious that he should not be seen and that he should leave at once."
"0022"	"I dreamed of being in an unfamiliar and rather vague room with an elderly woman who at one time was my music teacher. She was seated at a table and was speaking to me of a piece of apparatus which seemed to be somehow connected with medicine. She asked if I wished to see it operated and to do so required some kind of air pressure. It was necessary for me to use a mouthpiece and exert as much force as possible."
"0023"	"I dreamed I was in to see a doctor (a stranger) for consultation. The examination seemed of a trivial nature, but continued for quite some time. I was growing more puzzled by the procedure and wondering why he was taking so long. At last he seemed terribly pleased with himself and told me I had cancer. At the same time indicating because of his skill and early detection of the growth, complete cure was possible."
"0024"	"I dreamed I was in a strange town and was meeting a couple who were sitting in a car. They were vague and unknown to me, still it seemed perfectly natural to be seeing them. The next thing I knew I was entering a hospital ward and it was through them that I had been introduced to the people in charge. I seemed to be there in the capacity of observer and some kind of new equipment was being demonstrated to me by a woman doctor. She suggested that we experiment and I should be the subject to test the equipment. Some people in the room were alarmed and asked me not to do it because it was untried and perhaps dangerous. I think I was going to go ahead with the plan when I woke."
"0025"	"I dreamed I entered a building with the purpose of attending a demonstration and lecture on anatomy (perhaps an autopsy--I'm not sure). There were a number of people about and I seemed to be part of a group. However, I only noticed and greeted one girl who is a new acquaintance. I asked her if she had been downstairs to the laboratory and she said she had, but became uncomfortable and had to come upstairs. I proceeded down with the group and we arranged ourselves about the table, upon which was a prepared cadaver. This was particularly vivid. I recall the type of cutting that had been done on the skull, and the abdomen had been incised with consequent exposure of the entrails. The attendant or lecturer began to speak and explain something to us when I awoke."
"0026"	"I dreamt that my front teeth were loose and wobbled. Then I thought that I was chewing something hard. I spit what I was chewing into my hand and looked at it. My hand was full of blood and teeth. My mouth felt sore and swollen and I spit out what was in it. Again I saw the blood and teeth, but immediately my mouth felt full of hard bits again. I kept spitting and trying to get rid of the feeling, but it wouldn't stop. I was getting panicky and it seemed very real. I went in the bathroom and tried to drink some water, but immediately I had to spit and I couldn't drink. I became so frightened finally that I woke myself up."
"0027"	"The remembrance I have of the progress of this dream, I was standing in front of a desk. On the desk was seated one of the girls in our dorm who is a year ahead of me. I seemed to be being interviewed and then I realized that I was trying out for radio club. Next I was aware of one of the fellows who is in radio club. I don't know him very well, but I do know that he is in his 20's. He was looking me up and down, considering my fitness for the club. The girl at the desk said I think she will be okay, don't you? He replied shortly no, her legs and ankles are too fat. The case seemed to be closed and no one argued his decision. That is all I remember before I woke up."
"0028"	"I was taking care of a little boy. His mother is a good friend of our family. They lived next door in a duplex and the lady next door was having a party for her little girl. When the children came, I played with them, especially one little boy. When I went in, this little boy followed me. He said he was tired, so I put him to bed in my bed. A while later I went to look at him and he had wet his pants. I discovered that he was wearing diapers and I wanted to change them, but I couldn't find any clean ones. I asked Woody (the child I was taking care of) where his old ones might be. He didn't know, so I went and asked the lady who was giving the party. She said that she wondered where he was. I asked who he was and how old he was. She said that he was 10 years old, but he had a very poor home life. His mother hadn't wanted him so she never trained him or loved him at all. She told me then that his name was Freddy."
"0029"	"My mother and I were driving through western New York State. We went through Rochester and could see lake Ontario in the distance. We then arrived in Freeport on our way to Erie. Somehow we had the idea that this was where the two lakes joined. We drove beside Lake Ontario through the little town and beside a very marshy section. A little ahead of us was a hill and we supposed that Lake Erie was on the other side. We saw a bridge going over the point where we entered the town. Just as we were about to turn around the hill, my alarm rang and I was very angry. I did want to see how the two lakes joined."
"0030"	"My kid sister (15) and I were getting ready for bed in the room next to ours. I went into our room to get my pajamas and I noticed that the window shades were up. Our double room looked out on the porch roof and as I walked to the window, I had the feeling that someone was on the roof. I pulled the blind down, but a hand reached in the window and pushed it back up. A man was out on the roof grinning at me. I was angry and tried to call my father, but I couldn't. I went into his room and woke him up. I told him very incoherently what happened and he got up. I didn't want him to go in our room because he might get hurt, but he insisted. As he walked down the hall, I forced myself to wake up. I was afraid to go back to sleep because I didn't want to know what might come next."
"0031"	"Since stunt night is approaching, I went to sleep and dreamt that I was going. I went through the stunt, especially my part, and then dreamt about the dance and then breakfast at Haydn Hall. After it was all over (5 a.m.) my boyfriend and sneaked into his frat house and went to sleep on 2 couches. Only we had an argument as to whether we should sleep on the same couch or different ones. I think we necked some too. Then I woke up."
"0032"	"Last night I dreamt that I received a phone call at the dorm and it was my father telling me that I shouldn't get excited, but my mother was killed. It seems she and my father were fishing on the lake, which they never do, and some sort of electric current from the motor electrocuted her. My father and little sister didn't seem to be terribly upset about the whole thing and I just couldn't understand it because I was crying and crying and kept calling home to find out if it were really so. I can remember walking in a cemetery which seemed like Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles and again I was crying. That's about all I remember except that I kept seeing my mother's face in front of me. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt as though I had been crying all night and I felt very upset."
"0033"	"The other night I dreamed that I was calmly sitting in the living room hemming a pair of summer shorts when all of a sudden I heard some shooting. I looked up and it seemed as though I could see right through the walls and there were two men, one on top of the basement stairs and one at the bottom and they were shooting guns at each other. I didn't know the fellas, but I was aware of a plaid shirt that a boy across the street always wears. I kept telling them not to fight, but I wasn't overly excited about the whole situation."
"0034"	"The other night I dreamed that my boyfriend came over to take me out; however, we only had about an hour to spend together. So he kept saying maybe we shouldn't go out tonight. Maybe we should wait until tomorrow and I'll go to Canton tonight. He kept on repeating Canton, Canton, and then the next thing I knew, we were examining little white flowers."
"0035"	"All I remember dreaming was that our physiology teacher was trying to convert her students to Christian Science and I thought this was peculiar because she knew all about the way the body works and the importance of medicine and doctors, which is quite contrary to the beliefs of Scientists. I also remember trying to clear my glasses on my slip."
"0036"	"Can remember very little of this dream. Most vivid is the fact that my unmarried girlfriend GS was having a baby. It seems as if we were in the living room. GS was surrounded by her mother, me and several other people. She admitted that the father was SM, her boyfriend at school. She told us without tears just how it happened. She seemed sort of happy, so I got happy rationalizing that now she would be able to marry him right away."
"0037"	"Dream was very hazy. It had to do with Stunt Night. I remember waiting backstage till it was our turn to go on stage. Before we went on, there were other people performing - like an amateur show. I saw millions of chairs, little children's chairs backstage. It was all dark. I felt sort of a cold chill in my stomach. I was quite petrified. After the others finished, our leader said come on. Let's show em. We went and performed the whole stunt perfectly."
"0038"	"I was in a girl's dorm. I remember entering the girl's lavatory - quite a large room. I sat there for some time. When I finished and re-entered the outer part of the restroom, it was no longer that but a cafeteria. I remember seeing SM who shouldn't have been there because he attends Miami University. I asked him if he could help me find a date for GS who was coming in for Thanksgiving weekend. This was peculiar because it so happens that GS also goes to Miami and is a steady date there of SM who is not coming in to Cleveland. I know I was thinking about getting her a date before I went to bed."
"0039"	"I was joining a sorority. I saw a large room in which we met. The name of the sorority was Phi Beta. It was a high school group. I don't know why I picked on that sorority to dream about since I never went around with these girls in high school. I had something very important to say, but I wasn't called. I got very angry and left the room. Later I asked someone why I wasn't called on. They said it was because I was Jewish. The group of girls in the sorority were all Jewish. When I left the room, I went to the lavatories. When I returned, a dance was going on. I saw some boys I had dated - can't remember names."
"0040"	"This dream was sort of mixed up. At first the large room we were in was all dark. A mock wedding was going on. Later it turned out to be a weekend out at Camp Wise (I had just returned from there). Later it seemed as if I were in a dorm. I spoke with several counselors. On the back of my mind I kept thinking about my purse."
"0041"	"I remember sitting at a dining room table. There was lots of food at the table and I was avidly eating, though I don't remember what kind of food it was. My dormitory friends were in the dining room too. All of a sudden, I noticed a girl who had graduated and had come back for a meal. I was real happy to see her, and I called out hello to her and how good it was to see her. She was quite indifferent and didn't return as enthusiastic a hello. I felt a bit thwarted."
"0042"	"I dreamt that a friend of mine who graduated last year came back to the dorm for Stunt Night. I was really happy to see her. Another friend took care of her and gave her my bed to sleep in. Meanwhile another girl whom I'm not too friendly with was engaged to a boy whom she was not very much in love with. He was very wealthy and her ring was so beautiful that she didn't want to wear it around school. She was always putting her arms around me and on me, a very affectionate girl. I dreamed that I had to go to the john. Later I went downstairs and my friend who took care of the visitor and I proceeded to tell her about our affairs at school and our respective boyfriends."
"0043"	"I dreamt that a very good friend of mine was going to die. I was astonished and walked around in a daze. Then later, I remember she died. She went through sort of gyrations before she stopped; got up, sat down, stared. The kids had to hold her down. This took place in my dormitory. This girl is my age. The other girls in the dream were just girls in the dorm."
"0044"	"Two friends and myself were staying overnight at a very nice home, only we didn't know the people who lived there. We just stayed there over night. It was amusing cause we were hiding from the people in the morning. I remember having chewing gum and I got some stuck on one of the girl's coats. I remember hiding behind the door in hopes that we didn't see anyone cause we wouldn't know what to say to them."
"0045"	"I have forgotten a lot of the dream I had last night. I remember that it was very vivid and detailed, but I can't remember a lot of the details. Another girl, I'm not sure who, but probably a friend in my dorm and I plotted the murder of another girl, dark hair, tall about 20. I know we had a good reason then, but I don't remember now. She murdered her. I was just the accomplice. I saw it all but didn't actually do anything. It was set in a hotel room on a lonely country road. My parents and the other girl's parents were there. They didn't suspect us, but there was a lot that was left that would incriminate us. When we checked out of the room, I told the bellboy to throw everything out that we had left, among things the black dirty hat. I guess things were getting pretty frightening and suspicious because when I awoke to find it all a dream, I was extremely relieved and could hardly believe it. Then I fell back to sleep and again began to dream again about the same thing. When I woke up the second time, I had that relieved feeling again."
"0046"	"I was the only person in the dream that I recognized. I was walking past an old brick building behind our house and for some reason I turned to look back at the building. The lower left part of the wall was gone and a room that had not existed was left bare. In a straight chair was seated a naked man, his left side facing me. A naked woman was bending over him; they were in the act of intercourse. Just the two figures were visible to me and the beauty of the pose and the symphony of body movements struck me speechless. Then suddenly the figures were gone and what appeared to be the neighborhood children filed out of the room looking furtively from side to side. I was again struck, but this time by a feeling of abhorrence at the thought of children picking up sex in a manner they know is wrong."
"0047"	"I was in a car with a date unknown to me, but I have a strong feeling it was my fiance. (I'm not sure as I do not want it to be him.) We were driving along, not speaking. I was cold and uninterested in my surroundings and company. I saw a huge obstacle loom in front of us but was not moved? (C.S.H.) to warn my companion who was driving and who did not see it. There was a crash and he was struck down dead. I merely brushed his body aside and slipped under the driver's wheel and started on, oblivious of the limp body beside me."
"0048"	"In this dream I found myself in a new home with apparently new decorations which I have been busily planning for what seemed to be weeks. I was married and my husband (really my fiance) was about to come home from work. I was anxiously awaiting his arrival and flitting about from room to room. I could see every detail of the furnishings. What surprised me was that we had been living in this house with only a bedroom suite and a piano (which is mine - ""a dowry"") but I had saved and planned and now had carpeting and some furniture. My husband knew nothing about it and the greatest surprise for him would be when I handed him a bank book $0.00. I was anxious to see his reaction."
"0049"	"I dreamed that my roommate (20) who would never consciously do anything ethically wrong, had just come in from a date with a fellow (21) with whom she had almost been pinned to a year before. She was completely happy and content, not withstanding the fact that she had just slept with him and she was now pregnant. The fellow came into the dream pictured as a martyr who will make an honest woman of her, so he gave her a set of rings that were nothing but stone or glass - big and glaring. He had no recollection of ever having intercourse with her, although he admitted that they had fallen asleep in bed. My roommate was happy that at least she had him to herself. I was surprised at her reaction and wondered how she could ever feel that he could really love her, but she was unconcerned."
"0050"	"(I remember this fragment of a dream from last night. Our room was very warm and what little air came thru the window was damp and miserable.) All I can remember was that I was sitting in a classroom and Dr. Erickson (history prof.) whom I admire and think of a great deal was walking out of the room and I remember smiling as I looked down to see hanging beneath his trousers a pair of woolen bvd's. He had no socks on and it was very warm."
"0051"	"I dreamed that I and my family were Puritans. We were living the same house as we live in today, however. I was shelling peas, and was in an old-fashioned dress when a girlfriend of mine, Charlotte Kominsky (20) came over. She asked to borrow something (I can't remember what) and mother said, ""Bridget (which was my name), go up in the attic and get it for her."" I went up to my room with a stepladder for there are no steps leading up to our attic, and climbed up on it, pulled back and door, and a bird flew out and got caught between my hair and my neck."
"0052"	"This dream was a very disjointed one. I dreamed that I was at a Delta Tau Delta fraternity party. Here I was dancing in a beautiful ballroom of the type you see in movies and in a beautiful formal, with a friend of mine, Chuck Burka (25) who is a member of Reserve's chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Also present was Al Sanow (22), a boy I used to date from Case who is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. I was drinking a cocktail and walking down a long spiral staircase, and then I was having an argument with Chuck and finally went back to dance again. Then very early in the morning, my father (50) and I were in a very large and beautiful house out on the veranda by a huge swimming pool. It seemed to have been after the party, for I was talking to Dad about it. The pool belonged to Samuel Goldwyn who owns Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios in Hollywood."
"0053"	"I dreamed that Chuck Branden, my boyfriend (22) and I were in the Lasalle Theatre. There were about four other young boys in the show with us, all unknown to me, and all about the age of 10 to 12. As a matter of fact, they all resembled each other in looks Instead of watching the movie, they were all reading comic books and were in a more or less reclining position. I was laying down on a couch and Chuck was sitting beside, me, but I don't recall what we were talking about. Then the scene shifted and I was in a school room. The room resembled the school where I attended the second and third grades - Roosevelt Elementary School in Euclid, Ohio. There were about 15-20 students, none of whom I remember. My husband, Chuck, was the professor. I was sitting in the front row to his right conversing and acting silly with the girl who sat next to me. I knew my husband was getting angry with me and would bawl me out when we got home, so when the bell rang, I rushed out of the door and didn't wait for him."
"0054"	"I dreamed that I was jumping out of the window of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. I would jump out, run back up the stairs and jump out again. After doing this three or four times, I jumped again and was about to land in a puddle when I woke up."
"0055"	"I dreamed that a friend of mine, Lois Watkins (20), and I were working in physiology lab on a cadaver. We were working specifically on the stomach of this male cadaver, trying to find red beads in his kidney. I remember that we were the only ones who were unable to find the red beads, and at last our lab instructor (a young fellow, about 20-25, whom I don't know) came over to help us. He held the cadaver upright in a sitting position while we hunted. Here my dream seemed to end, or at least I don't remember any more of it. I do remember us probing around for the red beads, however, and at last we saw them, but didn't move them as other members in the class did. I also remember that we were working at the last lab table and that our cadaver was very limp and his hands, feet and face were not covered as the cadavers in medical school are. Our cadaver was a young, nice-looking (about 20), blond man and looked more as if he were just sleeping and not dead at all. I remember being a little frightened at the thought of seeing the cadaver for the first time, and then surprised at finding him looking so natural and not finding his hands, feet and face bound up. Lois and I also thought it was funny and laughed a good deal at being the only members in the class who couldn't find the red beads."
"0056"	"Upon entering a ballroom where a big costume party was taking place, I was confronted with many people and much excitement and confusion. The place was gaily decorated. Hanging from the ceiling were streamers which were all entangled. Upon looking around, I saw that all the men there were wearing the identical tie - it consisted of a red, white and blue design with a horrible man's face superimposed upon it. In addition, replicas of this tie covered practically every inch of the walls. Wherever I turned, I saw this very tie. I was very upset about it because I had bought this same tie for my brother that afternoon. It was without the face, however. I disliked the thought of giving him something that everyone else was wearing."
"0057"	"I was sitting in the front seat of a car with a man I cannot identify. We were in a very close embrace, but instead of kissing me, he was trying to make me stutter. His method involved my repeating certain words after him. This was supposed to make me very tense. Then he asked me some questions and told me that upon answering them I would stutter. I concentrated real hard on my answers and replied very slowly. As a result I did not stutter. He didn't seem too disappointed."
"0058"	"This fellow and I were walking arm and arm thru the parking lot of a Greensurgh hotel. The entrance faces the lot and we walked straight by it, but a considerable distance. I could see a woman scrubbing the floor of the vestibule. I was quite shocked to discover that it was my mother. This fellow never met my mother so I thought of introducing them. Of course, he had no idea that that woman was she. I doubt that he even noticed her. As we walked by two conflicting thoughts passed thru my mind. I will introduce them. I won't introduce them. It turned out that I didn't. At this point when it was already too late to do anything about it, I was furious at myself for not having done so."
"0059"	"I was sitting in some sort of classroom in the first row in the next to the last seat. It was an intersorority council meeting and my roommate was officiating and sat at the teacher's desk. This I couldn't understand because she isn't even a member of a sorority. I was sitting sidewards in the chair and it probably looked as if I were talking, but actually I wasn't. My roommate started to scold me for it and in front of the classroom of people. I tried to explain that I was completely innocent. She wouldn't listen to me and it turned into a mild argument. We let the matter drop and she resumed the conduction of the meeting. A short while later the girl sitting behind me began to speak to me. I listened to her intently but never uttered a word. Again my roommate scolded me for talking but didn't say a thing to this other girl. At this point, I was just furious. I tried to explain what had happened but she wouldn't believe me. She insisted that it was my fault. The result was a vehement argument, but nothing I said could change her mind."
"0060"	"I was planning on going to a costume party. I had given the kind of costume that I was to wear much thought. I met someone I knew, who was also going to the same party and she asked me what I was going as. I told her that I would dress as a game of bridge. At that moment, hundreds of people appeared from nowhere, and all shouting at once, stated that they were going as a game a bridge also. They didn't seem to mind that they would all look alike but it disturbed me greatly."
"0061"	"I dreamed that a man continually would come to my dormitory, ring the doorbell and while he waited at the door, I would hide in the living room behind a chair until I would see him leave. I seemed to be aware of the fact that I was terribly afraid of him, although I had never seen him before and he didn't look like anyone I had ever seen or known. I believe that a story had been going around the dorm (in the dream) that man would come around to all the dorms and attack the girls. I woke up after the dream (6:30) and was very much afraid. My heart was beating very quickly."
"0062"	"I dreamed that somebody was taking my temperature. I was afraid that I really had a fever, so I didn't want the person to come near me with the thermometer. Someone had said not to touch the thermometer on a certain point - otherwise the mercury would all run out in a steady stream. I must have touched it and the next thing I knew, all the mercury was running around the room."
"0063"	"I dreamed that Dean Dolan was explaining the construction of some English sentences to me. I had them all correct except one which she switched around to make it the right construction. Then we walked out of the classroom since she a class and so did I. As we came out into the hall, I saw a friend of mine coming out of another classroom. He looked as though he just had a biology class of some sort because he had a white coat and a pair of white trousers on. He had a bandage on his hand and half way up his arm. I asked him what had happened and he said he was playing football and had broken his wrist. I waited until he put his coat on and then we went home together."
"0064"	"I dreamed that I was sitting at a table with a girl in my dormitory, her boyfriend and either 2 or 3 other people whom I don't recall. Anyhow, the girl was asking me all sorts of questions about a dance I was supposed to have attended last week, but to which I never went. I had signed out for this dance before I left my dormitory that evening, but had merely done this in order to secure a later permission than what I would ordinarily receive. The girl evidently knew I hadn't gone to the dance and she was asking me all about to see if she could trip me in any way."
"0065"	"The dream began when a friend of mine came and told me that a boy whom I had dated a few times and whom I haven't seen for several weeks was pinned to another girl who was supposed to live next door to my dorm. (The only person living there is an old woman and a few servants.) Then the dream shifted and I imagined that a good-looking young man in a naval lieutenant's uniform was cleaning the outside of the windows of my room. He entered the room and we began talking. I remember him admiring my ring and I told him that it was a gift from my parents, etc. He told me he had tickets to see Romeo and Juliet and asked me if I would like to go. I accepted and the dream then shifted and we were saying goodbye on the porch of my dormitory. I told him I didn't even know his name so he told me what it was. It was a long name and I couldn't understand it, so he took out his billfold on which his name was stamped in gold. The first name was Avilo as near as I can remember. It doesn't mean a thing to me. I was hurt that he didn't ask me what my name was so I told him that he didn't know it. He said yes I do and he told me what it was. He was correct. I remember that in my dream I deduced from this that he was a friend of the original boy in the dream (the one who was supposed to have been pinned) and that he had told his friend to call me and ask me to go out with him."
"0066"	"Two friends, Nancy (19) my ex-roommate and Julia, girl living across the hall in my dorm and I were in a bathroom chatting. Nancy replied to my statement with a rather sarcastic hum which in real life torments me to some extent. I got so excited that I took her head in my hands and banged it twice against the wall. She was resisting strenuously. As I was about to do it the third time, I controlled myself and stopped. I think Nancy was laughing while she tried resisting just as if my actions were amusing with no intent to injure. I don't know whether my feelings were of wanting to hurt her or just to pretend I was disturbed."
"0067"	"I dreamed this dream the night before my friend Tia Sticapoulou went to New York. I dreamed I saw her walking down the street with another of my friends on the day that she was to leave. I inquired as to what had happened. She replied that she waited for a number of hours and that the person didn't come that was to take her. She was weeping bitterly. Seeing that I have no other connection with Tia other than knowing her in the dorm, I associate her with Bellflower House on Bellflower Road. However, the setting of this dream was on the street where I once lived here in Cleveland. I could see very clearly my old home with the bakery next door and the high cyclone fence around it. I even saw some of the houses and familiar faces that I once knew. Tia is a very good friend of mine who lives in the dorm. She is older than I am and is 23 years old. The girl that she was with is also a girl from the dorm who is nineteen years old. This girl, Maryanne Adams had no active part in the dream other than being with Tia."
"0068"	"All that I can remember is that I was at some type of social function. Someone came up to me and asked me to dance, and some time later this same individual in exactly the same manner asked me again. I can't explain how he asked me, but I do know that it was in the exact same way. The second time I said fine and grinned. I can't remember how I answered the first request. The second time he asked me was just after some sort of intermission. I recognize the person as someone from either Case or Reserve campus' but I know that I have never met him. I was very conscious of him wearing a brown checked jacket and was also aware of the dress I was wearing, but not of the color."
"0069"	"In my dream I was in bed aware of the fact that I was about to give birth to a baby. I fell into a deep sleep or when I woke the baby had been born. I had no pain and there was no evidence of afterbirth. At the time my parents were away and on returning both were overjoyed, especially my father (this is odd because actually my father hides his true feelings very well). I gave birth to a beautiful girl with long hair. She was very tiny, but very active. The happiness and love for my child and the baby's beauty was predominant in the dream. Then somehow my relations and I were together. I can't recall how we were united why or when. My uncle was predominant. He gave the baby some sort of a cradle or bassinet. This baby always attempted to get out of it. Everyone seemed surprised at my having a baby and I kept telling everyone I was married to Bob (Bob is the person with whom I have just broken up and whom I had planned to marry) although I had no ring. Then I remember a car but that's all. I didn't recall its significance."
"0070"	"I had to take an exam in the psych lab. When I entered, there were tables over the whole place. The lab was just one room, not the way it actually is. There were chairs along the wall all occupied with people who are proctors. There seemed to be more of them than students taking the exam. One girl, a student from Guilford house, was one of these proctors who had a bright blue outfit. She was sitting with her legs crossed and her head supported in her hand which in turn was resting on her knee. Another proctor had on a coat with a wide green band on the bottom and then fur. As I came in the lab, I remarked to whom I was with, that there are more people to see that we don't cheat than there are kids taking the exam."
"0071"	"My father was driving me up a very steep hill in our car, and my young brother (15) was with us. When we reached the top, we got out of the car and parted for my father was going one way and I the other. I was very worried about leaving the car parked on the steep hill because some little fairy like creature (male) was playing with the controls, so I told my brother to remain and guard it. As I turned away to go on my way, I faced a huge and peaceful lake that sat right on the summit of the hill."
"0072"	"I was just about to enter my sociology class when I saw a few girls (unknown to me) seated at a table across the hall. I, too, sat down there. Then my instructor came and began talking to the girls. I thought that if I kept silent, he wouldn't notice I didn't belong and my presence would do no harm. He then passed out papers for the girls to sign. Since I was no part of the project or whatever it was, I decided it was time to leave. I didn't want to sign something and later get into trouble. "
"0073"	"The only visible person was a man who had freakish limbs. At the end of each arm and leg there was either a stump or only one or two fingers or toes. I had the feeling he had acquired one of them only recently. I seemed to know that this man had a loving wife who would not leave him because of his horrible condition. I also had the feeling that both my fiance and I knew him and we seemed to be looking at him (but we were not actually in the dream). Later I had a spiritual rather than a visual dream in which I seemed to be training children."
"0074"	"I was shopping for lipstick and was with a girl with whom I had been close friends in high school, but now am unfriendly with. I wondered why she was with me since I didn't like her. She was helping me choose a lipstick and I wondered whether she might not want to hinder me. The girl showed me a counter where my brand of lipstick was sold, but the lipstick cases were red and I usually got a gold case. She said that they had changed the color, but the lipstick was the same. I wanted to streak each lipstick on some paper to help me choose the right shade but the lipstick was covered with red paper. I streaked it and the color did come thru the red paper. I remember being quite surprised."
"0075"	"All I remember of this dream is that my brother (16) re-entered a room I was in. He began upsetting everything in the room and doing everything he could to dirty it up--emptying the earth from flower pots was one specific way I remember. He was doing all this to spite me because I pleaded with him not to dirty the room. He also knows that I like to keep a clean room clean. Then I went seeking persons to help and I remember begging someone to convince my brother to stop but the person said he couldn't help me. This person was a nonentity. I don't even remember seeing a face."
"0076"	"I dreamed of 2 girls (I know them personally and always think of them together) both dressed exactly alike. They were beautiful silver-white fur coats which I liked very much. Both were very dressed up, and I remember especially that they wore light blue dresses. We were at a lakeshore. Some older person (a woman) of authority was there. She may have been a teacher. Other young people were there too, but I can't remember who they were. We went out upon the water and went fishing, being quite successful and catching quite a few. I remember that I couldn't understand why the two girls were dressed up for such an occasion. I remember that the weather was fine that day--a blue sky and a bright sun, but it was a little cold."
"0077"	"I dreamed that my father was commending my sister and me for picking two bushels of apples. One of the bushels of apples was, I distinctly remember, yellow. My father went on to complain about not being able to hunt. I don't think the reason is very clear. He said something about the oven not being hot enough."
"0078"	"I dreamed of being on railroad tracks. I don't remember feeling any particular emotion. There were several tracks, and moving locomotives, and I remember that my father was present. Another dream I had similar to this one involved my father trying to remove something from the tracks before an approaching train could hit the object and wreck."
"0079"	"I dreamed that I was home for a vacation. I was demanding from my mother that she tell me what a certain $80 was for. I was very puzzled about it and wanted to know its source. I remember then seeing my mother and father grinning at each other and right away I realized that it was they who had given me the money. It took me a while to accept the fact, but I finally did."
"0080"	"I was planning on going to a big formal dance, one of the Mather dances to which the girls invite their boyfriends. I was very worried about who to ask, and for some reason I didn't want to ask Milt. A girlfriend of mine I don't know who, got me a blind date for the affair. The night of the dance I received a pink camelia, but it was not as beautiful as I expected, so I was disappointed. I remember that it was 9 o'clock that evening, and the fellow I was going with had not come for me. I tried to call Milt because I was certain that he would go. I was unable to reach him for a long time. It seemed like I was calling him by long distance, and I was sure the operators were listening to us, when I finally got to talk to him. He came right away, but we didn't go to the dance. I seemed to have forgotten all about it. He surprised me very much slipping a diamond ring on my finger. I had no idea that he was going to propose to me. He told me all about the house which he had almost finished building. I remembered that he had started it 6 months ago, and when I asked him why it was started to long ago, he turned his head away and looked a little bit ashamed, telling me that he had started it for some other girl. I didn't feel jealous though. We were both extremely happy, and talked for a long time making plans. The setting of the dream was not too clear. I think the last part was somewhere near my home. It was a long dream and once my whole family was there. They were all very happy for us."
"0081"	"I dreamed I was dying. I had all the symptoms, and was just waiting for the end. But at the same time, I was about and carrying on carious activities with friends. It worried me to be doing this, because I was supposed to die, and I didn't know how much gallivanting I should be doing. Somehow these activities my friends wanted me to participate in carried me to Albuquerque, N.M. though the town in my dream was nothing at all like Albuquerque. (I was there several years ago.) And also, though I kept waiting, I never died. I gradually regained life."
"0082"	"I was in a movie watching it very intently. When the movie was over, I discovered I had dropped some article which I had been holding. But when I tried to look for it, I found my eyes would not move from their previous position of looking up at the movie. I tried hard for a long time to get them unstuck finally they did."
"0083"	"I dreamed of a very good friend of mine. He is 32, works at Marshall Field and Co. in Chicago. He is very overweight, but with such a personality that everyone likes him. In the dream he came here to Cleveland to see me. When he arrived, I found he had lost a lot of weight, really looked swell. He had done it to surprise me and I was very happy and proud."
"0084"	"I was back working at Marshall Field and Co. in Chicago. It was quitting time and my girlfriend (20) and I were riding down the escalator accompanied by a friend of ours. He is a very overweight person, age 32, and dressed in a striking manner. Flag red shirt, Kelley green jacket and brown trousers. He was acting up in a rather loud manner just to be funny, and to us he looked at the moment so awful we ran to get away. To more or less disown the actions of this friend. But the more we ran, the more he chased us."
"0085"	"I dreamed of my last year's English teacher. In real life she is a good friend of mine, in my dream she was a good friend of mine, out of a blue sky she could do nothing but look at me with disdain; not a word passed between us. It was my birthday and I was having a small party. My teacher was there along with a few or my girlfriends. I was opening gifts and had showed the teacher one of them, but there was such a cold lack of response, I showed her no more. When it was time for my guests to leave, I thanked the teacher for coming, but her answer as again only a look of disgust. Later I remarked to my best girlfriend (the only other person whom I recognized (in my dream) that I didn't know what I had done or said, and hence couldn't understand Mis blank's behavior. The only thing I could remember was that once I had said she was rather an odd person."
"0086"	"As a project in one of my classes, I had to make some candy which I put in a tin box and then I wrapped the box in striped wrapping paper. The next moment I was at the flower show and there I saw a display of the candy boxes which my classmates and I had wrapped. My box was all covered up by the others. The others were more beautifully wrapped, so I took mine and unwrapped it in preparation to rewrap it. Then I woke up."
"0087"	"I was working in a hardware store which was very long and narrow and cluttered with hardware products. My friend (m, 23) came in to see me. We were standing by two huge piles of scrap rubber which were located near the front door. My friend lit a cigarette. Before we knew it, the piles of scrap rubber were on fire and the store was filled with smoke. My friend ran out the front door and I ran towards the back of the store to get my purse. I don't know what happened after that."
"0088"	"I was walking on Euclid at Wade Park at night. I had on my bridesmaid dress (which I wore at the wedding of my sister). Suddenly a strange man flashed a light in my face and laughed. Then he started chasing me and I ran into a dingy bar. There were many men at the bar and it was very noisy and smoky. I didn't know what to do. Then I was in a designer's shop. My gown had been ruined in some way and three women were making me a new one just like my old. I kept worrying about the time because it seemed as if I should be at the wedding. No one would let me call my parents and I didn't know where I was. Then I was with my cousin (f, 5) in a small room. I don't know where. I left and went outside to a parking lot where I found my parents (both 45). Then my cousin came running out and she was crying very hard because she thought she had gotten separated from me. I felt very bad for having left her. Then a friend of mine (f, 20) appeared in my newly made dress. I was disappointed because it was a dull brown whereas the original had been a beautiful orange color. I said do you get to have the dress after the wedding? She said yes."
"0089"	"A friend of mine (m, 23) took me into a building in search of something (I don't know what). He opened a door and there was a winding corridor cluttered with dusty antiques. We followed the passageway until we came to an open room. Several men popped up from behind objects with rifles, and we were stopped. Then two girls (probably about 25) came in with the leader (m) of the gang who was fat and about 35-40. My friend was taken away and I was led into a waiting room where I sat with the two girls and a man. Eventually another girl came out of the room adjoining the waiting room and said it was my turn to go into the leader's bedroom. The scene changed to the hallway where we had originally entered. There was my friend and several policemen (I was just an onlooker for this portion) and they were in the process of collecting the gang together."
"0090"	"I was in a car with my father and mother (both 45) and another person (perhaps my sister [22] but I am not sure). We were passing a golf course. Suddenly my father started driving faster, explaining that he had seen a man just drive his golf ball and he was afraid it might hit one of the windows in our car. The next thing I knew was that the ball had come through the rear window and it hit me on the collar bone, which immediately swelled up. Also much glass lodged in my neck. We started home so that I could be doctored. We had only gone a short distance when the bump on my collar bone disappeared and I seemed perfectly well. Then I came out of the house (not my own home). My friend's mother (50) was waiting for me in a big blue car. The car was filled with many other people. Then I was at a party (I don't know where)."
"0091"	"I dreamed I was in the smoking room of my dorm talking to the girls, and I started to complain of the piano playing of one of our dorm mates. The girls all gave each other funny looks. And one went out of the room and came back with the girl of whom I had been complaining. When I stopped talking in embarrassment, the girls said for me to continue. They wanted M to hear me."
"0092"	"I dreamed I was in a small town in New Hampshire, but some of the buildings and all of the people were foreign to that area. I seemed to feel the town was located in Cleveland, and I wanted to fly to New Hampshire. The ticket girl wouldn't sell me a ticket at first because she thought I just wanted to get on the plane to see some movie star who was making the same trip. I finally got the ticket and while I was sitting on the plane, my roommate (at college) came and told me the fellow I was going to New Hampshire to see had come to Cleveland for the weekend on a bicycle and was waiting at the dorm for me. I had to argue with the ticket girl again to sell back my ticket for she was determined I'd bought it just to see the movie star whom I never did see. I awakened before I got to see my friend from N.H."
"0093"	"There is a fellow on campus who keeps asking me for dates even though I have constantly refused him. I dreamed he was waiting for me outside very classroom and wouldn't leave me alone. If I went to Hayden, he was there. I sat with a group of sorority sisters and he moved in at the table, embarrassing me by asking me for a date."
"0094"	"I was walking along a secluded path in the woods, with a high hill along one side, and dense forest on the other. I was conscious of the beauty of the surroundings. After walking for awhile, I came to a brook, stopped to take a drink, crossed the beach and walked onward. As it started to grow dark, I turned back, but had forgotten something (what I don't know) and returned for it. Something happened to frighten me, and I ran as hard and fast as I could homeward. I never actually saw anything to cause my fear, but I am distinctly aware of that fear in my dream, and I was still unexplainably frightened when I awoke. "
"0095"	"I dreamed I had to go on a long ocean voyage and I was in uniform of some branch of the military forces. Seats were assigned and I found my seat was on a small platform on the lower part of the vessel almost at water level. The platform was only protected from the elements by an iron railing, and the waves kept flooding the floor. When I asked why I was assigned to this seat, the ship's officer replied that I was classified a ""masculine personnel"" and must keep that seat during the whole voyage. The next thing I remember is talking to some other people seated at the same place and regretting I'd forgotten my knitting. Then all of a sudden I was in a dance hall, still on the ship, and dancing with many different fellows who kept cutting in on each other."
"0096"	"This dream concerns an artist friend of my husband's. He is an old friend and he and my husband have known each other since they were children. He is about 25. The dream itself is short. Only a fragment. In my dreams, I saw this friend of a fellow art student who was painting a picture. I felt rather puzzled at seeing him at art school and back in Cleveland, as I knew that he had graduated from art school this September and had received a position as a commercial artist in Chicago to where he moved with his wife just several weeks ago. When I asked him why he was here, he said that he disliked Chicago and his job and preferred going to school. For that reason he came back. I felt happy about the fact that he returned."
"0097"	"This dream is merely a fragment, but it is all that I can remember. All that took place was in the home of my sister-in-law (my husband's brother's wife) who is 35. My sister-in-law and I were standing in the bathroom and were looking the room over. My sister-in-law began explaining to me the details of how she planned to have the room remodeled. In my dream it seemed as though there were definite plans there were going to be carried through immediately. All I remember seeing is the glass mirror of the medicine cabinet. In my dream, however, the mirror appeared more metallic than glass. My sister-in-law explained that she was going to have this mirror extended in a modern curved line down to the bathtub. Then I remember seeing my sister-in-law's face very vividly. I was very much impressed by her plans and just a little bit envious."
"0098"	"This dream was rather short and fragmentary. I was off in some strange land - the Arctic or Siberia. Airplanes were roaring overhead and several soldiers in a fox hole surrounded by snow where reassuring me that these planes were not of the enemy. The enemy was a wicked old witch who was out to kill us, particularly me. I felt relieved at their reassurance. The next thing I knew, I was told the witch was pulled down into a whirlpool of snow and was killed. I looked at the ground and saw the hole thorough which she sank."
"0099"	"This dream consisted merely of seeing one of my professor's faces very close. He appeared to be smiling and very friendly, and I had the feeling that he wished to help me through some difficulty which I had (what it was, I don't remember). When I awoke, I had the feeling that this was part of a long dream with a series of events in them. For some reason, this was all I could remember of it. I had a vague feeling that other students were standing around with me."
"0100"	"In this dream I remember hearing the news that my mother had died. I remember feeling very upset at the news. I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and read of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid."
"0101"	"Subject dreamed that she was sitting in the dining room of her home early in the morning. her younger sister came in and raised the window shades very high. Then her mother came in very angrily and pulled them down again immediately stating that she didn't like the shades up in the morning because the people next door could look in and see everything that was going on, and everything was so open with the shades up."
"0102"	"Subject dreamed she was in her living room playing cards with her parents and aunt and uncle. Someone said they were looking for a cat. Subject turned around and said there was a cat in the corner, but while petting it, found that it was a black dog with sharp teeth. Then suddenly someone called that there was the cat jumping towards the window. The dog fiercely began to chase it and all of a sudden the dog shrunk up until it was the size of a tiny bug."
"0103"	"Subject found herself in some sort of a school building with many people walking about. Different groups of people were presenting plays. Subject was the head of her group. The time came for the plays (2) of the subject's group to be presented. Subject had not yet chosen the two plays and they had not been rehearsed. Excitement and distress followed and subject awoke."
"0104"	"Subject dreamed she had moved to another home a week after moving into her present one. She was very sad and asked her mother why the family had moved when the other place had been so convenient to everything and so well located. Mother replied family had moved to get away from the landlady, subject's aunt."
"0105"	"Subject was on a double date going to a hotel party. For some reason the boys had to remain downstairs and another girl who is really good friend of subject and subject started upstairs in a self-operating elevator. They had difficulty getting the right floor and after riding up and down several times, found it finally. They entered the ballroom together and felt quite lonely for quite a while until boys finally arrived. Girls were much relieved."
"0106"	"I was at a swimming pool and was about to go into the water when I saw a large insect rather spider-like, but I think it had wings and only 6 legs. I tried to kill it, but it started to fight back and nearly got the better of me. I'm not sure who won."
"0107"	"I dreamed that the parents of a boy I have known for over a year came to our house for dinner. I have never met his parents, but I have heard much about them. We were having a buffet dinner and eating on a card table placed at the foot (sidewalk end) of the driveway. The card table kept collapsing. Finally I saw another card table top in the driveway, so I tore the present top off the wobbling legs and put the other top on. Then I noticed a deep pit where the top had been lying. I went to look for some boards to cover the hole with, and when I found some and went back to the driveway, the hole was gone. I don't know what happened to the parents."
"0108"	"I dreamt I was over to my sister's house. She said, ""Wait til I show you the present I just got."" She ran upstairs and came down with a large cosmetic case. In it were jars of different colored face powders, like one finds at a department store for mixing personally blended Charles of the Ritz face powder. They were violet, green, rose and several shades of peach and tan. I began to fuss around with the jars when my sister came back and placed some peach powder on a little glass lid in the center of the case. At that I offered to put it in the jar with the rest of the peach powder and did so. My sister looked at me, ""What did you do that for?"" She ran out and got a fork and came back and started picking pieces of potato out of the jar. ""That wasn't powder I put there, that was potato salad,"" she told me."
"0109"	"I had a date with a boy (who is 30, a friend of a girlfriend of mine) for lunch. As I was going downtown I noticed that his pants legs swept the ground and his overcoat dipped way down in back. This embarrassed me. Then we went into a lobby to buy some theater tickets. This lobby was much like a small town railroad station. I was sitting on one of these wooden benches inconspicuously with many other people when this boy went up to the desk to get the tickets. As he reached under his coat to pull his wallet out of his back pocket, I saw that he had a thick corset laced over his pants. Everyone laughed. I sneaked out of this lobby and into another one. I was so embarrassed. I met another boy there who told me that he was a friend of this first boy, and the whole incident had been an initiation stunt."
"0110"	"I dreamt I went swimming in an indoor pool with several girls in my sorority. They had a special movie to see at some eye doctor's office. I went up to get dressed with one of the girls. We didn't care to see the movie, somehow we had to go outdoors to get to the dressing room, but we were already dressed. This required crossing a street. The traffic was terrible. Then we had to climb a fire escape. I hate fire escapes. Halfway up I got cold feet and came down again. It wasn't worth climbing."
"0111"	"I had been entrusted with the care of some small tadpoles, frogs, and other similar animals. At first they seemed cute, and I was pleased with them. Then they began to appear ugly and disgusting and I felt a little repelled. Suddenly, they started to grow smaller and smaller and to disintegrate. I frantically tried to keep them from coming apart, but it was no use. They finally became a slimy smelly mass of jelly. I was frustrated and frightened afraid I would be punished."
"0112"	"I was swimming in a country lake with a friend of my fiance's, a young man of about 22 who was recently been married. In the dream, however, he was unmarried. Suddenly I realized that my bathing suit had come off. The water began receding slowly, exposing me from the waist up. The young man then laughed at me, pointing at me and saying that my breasts were too big. I was embarrassed and at a loss for words, and at this point woke up."
"0113"	"I was in my bedroom with a lover (no one I have ever known in actual life). There was something slightly sinister about him that made me feel uneasy, but I couldn't be sure what it was. We were doing nothing in particular, but I was very much afraid that my parents would come in the hallway and hid him in a closet. After my parents came in and spoke to me for a while, my attitude began to change. I became convinced that this lover was some sort of insect in disguise and that his intent was to injure or kill me and my family. I tried to warn my parents, but they would not believe me. Finally a huge hornet-like insect emerged from the closet and began chasing me. Then I woke up."
"0114"	"One of my teeth hurt me. I wiggled it and found that it was loose. I kept wriggling it back and forth the way I used to when I was a child. It was rather painful, but there was a definite element of pleasure involved so I kept wriggling until the tooth came out. Then another tooth came out and still another and I began to be alarmed because these were supposed to be my permanent teeth. At the same time, there was something rather pleasant about it. The dream had no definitely conclusion. I woke up while my teeth were coming out one by one."
"0115"	"It was night time about 3 a.m. and the streets were deserted. I was riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. I started out from my house and followed a very definite route (which has been the same each time that I have had the dream) winding up on my own street in the end. I took particular notice of various stores and other familiar landmarks along the way and got some feeling of satisfaction out of recognizing them. It was altogether pleasurable to be riding all alone through the familiar streets at night."
"0116"	"I was at a party composed of female relatives whom I hadn't seen in a number of years. They were apparently celebrating the birth of a new cousin born to a second cousin of mine, though the baby itself wasn't in evidence. One of the cousins, actually quite young, went around looking as old as her mother who looked younger than she. There was much noise until the door opened and an auburn-haired girl walked into the room. Then there was silence."
"0117"	"I was roaming about in a ravine which was quite similar to the one that surrounded the junior high school I once attended. I think that I actually had the feeling that it was the same one, but at the same time, it seemed to be near Reserve. Then I was in a classroom, I think a history classroom, with a teacher lecturing whom I had heard of but never met. He was about 30 years old and quite personable. At the same time that he was lecturing, the boy in back of me was approximately my own age, was brushing his hair and this seemed very natural at the time. I also remember noticing a blond girl sitting to the front and right of me who was said to be very attractive, but whose face I could not see."
"0118"	"I went up to the third floor of our house to visit the lawyer who lives there, but found that he wasn't home and that instead a man whom I didn't know and a blond girl who looked familiar were busily washing the yellow paint off the kitchen wall so that the wallpaper of rose and green flowered design showed through. I remember thinking this rather odd as the walls were freshly painted. I went downstairs again and was surprised to see a man on the roof aiming a pistol at my husband who was asleep in bed. I screamed at him to warn him and ran into the hall. The man climbed in the window, however, and was aiming his pistol at me when I woke up."
"0119"	"I was driving with a friend of mine (f, 28) through a snow storm. We were attempting to discover the house of a third friend, but got lost enroute appearing to proceed in circles. Finally we got out of the car to ask someone where we were. We appeared to be in a rather tough part of town, and my friend suddenly disappeared. A man in a mask appeared out of the darkness and the next thing I knew I was in his home, which was quite comfortable, awaiting ransom. It was paid and I was released without mishap."
"0120"	"I was working in a jewelry store. A man whom I knew in his early thirties came in to buy his small daughter, 5, a present. They looked at several of the rings, including rubies and emeralds, but the little girl was particularly pleased with small carved animals in pastel colors. When he left the store I realized that he was leaving town and I hadn't said goodbye. I ran after him in pink socks and no shoes, although it was raining. I got to the station only to discover that the train had pulled out. However, another train had just come in. My father got off it and I was very pleased to see him."
"0121"	"I went up to our 3rd floor attic to get something that was stored there. I heard a noise and upon looking behind an old chair, I found our cat. She had had a kitten and was very proud of the fact. When I went downstairs she picked the kitten up by the nape of the neck and carried it tenderly and proudly between its teeth. When we got downstairs she took the kitten and deposited it very graciously in front of my mother."
"0122"	"I was working in a hospital. Suddenly I received an emergency call to go right home because our cat George was very ill. I hurried home and there I found my mother crying beside George who seemed to be perspiring and choking. I picked up a pair of scissors and began cutting off his fur. The fur didn't come off very easily so I skinned him. He didn't seem to be getting any better so I rushed him to the hospital. There the doctor said he had only a few days to live. He said that if I had brought George right to the hospital instead of skinning, he would have gotten better. I just stood in the doctor's office and cried."
"0123"	"The time was about 1 o'clock on Monday, October 17 and I was hurrying down the main corridor of Mather Ad Building to get to my Shakespeare class. Halfway there I met two other girls in my Shakespeare class. We started talking about the course and about the test that we were to have the following day. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had forgotten all about the test over the weekend and I hadn't studied at all for it. When we got to the door of the classroom, I stood outside for some minutes trying to decide whether I should go in and take the test or not. I had a very lost feeling and I retraced my steps down the corridor past an old high school pal of mine. I was now headed toward the library to read over my notes before the test. While I was in the library a girl asked me if a friend I knew was in my class. I tried very hard to recognize who the friend was and where she would sit in the class. I then returned to the class after it had started and took the test."
"0124"	"I was on a Euclid Avenue streetcar about 9 o'clock on a Wednesday morning. Suddenly a girl in one of my classes came up and sat down next to me. We talked about school and then she had to get off at Abington to go to Clark Library. I noticed how exceptionally nice she looked as she jumped off the street car because she was wearing anklets and loafers. This was unusual because she works part-time and always wears black shoes and stockings."
"0125"	"I was going to a baseball game at the stadium. I was to meet a friend there at 3 o'clock but the game started at 2. I kept thinking that I should get ready to go to the game, but I never quite got dressed. I then found myself at a dinner at Stouffer's Restaurant at Shaker Square. At this dinner were several of my classmates from Mather. I remember seeing an elderly woman there who was in my Spanish class. We conversed in several minutes and then I heard my mother asking me what the score of the Ohio State game was. I couldn't remember the score, but I said someone made along run. The conversation then turned to the subject of a fraternity at Shaw High School called Phacoms. We talked about how may of them were married."
"0126"	"I had a dream where I was riding in a beautiful car on a highway over the Pacific Ocean. The beautiful scenery and the ocean I can recall. I remember how relaxed I was taking this trip and how much I was enjoying it. We got off by the ocean and stood on the cliff and watched the waves come up as we felt the clean air and the beauty of nature. We traveled around visiting different places and enjoying the various sights. The participants of this dream were my boyfriend, 23, and I. The colors remembered are blue and green."
"0127"	"I remember being in South Dakota with my former college friends, and we were on a tour singing in our school choir. We were traveling by bus and were visiting different towns, singing as we went by, Christmas songs and religious hymns. We were all having a wonderful time visiting people in these different towns. We were having a grand time in the bus making a great deal of noise and were attracting everyone's attention. The participants of this dream were June Ramage, 19, a girlfriend Esther, 19, a girlfriend Evely, 20, girlfriend Ruth, my sister age 24, Shirley age 21, girlfriend. No colors were seen."
"0128"	"I had dreamed that my sister was in an accident and had injured herself severely. She had come home with a broken leg, arm and dislocated hip bone. She was all bandaged up. My mother, brother and I were shocked seeing her in this condition and as we heard what had happened, I had burst into tears because she was in such a terrible condition. We had not heard anything about it til she had come home, so it was a shock. The participants in this dream were mother 50, brother 27, sister 24 and myself."
"0129"	"I had a dream where a magazine seller came to our home and began throwing magazines of all sorts all over the room. And it seemed as if he was in an insane state of mind. Astounded, we got up and it seemed that he had run out and left everything all over the room. We knew not why he performed such an act. The participants in this dream were my mother 49, and myself and this magazine salesman whose face I cannot place."
"0130"	"I was playing ping pong at a church I remembered as being way out in Sacramento, California. The setting was so realistic, it was like I was there yesterday. As we were playing (my opponent I cannot place) a man suddenly came in and asked for some money. He looked like a beggar or a tramp. I found a nickel in my purse and gave it to him. Apparently this was not what he had come for. He started to come toward us and while screaming, we ran out the back way and up the stairs where I used to live. He followed and I called to my mother who came out and the tramp just ran as fast as he could. I woke up so suddenly terrified by this dream. The participants other than myself were this man about 50, a complete stranger, the girl I was playing with I cannot recall."
"0131"	"I know very definitely something occurred in the beginning of this dream, but I find it impossible to remember what it was. The first thing I recall is standing with a partner in a long double line such as one is taught to do in the elementary schools when passing through the halls. The dream is extremely hazy, although I do know that everyone was clothed in a net dress of some pastel color. In front of me and down one step were my parents. My mother was clothed in a green net gown, but I failed to notice my father. Somehow I knew that this was a wedding procession with my aunt and uncle who were to be married on the lead. I took absolutely no notice of whom my own partner was. It might easily have been either male or female. I faintly recall girls in net dresses brushing past me as they went up the steps, but there was not one individual in the dream who took distinct form or personality. Neither was there any plot or action in the dream. However, as was stated before, there seems to be much in the dream that I feel was there but cannot actually remember."
"0132"	"Glancing into the bathroom mirror, I was horrified to see that one of my bottom front teeth had a wedge-shaped crack in it. I reached into my mouth to examine it more closely and discovered it was extremely loose. As I tugged on it, I accidentally pulled out my entire lower left jaw bone. The teeth, however, remained in perfect order inside my mouth. Calmly I washed the blood off the jaw bone, which incidentally resembled that of a parrot beak calf whose picture I had noticed the day before in my genetic book. After the bone was clean, it very definitely assumed a different color and shape. It looked as though it were now made of pale blue painted wood, half my own size, and shaped like a rod about 1 inch diameter twisted around and around in loops. Tied to it was a piece of blue satin ribbon. I remember feeling very guilty about what the dentist would say when he found out I had removed my own jaw bone. Then the thought of how angry my mother would be occurred to me. Therefore, I folded the blue jaw bone in half and hid it in my closet. I knew that the dentist would have to pull my teeth since they were not held firmly in place by the jaw bone. So once again I reached into my mouth and ripped my bottom teeth out all in one strip. Again I washed them off with water and noticed with surprise that they were filled with tarnished copper--not silver at all. I was also amazed when I discovered none of the teeth had roots, but instead were held in place by little copper plates. Again I felt very guilty. How could the dentist fit me with false teeth when I no longer had a jaw bone? Suddenly I looked once again in the mirror and found with great relief that all my teeth were back inside my mouth. I remember thinking to myself that all this was only a dream and soon I would wake up. No words can express how thankful I was when I realized in my dream that it was only a dream."
"0133"	"I was standing alone in the living room of my home when suddenly I spied a tiny luminous ball floating rapidly through the air toward me. As I moved away frightened, it began to pursue me, continuing the chase for several minutes. Suddenly I was no longer afraid. Curious about the characteristics of the ball, I quickly seized it and was amazed to discover it had assumed upon close examination a very different shape. Its size had increased several times, its form had become conical, and strangest of all, it was composed of approximately 50 tongue depressors sticking out in all angles, but somehow attached at the base of the cone by tightly wound rubber bands. With a satisfied happy feeling I decided the reason this object had pursued me was due to the force caused by the tightly wound rubber bands which propelled it through space. With that the dream ended."
"0134"	"I was standing in a strange bathroom watching a friend of my mother's washing her hair in the sink upon which a gray kitten was perched calmly watching the proceedings. Suddenly the cat's face contorted in a wild grimace causing the woman to become frightened. Picking up the cat, she threw it into a nearby bathtub which somehow was filled with flames. Horrified I saw the kitten's fur catch fire and the cat slowly begin to burn to death. The woman was instantly remorseful, but her main thought was to put the cat out of its misery by speeding up the burning process and beating the cat over the head. Before the animal had completely disappeared in the flames, I awoke."
"0135"	"I was looking at a picture in a magazine of parallel lines of dead women floating upon a river, when suddenly the picture came to life. I remember thinking to myself that somehow I knew all these women were German peasantry and all approximately 50 years of age identically resembling each other. As I looked upon the scene, one of the women returned to life by opening her eyes. Then I awoke."
"0136"	"I dreamt that I was having extreme pains and didn't know where they were or what was causing them. I made an appointment at a hospital to see a doctor. I went to the hospital and a nurse at the desk took my name and other statistics and then sent me to a room. An intern came in, a young man about 28 and examined me, then told me to lie down. I'd have to wait until the specialist came. I lay there for about an hour, very annoyed because I had to wait, and then the doctor came. He told me I'd have to have an operation, but I said it was impossible. I had to go to school."
"0137"	"I dreamt that it was summer again and I was down at the beach at Lake Erie. I was all alone until a girl whom I judged to be about 17 came up to me and began to talk. She was very friendly and I decided I liked her. She told me she was from Pittsburgh and that she didn't know anyone at the resort. She and her parents and brother had just bought a cottage and this was their first summer at the resort. She asked me to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family, which I did. Her parents were very nice and just as friendly as she. Her brother turned out to be a very nice-looking blond fellow about 22 who was a senior in college. It was a very pleasant evening and I was asked to come back. The beginning of an exciting summer."
"0138"	"I dreamt that it was a warm autumn evening and I was in a restless mood. I decided to go for a walk in the woods. The forest was very quiet, but I kept hearing the rustling of leaves. As I walked along, I came to an overhanging cliff. I looked down and saw a small river far below. At first I felt very happy and then I heard the hooting of an owl in the distance. I then felt very lonely--turned around and went home."
"0139"	"I dreamt that I walked into a drug store one day and sat at the soda fountain on a revolving stool. The waitress came to take my order, but I was undecided as to what I should order. After waiting about ten minutes, the waitress became rather angry and said that people like me were always going around in circles. I didn't understand what she meant, but just then the stool I was sitting on began to spin around and wouldn't stop until all at once I fell off."
"0140"	"I dreamt that I was a famous ballet dancer and was acclaimed by audiences all over the world. Every night I would dance, and at the end of the performance there would be a tremendous ovation and I would receive large bouquets of flowers. All of them carnations. One night I went out on the stage to do my solo and I saw no one in the audience or the orchestra pit. I began to dance anyhow and danced until I fell exhausted. There was a tremendous ovation--from where I didn't know."
"0141"	"At the beginning of this dream, I entered church and sat down next to the aisle. Then I started talking to an unknown lady next to me about a fellow in the choir (one whose name I do not know, but one whom I have wanted to meet). She proceeded to tell me what a fine person he was and then she got up and started to leave. I called after her and asked his name. She replied Roy Neru and then left. I continued then to watch him in the choir. Later in the dream I saw him in another part of the church and I was very disappointed with his build and stature--he was very short and extremely fat through the hips and waist."
"0142"	"In this dream as in many I was at my home in West Va. I was in the yard playing with one or two unidentifiable persons, when suddenly by the porch steps I saw a snake and it was a very brilliant shade of gold. In extreme fear, we ran into the house and slammed the door, breaking an orange and pink-colored vase. Later I looked out of the front window, the snake was still there and our yard had turned into an ice skating pond for in the distant part of it two persons were skating, unaware of the imminent danger which the snake represented. However, I awakened at this point before any harm had been committed by the ominous creature."
"0143"	"This subject was on the second floor of a house, her own home, and she called her mother, but she was not there. Then she decided to go out and look for her mother. She went out the second floor window and floated down the roof of the house, and then started to walk, and the farther she walked, the more obscure the neighborhood became. She took a bus then, which went on past her the first time, but she took it on the way back and was the lone passenger. The bus was bright red. They drove down a steep hill, recognized a house and large lamp post in front of the house. The house was orange and she took out a key which fit when she tried to unlock the door. She then entered the house with a feeling of belonging there."
"0144"	"In this dream I was informed by a doctor and different other people that I was going to die, but no one seemed to know just why or how much longer I would live. Throughout the dream I was more upset because of the uncertainty of the disease than the thought of dying, and I was frantically questioning different individuals for the name of my fated illness. Most of the participants of the dream were rather vague, unidentifiable figures, even the doctor. I do remember my mother's presence though, but oddly enough she was not too upset about the whole thing; she did, however, try to obtain the cause for my imminent death. Supposedly blisters would appear around my eyes shortly before the end. The whole thing seemed rather inconceivable to me even in the dream. I couldn't believe that there was anything wrong with me, but I was still very disturbed by it all."
"0145"	"I was at Harvy Cafeteria (at Lakeside Hospital) with two of my girlfriends and we were there in hopes of seeing a certain intern whom I have an incipient interest in. The cafeteria, however, was very dark and gloomy and did not look at all as it actually does. We placed ourselves in various spots, hoping that he might walk past. He failed to appear and later I walked out of this building and down three or four steps very dejected."
"0147"	"I walked toward the desk in our den. There was an envelope with writing on the inside. It was from a girl who worked for our family when I was a child. She was with us for about 6 years and practically reared me. I was very attached to her and still do hear from her occasionally. I couldn't understand in the dream why she had written the letter on the inside of the envelope. I was blaming my mother. I don't think she wanted me to know what was said in this letter. There was also another envelope with writing on the inside, but I don't remember whom this was from. In the dream I was thinking that when I wrote this dream up in my dream report, I didn't think I would be able to remember from whom I had received this second letter."
"0148"	"I was making a telephone call on a Sunday morning. I dialed the wrong number (I don't know whom I really intended to call) and the phone was answered by the daughter-in-law of a friend of my mother's. She (the daughter-in-law) is about 23 years old and has been married 1-1/2 years. She answered by saying, ""This is Buddy's wife and it's 8:30 in the morning"" in a very belligerent, cold manner. I hung up. She and I are, in real life, friendly but not good friends. It's more of a big-little sister friendship. I don't see her too often."
"0149"	"I was walking down a street that supposedly was Euclid Avenue. The street greatly resembled Euclid Avenue, but was not exactly the same. I was near 105th I think. I was walking past some houses, and went into one. Then I was in what seemed to be a ground floor room of one of these houses. A boy I liked very much was being called on a loud speaker. (I do not know who this boy is, though he resembles someone I recently had a date with.) A woman was there also--she was his mother, I think. There were several puppies in a basket on the floor. I thought of playing with them, but I don't believe I actually did. Then the boy was there behind me, I believe. I think he said something about the dogs. Then I was walking down the street again and I think I waved goodbye, though no one was there. The entire dream is difficult to recall, as are all my dreams, especially since I've been trying to remember them."
"0150"	"I was at the home of a friend that lives in the country. I was walking toward the barn. At the door of the barn sat a woman about thirty years of age. I do not know this woman--her face wasn't clear. I did, however, seem to know her in the dream. She was holding a baby. I called the baby by my four-year-old cousin's name (my cousin is a little boy). The baby, however, was much younger than my cousin--perhaps not even 1 year old. I hugged the baby several times. A good friend of mine was with me in the dream."
"0151"	"I was walking down the steps from Hitchcock 306 and stopped to look out the window. Someone above me said, ""I hope you had a good look. I think you'd better come back up here."" I turned and I saw that it was a Gestapo agent. I walked back upstairs and he said he had a job for me. He set me to work in room 306 taking things out of a closet with two separate entrances (like the ones at my church and is not in 306) and piling them outside. Soon I heard dance music and turned to see the room filled with people. I looked and saw Dick, a boy in several of my classes at Reserve coming toward me. He held out his arms and I went to him and we began to dance a rumba. I could even feel myself following his steps. He held me very close."
"0152"	"I was standing on the bank of a small pond in which a very small yacht was located. The water was only waist deep and a boy of 20 that belongs to the young people's group I do was running through the water toward the boat. His clothes were blue. I walked along the bank and up the gangplank into the cabin. There was a mist in front of my eyes. I said, for I knew he was in there, I bet I know something. He said, what? I said, you're all wet. He said, guess again. Then I saw him smiling, stretched out on a couch with a cocky officer's cap and a light blue turtleneck tee shirt and blue dungarees. They were dry and not the same ones he had on before. I just stood there and the dream was over. His arms were folded behind his head. I had had several dates with him and he had walked me home from several of our Sunday evening meetings."
"0153"	"I was on an embankment by a lake with two of my girlfriends from Mather. There was a card table there and some chairs where we had eaten lunch. One of the girls was away from the table. I looked across and there was a flowing river going down the hill which looked more like a ski jump. It was so smooth and there was an edge just above the level of the lake over which the water flowed slowly. As I looked at this, I saw a tall blond young man in what looked at first like a canoe sitting straight up with a paddle floating down this river and landed on the lake. He was in a kayak (Eskimo boat). He jumped out. He was wearing dark trousers, loud socks, moccasins, and a dark shirt, and swam hard to a launch nearby letting the kayak drift. The launch was wide and gray and not like any I had ever seen."
"0154"	"I have a feeling that something happened before this part of the dream, but I cannot remember it. I was in the deep water in the swimming pool at the Tudor Arms where I have a swimming class. I was holding on to the edge. A boy I knew in second grade and met again later in junior high at a young people's group and who is 19 now and a student at Case and goes steady with a girl he met at the church we go to - was standing beside the pool and helped me out. I went down the steps to the elevator as he walked down the way to the shower room and I said I would see him downstairs. The next thing I knew I was getting in his car, a small coupe, and he put both arms around me and I leaned my head on his shoulder. I was tired after swimming and it felt good to be there."
"0155"	"I went into the reserve bookstore to buy some green-lined three-ring notebook paper. There were quite a few people in the store. I do not remember seeing any faces clearly. I saw a stack of the paper I wanted , but the pile was uneven and each package had about five sheets in it and were all dirty and messed up. I think someone looked at me quizzically while I looked through them to find a neat, clean package. So I turned around and found a nice neat stack of the paper I had come to buy and picked up a package."
"0156"	"I was having a club meeting at one of the member's homes in the suburbs. We carried on the meeting after which we went out in the back yard and played volleyball. (It had rained and the cement was wet.) There was a girl at the meeting whom I did not know, but after she left I asked someone her name and discovered that she was one of my girlfriends who I didn't recognize because she had changed her hair style. She is my age, so I don't know what she was doing at a meeting for 12-year-olds. (I lead the group.)"
"0157"	"I was getting ready to go to teach Hebrew school. I was to be picked up in a few minutes. Per usual, I was rushing about getting dressed. It seems that my clothes were heavy winter ones, boots, ski pants, parka-like hood. Suddenly I felt extremely warm and realized it was a summer day and should be dressed in a cotton dress. I hurriedly changed and went out to the car whose driver (my employer) had been impatiently circling the block due to lack of parking space on my street. He is a 40-year-old Frenchman whom I dislike and with whom I have strained relations."
"0158"	"I was living in an apartment hotel and was attending a party in another suite in the building. When I left the party I was going to go straight down to the main floor in the elevator, but thought better of it and got off at my floor. When I opened the door of my suite, the maid and butler were just pulling a large bag full of stolen things through the hall to take it out the door. The maid rain away immediately but the butler remained to express his regrets that their scheme hadn't worked. I for one was happy it hadn't."
"0159"	"Our family doctor (a good friend of ours), his wife, and another man were visiting my mother and myself in our home. The man left and we heard a shot. We ran to the window and someone was shooting him in the back. Our doctor went out to help him and he was shot four times in the base of the spine. An ambulance came and took both men away. In about an hour the man was back, not much worse for the wear. The doctor was getting along alright, but he would be in the hospital for a while. Some sort of impairment was expected from his injury."
"0160"	"I was attending a Sunday school teacher's meeting at the temple where I teach. There was a person there who seemed very familiar, but I couldn't place her. Suddenly I realized that it was R.S., a woman who was the principal and revered friend of mine when I was 13 years old and attending Sunday school. As I left her, I could see her making some pleasant remark about me to another teacher, Mrs. H."
"0161"	"I was part of a nationality parade in downtown Cleveland. We were marching three abreast. Each national group was distinct by something they wore. One group I remember wore Philadelphia cream cheese packages in their ears. The Russian group wore on their lapels red and white flowers. I glanced at the person marching next to me (a young woman, I think). She had little black dots resembling raisins in her ears. That meant she was a Sicilian, which made me one too because I was marching with her. The sky began to get dark and it began to rain. I had to leave the parade and round up my nursery school group. I could only find 3 of them. Two were 3-1/2 year old boys and the third was the nursery director's girl, who's also in my group. I looked for the children's drivers to take them home. I was carrying one of the boys who, though in real life is quite large, felt very light. We finally met one of the drivers who took the little girl. It was very dark and raining hard by now. Since I couldn't find the 2 boys' driver, I began to look for my car, which had been parked somewhere downtown. I couldn't find that either. Finally met the nursery director. She didn't seem at all worried where her little girl was, nor cared where my car was. She got into her car and drove away."
"0162"	"I dreamt I was driving to a club meeting for which I am (in reality) president. I parked across the street from the house and walked in. There were many members and prospective members sitting in the living room and dining room because it was so crowded. I called the meeting to order and then most of the members got up and said they were going on the front porch where they could hear the meeting from there. I was so ashamed and insulted (because of the guests there, many whom I had personally invited) that I put my coat on, asked one of the guests if she wanted a ride home and stormed out. Only my car had disappeared. I told my friend (my age) that it was probably stolen even though I had locked it. We waited a few minutes and soon a Negro woman drove by and parked my car. Seated in the back were four little colored boys. She got out and said to me, would you please drive these boys home? I told them all to get out and asked her how she got in. She said she forced open a window. I then got in and drove away with my friend."
"0163"	"I dreamt that I had applied and was accepted in a nursery school this summer. The hours were from 12:15 (noon) to 1:30 only. The teacher I was to assist is in real life my assistant, f, 25, in a nursery school. I was very worried as to how I could work at both nursery schools in one day. I remember taking the children in for a swim. It was a lake off a sandy beach. Then this head teacher said we would take them for a nature hike in the woods. I remember I only had on tennis shoes and therefore couldn't go with them. I rationalized that I would stub my toes with these thin tennis shoes. Therefore I stayed to prepare art work for the children because I knew the head teacher wasn't capable of it. As I was doing my art work (making balloons for them to color) 2 or 3 girlfriends appeared and we began to play cards. In the midst, my mother-in-law called to ask if we were having fun. I knew she was really calling to see if her son (my husband) was home safely. Next, I was getting my coat to leave the nursery school and I met a girl I grew up with but haven't seen in a few years. I introduced her to my husband and asked about her baby. She said it was a girl called Tonia."
"0164"	"I was returning to a former nursery school I once worked in, as a teacher again. Only the children who were assembled as a class, I recognized as the children I have in my present nursery job. It was a period following a long vacation and I couldn't get the children's attention. I began a story and the next thing I knew the children were running all around a large grassy playground. Then I would chase them together again and try to begin the story. Next I was at a rehearsal of the Cleveland Symphony. I was there to conduct the orchestra in Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Szell, the conductor, showed me the score and then he left. The first page of the score was words only, no music, and I was perplexed. I turned the page, lifted up my right arm and began to conduct. It sounded terrible, as the players, who said they knew it so well, played without music. I had to stop several times and once I reprimanded the piccolo player for not coming in on time. Szell returned and yelled at some of the players. The players told me secretly when he left that they were playing poorly because they didn't like Szell. Leaving in defeat, my husband begins to conduct and do a good job. I woke up and remembered part of the melody of that 5th Symphony. I heard the entire symphony in my dream."
"0165"	"I was living on a third floor suite of an apartment with my husband. A family of three ITALIANS lived on the street floor. I remembered that they were to be feared as they always carried knives. The dream skips around and I am next across the street from the apartment in a park and the three Italians are throwing (from their apartment) knives at me, only when they land on the grass and when I go to pick them up, they become darts. One of the thrown knives becomes a shining long saber knife. I believe the Italians were all males. The older one, the father, the other two, his two sons (or perhaps one was a daughter, can't remember)."
"0166"	"I seemed to be in a strange city with my skating partner to participate in a skating competition. At the hotel I was surprised to find that my partner (33-year-old male) had a three-room suite while I had only one room which I did not see. I was admiring his suite which seemed to be furnished in old-fashioned taste (like his home really) and was inspecting the things that belonged to him (as I have done in his home). After a while we began to wrestle playfully and I kept wishing it would turn into love-making (as I often wish actually), but it didn't (it never does in real life either)."
"0167"	"I was watching my French teacher (a female of about 50 years) step out of her nightgown. She seemed to have on two because I could not see any of her body when she stepped out of the first one-and they were light green in color. We seemed to be getting ready to go somewhere together. My French teacher looked at me and said that I had better take off my sweater which I was wearing over my dress or I would be too warm. I replied in French ""J'ai peu d'avon froid, je vain garden mon chandail,"" which is translated, ""I am afraid I will be cold, I'm going to keep the sweater on."" The dream ended there."
"0168"	"I dreamed that I was in a hospital waiting for the bandages to be removed from my father's eyes (he is 65) to see if he would be able to see. I cannot remember actually seeing any details. I just seemed to sense that all this was going on and that my father had bandages on his eyes. (In the same way I seemed to know that he was able to see once the bandages were removed. No one else was in the dream. Before they were removed, I was very, very anxious and afterwards I felt very happy."
"0169"	"I was skating on the outdoor ice pond that used to be across the street from my house. I was not alone, but I did not recognize any of the other people who were skating around. I went through my whole repertoire of jumps, spires, and steps-some of which I can do and some of which I'm not yet sure of. They were all executed flawlessly-some I repeated, some I did only once. I seemed to know that if I went into competition, I would be sure of coming in third because there were only three contestants. Up to that time I hadn't considered it because I hadn't thought I was good enough, but now since everything was going so well, I decided to enter."
"0170"	"I was walking on a wide sidewalk on a strange street and as I passed by the stores at the side, I decided that I didn't like the dream and I wanted to wake up. I as wearing long, black stockings which were wrinkled and had holes at the knees. I seemed to know that if I didn't like the dream, all I had to do was jump up in the air and land on my knees on the sidewalk. I did that and it worked. I woke up."
"0171"	"In this dream I was standing with my ticket in my hand in an outside railroad station waiting for my train. Next I found myself going with a handsome man in a brown suit (age 35-6) into another train. I was aware of what I was doing. I had missed my train and was taking another with this man. I think I must have known the man in the dream-but outside of the dream, I don't. We went into the Pullman and ordered some drinks."
"0172"	"In my dream I seemed to be in bed in a strange bedroom. Sitting in the chair in the corner of the room was a man who seemed to be quite familiar to me, but I did not know his name. His face was very kind, attractive, and I wasn't afraid of him. He was watching me while I tried to make up my mind whether to take the 3 capsules which I had in my hand. I don't recall the color of the 2, but the 3rd one was a bright red capsule, and looked to me like a Seconal capsule (a strong sedative) which I know from past experience that I am very allergic to it-it makes me quite sick. After deliberating, and knowing that I shouldn't, I did swallow all 3 of the capsules, and seemed to feel extreme confidence in the man who had given them to me."
"0173"	"I saw a very dear friend of mine (f, 32) who was standing in my room. She wore a white satin, lace-trimmed slip. The one shoulder strap of her slip was broken and she appeared disheveled and distressed. However, we did not carry on any conversation."
"0174"	"I found myself walking on a huge green lawn and saw distant tall building. The lawn was flanked by banks of flowers. The building looked new and white. As I was approaching it, I felt a sense of loneliness, and felt myself a stranger as I neared the building. There was no one else in the dream, and I did feel a little sad because I did not know where my family was."
"0175"	"I found myself in a strange room and a strange man seated at a desk (age ?). In front of the desk stood my former husband holding some books. I couldn't see his face because I was standing some distance behind, but the outstanding thing in this dream was the bright blue shirt he was wearing which had a large tear in the right sleeve. I do not recall the conversation, but remember leaving the room and crossing into another room which was very familiar--that is--I knew I had lived there before. This room was very dilapidated and messy. I then awoke."
"0176"	"I dreamed that I was driving along the street and the traffic was very heavy. There was a woman who was swinging from one lane of traffic into another. My roommate was with me. She is a school teacher, 23, I commented to her about this stupid driver, alongside of us at the present time. Although the windows of my car were closed, the woman heard me and looked at me as though she was quite insulted. After she had looked at me in this manner, she turned her car directly toward me and drove right into my car. The woman driving the other car seemed to be about 40 years old."
"0177"	"I dreamed that I was walking down the street with a man and woman. I cannot remember the appearance or age of these people, except that I seem to think that they were about my age level. A very large man passed on the street who seemed to have a very distended abdomen. I commented on his largeness. The man I was with said his father's abdomen was like that, and that he was an alcoholic. He also said that his father was dead. Suddenly a woman started chasing us and I became frightened and ran to my car and got in and drove away. The woman seemed to be chasing me in my car. Then I seemed to be driving down the street and it was very dark and late at night. I locked the doors in my car. The street seemed to be very quiet and there were no cars or people on the street. I heard a noise and I turned my head to look out the window at my right and saw the same woman who had chased me before, running along my car and screaming. She appeared very old and her face very wrinkled. She ran faster than I was driving and began to run in front of me. I turned to the left and saw another woman (I have no memory of her appearance other than she was a woman) running in front of my car from that side. I turned the other way to avoid hitting her and crashed into a store window."
"0178"	"I dreamed that I was walking out of the rear entrance of the hospital with two friends. Both are girls and one is 27 years old, and the other is 19. I was carrying a typewriter and we were going to my car, which was in the parking lot. We were walking around the lot and we couldn't find my car. Suddenly one of the girls called and said that my car was over where she was. I went over there and the two of them were in a car which was not mine. It had a New York State license on it, but it was not my car. I told them that it wasn't mine, and they got out. A teacher who I had for English in high school passed by and said that if I was looking for my car, it was on the other side of the lot. This teacher was a female and about 35 years old. I thanked her and we went over to that side of the lot and there was my car."
"0179"	"I was in our cellar at home with a former instructor. We were debating about what would be the best procedure to go about getting a stuffed water drain cleaned. I was sitting on the washing machine in my nurse's uniform smoking, and she was on her hands and knees inspecting the drain. After a few minutes my father walked into the room and I introduced him to my former instructor. He was very rude when she asked him if he would get the drain cleaned. I stood next to her and whispered to my father that he should be nicer. The instructor in this dream appeared actually as she is, and she is about 35 years of age."
"0180"	"I dreamed that my mother had died and my entire family was gathered in our living room after the funeral. We were all upset and everyone was very unhappy, and some of the family were crying. I was very unhappy, but was not crying , and I was talking to no one. I looked across the room and saw one of my sisters crying and very upset. I walked over to her and in front of everyone announced to her that I could see no reason why she was crying and acting as though she was upset. I told her that she of all people should never cry at my mother's death since she had done nothing while my mother was alive to make her anything but miserable and unhappy. At that point I was in the center of comments from the entire family, and I began to cry. My roommate then awakened me because I was sobbing in my sleep. All the people in my dream were members of my family. My sister is 39 years old."
"0181"	"I came into a living room with my boyfriend. There were 2 or 3 small children. One was 2-1/2 and another 1-1/2. I seemed to get their names by reading a Hebrew newspaper. A middle-aged woman, dark complexioned with black hair and wearing a print dress came into the room. She said she was his wife. I was shocked and surprised and was a little angry that he had not told me about her. I seemed to vacillate between withdrawing from the entire situation feeling maybe he's not worth it all and between sticking it out and fighting. As I felt he would be happier with me than with his wife. I felt quite uneasy, but the woman began speaking to me and she seemed very friendly. I then felt at ease and comfortable."
"0182"	"I was crossing the street and saw an accident. On the curb reclined a woman surrounded by about five or six people (men and women). They seemed to be supporting her. As I looked at her I saw her legs ended at the knees. She was uttering horrible sighs and screams in a somewhat rhythmical way. I sensed the street as 105, but I noticed a double street car standing on the track."
"0183"	"I was in the Hebrew school where I work. I evidently had come for an afternoon class on a Sunday afternoon. Another student (girl and my friend 20 years old) was there, but came in after I did. There was also a reception for our principal (who is leaving for Israel, 50 years old). I waited for my teacher, but he didn't come. The principal (female) came, but didn't go into the auditorium where the reception was. I then saw myself standing on a little side porch with my friend (the other student) and the principal. We saw a girl in a white dress coming down the street towards us. It was a girl I know, but to my knowledge doesn't know Hebrew. Anyways, the principal remarked how hard the girl promised to work in class. I seemed anxious and worried because it was after 9 p.m. and the program hadn't started yet."
"0184"	"I was talking on the telephone to the father of an old friend of mine (boy, 21 years old). We were discussing the party the Saturday night before to which I had invited his son as a guest. I asked him if his son had a good time at the party. He told me not to tell his son that he had told me, but that he had had a good time, except he was a little surprised that I had acted the way I did."
"0185"	"I was walking down Euclid Ave. near 105th. I then found myself in a building. There was a room with a counter and a woman behind it (like a counter in a department store). There was a door with 4 members on it. I was supposed to get married in the room. I spoke to my dad on the phone, telling him to come to the wedding at 8:30 p.m. He told me he was wondering about if he should bring an extra tie or go home after and change his tie because he was going to see South Pacific afterwards and would get his tie stained at the wedding. He told me if I needed anything, I should ask the woman. She took me into the room off of which was a bathroom. She showed me the bathtub and handed me the soap. As I was washing, my boyfriend and my economics teacher came into the bathroom. I remember it was 8:10 and I wondered if we'd be ready on time."
"0186"	"I dreamed that for some reason I was confined in the big brown house behind our lot. I was free to come and go as I pleased within the house, but I could not leave. The interior of the house was beautifully done in pale marble. There were no separate rooms, but it was divided into separate compartments by walls which protruded from the side walls at various angles. Straw mats were on the floor, and the large, short, fat man who kept me from leaving was always watching me. A wonderful man (the boy I am engaged to) kept coming to see me very often and begging me to come away from the place with him. I wanted to very much, but the fat man would not let us. One morning a group of school children, about 7 years old, were being led by the fat man in a tour of the building. We followed them, hiding behind the marble walls until we managed to escape. It felt so wonderful to be outside in the sunshine again."
"0187"	"I dreamed that three other girls and myself were being held in this large building by a gangster. He had much equipment for his gang, guns, lens, etc., and we kept destroying them. He became very angry, but did not kill us. He could not let us go because we knew so much. I managed to find a way to escape and the four of us looked for a place to hide. We came to Clarence Brown's furniture store. I thought this would be an excellent place since one of the girls last names is Brown. They were having a large party at the store and we had to tell just whom we came to see. I told the girl at the desk I wanted to see Clarence Brown and she replied he's been dead since 1863. She immediately knew we did not belong at the party and the gang leader's men--all over the party began to chase us down the street. We found an old house where we stayed for a while. One of the girls became engaged. We were very happy for her, but it seemed to mean that we could stay there no longer, so the other three of us set off again to look for a place to stay."
"0188"	"I dreamt I was in an 8 o'clock class with a girl who eats in our dining room, but is not in any of my classes. When I walked in, she was sitting there looking very tired. Her face was chapped, her eyes were red, and her hair was very straight and stringy. A very old lady whom I can't place, but seemed to know, had at the time come in and placed her hand on this girl's shoulder. How are you feeling, Pat? she asked. Pat replied that she was very tired. The lady asked her if it was a boy or a girl. She said it's a baby girl, but I just couldn't see missing my 8 o'clock class."
"0189"	"I dreamt my roommate and I were saying in our room at school, but the room was a part of a large hotel and summer resort. It was warm weather and we were having a wonderful time, swimming and playing tennis. When we returned to our room, the hotel manager came up and tore a ridiculous sign off our door. He was very angry and told us if this didn't stop, we would have to leave the hotel."
"0190"	"I dreamed that I was a small child, staying at the home of an aged lady. She kept insisting that I go upstairs to see her beautiful daughter, which I finally did. I opened the door and she was lying on the bed--dead. I did not walk over to her, I just knew she was dead. I came back downstairs and couldn't bring myself to tell the old lady that she was dead. I knew we were having company and I was worried that they would come soon. A large group of people walked through the front door and upstairs without knocking. I knew they would find the dead girl. I stood down at the foot of the stairs and heard much talking upstairs. I ran out of the front door and down the street."
"0191"	"We seemed to have moved to an apartment which consisted of all the rooms of our present house strung out one behind the other, starting with my father's bedroom. It was up a flight of stairs, the door at the bottom of which wouldn't lock. A bad little girl, about 6 years old, with dark brown braids, kept running up and doing something annoying, frightening, or destructive and I spanked her. The second time I took down her pants to spank, she quickly pulled off all her clothes (turning the other cheek, I suppose) and I became ashamed at my cruelty for I could not spank her all over. So I hugged her tightly to me."
"0192"	"A young male friend asked me did I have anything to do that afternoon. My watch said 2:35 and I said no. Then I thought harder and remembered I had (not a class) an exam in a peculiar kind of scientific German course in advanced grammar. Yet I had not attended class since spring vacation, nor had I studied. I needed the credits for graduation and couldn't figure out why no one had reminded me of this class which I had forgotten. I tried to cram for a few desperate moments, not knowing what to do."
"0193"	"I was eating a late at night dinner at the home of my church choir director, along with three members of the solo quartet, Sop. Tenor and bass. I decided that my hands were dirty and wanted to wash them, but I didn't know how to excuse myself for fear they would laugh. Finally I said, ""I have to wash my hands"" and went to the kitchen and started to splash about loudly. Just then the bass who was upstairs called, ""Oh mother,"" in a falsetto voice at the tenor who replied, ""Do you want me to hit you in the mouth?"" Then the bass came down to talk to me about what I can't remember, but his last words were something like, ""Well, why don't you?"""
"0194"	"I remembered more of this dream than usual. It is a good example of how the scenes change. Usually all but one or two are forgotten. In this dream I came late for lunch to the cafeteria, bought steak, potatoes, peas, etc. Bill $1.05. I sat with some friends who left shortly. I was next in the chapel singing the words to a bib. Lit. theme which I held in my hand--not my own theme, the name was that of a man. Another girl played the piano. An organ student came in at 1:05 to practice. We (who?) went over to the recital hall where my singing teacher was auditioning on the violin with a quartet. Soon there was a whole orchestra and we found that we had missed the overture to Carmen. A group of singers were putting on a concert version. Saw the first act in English. Don Jose was a short blond boy who kept getting shorter, ending the scene with the words, ""I walk just like my mother."""
"0195"	"I was to leave for California the next afternoon early. School was still in session and I planned to attend the classes all day, but soon realized that it would be impossible. I found it hard to convince myself that it wouldn't make any difference. I was not packed, and mother was to help by getting breakfast for me, but she didn't, and I couldn't find any clothes to take. Finally I packed my winter bathrobe and that's about all. I was to fly, a fact which has been a source of fear in other dreams, but was not too important except that I remember saying, ""Everything here is finished anyway. I've started nothing new."" My sister and a girlfriend were going too, but the arrangements were vague. I was to fly alone."
"0196"	"My 15-year-old sister did not return home from a date until 10:30 the next morning. My mother refused to punish her and I was furious. I berated her, but was embarrassed because a Mather girl, whom I know slightly, was visiting my home. She began to telephone her boyfriend and at this point my brother with numerous strange boys entered the house. I then found myself talking on the phone to a Western Union operator who told me that someone had purchased a leopard suit and expensive purse for me. You wanted to know if I knew of the purchase and if I thought I ought to accept it. At this point I woke. I remained resentful toward my sister as this was the most vivid part of the dream."
"0197"	"The situation took place during sorority rushing. The place was a grassy little hill in what seemed to be Florida. The hill was in front of the cabana-like building. It seemed that all our rushers had pledged other sororities and we were very upset, especially over one girl. We all attempted to talk to this girl, but were berated for dirty rushing. We became more upset as our favorite girls were running in and out of the cabana with other sorority girls and we were left sitting on the hill with a few, meek little girls we had never seen before."
"0198"	"I was in Mather administration building, but it resembled my high school somewhat. I recognized a girl coming down the hall as a girl my boyfriend used to date. She went up to him and asked him to carry a load of books for her. They went into a room nearby, but I could still hear them. She asked him to a dance and he finally accepted. He came and told me about it and I said we were all through. He was very upset and confused, so I turned and left him."
"0199"	"I had just returned from a vacation or somewhere to my classes at Cleveland Heights High. I was taking over my first gym class as a student leader or gym cadet as they are called. I did not know any of the other cadets because I had been gone so long. They were all strangers and regarded me with great curiosity because I was so much older than they. I did not know the gym teacher either and they seemed unwilling to allow me to conduct a class. When they finally consented, I had great difficulty in leading the girls because they did not respect my authority. I left the class as soon as I could and went to the dressing room feeling very depressed."
"0200"	"I was watching a large procession of men, led by Winston Churchill, walk into the parliament building in London. Behind Churchill a small man with an umbrella trailed. I went in with them and was seated near Churchill. Proceedings began and a young man stood up to talk, but I couldn't hear him because of planes overhead. Everyone laughed at him and he was very embarrassed. I stood up to berate the members for not allowing him to talk, and they were all very surprised to see an American in their parliament. As I talked, the planes became louder and everyone decided they were being bombed and left. I remained alone."
"0201"	"This is a part of a longer dream. The first part that I remember concerns swimming in the ocean. I do not remember getting wet, but I was struggling against the waves to get to shore. I came to a shallow place, but still had to fight my way along. I remember thinking that this was significant and I must not forget the dream. I finally got ashore. Next I think I was in some church with a friend of mine (f, 19). People kept arriving, and one was my friend's boyfriend. He brought her something, but I forgot what it was. I felt lonely so I withdrew. I was doing something in the rear of the church (writing or reading, I think) and not paying any attention to the service. I looked around (my back was to the congregation) and noticed that folding doors had cut me off from the rest so I felt relieved. Then I remember someone I knew (I don't remember who it was or the sex) came riding along a road on a bicycle. I said, ""You're a long way from home."" The person talked to me a while and then left."
"0202"	"I dreamed that I was in the Adelbert yard, getting a drink out of a fountain. A parade or large group of students came by and among them I saw the boy (21) whom I used to go with. I was about to go over to speak to him when I saw the girl whom he now sees instead of me. I felt very sad, lonely, rejected, and I started to sing to myself f, ""O where, o where has my highland laddie gone."""
"0203"	"I dreamed that I went into the Commodore Bar alone and ordered a glass of port and Seven Up from a waitress, but was feeling a little guilty about being in a bar all by myself at night. The order was brought in a cup with the Seven Up, and the port in the bottle, only it wasn't port. It was whiskey or something. The bottle was horizontally laid on the table, and I knew I shouldn't pick it up. Somehow the drink was spilled in the cup and I put a napkin in a saucer to soak it up. I drank it and expected my head to become dizzy, but nothing happened. On the way out, I saw two girls who I know who were drinking some beer, but whether I stayed with them I don't know."
"0204"	"I dreamed that I had just become engaged or married and that I was standing on Chester and Euclid waiting to cross the street. The light was red, so I couldn't cross the street because of the automobiles. I leaned against a telephone pole, picked a splinter from it and thought, ""Well, what difference does it make to be stopped for one light, when there is a whole life ahead?"" Next I seemed to be watching a play, Kiss Me Kate, but there was no audience that I could see. Kate and Petrucio were singing a song about dancing up and down. I thought that was as good a way to symbolize it as any. Then Petrucio said that he had practiced that afternoon with his secretary. Kate pretended to be shocked, but I knew she really wasn't."
"0205"	"I dreamed that a plague had descended upon a city. The people who were affected had their faces, limbs, and other parts of the body horribly distorted. It was necessary to shut these people up in vaults. I thought that this was an unmerciful thing to do, but nobody would pay any attention. Soon I realized that my cheek was becoming hard and knew I had the disease and would have to be shut up. My leg also became hard in one spot. The people said that I would have to be shut up, but they would try to put me in a nice vault. I felt resigned, but didn't want to be so distorted. The inside of the vault wasn't too bad, and I sat and waited until I became as sick as the other people there, but somehow I wasn't afraid."
"0206"	"For a little while I was walking up a sidewalk on a road that needed mending. I remember climbing over piles of dirt and rocks. Then I was riding in a car with two boys, Leonard and John, with me in between. We were riding up a street lined by 2-story buildings. The outside wall of all the top stories was colored a brilliant deep sky blue. The sun was shining. The sky turned exactly the same deep shade of blue as the buildings so that there was blue, blue, blue all over. It was so bright and lovely that I almost cried. Next I was in a new, modern apartment on the first floor up on a hill. It had big light window sand pink decorations. When I walked in, I said, ""This needs just a touch of blue."" Then I looked around and saw at some of the little windows, flower vases, pillows, were blue. Outside was a porch, and below was a big tennis court for all the kids to play on. My brother was down there. At the time it was getting dark at twilight and I could see tiny lights in the distance."
"0207"	"At one point I was trying to wheedle an extra late night from my house mother. I followed her all over the dorm saying, ""Please, just one late night."" I don't remember whether I got one or not. Somehow I was squeezing black heads and pimples on my face. I worked on them furiously and I remember seeing the tuff squeeze out. Somehow, they weren't on me, they were on someone else's arm. They got a dark purple color, so I took a big, wet alcohol-soaked piece of cotton and dabbed them with it."
"0208"	"I dreamed that I was sick and was having a dream about Mr. Chapman, my art teacher. In my dream we were rehearsing a play that he was directing. When I actually got well and returned to school, in my dream, Mr. Chapman was rehearsing a play and just as I had dreamed it. We started talking and I told him about it. At one point during the rehearsals, he was demonstrating a dance with the main dancer, to show the others how to do it. She had very bright colors on and they went whirling and twisting all over the place. Somehow I was in love with Mr. Chapman and I think he was in love with me. I think he made love to me even though he was married and I cried because I was so sorry he was married. This is all very indefinite and I don't remember much."
"0209"	"There was much more to the dream than this, but I can't remember it. I dreamed that I was supposed to go out with a boy on Saturday. I'm not sure which boy it was, but it was one of two that I date now. Then another boy named Victor asked me out for Saturday. (Victor is the first boy I ever went with. We broke up several years ago, but there has been attraction on both our parts ever since. I still like him, but he goes out with a good friend of mine. Since we understand each other, he periodically comes and tells me all his troubles.) When in the dream he asked me out, I knew that I already had a date, but I said okay, I would see him Saturday. He grinned, looking as if he knew about my other date, and left."
"0210"	"The early part of the dream I can hardly remember. I only know that I knew a poetic, artistic young man, and he died on the corner of Euclid and Adelbert Roads. There was no accident or anything unusual. He just lay down on the sidewalk and expired. The second part is not much clearer. I was in a sort of drawing class. We had to copy a make variations on a girl's figure. She had a very full skirt and very padded, broad shoulders. We drew her outline on the paper by drawing around a figure of her made in chocolate. Somehow, I couldn't find my chocolate figure and had to borrow someone else's. That figure was getting melted and soft, so that as I traced around it, I got chocolate all over my finger. I thought I was copying the girl's figure front view. Suddenly I looked up and it had changed to back view. I had to erase a great deal."
"0211"	"I dreamt that I was at the camp where I worked last summer, but two girls from school were there with me. There seemed to be a series of secret passages around the camp, and I was always running from something through them. Although I knew someone was after me, I was not sure who it was, so I was never sure whom I could trust. I also had the feeling that I had to get back to town. When the phone rang, I answered it and someone asked for me. Just as I was about to speak again, one of the other girls from school answered on another extension and said that I was not there. At this I became more frightened and didn't know where to turn."
"0212"	"I dreamt that I was at a swimming pool. However, it seemed to be a combination of a swimming pool and an open body of water. Although there were sides to it, waves were continually washing in. I stood looking at it, trying to get up enough courage to go in. Other people stood about and wanted me to go, telling me that it was safe. However, jut as I was getting up my courage, a boat race started past the place and it became impossible for me to enter the water."
"0213"	"I dreamt that I was crossing the street toward 107th Street by the Elysium Auto Sales when I heard some people in a car plotting a murder. Somehow I seemed to keep going back and forth across the street without seeming to be detected, and thus hearing the whole plot. A man who was a gangster was going to murder his mother-in-law. The only motive for this crime seemed to be that she had bought a hat that was too small for her. This gangster later found out that I heard the plot and was going to try to catch me. There was a man at the Elysium Auto Sales who was going to help me from being caught, however. The murderer's gang had come to the building where I was in a car. When I got in the car, it seemed to be enclosed; there was another car in front of it and the wall of the building in the back. When I did try to go, I seemed to go backwards. As the car seemed to start its slow backward motion, the dream ended."
"0214"	"I was somewhere downtown in Pittsburgh, although I did not recognize my surrounding, with my father. He wanted to buy a pair of shoes so we entered a shoe store that was on a side street. Not finding any he wanted, we left and turning the corner, we came onto a main street. Just ahead there seemed to be a large building such as a post office or a courthouse, although I didn't know which. Looking back, I saw a great many big stores where we had not been and I wondered why we had not gone there to look for a pair of shoes."
"0215"	"I had attended a movie at 105th Street and was sitting next to some other girls from school, although I did not seem to recognize their identity otherwise. However, I left them and was walking along Euclid Avenue alone. Just after I had passed 107th Street, I saw a police cruiser and the thought came to my mind of the safety it implied. However, soon afterwards, a man started to follow me. He seemed to walk just a step or so behind me and talk to me continually. He told me that his wife was out with a colored man, but that after she had attended a funeral, and would be home again. At first I did not seem to fear him, but as he continued to follow me, my fear grew. I was about to throw an egg at him which I realized I had in my hand (where I got it I do not know) when I woke."
"0216"	"I was guest in the hotel where I worked this summer as a waitress in Lake Placid. My parents were also there. We were seated at a table with one of the guests I waited on last year. His name in my dream was Mr. Bernstein, but afterwards I remembered his name really was Mr. Saferstein. I wanted to stay in Lake Placid, but I knew I had to go back for graduation. Then I felt like crying. I looked for more people I knew and saw three friends from Montreal, who had offended my parents and therefore we do not hear from them any more (really). I wanted to talk to them very badly. Afterwards outside I saw one of my parents with them. I don't remember which parent it was. I waited for them to come up the steps to the terrace, but they got into their car and drove away. My parents then told me they were going back to Canada. I was very disturbed because I had wanted to talk to them."
"0217"	"I was sitting at one of our tables in the dorm dining room. Suddenly I remembered I owed two of the girls some money. I gave it (change) to one of the girls next to me, and asked her to give the rest to the other girl. As I was handing her the money, our housemother popped up at my side and acted as if she wanted the money. I told her I would pay her later and as she stayed there, I got out my billfold (still sitting at the table) and gave her $1.15, which is the amount for a dinner in the dorm. I do not remember having a guest at dinner."
"0218"	"I was in a chemistry lab and was working with cleaning solution. One of the things I had to do was to put a rubber glove which had been turned inside out into a flask containing the solution, and then to pull the sides of the glove over the top of the flask. After this I remember having a mouthful of the solution. I had to keep it in my mouth for 10 minutes. When I went to rinse it out, I first took a mouthful of water and as I rinsed it out, I felt very faint. This happened several times until the water was colorless and then I no longer felt faint."
"0219"	"I was standing on a chair landing in the dorm when one of the girls went by and called to a boy (22) to come on up. I knew him, but when I saw him, I was surprised to see him. One strange thing I noticed about him was that the back part of the top of his head had a brush cut while the front part was shaved. I asked him what happened and he told me he was undergoing treatments at the dentist."
"0220"	"I dreamt I was sleeping. My girlfriend (20) who also lives in the dorm knocked. I wanted to tell her to come in, but I could only think it, as I was too sleepy. She came in and started showing me her packages. I had a feeling she had a bottle of cologne for me. There were about three packages which I knew were perfume. She then asked me to open one of them for her, and while I was opening it, I woke up, before she gave it to me."
"0221"	"I had to go to the laundrateria up at the corner. I took the streetcar (there is no longer a streetcar, it is replaced by a bus) and it was very crowded. I was standing right at the door, and I found that I was standing next to a former boyfriend of mine who I dislike at present and whom I was going with until September. He suggested that I get off with him to attend some kind of meeting. I did so. The meeting was outside on the corner. There was a mixed group with no one there whom I knew. Then another fellow came up who was the chairman, I believe. He offered to take me to the laundrateria. I accepted, and we drove over. We stopped the car and sat talking. I had never met him before. It was not where it is. It was a couple of blocks away, but we knew where we were going. It was set back from the street and was modern yellow brick."
"0222"	"I was in my house. On top of the bookcase in the sunroom were piled books and record albums (the bookcase is about seven feet high and there are not generally books on top of it). I was searching for some playing cards which were mixed up with the books and albums. As I was doing this, my Sunday school pupils were coming in the door. They stopped to say hello to me and then went on into the kitchen where the class was supposed to be held. My pupils are 4th graders. Only one little girl stands out in my dream. She said something to me, but I can't remember what it was. The cards that I was searching for had a blue bicycle design."
"0223"	"I was at some kind of camp in the evening on New Year's Eve. Some people asked me to go with them somewhere. I went with the others in a truck with an open-topped back. We set out about 10:30 and built a bonfire when we got where we were going. At about 11:15 I looked at my watch and realized I had to get back to my date before midnight. I rushed back and didn't find him there. I was told which direction he had gone. I hurried along the path and found that it led to a football stadium. I found the fellow I had a date with sitting there with one of his boyfriends. It was after midnight. There were only three main people--two fellows and me. The group I went with was mixed."
"0224"	"I was in a restaurant with the fellow I was going with at the time. We were with another couple our own age whom we doubled with and my next door neighbors (ages in their 40's). We were waiting to be waited on. When the waitress came, she asked us two girls to write down our ages on the check--even though we weren't ordering liquor, only ice cream. The other girl wrote down ""twenty,"" but everyone knew it meant twenty-one. I wrote down twenty-one, but felt ashamed because it wasn't true. My date was angry with me. Despite the fact that he didn't say anything, I knew how he felt."
"0225"	"I was in Texas listening to someone give a speech. The scene shifted and I was in another part of Texas listening to a speech given in an enclosed place with an open top. It was like a television show with lights, etc. Someone in the audience asked me where we were. There was a large flat lake near us, but desert all around otherwise. I said we were near Corpus Christi or Corpus something else, I can't remember. Then I was in a hotel going up to see the princess. When I got to her apartment, I saw a lovely light blue permanently pleated nylon negligee lying on the bed. It had a darker blue tatted edge at the bottom. I admired the gown very much."
"0226"	"I dreamt that I with my father was traveling on a train through a dark tunnel. We were sitting together, but I got up and moved to the back of the train. There was a Negro man of about 50 years sitting there, and I seemed to know him. The train slowed down and I said to the Negro, ""Well, here we are."" He got off the train and boarded a ferry boat."
"0227"	"I dreamt that I was in a large auditorium where a large crowd was seated. Many of the women carried hand-made white cardboard lambs. We were waiting for a famous movie actor to make his appearance. A man came on the stage, and said there was an accident. A girl who danced had to be substituted for the injured actor. My mother and I had to leave early because I had to go to the dentist. When we arrived, we found that the building was being torn down. The dentist was dressed in dirty overalls, but he put on a white doctor's gown over the overalls and began to work on my teeth."
"0228"	"I was in a long corridor with many other girls of my own age. Then other girls came filing in with papers in their hands. They had just graduated and the papers were their diplomas. I saw one of my friends who is a senior come in. I went over to her and congratulated her. I was emotionally wrought; tears filled my eyes. My friend accepted my best wishes and then walked away from me; she went to her locker. I followed her. She paid no attention to me. I kept asking her questions, but her answers were short and abrupt. She left and went down a stairway; I tried to follow her, but I found I had taken the wrong stairway."
"0229"	"I dreamt that I was invited to a large party held by a group of sororities. The one sorority that I seemed to be most interested in had chartered a bus. Several of the girls had dates. I did not, but the boy with whom I had gone to the stunt night dance was sitting in the seat behind me holding hands with a woman almost twice his age, and presently we turned around and began talking to the boy with whom I had gone and the woman. We talked of generalities, such as the weather, etc. Finally the ride seemed to be over for everyone left the bus. All the while, however, I was not conscious that the bus had been moving. We went into a large building in which each sorority had its own particular room. To get to the room of the sorority I was with, we had to go through the room of another sorority which I disliked intensely. But the room was empty and we went through into our own room."
"0230"	"I dreamt that I was in church along with many others. We were listening to a sermon by our pastor who had just died a week ago. The choir sang a beautiful hymn, and we all applauded loudly. There was a great deal of levity and laughter, but no one seemed to remark about this case of extreme bad taste. The pastor left the pulpit and we all sat still and very quiet as if we were waiting for something else to happen."
"0231"	"I dreamt I was office duty in the dormitory (consists of answering doorbell and telephone). I was sitting in the office when a tall, dark-haired young man came in, walked quite rapidly through the hall and living room and out into the dining room. He took a napkin and napkin ring out of the napkin stand which is at the entrance to the dining room, then he sat down at one of the tables all by himself and waited to eat. I thought this was very funny and I laughed and laughed. It was very amusing. I believe he took someone else's napkin, not mine. I don't know who the young man was, but he was about 24, I'd say."
"0232"	"My sister (16) and I seemed to be down by the lake and going to go in swimming. The water was beautiful and quite shallow in some spots, shallow enough that you could see green grass growing up from the bottom and out through the water. I felt that I needed exercise badly and I really wanted to go swimming on account of this. It seems that Miss Andreas of the gym department and some other gym faculty were there, but I don't remember them too clearly. Well, I was quite fearful of the snakes and other water creatures that might be hovering around in the shallow water, but I went in anyway and was very glad I did because the water felt nice. I woke up then."
"0233"	"My grandmother and I were near the lake which was frozen (grandmother 76). We were trying to go up a frozen path beside the lake, I was helping her. It was getting dark and she said we ought to turn back, but I said, ""Let's keep going. We can go over the slope and around the block and home."" She asked me if I was sure I knew the road over the slope and I hesitated somewhat, and finally agreed that we should turn back. It seemed that my father (42) and my sister (15) were worried about us. They were in a tower-like structure which was beside the lake, talking through a speaker system to planes which were out looking for us. I don't know what happened to grandmother, but I went up to the tower and told them I was alright. He called in the planes and questioned me where we had been."
"0234"	"I dreamt I was out by the barn at home, by the big barn doors. I heard a noise and looked down at the ground and there a little duck was trying to come up out of the ground. It was sort of buried and was trying to get out. When it did get out, I saw that it had a membrane or piece of skin attached to it, that it was not quite normal. I was wondering what to do to make it healthier when all of a sudden the duck seemed to have turned into a cake and I was cutting the cake. I was going to taste the cake and quite eagerly cut into it, when I saw right in the middle of the cake a horrible black worm with two feelers or type of sense organ-like whiskers twitching up and down. It was so horrible I could hardly look and dreamt I felt ill. Then I woke up."
"0235"	"I was going to a big dance and I was getting ready. I was going with a boy I used to date once it seemed that he was going to come and pick me up. However, before I could go, for some reason I had to go see our family doctor (about 48, male). I went up to his office and sat in the waiting room while he was finishing with the person ahead of me. Finally I went in and right away I sensed that he was dead drunk. He acted very queerly, demanded what I was there for. I told him I had to be examined so I could go to the dance. I was somewhat afraid of him. I remember there were cupboards in his office with all kinds of bottles on them. He examined me very quickly. I don't remember the details of the examination, but I knew it was very short. I left his office very puzzled."
"0236"	"I was waiting in a theater for a friend. I saw a girl dancing on the stage. She was dressed in a lovely pink ballerina gown. When the show was over, the man I was waiting for came over to the last aisle in the back where I was sitting, and we started out. Then the girl came out too and I congratulated her on her exquisite performance. She looked less happy than she had on the stage, and I felt guilty about that because I was going out with my friend and she was not. There was a bench in back of us and on it was a cake that had been made for her. I think I made it, but I'm not certain."
"0237"	"About 8 of us were going somewhere in a little coupe. We were out in a sparsely settled snow-covered country. Everyone was laughing and talking and suddenly, but without any noise or disturbance, the car stopped. I saw that there was a white snow-covered obstacle obstructing the passageway. Someone said it was a truck. I looked to find out and it was. Some of the boys got out and only two others and I remained in the car. I was alone I in the back seat. I propped my elbows on the back of the front seat and asked my friend, thinking my date was out of the car, ""Say, Pat, what's my date's name anyway? Don't tell him I didn't know, but I was never introduced."" Pat laughed and said, ""He's sitting right in front of you, ask him yourself."" I thought this was pretty funny and made some remark I can't remember. Suddenly the boy turned around and all I could think was I've never seen him before in my life. And the next thing I knew, someone said the truck was gone and the car was full of people again and we went away."
"0238"	"I was in my bedroom and the window opened and a baseball player came in. He smiled and said he was looking for something. I asked him who he was and his answer was ""a Cleveland Indian"" and I was impressed. Then a crowd of the dorm kids came in and I told them, and they smiled and said he wasn't. He carried an aluminum rod which I supposed to be a bat. Then he leaped out of the window onto a tremendous ball field and suddenly there were hundreds and hundreds of people and they were all stampeding somewhere, while many others were playing baseball. I laughed because suddenly I saw that the Cleveland Indian wasn't one at all and he laughed too. I don't know why. He was medium height with black hair and very brown eyes. I know I'd seen him before. The people were running, very happily--it was some sort of a game. It bewildered me, but didn't too much faze me."
"0239"	"I was coming off desk duty at 1 a.m. I picked up my books in the dark and started to come upstairs to bed because I was exhausted. When I arrived at the bottom of the stairs, my legs gave way and I slid to the floor. All I could think was how silly. Now I just want to lie here and sleep till morning, but people don't do that. Then a fire door opened and there were kids from the house peeking at me through a crack in it. They said, ""Did she faint?"" But I couldn't answer because I was just too tired to bother. Then I was coming out of the drugged state and started to laugh because I was still at the foot of the stairs and not in bed."
"0240"	"I was in a room in which lay on a hospital bed a male patient. He was losing his eye, only didn't seem to care. The next day I was going to a party and found that I had contacted the disease took and was quite worried because I didn't want to bear the pain and lose the eye. My friends took very good care of me. One bandaged my eye while the others waited in the car for me. I was sorry to keep them waiting so long, but they said that was perfectly all right. We rode to a beautiful village and it was night time when we arrived there. Everyone was very hungry, so we stopped at a strange little place for food. I felt wonderful again and more reassured about my eye, which though it was still painful and inflamed, seemed to me to be healing. After eating, we played hide and seek, and then had to go on. I didn't recognize many of my friends, but I knew I liked them all, everyone was in a good humor and laughing and joking."
"0241"	"I was taking care of children and after doing my homework I lay down and went to sleep and when I woke up, it was very late and the children's parents weren't home yet. So I just left. The next thing I was waking up the next morning in my house and my mother was asking me how could I have left those poor children alone last night. I felt terrible about it and I told my mother I must be going crazy."
"0242"	"I was talking with a group of people. Suddenly I heard a crunching noise and felt something drop into my mouth. I spit it into my hand and saw it was a tooth. It seemed to be an eye tooth, but resembled a three-legged individual salt dish. I remarked upon the oddity to my friends only to feel a sudden avalanche of falling teeth. My mouth was completely filled with teeth and they hurt my mouth. Again I spit the mouthful into my hand. Yet the minute they began dropping, other teeth came half way into my gums. A second time all my teeth dropped out, but again they seemed to be forced out by new teeth growing in. I thought in the dream that this was ridiculous because no one can have two sets of adult teeth grow in."
"0243"	"My boyfriend was home on leave from the Navy. He came into the house in his uniform, which he never wears at home, as son as he arrived. He held a box in his hand which contained matched wedding bands. He kept begging me to take them so that we would be married. I tried so hard to refuse because I didn't want to marry him, but yet I didn't want to hurt him by refusing. We stood in my living room arguing about the rings until I started to cry."
"0244"	"A group of girls who live in my dormitory were standing in the hall outside of my room. I was with them and we were all busily admiring the baby of one of these girls. The girl is not one of my best friends and is not married. Her baby was darling, but it was only a few months old, but was the size of an infant of 2 or 3 years. I wanted to hold the baby, so she gave it to me, but held onto it since it was so heavy. The baby kissed my cheek and I turned to my bedroom door where a high school teacher, a man about 45, was standing. I went over to him and asked him if he wanted to hold the baby. He smiled and took the child."
"0245"	"I received a phone call from a boy in his twenties, whom I used to date. He asked me to go out Saturday, but I hesitated and reminded him that I was engaged. He said that didn't matter and that he just had to see me. We went out into his car from our dormitory. Then the setting faded and I was only aware of the two of us. He kissed me and begged me to break the engagement. I kept refusing, each time less sure of my reaction. I thought I was in love with him, but yet I wasn't certain enough to break the engagement. Finally we were in a crowd of strangers and the rest of the dream has evidently been repressed."
"0246"	"I dreamt I was making snowflake decorations for a party. Some boys were helping me, about my age, then they all left and I had to finish all the work myself. They (boys) went outside and played around in the snow, then started throwing snowballs at me. Then the dream shifted to another scene. I was going to visit my father who was put in prison, although he was innocent of the charge. I do not remember what the charge was, but I felt terrible about it and wanted to get him out. My older brother also came to see him, and told me he did not think there was a hope of setting Dad free."
"0247"	"I dreamt I was going along with a group of friends on a trip. The others were coming for me at a certain time and I had very little time to get ready. One of the girls that was going, my cousin who is 17, usually is dressed very neatly and looks very attractive, came before I was ready. This time she amazed me because she looked very sloppy and messy and I couldn't believe she would ever look like that. When the rest of the gang came, I still was looking for the dress I wished to wear, everyone was rushing around packing lunches, etc., and our house was in a turmoil."
"0248"	"I dreamed that I was walking about in a parking lot with another person, a man of about 40 years old, and it was our job to hurry around to get all the cars parked in certain places. I remember that I saw many of my parents' friends driving in, and I had a hard time finding room for them. I also saw several Walt Disney characters such as Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse and others. It was my job to chase around after them and tie a yellow ribbon on each one. I had a terrible time finding all the animals and was worried that I could not get all the ribbons on in time. I was still hunting for the animals and then I awoke."
"0249"	"I dreamed that I had 3 huge pimples over my right forehead. I was very anxious to get rid of them because they were painful and ugly. Meanwhile my mother was talking about the great need there was for teachers. She thought my sister would make a good one. Then it seemed as if I was taking part in a movie. Humphrey Bogart came in with 2 thugs. He came over to me, then grabbed me and poured some rubbing alcohol on obvious bumps on my head. I was angry and felt the pain, then the bumps slowly disappeared."
"0250"	"I dreamt I was going on a trip to Chicago along with my sister and girlfriend Marie. She was as usual very slow to get ready, then she could not find her purse. The train was right behind our house and we barely made it in time. Two friends from our dorm were there to see us off and I was quite excited. When we arrived we went to our hotel and found that our father had made a reservation for us. Our room was on the 9th floor and we were surprised to find our two young brothers asleep on cots there. We then went out to find a place for dinner and saw our other brother 13, standing in front of the hotel. We then had a talk with the room clerk who told us what to be in night, where to go, etc."
"0251"	"Male companion (22) and I were walking down dimly lit street in a poor section of town. Walked down a hill to a ramshackle old house which we entered. We sat down in the living room and he told me he was going to introduce me to a girl he used to go with. I did not resent this in the least and was quite anxious to meet the girl. I remember that he called her by a Japanese name Ishihara. He called her by name and to my great surprise a tall girl entered whom I recognized as a girl who at the present time lives in my dorm. I didn't let either of them think that I knew who the girl really was--felt shocked and hurt. Next day I saw the same girl at her home (in the living room) and asked her if she had previously gone with my boyfriend. She said oh yes, but didn't seem to know that I had seen her the night before when she had been presented to me under the Japanese name of Ishihara. All the time I was dreaming this, I was convinced that it was only a dream. "
"0252"	"I dreamed that I was a member of a gang which was being hunted down for some illegal activity that I can't remember. However, I felt all the while as if I were playing a game. I felt thrilled and excited. The other members of the gang were friends (male) whom I had gone to high school with. I remember one, in particular, who was leader of my gang. I had dated him in high school once in a while. The gang and myself were hiding behind some huge marble pillars high up on a mezzanine in a building somewhat like a bank. Police were below us and shooting at us. Several members of my gang had already been killed. The leader of the gang was below near the police. He and some remaining members were in a position to watch the shooting and seemed quite worried about me. I could hear the leader asking ""is xxx all right?"" They haven't shot her have they?"" I can only remember that I was hiding crouched behind a huge pillar feeling sure that the police couldn't shoot me. "
"0253"	"I remember that I had rushed home early one morning between classes to visit my parents. I felt rather guilty about never coming from school to see them. I stayed for two hours or so and then got ready to call a cab to go back to school. I had a 9:30 class which I had to attend. When I told my mother this, she seemed to think I was lying to her. She seemed to think that I could really stay all morning if I wanted to. Seemed very upset over the whole thing. I seemed only anxious about not getting to my class on time and regretted ever having come home at all."
"0254"	"Dreamed that a friend of mine (18, lives in dorm) was with me in a large cement girl's bathroom. It was dark and gloomy in there and I was quite upset because a large rat was running around the room. I was afraid he would crawl over my feet so I called to my friend across the room asking her if she wouldn't kill the rat by picking it up by its tail and slamming its head against the cement floor. I felt that she was very strong and fearless. She picked the rat up and did as I told her, however, she only crippled it. I felt so sorry for the poor thing writhing about then that I told her to slam the rat against the floor once more to put him out of his misery. When she did this the second time, the rat looked to me like a possum. With this I awoke. "
"0255"	"In this dream I was out of doors looking at a huge river and I was standing somewhere above the river and I could see a vast expanse of dry cracked mud between the fork of the river. I wanted to go swimming in one of the forks of the river, but couldn't decide in which one. The next thing I remember I was standing on the sand at the shore's edge. I ran, plunged into the river and swam out to a buoy. It seems I had picked the far fork or branch of the river in which to swim. I was with other people in the water, but am unable to remember anything about them (sex, age, etc.). "
"0256"	"I was at school getting ready to come home for vacation and my sister was helping me pack. She is 17 and lives at home in Michigan. I didn't know what to pack but I finally decided and laid out my things in my drawer, ready to put in my suitcase. My dresser was for some reason in my father's room. When I was ready to leave, I went into my father's room to pack my suitcase. He woke up and said that if I'd wait a few minutes he'd get up and take me. I was already home but my father said he would drive me home."
"0257"	"I was walking home down a country road at dusk when an unknown man began chasing me. I was terrified and ran furiously toward my home. I managed to get in the back door and lock it. I told my brother (12) to get my mother from the garden to help me. The man went around front and up on the porch. Just as he was opening the storm door, mother and my brother came up and shut him between the two doors. His head was smashed and the whole scene was very ghastly. We then called the police to carry away his dead body."
"0258"	"I was at school getting ready to go home for vacation. My sister, 17, who lives at home in Michigan was somehow at school in the dorm with me. We had our family car at school but we were going to take the bus to Detroit as I usually do when I go home and we were to drive from there. We raced around making plans, buying bus tickets and checking schedules. Then we went down to the bus station and checked our suitcases through. The only trouble was that we didn't know how to get the car from school to Detroit. All of a sudden I realized how silly we were and said we can drive all the way home. With relief we went down and claimed our baggage. "
"0259"	"I was with a group of kids from school including a girl and a boy who have just begun going together and his mother and younger brother. We were going on a trip in the car and the boy and girl were planning to elope and be married. We were going along with them. Next I was standing in a room which represented my bedroom at home and my sister opened a large box to show me an engagement and wedding ring which my fiance had bought for me. I examined the diamond and then began to lift the wedding ring from its place when the scene suddenly shifted. My sister and I were standing in a driveway next to the house where we used to live. There was a beautiful brand new green Lincoln sedan standing there and I got in it and drove away. "
"0260"	"My friend who is planning to start to college and I had decided to take some courses in high school during the summer. The high school classes were held in the auditorium of a grade school I attended in the seventh grade. The teachers who lectured to us were my grandfather and grandmother who have both been dead a number of years. It seemed very natural for them to be teaching the class. We sat there and took notes and then I talked for a long time to my grandmother. It did not seem that she was really my grandmother in the dream. "
"0261"	"I dreamed that I was in an antique store. It was similar to one that I am familiar with--dark and dusty as these places often are. The store was divided into two partitions--a front room and a back. I was in the other or front room and the proprietress of the shop was showing me various antique articles in which I had no particular interest. I know the proprietress quite well. She exists in real life--a middle aged woman who has gray hair and is somewhat deaf. In my dream either I specifically asked for or she volunteered the information that she had some very fine antique jewelry for which I really have a passion. Garnet jewelry is my special weakness. In my dream I asked eagerly to see it and she conducted me to the inner or back room. The only furnishing I recall was an antique desk with a great many pigeon holes and small drawers. She then left me alone and I heard her shut the door. I pulled open a little drawer and a vast quantity of jewelry--necklaces, bracelets, earrings and brooches--tumbled out. They were all of garnets set in antique gold and I coveted them more than anything else I ever saw. I fondled them greedily and I decided that, since I was alone in the room, I would take them. I was about to put them in my pocket when I experienced a definite feeling of wrong doing. I felt that the Virgin was looking down and disapproved. (I am no Catholic.) I put the jewelry back in the drawer and as I did so I noticed that the stones had undergone a radical change. The deep red of the garnets had become gray--colorless--lusterless. They were nothing but granite pebbles set in gold. Even before I woke up I felt that I had passed a sort of religious temptation test. "
"0262"	"I dreamed that I was standing on a hilltop. I knew immediately that it was Mexico. Seldom even in a movie have I seen such a beautiful scene. (This was a thoroughly enjoyable dream). It was early dawn. I saw the sun cast long golden ribbons over the softly rolling hills. I swear I felt a fresh breeze on my face. The hills were brown, freshly plowed with long furrows. I even noticed that many of their hills were contour plowed. In some of the fields, white skirted peasants in straw hats were sowing seed with a rhythmical precision. I stood on the hill and looked at everything with a peaceful pleasure. Suddenly I heard shrieks and shouts. I glanced down into a valley and saw many horsemen driving crowds of people before them. The horses reared and whinnied, the riders shouted and cracked whips. The people wept and screamed as they were driven down into a huge ditch. They were forcibly thrown down into it. Their baggage and possessions were flung all around them. I rushed forward and threw myself into the ditch with these expelled people. I learned that they were Spanish but I never found out why they were exiled. I was considerably surprised (even in my dream, which was quite credible) to hear myself announce in ringing tones ""I'm Spanish too."" I talked in a friendly manner to a little girl of about 8 years. Her name was INES. As my dream ended I was sitting in the dirt of the ditch, quite happily making paper dolls for INES, who crouched beside me. "
"0263"	"I dreamed that my sister, Martha, my mother and a friend of my sisters were in our kitchen at home. Mother seemed to be cooking on the stove. My sister, her friend and I lounged about talking. Suddenly the back door opened and my father lurched in drunk. I was faintly ashamed that Martha's friend should see him in such a condition. He seemed to have brought with him a florist's box which he laid on the kitchen table (it had a cover on it of red and white checks). It was for me and contained a beautiful orchid. A boy I date at school who lives out of town had sent it to me. Also in the box was a long rambling incoherent letter which seemed to be a declaration of love. I was overjoyed as it proved to me that even though we were separated, he had thought of me. "
"0264"	"I dreamed that I was sitting in the back room of Moe's, a well known college beer joint and one I know fairly well. The back room looked a little different. I can only explain that it seemed to be turned around. I knew however that it was Moe's. It was a very colorful scene, looking rather like a Hollywood version of a dive. There were bluish clouds of smoke, people were dressed in colorful clothes. The scarred tables and chairs were the same as they really are. I was happy because I was in a place I knew well and was fond of. I decided that I would have a beer and called to Al, the bartender, to bring me one. He refused to do so. I couldn't understand this but I didn't feel that I should make a fuss. I felt rather inferior because while I was sitting with people I knew who were very friendly to me, I lacked an escort. Here the dream ended. "
"0265"	"I dreamed that I was in a classroom about to take an examination. The test was handed out on white printed folded sheets. I unfolded mine and read the single question printed there. I read: trace the importance of erasers on the control of audio-sound frequencies. With a sinking feeling I realized that I knew absolutely nothing about the subject. I seized my pencil with determination and began to do what so many students try to do on exams--bull around, as it's known. I recall writing authoritatively (hoping I could fool the professor). ""It will readily be seen by any intelligent person that erasers are of the most extreme importance, etc."" I was quite worried that I would be seen through and receive a low grade."
"0266"	"I was driving when suddenly I had no brakes in the car. I was going downhill and had to stop at the bottom and I couldn't stop the car. There didn't seem to be any other traffic for me to run into; however, I had to stop for a light at the bottom of the hill. I woke up before anything happened. "
"0267"	"The dream took place in a hotel where I was staying. There was a lot of confusion and noise. Everyone around seemed to be happy and festive. There were a lot of young people there. I was discussing things of interest with them. Then I was in another room. And in this room, in the bathroom, next to the bathtub, was a huge chair set up high. The chair itself was yellow leather and it was braced with large pieces of wood and made to look like a throne. The bottom of it was decorated in white tile, as was the bathroom. Then I noticed that draped here and there were rhinestone bracelets and necklaces; and gold belts with pseudo-jewels in them. Later I learned that this throne was used as a prop for the stage play of Macbeth. The person to whom it belonged was a young man about 27 years of age. He had dark hair. Someone was asking him how he got so many people to give up their rhinestone necklaces, bracelets and gold belts permanently for the construction of this throne. This man kept saying that the people didn't mind at all. This seemed to cause an argument between the two. Then I woke up. "
"0268"	"I dreamed that I received a new General Electric alarm clock that a radio can be attached to. This clock had all sorts of dials on it and could do many things besides turning the radio on in the morning. I don't know what the other things were, but I just knew it was very complicated. Some of the dials and numbers were in red. "
"0269"	"I was in a strange house in the town we lived in about 10 years ago. I was about the same age as I am now but it seemed that the time was about 8 years ago. My mother had decided to walk to the corner with the lady of this house who was about the same age as my mother. I said that I would take care of the children (who belonged to this lady) while they were gone. I watched them leave and a few minutes later there was a knock on the door. I thought as I answered it that I should look to see who it was before opening it. But I opened the door and there stood a big man. He was about 60 years of age and was unshaven with gray hair cut in a butch. He looked at me and smiled in a sort of fiendish way. Then he stroked the side of my face and said something I don't remember except that he called me dolly. It made me very angry and I could feel my heart pounding. Then he started to lunge at me and I ran. Pretty soon I found myself going down some back stairs outside the house and the man was gone. I felt weak from fright. "
"0270"	"I was in the dormitory I lived in as a freshman in college. I was with two young men whom I knew. We were playing cards when we heard a lot of commotion in the halls. Then we heard police sirens in the distance. For no apparent reason we ran to escape the police. As we were making our way to the back fire escape, we heard someone say that there were three dead people in the ironing room. We stayed on the fire escape until the police left and then went in to look at these dead people. What I saw was not well defined. It just looked like a bunch of old dirty rags scattered about in heaps in the room. I was fully expecting to be horrified and felt much relieved when I could see nothing that resembled dead people. These young men were about the same age as I. "
"0271"	"I dreamt that I was sitting in front of someone's home somewhere making mad love to my husband. My best friend and her husband were there also, and when all sorts of other people left us, we continued on our happy way. Then suddenly I had nothing but a coat on, and the crowds came back. I must grudgingly admit that I was slightly embarrassed but my husband came to the scene (I don't know where we were at this point) and I forgot all emotions except how happy I was that he was with me. "
"0272"	"I dreamt that a close girl friend of mine who has been married for over a year was engaged to another friend of mine who is unmarried, but probably has never said 10 words to this girl in his life. The girl's parents (from whose apron strings she has not as yet untied herself) gave her a huge party when the engagement was announced. Everyone was very happy and she was to start attaining her divorce the day after this party. Her husband came to the party but left very early (as he always does). I told her how happy Bob and I were for her (Bob is my husband), but I said that after all, passing value judgements upon her life was not my affair. At this odd point I awakened. "
"0273"	"My husband and I suddenly were in New York at the school which I had attended 3 years ago. All of my professors were present, one of whom I had been very close to, as she was a philosophy instructor and I had spent considerable time with her. We had a long discussion in regard to pragmatism and my husband's view s about abstract philosophic approaches. She was extremely impressed by his keenness. (She is a woman of 45 or so.) Suddenly I was in the bath tub with my husband (that's tough to figure out) and a few of my friends came in to meet him. "
"0274"	"I was in an airplane which was trying to land on top of a car. All passengers were panic-stricken and speaking of death and what they had or had not accomplished in their lives. All accepted the inevitability of death. One man died of a heart attack and the woman next to him collapsed. I said that everyone should parachute out and, as I was falling, I awoke. "
"0275"	"I dreamt that I was walking up a street and I met a friend of mine who was in her wedding dress. She was to be married that afternoon and she told me to come to the vacant lot where her friends were, as they wanted to see me. I said no, as I had not been asked to the wedding and felt self-conscious about being around there. However, next thing I knew I was there on some unknown porch, visiting with some old school-friends of mine. The girl whom I most wanted to see was not there, however. As the bride left for the church, she told me to come to the wedding, so I went home to get my husband, who said we shouldn't go. I woke up."
"0276"	"I was in an office building and, as I walked down the hall, I looked into an office and saw one of my girlfriends whom I went to high school with. She had recently become engaged and was wearing 3 diamond rings. Two of them were in an old-fashioned setting with two stones side by side and the whole shape of the ring was rectangular. The engagement ring which she had just received was in a modern setting and had one large round diamond. As I looked at it, I noticed that there were little curls of something resembling wood shavings and these curls covered up the whole ring. I proceeded to remove these curls, and was surprised that the girl hadn't done so herself. "
"0277"	"I was in a living room which was decorated in a very old-fashioned style. With me was one of my friends, a boy who is 21 years old and a senior at Reserve. We are very close friends, even though I am engaged. We were waiting for something and then an older woman came out. She was a secretary and told us that the judge would be with us very shortly. The judge came out and he was very jolly looking, had white hair and whiskers, a very large round belly, a veritable Santa Clause. He was clad in a wine colored satin dressing gown. He then proceeded to bawl out both me and my companion, although I do not know about what. Then his secretary came in and told the judge that his bath water was ready for him. "
"0278"	"My boss, Yale, about 30, was clad in his undershorts. He was cutting Jean's hair. Jean is the other girl who works in my office. She is engaged and very, very righteous and completely lacks a sense of humor. I spilled a bottle of Ruth's cologne. Ruth is Yales's wife, and the cologne was slowly dripping down the sides of the dresser on to the floor. I was not afraid that Ruth would be angry at me, but I was very frightened that Yale would be angry with me for my carelessness. Their little girl, Dibby, was there but she was playing on the floor and didn't figure into the dream. "
"0279"	"I was in an operating room with a nurse and two other girls. One I did not know and the other, named Shirley, I know slightly and have not seen in three years. I had cancer and the nurse was cutting me open in exactly the same way I had dissected my frog in biology laboratory last year. All of the organs she took out of my body exactly resembled my frog's organs, only mine were bright red and much larger. I especially remember the nurse taking out my liver and heart. I was fully awake but felt no pain. Shirley kept running in and out of the room with the unidentified girl, but I do not know where they were going. "
"0280"	"I was walking up Bascom Hill (University of Wisconsin campus) with my mother and met my friend Ann. Mother was going to a luncheon and walked on over the hill. Ann was directly in front of Bascom Hall (top of the hill), was carrying books and had on an outfit which she wore to class and which I always disliked. I was very anxious to impress upon her that my mother was going to a luncheon. Ann had a class halfway down the hill and I walked down with her. We stopped in front of the building which looked exactly as I consciously remember it. "
"0281"	"This dream took place in a church. I had a very beautiful singing voice and was standing by the altar singing Ave Maria. While I was in the middle of my song some businessmen offered me opera and Hollywood contracts. At that time I was angry to think they would go so far as to interrupt a church service for their own affairs rather than at least wait until it was over. I refused their offer, feeling that if God gave me a beautiful voice, I could well use it by honoring him. Alongside me was a priest and in front of me were people praying. "
"0282"	"I dreamt I saw an Indian dance similar to the one depicted in Annie Get Your Gun. The dream was just a few seconds long. The dance was done in beautiful rhythm, the costumes were of all bright colors. The Indians in my dream were not dancing a war dance, but rather one of being happy and joyous. I was watching the dancing and clapping out the rhythm. Men were the only ones dancing, although occasionally women would join in if they liked. Men, women, and children were gathered around in a circle looking on. "
"0283"	"This dream was about a new dress that I bought. I went downtown shopping in Halle's, I believe, and a very sweet elderly lady helped me select a dress that I would like. The lady was short, wore a black dress, had gray hair, and was very pleasing and sweet to talk to. The dress we picked was a high neck, short sleeved affair with a tight fitting waist and full skirt. Needless to say, I was very happy and thrilled at finding just what I wanted. "
"0284"	"This dream was very confused. It seems I was trying to trick some men (or boy) into admitting whether or not he was a communist. After trying to catch him on several questions, I finally fooled him and he confessed he was a member of the communist party. Here I was a little frightened. Who the man or boy was, what was the setting, or what was the person to me, I do not know. "
"0285"	"The dream takes place in a large, new house. A girl is running barefooted over thick white carpeting. There seems to be the color green running around her. In the distance stands a smiling woman, the mother of this girl. Near the mother is the father, happy but not smiling. The girl herself is joyous, skipping around and jumping."
"0286"	"I was in the kitchen of a strange house when I heard a woman (about 50) call me to come out to the backyard. I did so and found her to be my boss of last summer. She indicated a man (about 60) who was standing nearby. She said he wanted to borrow my bicycle. I went near where he stood in order to talk to him and started to tell him he, of course, could borrow it. I kept talking and then proceeded to give him reasons why he could not borrow it. I became somewhat angry. It was about dusk. I turned to go in and he followed me. I tried not to show my fear and felt he was going to shoot me, although I had the idea that he followed me inside with evil intentions. I sidled around the doorway into the kitchen and awakened. "
"0287"	"One of my best friends (f, 20) and I were in a classroom. The teacher was one (f, 50) we both had had in junior high school. We both disliked her. She taught sewing there. In the dream she was teaching typing. It was the first day of the semester. My friend had taken the second semester of the course the previous year, while I was new to the subject, not having taken any before. Therefore, my friend had the advantage of knowing the teacher's procedures etc. We were instructed to write a heading on the paper. I made a mistake and the teacher ridiculed me. On the board was a sample of the heading we were supposed to put on our paper. It was written partly in the handwriting of a grade school child and partly in an adult's handwriting. She instructed us to do more things (forgotten now--never remembered clearly) and I did not do them correctly. "
"0288"	"I, as my maiden aunt (51), was standing in the front yard of my home in the country. I was not myself, but my aunt. A car drove by in which were my sister (my mother, my aunt's sister) and her husband. I did not determine whether her son and daughter (I) were in the car. I felt very sad that I had no husband while she did. I envied her. Immediately, I changed back to myself (f, 20), although the setting remained the same. I got in my car and followed that of my parents. There were several cars between us. My parents and the cars following approached a curve on an upgrade. The right side had no protection from a considerable drop-off except the guard rail. My parents' car was first in line. Upon executing the curve they came upon a piece of heavy road construction machinery traveling slowly ahead of them. They could not have seen it until rounding the curve. I saw them swerve to avoid it and, in doing so, they went through the guard rail and over the bank. The line of cars halted. I rushed from my car, over the bank to them. My father (wearing a blue shirt) was slumped over a piece of the car, his back toward me and motionless. Farther on, my mother, wearing a red and white figured dress, was brushing off herself. My young brother (11) sat farther on and wore a bright red shirt. I awoke. "
"0289"	"I entered the home of the woman who was my boss last summer. This house looked nothing like her house actually looks. I was eating hard candy when I went in and asked her for a wastebasket to put it in. She showed me a sunken wastebasket in the floor. We went to another room where I was in bed and she sat on the edge and we discussed the hours I would work. It was apparently this coming summer and I had taken the job again for the summer. A Chinese child (f, 3) was lying on a ledge to my left. She said she was cold so I told her to go in my bed, which she did. There was another smaller baby sitting at the foot of the bed (m, 1) dressed in blue pajamas. "
"0290"	"I was swimming. I was underwater and looked up to find the water level to be several--maybe 10--feet above the level of my head. I went to the surface. There women were swimming around holding babies. I got out to the side of the pool. There I saw women preparing the babies to go underwater by holding their noses (the babys'). One woman hit her charge on the chest and then held its nose. They then dove in. Later, I was leaving the building with a friend (f). She was telling me that she had no more money because, to quote: ""I just bought ________ (her roommate, f) a tricycle--I mean bicycle"". "
"0291"	"It was a very dark night and it was very late. Some friends had walked me home. They tried to persuade me to go with them to get some food, but I knew it was very late and I had to go inside. These friends were angry because I would not go with them and they quickly left. As I was about to enter the door a little squirrel ran up to me and I was frightened. I thought the squirrel was going to bite me. I ran inside. I wanted to find my parents so they could protect me. I started to run up some steps. I ran and ran. The house old and unfamiliar. The stair-steps were steep and I thought I'd never reach the top. When I did, I found my mother. She had been asleep. She was in a night gown. Her hair was disheveled and her eyes looked wild. I could tell she was angry. She told me to climb onto a high table or dresser. She went to get something and I knew she was going to get a knife so that she could cut me up. I started to run down the stairs. "
"0292"	"I dreamed I was on a streetcar on Euclid Ave. The car was going towards the city. A boy I know got on the car with a dog. I knew he shouldn't have, but he said it would be all right. The conductor opened the doors at a stop and the dog jumped off and ran down the street. I was worried about the dog and this boy and I got off of the streetcar. We found the dog on the sidewalk outside of a store. I knew the dog was sick and dying. He appeared to be flat against the sidewalk. He was trying to move but he couldn't. I told the boy to get the dog to a doctor but he thought the dog was all right. "
"0293"	"I was with a boy about my age and an old woman. We were in a flat field. A storm was coming up and I noticed that the clouds were beginning to swirl and twist. I thought the wind and clouds indicated a tornado was coming upon us. I knew we had to hurry to shelter. I asked the boy to help me get the woman to a shelter. We tried to help her but she could not move and we couldn't carry her. I knew we would have to go far to find a shelter and I didn't think we could reach a shelter before the storm hit, but I wasn't frightened. There was more, but I can't remember what it was. "
"0294"	"I was with my sister at the hospital where she took her training. She was on duty and I was going to help her. We were alone in the room with the patient. She was a very tiny old lady. She in a high-sided bed. She was unconscious. I asked my sister what we could do for the woman. She said there was nothing to be done because the woman was just waiting to die. The patient's left arm was paralyzed and had turned green. Her face was drawn and wrinkled. I felt repulsed and frightened. "
"0295"	"I was watching the performance of a symphony. I was sitting next to my mother. The stage was brightly lit and the musicians were sitting in one corner. They were dressed in brightly colored costumes. The background was yellow. The conductor appeared in a very unusual pink costume, like that of a ballet dancer. The performance was also unusual, for instead of directing the orchestra in a conventional manner, the conductor danced and in this manner conducted the musicians. I thought the performance was beautiful and I said I thought the conductor was very clever and talented. I felt enthusiastic and happy. My mother said in a very disgusted tone, ""He's a nigger. do you mean you approve of him?"" I was angry and hurt. I hit my mother on her knee in a restrained way and I said, ""Oh mother, you always spoil things."""
"0296"	"I dreamed the atom bomb had hit parts of Ohio and as I walked along the street, I could see the smoke from where the bomb had landed. (This occurred on Monday.) I knew that three days later the bomb would hit Cleveland and I wanted to get home as fast as I could. I was with my 11-year-old sister and together we got on a bus. No one had to pay bus fare because the bomb was coming. I noticed we were on the wrong bus and it took us way out to University Heights. My sister and I got off the bus and ran into a stranger's house to call home. My grandmother answered the phone (here I was conscious of the fact that I was dreaming) and I told her I would be right home. Suddenly I found myself at home. I began to cry and had a horrible fear of dying and of the atom bomb. "
"0297"	"I dreamed that I was part of a cast of dancers and singers in a show starring Tony Martin and wife, Cyd Charisse. After one performance some men and I went to Higbee's for dinner, only the restaurant wasn't really that of Higbee's. One of the men (who was my baby doctor) told me to get a job selling at Higbees, but I was very indignant when I told him I was a college graduate and wouldn't sell at Higbees. Then we returned to the scene of the show and bunch of girls and I were in a bedroom or dressing room. Tony Martin and his wife came in and Mrs. Martin had dull red hair and red lipstick on. Mr. Martin's hair was coal-black and I told him her really shouldn't bleach his hair black because men with gray hair, especially those gray at the temples, were very distinguished looking. "
"0298"	"I dreamed that my 2 girl cousins, ages 11 and 15, who live in L.A.; my sisters, ages 11 and 17; and I, were standing in an apartment building somewhere in Cleveland ringing my grandparents' door bell. (My grandfather passed away a year ago, and my grandmother lives in Los Angeles.) My grandparents were supposed to take us on a picnic but no one answered the bell. So my cousins, my sisters, and I got on a streetcar and on the streetcar we met our grandparents. My grandfather told us that they had had to leave Cleveland suddenly to go to Los Angeles because my grandmother's sister had died. I remember him saying ""Can you imagine that?"" and I felt surprised that he had said that because I knew that my grandparents and my grandmother's sister had never gotten along. Then my grandparents began to playfully argue and everyone on the streetcar laughed. I woke up and, when I did, I felt happy and satisfied because I had seen my grandfather so clearly. "
"0299"	"First I found myself sitting inside a movie theater dressed in a formal gown and my date (whose name I cannot recall) was sitting next to me. Then I found myself on Cedar and Lee Rd. walking with a person, but this person kept changing; first it was one of my girlfriends and then it ended up to be my sister who is 17 years old. Then 2 men began following us (one man I have never seen before; the other one lives in my neighborhood and acts strangely.) I felt horrified that the men would catch us, but the bus stopped for us and we got on safely. "
"0300"	"I dreamed I was walking down the street with a man who was a composite of 2 boys I know. I was very conscious of his dark brown eyes, his dark thick eyebrows, and his dark brown hair. He was of medium height and rather stocky, and between 28 and 30 years of age. I remember feeling extremely happy and very lighthearted. Then my grandmother (who is living in Los Angeles) walked by and I introduced her to the man whom I was with. Then my grandmother walked away after taking a gook look at the man and I awoke."
"0301"	"It seems I went to a certain party where there were many people. It must have been a hotel. I can only remember one young man there that I recognized and talked to. He is about 28 and an acquaintance of mine. I cannot remember the other young women at the party, but there were quite a few of them, some of whom I seemed to know. There were many small tables and so we must have eaten or drunk something. After a while I seemed to feel very warm and retired to the ladies' room where I rested up for quite a while. After that, it seems I was visiting a girlfriend's apartment with another girl. The apartment was in the Mayflower Village. I have never seen the apartment before but she showed us the living room, which was a light green. While we were there she talked to her mother on the telephone. "
"0302"	"It seems I had a big party at my house. Perhaps it was not so much of a party as a gathering. This gathering consisted mostly of my relatives. I recognized a few of my aunts, cousins, (male and female) and my grandmother. I don't remember serving them anything but drinks and I found myself in the kitchen getting ice cubes. Many of the people came to watch me do this. We sat down at the table for a meal and as I sat down I realized that I was at the table at the downstairs cafeteria at Haydn and I saw one particular girl that I used to eat lunch with when I was a freshman. She is no longer in school and have only seen her a few times since. "
"0303"	"It seems I was in some small office. I know I was working there but I don't know exactly what were my duties. I know that there were several other people in the office. After a while we all got tired of working and the boss decided we go out for some coffee. There were enough men in the office for the girls and all of the girls went out of the office with a boy. I know that this place was either in France or in an export house in the U.S. where they spoke French because I was aware that they were speaking French. The other people in the office were the same age as I. "
"0304"	"It seems I had seen advertised in the paper some radios advertised for 16.95. I called up one of the department stores and inquired if they had the radios advertised. The clerk said no, but gave me a whole list of other radios he had. After I had hung up, I realized that I had known the voice on the telephone; it was some boy about 22 that I work with on Saturdays and I had not told him who I was. In the next part of the dream I went up to the ladies' rest room where I work on Saturdays. There were many present but I cannot remember what happened. "
"0306"	"Bill and I were sitting at the counter in Wade's drug store when suddenly in came this blonde whore in a red satin tight-fitting dress and started flirting with Bill (then my steady boyfriend). As she walked in, the room changed into a bar all lit up with cheap neon lights and lots of noise and smoke. Then she went over and stood by the stairs leading to the hotel rooms and he looked over at her and asked me to excuse him for a few minutes and walked over toward her. "
"0307"	"I was carrying suitcases up the steps at a huge gray stone building and Julia, a girlfriend from home who also goes to Mather, came running down the steps to meet me and said she was really glad to have come and she wanted to introduce me to all her friends. We walked down all sorts of corridors and up an elevator (the supposed dorm reminded me of a hospital. Everything was all white and shiny with silver gleaming doors.) We finally got to my room which was filled with laughing pajama'd girls; when we walked in they said Bill had called and would call back. I remember thinking how lucky I was to have a second chance to live the past several months. "
"0308"	"The scene was by a canal with the sun shining and with green grass and flowers growing. Lots of little girls were playing all different games. Everyone was happy and smiling. Then we began playing red rover. Most of the girls I didn't know--those I did were mere acquaintances of mine at Ohio Wesleyan. They didn't call me for a long time then several times in a row. Then I got tired of all the kids and went home. Our front door was freshly painted white with gold numbers beginning with '1' and I thought to myself that a home shouldn't begin with a number '1'. While I was watching the '1' became an 'f'. Then I walked out in back behind the house. Daddy and mother were sitting in a rowboat fishing and mother was dangling her feet in the water. Mother was wearing blue jeans. "
"0309"	"I was at typing class which was being held outside our high school building. There were lighted Xmas trees in a semi-circle around us (supposedly to keep out the wind). The teacher was unknown and definitely unfamiliar to me. She gave us a long lecture on how to type and I was very cold and not paying attention. Then she gave us a speed drill and I got all confused and behind and forgot the margins on the side of my paper. I asked a middle-aged woman sitting beside me what the place was. At the bottom of my page I wrote down I never had typing before, thinking I would bet a better grade by doing so. When she passed the papers back, I got a C. I felt conscience-stricken and told her I had lied and amazingly, she changed the grade to an A-. Then Mac, a boy I'm dating now, came in and took my hand trying to get me to cheer up. I began typing again and was doing much better and feeling very happy. Mac was still holding my hand, however. "
"0310"	"I was a ballerina; wearing a frilly pink dancing dress. I was dancing in, supposedly, Reserve's new student union. There were lots of kids standing around the grill and at the booths. None I recognized however. At the top of a double stairs stood Bill, an old boyfriend wearing a black overcoat, which had the collar pulled up around the neck. I was trying to impress him with my dancing. Everyone else smiled and commented how nice I looked and how well I was doing, while Bill merely glared down at me. Then I whirled around the other direction and two men were sitting on a marble bench and doors shut behind me to separate me from my friends in the other room. I danced before these two, didn't recognize either one, then one of them came over, grabbed my arm and said, marry me, and suddenly his face cleared up and he was a fraternity brother of Mac's whose name I don't even know. I felt very badly because I knew the man was married. "
"0311"	"With some friends, we decide to take a boat trip on a river. We spend the night at the house of two girls, reading wonderful children's books instead of sleeping. The next morning everything is happening many centuries ago and seems as unreal and beautiful as in the books. We are in the 15th century. Our clothes and the boat are those of the century and the river is in the middle of a town which looks like Venice. Then we want to stop and land for a few minutes (to buy books), but when we want to go back to our boat, we cannot, and find that we are surrounded by golden chairs. The building we are in looks like a bank and is made out of yellow and brown marble. But along the building, instead of a street, is the river. Some of our group stayed in the boat, and we are worried about this. "
"0312"	"I am walking in a street I Paris. It is about 6 o'clock. Nobody is out. Everything looks quaint and deserted. All the stores are closed and the blinds are down. I really feel all alone in the sleeping town, although it is too early for the people to be asleep. And then a car arrives and stops and my parents and my brother (he is 4 years older than me) are in it. They ask me why I am walking by myself and scold me a little bit. I go in the car with them and we ride through the deserted streets until we arrive home. But I don't recognize it at all. It seems to be somebody else's place. I am very much upset because the others seem to feel at home there, and not notice the difference. They act very natural, don't feel lost in this unknown house. I can just stand next to an unfamiliar table with a lamp on it and watch them, coming and going, and talking, feeling a stranger. "
"0313"	"In a big theatre. I am watching an amateur show, supposed to be a college student night, but it turns finally into an ugly bright-colored cartoon. All of a sudden I remember I promised my aunt with whom I live here, to wait for her in front of the theatre. In haste, I rise and leave, disturbing people who mumble at me and run down the stairs, find her waiting outside. Together we enter the theatre again, sit down and watch the program. Soon it becomes boring and all the young people leave the theatre and walk by groups in a nearby park and boys and girls are wearing the costumes the actors had on for the stunt, initially. After a while everybody goes back to the theatre where a very lively ballet is given on the stage. Some people among the spectators say we missed a very good part of the program. Then we are discussing the program in the lobby and soon we are no more in the lobby but back in the park. It is summer in the park with leaves on the trees and it is warm. Outside on the street it is cold, and still winter. "
"0314"	"I am walking along a river which is more likely to be a canal, with trees on both sides and high grass, fresh and green, full of pink and red flowers. Everything is calm and so peaceful that one does feel like laying down and daydreaming. But I go on with the idea that I have to take a steamer which must be anchored here, some place, and that I cannot find. I am looking for it, but I am not too eager to find it; everything around me is so nice and appealing and makes me feel like staying. I have the impression of being really alone, but I am not concerned about it. On the contrary, I feel very much relieved to have nobody to push me around. Just something very softly in me makes me walk toward that boat which is going to take me home. "
"0315"	"I was playing with my brother and he was running after me, teasing me. I tried to escape him and fell down on the stairs--oddly made out of green jello which started to shake. After that, I found myself back in my country in the apartment of a young married couple, friends of ours, and saw their newborn baby. I wanted to call my mother to tell her that I was back, but I spent a whole hour and could not correctly dial our number. I knew it but always something prevented me from dialing it right, and I was extremely upset. Finally my mother called our friends, and I answered the phone and felt a great relief, but I did not know how to get home and was mixed up in the buses and subways. "
"0316"	"This dream was completely confusing and uncorrelated. Only a few of the details stand out in my mind, while the others remain obscure. I recall being in Saks 34 St., a department store in N.Y.C., with a few friends of mind. We were all trying on dresses when suddenly we heard an explosion coming from the distance. At this point my dream began to wander between two definite themes--one having to do with something concerning the United Nations building and another having to do with a boat smuggling dope in N.Y. harbor. I don't recall any of the details, except that it was a Coast Guard boat firing on the boat with the dope, which seemed to cause the explosion, but where the various details met I cannot seem to remember. "
"0317"	"The only part of the dream which I can remember clearly is where my boyfriend TG and my uncle HT and myself were caught in a flood. I recall the water kept rising higher and higher about us. Finally, we were able to reach a higher piece of land and sought shelter there, but still the water swirled about us. At last the water subsided and we remained in our fixed position, waiting for help to arrive. I recall that there was a great deal of yelling and arguing, because my uncle was very hungry. However, we had no food so there was nothing for him to do but wait. When the rescue party finally reached us, my uncle began arguing with them and wanted to know why they had waited so long to rescue him. The rescue party threatened to leave him if he didn't behave so he kept quiet. "
"0318"	"In this dream I remember playing a part in a play. I had done a very good job and many people had told me that I had talent. I was quite enthused and decided to make a career of the stage. I started taking dramatic lessons, but told no one about it. Finally, one day I was given the opportunity to play a small part in a play in Broadway. I was very pleased and excited and quite proud, and I decided to tell my boyfriend , TG, about it. He was very happy for me and encouraged me a great deal. However, when we told his parents, they became infuriated and told me that if I went on the stage I could not marry their son Ted. The last thing I remember is Ted talking to his parents about it and trying to reason with them. Before anything definite had been decided, the telephone rang and woke me up. "
"0319"	"This dream was quite confused and uncorrelated. I remember, in one part, doing a dance in a pair of black velvet leotards (shoes). I don't know where I was dancing or why. Then I recall talking to a boy, BF, age 20, with whom I went to high school. I never really knew him--only enough perhaps to say hello, but in the dream, we were having a long serious conversation. He asked me to go out with him and I remember not knowing what to do, whether to go with him or not. Two of my girlfriends from high school, EL and DG, advised me not to go with him. I thought the only reason Ellen had said not to was because she cared for him a great deal and was hoping that he would ask her out. "
"0320"	"I dreamt that I had become pregnant, although I wasn't married. Obviously I had had sexual intercourse (with my boyfriend, TG) although I can't recall experiencing the act in my dream. By the time I realized I was pregnant I was in my second month. I was not in the least bit worried or frightened but even happy, and I told my parents (mother, 45; father, 49) about it. They weren't at all concerned or ashamed of the fact and told me to ask TG to marry me. When I told him he said he couldn't until he finished scratching his uncle IG's back. There was no reason why he should have been scratching it, but he was. I became very angry and spoke to his parents (mother, 52; father 55). His mother told me how unjust that was and said she would speak to him. I also told his father and he became so angry at TG that he began to beat him up. At that point my dream ended, and I was in the stage between being awake and asleep; but I was acutely aware of the fact that I was very married and when I finally awoke completely I was in a cold sweat. "
"0321"	"Dreamt about a boy I knew in high school (saw him briefly for about 5 minutes last night-driving past the house and hit our dog). We were out on a date--was wearing jeans and a shirt--discussed where we could go in jeans. He suggested place to eat. Picked up a number of other people all of whom were very strange--didn't know them. Greater part of them were children. We stopped and I had to get out of the car for while--was afraid of seeing someone that knew me, for it was a Friday night and inasmuch as my father is orthodox in his religion, I was not supposed to be riding. Had argument with someone about discrimination and the segregation of the Negro and the Jews. Something came in about stunt night. Seems the boy I asked told me he was able to go. Rest of the dream vague and all mixed up. "
"0322"	"I had gone down to the Schofield Bldg. Used to work there. Had stopped in to see my old boss and found out that the girl who had taken my place had left. They wanted me to come back to work and I couldn't give them any definite answer inasmuch as I was, or am, presently working. The bookkeeper was there, though she had changed quite a bit. She had now become quite gray, was wearing black and looked very old. I felt a little guilty for not going to work there. While I was there I noticed a number of applicants, all of whom were elderly women and all of whom were wearing black. I left there and went to my job. When I got there I found Bess, the bookkeeper from my former job, now working on my books. She told me she had quit and was now working for my boss. I then thought that this was a good idea as Bess was an accountant and, with her ability, deserved a better job than the one she had. "
"0323"	"It was just before a stunt night rehearsal. I had to find a gym outfit to wear and went to the gym department. At the desk I noticed racks of costumes which the seniors wore two years ago. They were striped black and yellow with purses to match. Also on the shelf were a number of glasses--cocktail or champagne glasses. Finally the teacher came to the desk. It was one of the Mather instructors but, looking around, I realized it was the gym department of the high school I attended in New York. I then went into my gym class and participated in the activities. From there, went down to the locker room and still being confused as to whether I was in Cleveland or New York, I couldn't find my locker. I seemed to have been in a very big hurry. It seems I had to get to another class. A friend of mine helped me find my locker. I also remember something about a rattlesnake which was given to me as a gift. "
"0324"	"I was going shopping with a girlfriend for a present for a boy I date. We were in a store which itself was a cross between a department store and a dime store. We looked at a couple of ties first. One was a narrow gray tie, the others were white with a design in a slightly darker shade. I didn't like any of the ties and we then looked at sweaters. The one sweater which I did consider was a brown plaid sweater. While deciding, we also picked out a roll of gray wrapping paper with blue ribbon. I couldn't decide whether or not to take the sweater because it had to go with a cocoa brown suit which I knew the boy had. The salesgirl came over and cut off a piece of ribbon so that I could find another piece of ribbon that length which would match the color of the suit. We decided not to take the sweater as it was wool and too heavy and left, taking with us the wrapping paper and the ribbon. We sort of sneaked out as we were afraid the salesgirl might see us. We then decided to buy a nylon sweater instead, a sleeveless sweater. "
"0325"	"Chuck and I had been out on a date (Chuck, the boy I used to go steady with, 23). We were coming home and it was quite late. For some reason we have to stop at his house. I believe we were deciding where to go to eat and decided to go to his house instead of a restaurant. I was hesitant about going in but nevertheless did go in. He woke his parents up as I feared we would do. First his father came out; him I remember seeing very distinctly. There was some conversation between us, all of it very vague. Then his mother came out. Both parents were somewhat cold and indifferent to me. Then two girls, supposedly his sisters, came out. He doesn't have any sisters. The two girls were girlfriends of mine, two sisters. We then left and Chuck took me home. "
"0326"	"I was in a mammoth, luxurious house. I was talking to a woman named Juliana, but she ran away after something had disturbed her. I think it was the doorbell ringing. I went upstairs to look for her with a tall, husky boy. We started opening strange doors, and I was so frightened that when I said something about it, he picked me up. Finally we opened the door to a huge bedroom with doors leading into every part of the house and out onto a beautiful terrace. All of a sudden Juliana tried to dash through the bedroom from one door to another, but we caught her before she could get away. Next, there was a very distinguished woman guest in the house. I tried to anticipate her needs, but she told me to get her linens. As I was looking for them in a hall filled with drawers and shelves, I came across numerous used and new toothbrushes. On one of the top shelves I saw a box-file with the numbers 60 and 604 directly below each other. Opposite the 604 were the words Sandra Gordon, very severe case. (I seemed to associate this with an admonishment I had received at my job a few days before.) I was rather surprised to see this, but I went on looking for towels. Finally I went into the big bathroom where this distinguished lady was bathing, and asked Juliana where the linens were. Then I woke up. "
"0327"	"I was ushering someplace with a girl from the dorm. I thought it was at Severance, only I was in Buffalo. I wanted to go to some hangout where all the kids were, but somehow I thought my mother wouldn't like it. I felt sort of sneaky doing it, and I was relieved when I succeeded in getting away with it. At some related time I excused myself from going somewhere with my mother. I gave such an excuse that she allowed me to leave. But I wanted to go to this place again. I got home sooner than I should have, considering where I told my mother I was going. So I pretended I had been sleeping at home all the while. I didn't think she'd fall for it. "
"0328"	"There was a bunch of little children rolling logs down a hillside. Below the hill was a lake. The kids seemed to be having fun doing this. There was something about a little boy drowning, though I wasn't very upset about it. Then another little fellow was hit on the head, and while he was dying in my arms, I called my paper in New York and dictated a human interest story. For a while at this point I seemed to think I was a man. I held the child and tried to quiet him, but he died while I was holding him. I was grief stricken. The boy supposedly died from a blow on the head by a log, but while I was reporting the incident, I had the idea that he had cancer. "
"0330"	"A young couple, friends of mine, were getting married. (I recognize neither of them.) After the wedding, they were fooling around downstairs, with a whole gang of kids surrounding them. Some girl piped up with a cute crack and the groom said: see, I told you what a doll she is (referring to the bride). Later on, they went to bed in my brother's bedroom. Mother suggested various things she ought to do for them. I said she should just leave them alone. She said she had taken care of many couples in that room, and she knew what was best. I still insisted she should just let them alone. "
"0331"	"I was lying half in my bed which is beside a window and half out on a ledge which seemed to be attached to the window sill. N, a friend my own age, came into the room and stood beside the bed. A black cat appeared on the ledge and I screamed at N to take the cat away, as I dislike them intensely. She picked the cat up and was holding it. I said to be sure not to let it loose in my room. She smiled and dropped the cat, which ran out of the room. A spotted cat appeared on the floor and I screamed again. The cat jumped onto the ledge which was 3 stories up from the ground. I wanted to push the cat off but was afraid to touch it. N. just stood there and watched me. The black cat came back into the room, jumped from the bed to the ledge and touched my leg. By this time I seemed to be having a mild case of hysteria. "
"0332"	"I dreamed that it was stunt night. The time was just before the judging of the stunts. I had come into the lobby where there were many people milling around and looked for my date. Someone told me he was in the balcony (my date is an old acquaintance from Lake Erie College where he dated a friend of mine.) N., a college friend, hurried up to me and said P. had come to the show with some other girls from LEC (P. was the girl my date had gone steadily with at LEC). The fact that she had come did not bother me but I did not want her to see me when I got dressed into my street clothes. It seemed that I had a fur coat similar to hers and was afraid that she would accuse me of having stolen it. The strange thing was that I did not know for sure if I had stolen it or not and I had no proof that I hadn't. The lights began getting brighter in the lobby and I wished some of the people would leave because there were so many of them. "
"0333"	"I was walking down a side street in Painesville, Ohio where I attended Lake Erie College. I met J., a girl I had gone to junior high school with and whom I hadn't seen for 5 years. It was getting dark out and we walked in the shadows as we didn't want to be seen for some reason. We came to a bridge and were stopped by a man who asked to see our passports. There was a small building by the bridge and a lot of Negro men were milling around and some were working with a machine on the sides of the bridge. We didn't have the proper papers with us so someone pushed us and the next thing I knew, I was in a small room beneath the bridge, sitting in some mud. J. had disappeared. There were some people lying in the mud but I did not recognize them, nor could I see them plainly. I kept talking about some letters I was expecting and wondered if I could receive mail where I was. A man leaned over a railing and asked me what I was mumbling about. I told him about my letters, which were very important. He said he would try to get them for me but it would be difficult, as he was a Negro and wouldn't be allowed to go into my room at school. Then he disappeared. I started crawling around this awful place I was in and tried to figure a way of getting out. My main objective was to get the letters which seemed so important to me. "
"0334"	"I was in the basement of a house which was filled with water. I kept swimming back and forth from one end of the house to the other. I thought I was alone until I heard a loud splash. I turned and saw Mr. B. (a married man who lived next door to my family over 5 years ago and I used to baby sit with his daughter.) He swam over to me and I realized that he was naked. I was also but it didn't seem to be wrong. We swam about together and eventually he kissed me and later we had intercourse under the water. I asked him where his wife was and he said she would be down soon. She did come down very soon and saw us together. This did not shock or even surprise her. I kept swimming back and forth until I was very tired. "
"0335"	"I dreamed that I was dancing In a nightclub with B (a 25 year old Negro fellow whom I would like to date--we just recently met and are becoming quite well acquainted). The lights were very dim and I couldn't see many other people in the club but everyone I did see was colored. This didn't seem strange to me and it seemed that I was almost a Negro because I couldn't think of any white friend's names. Then I was in B's apartment, sitting on a divan with my head in his lap. I had been crying and he was stroking my hair and face. Then I thought of S, the girl who is very fond of B and doesn't know how I feel about him (she's in my class at Mather and we're quite friendly.) All I could see was her face with her long black hair drooping over one eye. "
"0336"	"I went to a picnic with another boy, only to meet my boyfriend with whom I'd had a fight the day before, although I can't remember what about. I kept trying to catch his eye and to smile but he refused to look at me and I knew it was the end of our relationship. I felt terrible because I hadn't known he could be so stubborn or get so angry and I was terribly sad. I turned around to look at the boy I was with. He asked, 'what's the matter?' and I answered nothing. He had the most understanding look on his face that I have ever seen. The strange part of the dream was that his face was the only part of the dream in color. I distinctly remember his ruddy cheeks and pale gray-blue eyes, with their understanding expression. My brother, sister in law, and their baby were also in the dream but I can't remember where. The alarm clock awoke me and I was very relieved that our fight hadn't actually happened. "
"0337"	"Our family had rented a summer suite in an apartment for summer but we were going to rent it the year round. Mother and I went there early one morning to have breakfast. In order to get to our apartment, we had to pass through another person's. She was a rich widow who was selling all her expensive antique furniture. I remember looking at the price tag on a mahogany table. We were going to rent her apartment when she moved out at the end of the summer. We were right on the lake and I couldn't wait to lie on the beach in the sun. But suddenly it got cloudy while my mother and I were drinking our orange juice. I lay on the sand a while but it got windy and cloudy and began to get chilly. Then suddenly, my older sister, who is 26, was there. She wanted to relax too, but it was too cloudy. I didn't like our apartment at all. It was freshly painted but too dark and the ceiling seemed so low that I had to stoop. I was very dissatisfied with it as living quarters. "
"0338"	"I was driving home from the show alone, and I was at Richmond and Mayfield or somewhere when I got lost and ran out of gas. I got out of the car and walked up the hill in the snow. Four little boys were playing where my glasses had fallen off so I went back to pick them up. But the smallest boy had [them] and wouldn't give them to me unless I gave him a dime. Then he dropped them and both frames and lenses broke. I couldn't drive without them so I was very angry and made him give me his name and address so I could send his mother the bill (the name was Asa something!). I went home for my streetcar pass so I could go back and get the car. It was cold and night time and I was dead tired and my father couldn't drive me there because his car was broken. It was about dawn when I went outside. In front of our house was a car with a boy I know in it with his three roommates sleeping. I woke them up and the boy held out my car key to me. I don't know why this was so wonderful but I didn't have to go back for my car. There was snow on the ground too. "
"0339"	"I dreamt I had a date with my ex-husband. Before the movie we met at a drugstore lunch counter and had bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches. While we were sitting there, he started a quarrel about something I can't remember but I know it was petty. Then he walked out. So I bought a box of popcorn and went to the movie alone. It was a downtown theater and an usher seated me as if the seats were reserved. The movie ""Hansel and Gretal"" was playing. At the back of the show were tables, as if it were a first-class restaurant, so I went back there to sit with my younger sister (20) and my older married sister (26). The waiter helped me off with my coat and I sat with them but we didn't order anything to eat. I remember that it was snowing and slushy outside and we all wore boots. The alarm woke me before the movie started but I vaguely recall that it had suddenly turned to summer and we were out on a terrace. "
"0340"	"My parents took in a male boarder, and we were attracted to each other, although we never said anything. We just exchanged glances. Then we had to move and I would have to transfer colleges or board at school which I didn't like. We were going to move to Willoughby, I believe. We went to look for a house and found one on the next street. It was pink and cost $75.00 a month for rent. We went to look at it and liked the big backyard. When we came back to our house, my father was sitting on the porch talking to 2 elderly men. It was summertime. I remember realizing that my father was getting old because he never takes time out to relax long enough to sit on the porch. It made me a little sad. But I was glad we had found a house here so I wouldn't have to transfer schools. "
"0341"	"Takes place in the upstairs suite of a double house. Some sort of informal party is going on consisting of friends from various musical groups. No one in particular except a boy, C., my own age with whom I associate a great deal, having known him since childhood. He plays no particular part in the dream, is merely present. A man, B., about 35-40, arrives. We see him first outside in front of the house, standing by a car and talking to several people. Then he is in the room. (He is not particularly popular with our group. He is the leader of an organization to which C and I belong and, in our opinion, doing a very poor job of organizing and leading and being very pompous and conceited about it.) He is holding a thermos bottle of Coca-Cola and he spills some on the shoulders of his overcoat. He pours the rest of the drink over himself, and stands there with a look on his face which is typical, a sort of stupid, self-conscious grin, as if he is worrying about what people are thinking of him. "
"0342"	"A theater. I am sitting with R (a boy I have been dating recently who is becoming somewhat of a problem because he insists upon getting serious). We are sitting in a section of the auditorium which seems to be right under the stage, although everything on the stage is visible. The seats are very comfortable, actually more like lounging chairs. A man comes out and leads the audience in some community singing which isn't too successful, since very few know the song. The melody was familiar, but I didn't know the words. Then a Negro dressed in old clothes comes out on the stage. I recall having seen his picture in the radio section of the newspaper as a star. He sings a song, with interludes of a shuffling sort of dance step. The audience applauds, particularly a Negro woman in the front row, and I think to myself as I see that, that this is as it should be. During this act R, who has his arm around my shoulders, kisses me twice, which I permit, but do not respond to as I don't want to encourage him. I look backstage and see a blonde showgirl apparently preparing for the next act. Her size is out of proportion to the people around her and she appears by comparison to be about 40 feet tall. "
"0343"	"Setting the back yard at home. A group of neighbors are over visiting. I start pushing some sort of cart down the driveway when a green car turns up the drive. The driver is A (mentioned in earlier dreams). He keeps coming ahead and slowly pushes me and the cart back into the yard (in a spirit of fun). He gets out of the car and I go to find him expecting to be greeted with some warmth, since we had not seen each other for a year, but he is not particularly affectionate. I decide that this is because of the other people around, particularly my mother. I mention to him that I had just sent him a letter since I wasn't expecting him home for several weeks yet and he just shrugs. There are several small children in the yard and we amuse ourselves by playing games with them. "
"0344"	"The stairway hall at home. I am standing at the front of the stairs, repeatedly working the light switch up and down, trying to get the light to go on (it already is on, but I keep trying to turn it on), but nothing happens. The doorbell rings, and my youngest brother is at the door. I am quite annoyed with him, because we had him started to school in plenty of time to get there on time and by coming home again, he will be late, and also because he has taken his coat off against orders. He says something about being hungry and I decide that he has forgotten to eat breakfast. "
"0345"	"I am headwaiter in some large hotel. A customer orders a poached egg which must be ordered specially. I go down to the kitchen to place the order. However, the cooks after much consultation, get together and came up with a more or less scrambled egg. I decide to let it go but later on the exact same situation occurs almost as if the dream were merely repeated. I call it to the cooks' attention, but they just shrug."
"0348"	"We, meaning the food's class, were in a dining room. It seems I was arranging a bowl of flowers. There were yellow roses, a red lily-like flower, and green foliage. After the flowers had all been arranged and the rest of the class went to get the instructor to show her the arrangement, I decided that the flowers were all crowded into one section and I began to try and rearrange them. It seems that all the flowers started to sink and go under. The red lily-like flower began to fall apart. The instructor came in and said not to bother, but I wanted to make the flowers look better. The dream ended with only the red lily-like flower being visible and rest of the flowers gone. "
"0349"	"I was in Haydn Hall, in the snack bar. Girls were selling tickets. One of the girls at the table was a friend of mine. Joan was a freshman. I saw a ring on her finger, but at first thought nothing of it. As I looked at the ring, I finally realized she was engaged. I went up to her and wished her the best of everything. I looked at the ring, which was not small or large, but very pretty and unusual. It looked more like a costume ring than a regular engagement ring. We talked about her future plans. She said that she and her fiance, who was a Beta, were planning on getting married in August. I, at this point, for the first time, noticed her Beta pin and tried to recall when she got pinned. I told her how lucky she was to be getting married and complained about the fact that it would be at least 2 years before I could get married. At this time more people seemed to be coming in Haydn for lunch. Several of my classmates were seated around a table. It seemed as if I was involved in the conversation with the people from my own class and was at the same time trying to learn from Joan if she would be back to school next year. I was interested because I thought the girl was very nice and would be a terrific asset to my sorority."
"0350"	"I was in one of my friend's home, but I don't know whose house it was exactly. There were boys and girls there that I knew. The boys wore tuxedos and the girls in formals. There was a formal that night and I was waiting for my flowers. When they were delivered, I opened the box and admired the beautiful flowers. Then I suddenly realized that they were pink flowers and I could not wear them with my coral dress. I became quite excited because I had asked for a white flower. Somehow there was another box and in it was a white orchid. I did not want this because of the purple center and because I just do not care for them. I took up the boxes in a very bulky way with the flowers sticking out of the boxes and started going up the stairs to get my coat to go back to the florist and exchange the flowers. As I was going up the stairs, several boys were standing at the top of them, around the railing, waiting for me to go up so that they could come down. I was next in a car going to the florist. My boyfriend Dan was driving. There were 3 people in the front and 3 in the back. Dan's mother was sitting in the back seat with two other boys and I, Dan and another boy were in the front. We were driving through the countryside and discussing the problem of exchanging the flowers."
"0351"	"My mother and I were driving to church for an evening service. We got to the front of the church when I realized we were supposed to pick up my boyfriend. I told mother to go into church and I would pick up my boyfriend. The next scene, my boyfriend and I were entering the church. The setting was very familiar to me. As we started in to take our seats, I noticed 3 boys sitting in the back row. I had some sort of obligation to one (whether I had a date with them I don't know). Since we would have had to pass him, I told my boyfriend that we had better go up to the balcony. As we reached the top of the stairs, a brick or stone came through the small window in the balcony. The dream ended."
"0352"	"I was sitting in the back seat of a car when a boy I knew from my high school class got in with me. He put his arm around me and I felt that the car was moving. There were two people in the front seat whom I didn't know. The next scene seemed to be in a big kitchen. I was making something to eat for the boy. I buttered up quite a few slices of bread while I waited for him. When he came to the table, he said he didn't want anything to eat. I looked at the table and could see the yellow butter melting on the warm bread. He left and I ran after him. It seemed important to me that he should eat. I told him that I wished I had met him before I met my boyfriend, I said I couldn't leave my boyfriend and he was very disgusted with me."
"0355"	"Mother and I were driving along the street when I saw the mother of a girl I knew from high school who had just been married. We stopped to talk to her when the girl whom had just been married the day before came toward us. I wanted to talk to her. She came towards us backwards and when she turned to face us, she was a heavy Negro girl. I stared at her for a minute. I said, ""I hope you got through it alright,"" meaning the wedding ceremony, but my mother and the girl's mother thought I meant something dirty. I tried to convince them that I hadn't meant anything obscene, but neither would believe me. I felt terrible."
"0356"	"A girl in a pair of pants and bra only was standing on the stairs. I identified the girl as one in my dorm. Her legs were very tan and long and more thin than any I have ever seen. It seems my boyfriend was looking in and admiring her and stroked her leg once. I was somewhat jealous, but I tried not to appear so. I don't remember for sure, but it seems that I dismissed Helen, whose legs are not like that, by saying, ""That's all,"" as though she were a model or something. There was no rancor in my tone, only command."
"0357"	"I dreamt I was supposed to go fishing on a fairly big boat. I was near the sea and it seemed evening since the sky was so overcast. It seemed that this expedition was part of a class requirement in which the majority were males--something at that. They were waiting for me and I was trying to get a fishing rod. I called to them to help me if they were in such a hurry, but they wouldn't, so I started picking out and untangling a line I found there in the sand, thinking to drop it in and hold it wound on a stick. They said it would be fine. Then my mother came and said it was so squally that she didn't think she'd go and I thought about it and decided I wouldn't either, so I told them to go ahead and leave. Then later someone came to my house and seemed quite distraught. The ship had gone down and she was grieving for her son. I had been in bed, but got up and began putting on my clothes to go and look for him. I had the feeling, however, that he was dead. I also felt glad that I hadn't gone on the trip. I also felt that his arm was off."
"0358"	"I dreamt that I, with a few others, was in a house and people outside were shooting at us. They had guns trained at the windows so that if anyone showed their heads, they would be shot. I wanted to go upstairs to the bathroom, but was afraid I'd be seen and shot. I debated whether I could crawl up and was afraid not. Once someone threw in the window a jelly bomb, it was yellow. It didn't seem to have much effect. This fight had started after the backroom had been set afire. I forget why. I was told to throw water on it as everything was probably killed by now and there was a row of animals charred, but I don't think they were dead. I was a little frightened. There was a burnt crow and I think the other animals were birds also, perhaps vultures. Oh, I was also afraid someone would get close and stick their gun right through the hole made by the jelly bomb and shoot me"
"0359"	"I was in a class being conducted in a damp, marshy wood. The professor was lecturing in front of this little cabin, but my seat was behind it, so I asked him if he minded my sitting in front so I could see, and he said that he did and said to me something about not enough seats, these all being taken and kids took the seats that I had thought I would take one of. Then I looked about for a place to sit and debated sitting on some wooden planks over some watery part, but decided it was to damp. Meanwhile, someone started to talk, seemed like gibberish or maybe she sang. The professor beckoned to me and I realized that he had made me a flat seat to sit on and had I sat down with it where I was, speaker and the prof. sat down on the grass. The seat he had made me was quite wide, so I moved over and invited him to sit next to me. Meanwhile the speaker went on. I was a little worried that the class might think I was brown-nosing, sitting next to the teacher, but I wasn't embarrassed. The dream ended."
"0360"	"Ray and I were driving along at a pretty good speed. We were in the back seat dressed in our ordinary clothes and seemed to be on our honeymoon. I told Ray I was afraid because the car was going too fast. He said, ""Don't be silly,"" and we came to a bridge--the countryside was rustic and pretty--a little wood bridge and didn't make the corner and went off into the water, which was quite deep. We got out and I saw myself fluttering upward through the water, but Ray was staying to look for a valuable dress dummy we had with us and not finding, came to the surface only to see the dummy pop out of the water. But I was nowhere in sight. I felt alarm at seeing the dummy, not myself, pop out. The alarm rang. I feel the dream unfinished."
"0361"	"I dreamt I was on my way home from visiting when I saw our house was on fire. I saw fire engines all around and people everywhere. The firemen told me everyone was safe except they couldn't get my dog. I ran into the burning house calling for Terry. I spotted him on the floor and picked him up. When I looked at my arms, they were black and pain shooting up and down. I got Terry outside and threw myself on the ground, putting out the flames on my clothing. I kept holding my arms, screaming because I couldn't stand the pain. I woke myself up and found myself with a tight grip on my left arm."
"0362"	"I was walking down a long road with odd-shaped trees alongside. I kept looking for a house and trying to locate a person to find where I was. All I could see were strange-looking animals running across the road and disappearing behind the trees. Then up ahead of me I saw a large dinosaur coming for me. It looked like it was at least 75 feet tall. I was frightened and started running. I threw sticks and large rocks, but it didn't stop. It kept making funny sounds and knocking down trees as it walked. I ran until I came to a cliff and jumped over. I could feel myself falling and this woke me up."
"0363"	"I was on a dark deserted street late at night and there was no one in sight. All of a sudden a big cat came out of nowhere and jumped on my clothing and wouldn't let go. I kept running up and down the street trying to throw him clear of myself, but he remained where he was. He kept making strange noises with his mouth as if he was trying to speak like a human to tell me something. Then he started for my throat to bite me, when I screamed and woke myself up."
"0364"	"I dreamt I was lying in bed and there was a snake underneath it. I was afraid to move in the bed or scream. I could hear him moving back and forth under the bed, making a funny noise as if he was ready to attack someone. All I could do was sit in one spot hoping he would crawl out and go away. This frightened me so much I woke up and looked under my bed to see if a snake actually was there."
"0365"	"I was watching my sister's baby while she and her husband went out. I went up the stairs to see if little Cathy was alright when a Negro jumped out of the next bedroom and tried to pick Cathy up. I kept hitting him and started to scream when he stabbed me. He jumped out of the window and started running down the street. I looked down at my side and blood was pouring out. I ran down the stairs and outside, when all the people in the block ran over with a sick look on their faces. I told them to get Cathy and then I fainted. When I came around, I was in the hospital and the doctor told me I was going to die. I started to cry out loud and that's all I can remember."
"0369"	"I was walking through a swamp for a long time, when suddenly a huge bed of snakes came upon me. One wrapped himself around my neck, one around my feet, and the rest just crawling al around me. I collapsed and the snakes struck, biting me at least 1,000 times."
"0370"	"My dream took place in two houses, my own home and the home of my boyfriend's sister-in-law. I was married to my uncle, someone other than the person I am engaged to now. The doorbell rang at my home and a little boy asked me to come over to my boyfriend's sister-in-law, that there was a package for me from someone other than my husband. So I did. When I arrived at the sister-in-law's home, she had opened the box. She said, ""Look, isn't it beautiful?"" I didn't look. I merely took the whole box and went home. When I got home, I threw the box into a corner and then my husband arrived home and shortly after this the other boy's parents came over and said, ""How could you marry someone else when you knew Whitney was coming home?"" Then they left the room. I never looked at the box and I wondered what was in it, and how I married my uncle. The dream ended here."
"0371"	"I was looking for a person in Crile Hospital. Not knowing who I was looking for, my search was quite exasperating and frustrating. Crile Hospital in my dream was as far from reality as can be explained. The patients were in skeleton casts and caves and all looked undernourished. I couldn't find who I was looking for and so just walked around in a daze. The time just dragged and by the time I left the hospital, I was all tired out."
"0372"	"Was driving with my family in our automobile when we came to the corner of my street and the car in front of us had two little children sitting on the roof of the car. As the car turned the corner, one of the little girls was hurled into the street and another car ran over her. Since we were the only witnesses of the accident and therefore it was our responsibility to get help. I didn't know where to find a doctor, so it seemed as if it took me hours and hours to reach a friend's home. After finally arriving there, I couldn't get in touch with a doctor. Finally I got a Dr. Meyers of whom I never heard of, but it was too late. We were held guilty for the accident."
"0373"	"A party was being had at my home. Many of my friends were present. Cannot account for what friends were there. Another friend, whom I found extremely irritating, came to say goodbye for he was departing somewhere. My boyfriend became very jealous and began to fight with this person. Never again did I see or hear from this irritating friend."
"0374"	"Went down town shopping in Higbee's. The store was altogether different from the HIGBEE'S IN REALITY. In the store I was looking for something I couldn't find. Someone was chasing me and accusing me of taking things. I never found what I was looking for, and the person, whom I am completely unfamiliar with, never found me."
"0375"	"It was the day of my history test. I had studied hours and hours and thought I knew everything. When I entered the classroom, my mind went completely blank. The professor began to yell at me and I became very upset. I couldn't think of one answer and this test meant either passing or failing. The whole attention of the class was turned to me. The hour seemed to last hours. I flunked the test."
"0376"	"I dreamt that I was lying in bed dying and was suffocating by the sheets and blankets. My mother and father were standing there crying, but they couldn't help me. I kept telling myself that I wasn't going to die and not to be afraid. What made me be afraid was the fear of how awful my parents felt. I kept telling my parents I was all right and I was really dead."
"0377"	"I dreamt that I was sitting in Kulas with my father. There were 6 beautiful chandeliers on the ceiling. While we were sitting there, a bomb fell, but it didn't harm anything and the people continued to sit there and the program went on also. All of a sudden I decided to find my mother. I left my father and went near the back to sit with mother. I had just sat down when they called me up on the stage. They asked me to tap dance. I told them I couldn't dance, but I would sing for them. I started to sing and found myself in my own living room singing for my grandmother, mother and father."
"0378"	"I dreamt I was on a street in Euclid, where I live, but that street was in Bena. I got on a bus and as I was riding along, two of my girlfriends (from Euclid) were yelling to me from a window of a house. One of my girlfriend's house. As I was riding, the bus turned into a bicycle. One of my girlfriends yelling from the window was ill and she wanted me to come in to see her. From the house next door the two girls' mothers were saying hello to me out the window. That was all that there was to the dream."
"0379"	"I dreamed that the boy I go with at Bowling Green (Doug) and I were going to get married. His mother and father had given us a whole lot of money, just so we could get married. My mother and father were very much in favor of the marriage too. Doug and I were very surprised and happy to see everyone so pleased upon our decision. We also had a home to live in. When we acquired it, I don't know, but it was real nice. All through the dream there was happiness."
"0380"	"I dreamed that my mother and I were downtown in Cleveland shopping. We were having a very good time laughing and enjoying ourselves when all of a sudden it began to storm. My mother and I decided that we had better hurry and go home because we didn't want to get caught downtown. So we went to the car and drove home. When we got home the storm had stopped. Then I woke up."
"0381"	"Jane Hearne, a good friend, and I were on a larger boat--similar to a pirate ship, up in the icy waters of the Arctic. We were sailing towards a large, large iceberg and finally crashed into it, being unable to avoid it. I jumped out of the boat and Jane stayed in the boat and sailed it away. I kept screaming fro her to come back and pick m up, but she wouldn't. The iceberg I was on was gradually sinking and the icy waters surrounded me. The dream ended."
"0382"	"I was swimming at a lake with some boy around 27 years of age. The lake itself was not familiar. It was one which had swamps on one side. It was nighttime and a full moon was shining. This boy and I went swimming. Suddenly a large muscular Negro man started chasing us. We swam towards the swamps, the man following. In the middle of the swamp was a house. We ran into it and hid upstairs. The man followed us there and entered the house. The dream ended. I have dreamt this dream 3 times -not in successive nights."
"0383"	"The dream took place in Rye, N.Y. in the winter. I was with 2 of my friends from Rye and a college friend. We all were at Marie's house, one of these friends. Her house was pictured exactly as it is in reality except that right beyond the yard was a cliff which overlooked the ocean. The drop to the ocean was at least 50 feet. I had on an aqua knit dress, one which I received for Christmas and a large turquoise ring. Extending from the cliff was a long, narrow diving board. My friends and I decided to go swimming and in order to do this, they ahead of me dove from the board into the water which lay way below. Being last and terribly afraid of height, I can remember the terror I felt as I walked out on the diving board. My sense of balance was not constant and I found myself swaying from side to side. Finally I took a deep breath, hoping it would last until I reached the water, and jumped. Then we all swam in freezing water out to a float. When I arrived there, I looked at my ring and the turquoise stone had melted and turned orange. The last thing I remember is that I thought that the stone in my ring had been made out of dehydrated vegetables."
"0384"	"I was in a bus crowded with friends from college and home. The surroundings were not all familiar; the roads were winding and the towns were old and quaint. The bus came to a stop at a red light and I noticed three policemen, one piled on top of another, in the street. All had been shot and were bleeding. The bus continued and finally stopped in a town. The passengers stayed in the bus except for a friend and myself who got out and went shopping. We heard the townspeople talking about a maniac who was shooting everyone. We entered a 5 and 10 cents store and were looking at the displays when all of a sudden the maniac was before me. I say me because at that time my friends were gone and I was alone. The trigger-happy maniac was an old white-haired hunched over man with a crazy sort of a smile on his face. He shot at me at least 5 times, and finally I ran back to the bus bleeding greatly. The bus left and my dream ended."
"0385"	"I was at home in Rye, N.Y. The man who lives down the street from me is a tall sort of Angy Gump type character. He has very long lets. In this dream it was night time and I was walking in the parking lot which runs adjacent to our high school. Suddenly I saw this man chasing me. His height increased greatly and his features exaggerated. I tried to run but my feet were stuck to the ground. As I woke, he was coming closer and closer to me."
"0386"	"The boy I used to go with, but hadn't seen for quite a while called up--wanted a date. He lived quite far away, so I said he could stay our place that night, but forgot to ask my mother if he could stay. He came--drove a red convertible--and we three went out together. Mother rode in front with him. I rode in the back. Found out he had just gotten out of the hospital. For some reason he kept scratching his head and asked me for a Kleenex so I thought he had had a head operation. Then I just forgot he was even there as I talked to mother and tried to convince her that he should stay at our place. When I finished, I suddenly realized he was there and I was very embarrassed, as was he."
"0387"	"There was a large group of us out in the field watching a boy ride a donkey he had just gotten. The donkey only had a halter on, but the boy was a good rider--made him run and buck. The donkey was very alert looking--had a face like my cat. We put him in the stable and went away--later I came back because I wanted to ride it secretly, and found he had grown much larger and was all bloated up from eating a pile of alfalfa that had been left in there. Boy surprised me by coming in. He was mad--thought cruel uncle had left alfalfa there on purpose. Uncle lived in house built way up in the air with dangerous steps leading up to it. He was keeping a man prisoner there by taking the man's glasses, because he (man) was almost blind and was afraid to go down the steps without his glasses. Uncle had party and man snuck out while it was going on and escaped."
"0388"	"We were going to a big family get together--when we got there everyone was going to various formals and strangely enough, we were all dressed for it. My mother was in a very short fantastic formal. My sister and some of the younger folks were going, but I didn't have a date--though I didn't want to go, they made me come along too. We drove to one fellow's house to see if he would go. It was then 4:00. He came out without tie, hair and clothes all mussed up. I made him go back in and change, then we left for the formal. At one time he asked me what kind of drink I could afford and I told him none. I didn't drink."
"0389"	"It was Easter Sunday and I went to my home church where I had not been for quite a while with a girl I recognized as being from college. She reintroduced me to all the younger people who were very friendly. At one time there were three of us girls and three fellows walking somewhere. One boy was the one I had dated a while ago and one girl was from college. We were all carrying little suitcases--I had left home to come to church because of some argument at home. When we went in church, I sat with my mother and sister as part of the service, a woman came driving down the aisle in a jeep, drove up the steps to the altar, turned over as she turned around, but righted herself and drove back down. Mother was also in service somehow, but I can't quite remember how."
"0390"	"Some boy and I went to see a very special military movie. The movie house was built quite a bit like our gym. The boy told me that the manager had been greatly honored by being given the right to show this movie and had expected to make a mint from it (these were the boy's words). Instead, however, the orchestra that was supposed to play for a special program between shows didn't show up, so he had to play the organ for it. The program consisted of children, dressed in pretty pink and blue costumes, doing complicated march formations. The manager was dressed in a dark blue suit."
"0391"	"At first it seemed I was flying along in the air, although not very far off the ground. I looked down and there was a high cliff with a canyon below. I got scared and couldn't fly anymore and I had that feeling of falling a long distance. Then I walked out of my house and saw my uncle's car in front. I got in and stepped on something soft and furry. When I looked down, I saw a tiger lying on the floor of the car and I was scared again."
"0392"	"I was in a dance studio practicing and at first I was the only one in there. Soon several women came in to watch me. After a while there were what seemed like hundreds of children watching me and standing so close that I could hardly move. I was afraid to tell them to move, but for some reason or other they all went and sat down on a window seat. I got nervous with all of them watching and I went over to the barre to exercise. I was so scared by that time that my legs seemed to weigh me down and when I went to do kicks, I could hardly lift them. Everyone started laughing."
"0393"	"I was driving in a car with a man. Evidently I must have known him very well because there wasn't the slightest fear or question in my mind. We were driving someplace near Berea because things I saw seemed very familiar to me. It was getting dark and we had absolutely no idea of where we were and I kept having the feeling I was looking for something. As we turned down a dirt road, I saw first a quail and then a big dog which my companion said was a fox. We were getting worried and I was becoming frantic looking for something, when we saw a sign that said Strongsville. We knew we were okay then and we drove into Berea from the south side of town. I still had the feeling of looking for something. As we drove into Marting parking lot, another man I know very well came out to meet us with a white mask on his face. It was then I woke up."
"0394"	"I was at home in Cleveland only the house was in an isolated section with nothing but trees and shrubbery all around. The only person besides myself that was clear was Franklin D. Roosevelt. It seemed there was a gang of men who were to kill the president. The house was continually under fire and once or twice I was hit by bullets. The most amazing thing was the calmness which Roosevelt kept throughout. We were unprotected for several days in this house and still Roosevelt kept smiling and was serene through it all."
"0395"	"In the first part of the dream I was at a ballet school and the walls were covered by mirrors. The teacher stood across from the exercise barre giving us instructions to the music of a worn out piano. In the second part all I remember is that a very good friend and myself finally saw our hopes realized and were being taken into a ballet company. I remember noticing how well my friend looked in her practice costume and just as we were about to try out for our parts, I woke up."
"0396"	"I was at home and looking out of the window at the street. Suddenly I spotted my dog lying out in the street several houses down. Evidently he had been killed by a car. But he was in four sections. I was horrified and quite broken up about it. Also I didn't know how to tell my sister as I had to tell her several years ago of the death of another dog of ours. While I was pondering on this, a dog that looked just like ours walked in. But I was sure that it wasn't ours. The remainder of the dream was concerned with trying to decide whether or not the dog that was alive or the dead one on the street was ours as they both looked alike."
"0397"	"A very small plane came straight down through the trees of Lang Lawn. It was spring and a lot of girls were watching it come down. Finally it came down with no damage resulting. Barbara Ayres, a sophomore here, climbed out. Everyone was quite surprised to see that it was she. Babs left the plane on the lawn and went into the dorm. Joe Warner, a senior, appeared and claimed that the plane was his. Nobody seemed to question why Babs was flying it. The plane was the smallest one I've ever seen. There were two seats, one behind the other, and an average individual could just fit into it. Lee Ellsworth, another senior, told the onlookers that it took 9.4 seconds to get off the ground if Joe did it. Suddenly I was in the driver's seat and Joe asked me if I knew where the throttle was. It was under a rubber mat on the floor. The instrument panel had very little on it. But I got it started in 9.0 seconds. I went off the ground and Lee was yelling at Joe that I beat his take-off time. Then I landed."
"0398"	"Several people were telling me of somebody's death. Evidently he had been killed in an automobile crash. Everybody in my group, consisting of B-W students, seemed to know this fellow. He evidently had been a student here, but I couldn't quite catch the name. The next week I discovered it was Jack Obert. He was pinned to a sorority sister of mine, but she didn't seem to be affected. I remember going by the Lambda Chi house and I wondered why they didn't have a black wreath on the door. In what seemed to be the next week in the dream, I learned some of the details of the crash such as it happened in Euclid and a truck crashed into a car in which Jack had been a passenger."
"0399"	"My father and mother had become parents of a baby boy. I went to see him at the hospital and he was absolutely the smallest baby I'd ever seen. It seems my mother was my father's third wife. I was the daughter of his 1st wife and my younger sister was the daughter of his 2nd wife. However, the 3rd wife in the dream had the appearance of my real mother. My dad was very happy because it was a boy. Suddenly the happy father was my husband and he said, ""I knew you'd come through."" It seems that I was the mother."
"0400"	"It was the night of the sorority formal. I had played tennis in the morning and gone to the track meet in the afternoon. I was going to leave for the formal at 8:30. Then I was in somebody else's room and I noticed it was 8:45. I was frantic and I hadn't even pressed my formal yet. So I started looking around for an iron and all of them were busy. In fact, all the girls who were using the irons were going to use them for several hours. I was frantic, but I hadn't received my parlor call yet. Then I went to a sorority sister's room. She was going to the formal, but the fellow she was going with was on the baseball team which had to play at Toledo that afternoon. Suddenly he appeared for her earlier than we had expected and she left in bobby socks. I was about the last one left in the dorm and I wondered where my date was."
"0401"	"I was in the girl's room (a triple room) on 2nd floor after lights out. We were watching out the window the ATO's and XA's having a 3-day snow fight. They have 2 snow forts and started to fight. There was a knock on the door. I jumped behind the door and motioned for one of the girls to answer it. She won't answer. I couldn't answer it because I would get campused if Mrs. Sanky saw me in their room. I couldn't lock the door because we aren't allowed to have our doors locked. So either way I was campused. She pushed on the door and I pushed back. She pushed me over and got in the room. I was on the floor and she was standing over me. The dream ended."
"0402"	"Dream took place in the registrar's office. I was trying to see what they could do for me because I broke my glasses. The people in the office were very unsympathetic to me. I kept dreaming of all the money it would cost to get new ones. Because I can't see without them, I kept worrying about how I would get my studying done. The person I talked to was a lady with pointed ears and a dog's nose. All this time I seemed to be looking up to a high desk."
"0403"	"It was 10:20 at night and I had forgotten my biology book over in the boiler room. Lights are out in our dorm at 10:30 and I had to get permission from our house director to go over to get it. It was real dark in the boiler room and I couldn't find my books. I looked and looked and finally went to the third floor to look for them. It was still dark--but a little lighter. Then I saw a bunch of kids from home. I talked to all of them at first. Then I was talking to this guy who I used to go with. We talked and then argued and then laughed. Then he crawled out the window and I had a party with the other kids. But I was unhappy because this guy left and I didn't have my biology studied for the test. I was also worried because I was going to be campused because I didn't go straight back to the dorm. When I went back, Mrs. Sanky, our house mother, hollered and campused me."
"0404"	"The B-W bus was on its way to our back to the B-W on Parade program. They (the bus) kept swinging back and forth. Then it gained speed and went very fast. The kids in the bus were laughing and crying. I could see my roommate in one of the windows and she was crying and crying. I knew she was unhappy, but I didn't know why. Then somebody, it was a man, sneaked out to the middle of the road and put down a big log in front of the bus. Then a train came along and hit the bus too. Kids went flying all over. I couldn't do a thing to help--couldn't stop the bus--the man--or the train. Then I couldn't find my roommate anywhere. I was very unhappy."
"0405"	"My father, some of his friends, and I were out in the woods hunting coons. The dogs got on a coon trail and ran very fast. We ran and ran trying to keep up with the dogs, but we could never catch them. Some of the men kept falling at the side of the path, too exhausted to run any more. Finally there were just daddy and me running. He fell down and I tried to help him up, but couldn't. I started to cry and cry. The end."
"0406"	"I was walking down a street with a group of boys and girls all my own age. In the distance I could see a building. This building was queerly shaped, the roof coming to a point. There was a garage attached to one side of it. I said that the building should be used for the rec hall because it was much nicer than the present rec hall. One of the boys in the crowd said that that was impossible because there wouldn't be a 50-foot clearance. I asked what a 50-foot clearance was needed for and he said because of playing basketball. I became rather confused since I knew they didn't play basketball in the rec hall."
"0407"	"My father was Napoleon, why I don't know. My brother cut his foot on a sword that he had been using, but my father showed no concern or sympathy for him. All he did was to tell me to put an apple on my brother's foot. He said this would cure it. I didn't think so, but I did it anyway. Then people, no one in particular, told me my brother was going to die. I didn't see how he could from such a small cut, they said he would."
"0408"	"I was coming home from college. I was rather peeved because I had to come home on the streetcar. It was Christmas time and I had a lot to bring home. The trouble was that I had so many small suitcases that I couldn't' keep count of them. I went to my grandmother's house because that is where we always have Christmas dinner. I felt hurt because when I got there, everyone was eating and no one had waited for me. After dinner I went into the bedroom and there was a large suitcase, big enough for all my stuff. I asked my aunt to whom the larger suitcase belonged, to please give me the suitcase, but she said no I couldn't have it."
"0409"	"I was with my father and we were out looking for a Christmas tree. The funny part about it was that I was dressed in a plaid formal. We rode for a while and finally stopped at one place and got out to get our tree. The girl in charge told me to pick out a tree. I told her I couldn't and she said, ""You mean to tell me you can't tell good wood from bad wood?"" This made me feel useless and definitely inferior to everyone else."
"0410"	"Our neighbor from across the street was bringing boxes of junk to store in our attic. It seemed strange since we both own our own house, but she told us that she and her husband had become our landlords. Later I was upstairs sitting on the attic floor in my plaid formal, looking at the boxes. She had a whole box of stockings and a large box full of evening purses. I thought that she was a hoarder because of the stockings."
"0411"	"A friend was going to Germany and my aunt was very interested in obtaining some original figurines from Germany. Shortly after this friend left for her journey abroad, my aunt and uncle went to New York and my aunt was so afraid that she would not get her figurines that my uncle wanted to go to Germany and get them for her, but my aunt was worried that they would not have enough clothes for such a long trip."
"0412"	"I was riding on a hay wagon one lovely moonlit night when suddenly a storm broke loose and the horses pulling the wagon became frightened and ran uncontrollably away and tipped the wagon and we fell off unhurt. My escort disappeared at this point. I was very disturbed and began running through the woods to find him, but found only fierce animals."
"0413"	"I was at work typing when the company president came into my office and asked me to come and take some dictation from him. This was my first experience of working with the president and I was excited and afraid. The president was a very stern man and frightened me. As I started, I had quite a bit of trouble, first a broken pencil, then I got a little behind the dictator and I began to think of losing my job. I became so confused that he had to dictate the whole letter over again."
"0414"	"It was raining and I was taking a driving lesson. I turned the corner at 18th and Euclid and almost hit a little kitten. This frightened me and I became doubly cautious. I was skidding quite a bit and was afraid of an accident. I was turning a sharp corner and instead of putting my foot on the brake, I hit the accelerator and we went up over the curb and stopped when we hit a telephone pole."
"0415"	"I was at a railroad yard watching the men work and engine came by with a flat topped car carrying three men. One man was moaning and badly banged up and the other two appeared to be dead. They were taking the men to a hospital. Something happened to me and I was limping with a broken ankle so they took me along to the hospital and when they proceeded to set the ankle. They had quite a hard time and I was in terrible pain and when I left the hospital I had a cast on my entire leg."
"0416"	"I was writing out invitations to a wedding when suddenly I seemed to be in the midst of a crowd of people who were celebrating something. It must have been my wedding because I wanted to open some gifts but someone stopped me saying that there would be time for that later. A gypsy came to the door and it developed she was Japanese and she seemed to be looking for someone. Then I was in an alley or basement or someplace small but dark. I saw two shadows on the wall and then just one. A woman was on the ground. She looked very still. This Japanese gypsy had hit her on the head. She was a very nice woman. She had done a ______ at the wedding and everyone liked her."
"0417"	"On a shopping trip my mother and I were going to buy a hat for my niece. I asked her size and it was 4. (She is now 10 years old.) After looking at a pink jacket and hat which was dirty, we went across the street to another store. Sonja, my niece, ran ahead. When mother and I got there, she had already picked out her hat and had it in a bag. As we were going in the store, I told mother that a natural straw would be nice with Sonja's coat which was bright green and I pointed out just such a hat. Sonja put on her chosen hat which was an ugly shade of green with a bonnet brim trimmed with brown ribbon. She was determined to have it so we got it. When we went to the car, we had other packages. I was afraid to have my sister see Sonja's hat because it looked terrible with the coat."
"0418"	"After packing a suitcase to leave with my husband, we began driving on country roads among the hills. I remember particularly now how green and beautiful the hills were. We decided to stop and see a mine. My husband has been there before. It was a peanut mine! We walked down many stairs and could see miners going down another stairway. We finally came to an elevator. It was in the shape of the peanut man which is in advertisements so much. I was frightened to get in it, but my husband told me it was all right. I was to count to ten aloud so that he would know when to take the next elevator. I was terrified because I didn't know when to start counting."
"0419"	"My husband and I were taking some girls to my home town for the first time. When we were a couple of miles from the town, we parked the car by the side of the road and began to walk. When we reached the town, I stopped to get the mail. The others were looking at the few stores (which were very different from the actual stores there). In the post office the woman was talking to me (I knew her, but I don't know now who she was). She asked me if we were all right. I said we were, but thought it was a queer question to ask. Then I heard that there had been an accident a couple of miles out of town. It was our car and they thought that we had been in it when the truck hit it, demolishing it."
"0420"	"I went to the bank to cash a bond, then walked down the street window shopping. In one of the stores, I noticed a woman sitting tied and gagged in a chair in front of the door. There was a chair under the door knob on the outside and as I tried to remove it, the woman shook her head no. I then realized the store was probably being robbed, so I tried to get out of that doorway and into the one next door before the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally after what seemed to be a great struggle, I did it. I stayed there for a while trying to make myself small. The store wasn't open and there was no one on the street. I began to worry that the man would come out and see me, so I decided to venture farther down the street. Again, my legs wouldn't move. The last thing I remembered was that I was glad I didn't get the money for the money I cashed in."
"0421"	"My mother has had trouble with her bridge in her mouth and I dreamed that I broke my front tooth (bottom tooth) and that I was supposed to be going away that night to a formal and my mother had this bridge laying on her dresser and when she went downstairs, I quickly picked up her teeth (there are four in all) and tried to fit them into my mouth, but my mother came upstairs and caught me and then I woke up."
"0422"	"I dreamed that a bunch of kids from college went sledding on a real cold nite. It was about 10 below zero, but we were all dressed real warm (we thought). We went down on this great big sled and we kept on going and going and going. I tried to stop the sled, but couldn't. It seemed as if we were going for miles and miles. We finally stopped and we tried to get up off of the sled, but we were frozen right to it. I woke up then and was very cold, especially my feet and hands."
"0423"	"I dreamed that was in typing class and the world's greatest typist (don't remember her name) was there and the kids in our typing class were trying to beat this famous typist. We all had three times to try and see if we could type faster than she could because there was a prize of $11,000 to the one who could beat her. No one could, but then on my last try I finally beat her by 1 stroke. Just as they were handing me the money, I woke up. What a disappointment because I never did get the money."
"0424"	"A bunch of college friends were out on a farm having a picnic and all of a sudden bombs were falling and we were crawling along on the ground. Everyone was trying to crawl ahead of us and gradually there were only two of us trying desperately to catch up with those ahead. Then I woke up."
"0425"	"I dreamed that the communists invaded Berea and that they had all the people out in a big field in a big long line. It was very cold outside and I can just see the faces on those Chinese soldiers. They were unshaven and smelled filthy dirty. Then we were told to take all of our jewelry except they didn't want our watches. I remember my mother taking off her diamonds and the sad look on her face. I remember taking off an old ring and I asked the soldier why he wanted that old ring for and he slapped me across the face and took the ring and walked away. Then I woke up."
"0426"	"My girlfriend Marlene and I were in an outdoor bowling alley which had a lot of shrubbery and trees around. There were a lot of younger boys around there as if something was fishy. Then we went into the bowling alley and there was a Chinaman's head in one of the crooked bowling alleys and when the boy bowled, he broke the Chinaman's head. The manager of the bowling took after the boy and I felt sorry for the boy, so we rode away and in the country was a park where we hid and no one ever found us."
"0427"	"I was on the stage trying out for a part or I had the part. Many people were on the stage walking off and on. Confusion was present. Next I was in a room trying to find clothes to put on. I had one outfit on but found a brand new skirt so I put the new skirt on with a blouse. I had two sorority pins on. One was plain gold and the other had pearls. I asked a friend in the room if I cold wear them and she said yes, so everyone would know I was in a sorority. I then took off he plain pin, but kept the pearl pin on. At the end I was back on the stage with an audience, but not doing anything."
"0428"	"I went downtown with a friend of mine in the streetcar. The downtown section was populated with small people who were smaller than dwarfs. They were ugly and all the clothes and skin were black. While I was riding up the escalator one of these black persons was chasing me. In the meanwhile my friend deserted me. While I was in the store, I got a motorcycle and toured the town while this person was chasing me, but I never found out who it was."
"0429"	"I dreamt that I was swimming in an outdoor swimming pool one day and there were all white people there, but under the water there were Negroes who pulled me down under the water into another land Here they made slaves of me so I was a barmaid who had to wait on Negroes"
"0430"	"I dreamed that I was at home and I told my dad I wanted to join a sorority at school, but he didn't want me to. If I joined a sorority, he would take me out of school. So I went downtown on the bus and joined the Spars because I didn't want to go back to school without belonging to a sorority. Of course I did this out of spite, which my father didn't like, but I still had to go to the Spars because I had enlisted."
"0431"	"I was sinking, sinking downward until I landed in a submarine. Everything was black throughout the whole dream. Then I was thrown in the closet and a bear was thrown in with me. We kept sinking because there was no bottom to the closet. When I woke, I was shivering."
"0432"	"I was a teacher in Alaska in this dream. My husband (I'm not really married, but unofficially engaged) and I lived in Anchorage. One day an American ship was coming in; the last one before the hard winter season. I took my class to see this ship. We went through it from top to bottom and I received photos of it to teach the class what it looked like. Before we were able to get off, the boat left shore and there we were, on the boat. I was frantic, worried sick and almost panicky. Then what did I see but my husband working with the crew. He let down a life boat, put all the children in it and sent them back to shore. There was no room for me in it, so I had to stay aboard ship. The ship gave a big lurch and I woke up from my dream. I was very confused."
"0433"	"I was tap dancing on the stage at the Statler Hotel in Cleveland when my parents came in and went backstage to wait for me. They told me that they would lock me in my closet if I didn't stop dancing. I didn't pay any attention, I guess, because I was dancing the next thing I knew. When I went home, all I could see inside the house was the dark closet. As soon as I went inside, the door locked behind me. I groaned and moaned (my roommate heard this). My roommate came over and woke me up. It was horrible."
"0434"	"It was a dark, stormy night and I had been out walking. I walked and walked all over town, then came back to my street. I couldn't find my home at all. It wasn't where it should have been. I hunted up and down the street and all over the block and still couldn't find it. I asked the people who were home (neighbors) if they had seen my house. They looked for it too, but they couldn't find it. I went to my grandmother's place and she took me in for a week until I could find the house. I woke up when I was looking for my house again."
"0435"	"A girl came in from the next room from me and woke up my roommate asking her what time it was. Irma said it was quarter after 6 and Barb called her a liar and insisted that it was 6:30. Irma got quite huffy and they started quarreling. Barb slammed the door and stormed into her room. This woke me up. I was very angry at being awakened from a sound sleep in such a rude way. This dream seemed so real that I was actually surprised to find out that it really never happened."
"0436"	"I dreamt that I broke up with my boyfriend and started to date one of his fraternity brothers. No matter where we went, the places reminded me of my boyfriend. One night when I had a date with his friend, I turned around and his friend turned into my boyfriend. I was very pleased."
"0437"	"I dreamt I was in college and one night I was called to meet Bob, my boyfriend, at his aunt's house. So after class I walked to his aunt's house on a very cold day. As I reached her house, I looked in the window and he was amusing all the children in the house. I knocked on the door and he let me in. I also began playing games with the children, then the dream faded away."
"0438"	"I dreamt I was swimming on a beach and it started to rain real hard as a few friends of mine and I ran underneath an umbrella on the beach. One of the girls ran for help because the water was beginning to rise. She came back with a sorority sister of mine on a horse. The horse was very wild and wanted to throw her off. After she came, others arrived on horses. Then the dream faded away."
"0439"	"I dreamt I was present in the room that was discussing where to drop the atomic bomb. I saw them load the bomb on a very different type plane that carried the bomb on a cord outside the plane. I sensed the fact that all this was top secret. They were going to drop the bomb in a valley very close to where one group would be, but it was the softest of all places. The dream ended as the plane took off to its destination. Everything seemed so mysterious and powerful."
"0440"	"I dreamt that my cousin in Cleveland had a pet seal and it followed her everywhere she went. In fact, she carried a handbag that was big enough to carry the seal in. I was afraid to get too close to it. Then my dream switched to Tommy, my cat. I dreamt that he was alive again, yet I still couldn't quite believe it, so mother made him do all the tricks he used to do to prove it to me. As he is doing these tricks, he jumps out the window and over the stone wall in the alley and is gone. Then the dream ends."
"0441"	"I was in a huge living room in a house that was unfamiliar to me with a group of people which included my mother and father, my grandmother, my roommate and her parents and several other people. We were having a religious discussion and I was the only one who was arguing for the minority groups. The whole room seemed to be against me, but I used every possible proof that I could think of to prove that I was right. I even quoted something from the Bible. Finally I got so mad that I just started yelling and I woke myself up screaming."
"0442"	"I dreamed that I was transferring from B.W. to some school n New York City. It was a one-building school and had no dormitories, so I didn't know where I was going to sleep as I didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel. There was another girl with me, but I don't know who she was. Somehow there was a huge grocery store in the school and I was going around picking out food that would last a long time so I wouldn't starve. The superintendent was following me around giving me all sorts of tests for entrance to the school. Suddenly I decided not to go there and I found myself in the little town I used to live in in New York State enrolling in some kind of a college that was connected with the high school. They also gave me a lot of tests and I wrote down the subjects that I wanted to take. I said that I wanted one of my Medina, Ohio high school teachers to teach me all the subjects. The rest of the dream is hazy."
"0443"	"I dreamt of my wedding and honeymoon. The dream was in Technicolor. My mother wore dark purple and my fiance's mother wore light purple. I married the guy that I'm going with now. I went through the whole marriage ceremony. Following the wedding there was a reception and all the people wanted to kiss me when I went through the receiving line. After the reception we went on our honeymoon and stayed in a motel. I wore a white negligee and lounging jacket. After the honeymoon we went back to our own little house and he carried me over the threshold."
"0444"	"I had a dream about one of my girlfriends here at school. She was roller skating down a hill and couldn't stop when she came to the street and saw a car coming. The car hit her and knocked all her front teeth out. She had gold teeth put in to replace them. The next scene took place in MP's dining hall where she was waiting to eat dinner. She was all decked out in slinky clothes, including an inch of mascara and makeup and false eyelashes. Somehow her boyfriend was there too and when he saw her, he exclaimed over how terrible she looked and said he'd never go out with her again. All she could say was that she couldn't help it. The roller skates wouldn't stop."
"0445"	"I dreamed that I was with a bunch of girls from BW. We were all on the Medina High School stage and groups of us were putting on little skits and trying to beat the other group. My group put on the best one--sang and talked some. After my act I went down into the audience and sat down. Just as I was about to sit down, I saw one of my old boyfriends and I was startled and woke up."
"0446"	"This dream took place entirely in one room and instead of a so-called plot, I dreamed of the room itself. It was supposedly a double room in a dorm. It was a corner room and had two windows. The companion wallpaper was flowered and was brown in color. There were twin beds in the room with chenille bedspreads. There were to desks, one being black and two dressers. Two pictures of my roommate were hanging on the wall. The floor was completely covered with maroon carpeting. My roommate was standing in front of the closet between the beds, and I was standing at the door leading into the hall. We were attempting to decide how we should rearrange the rooms we wouldn't have to walk around the bed every time we went to the closet."
"0447"	"I had been working for hours ruling off a card to use for roll call in a swimming class. I did it all in India ink and as soon as I had al l the members in the class listed on the card, I gave it to the instructor of the class, Dorothy Crandall. However, she already had a swim roll exact like the one I had made, and so I told her that I had made it for the fun of it and she didn't have to use it. But she said that she needed it and so she decided to keep it."
"0448"	"I was standing at the kitchen door when suddenly two of my cousins whom I haven't seen for quite some time appeared. Nothing happened or was said except that they thought I had changed a great deal since they last saw me. Then I was outside holding a little girl (in a white dress) in my arms while at the same time I was dancing the polka. Someone was laughing at me because I looked so funny. For some reason I felt cramped for space. Next I found myself sitting on a porch swing, but when I saw my grandfather coming, I tried to hide between the swing, and instead of there being a solid wall behind me, it was open and he saw me. My sister was sitting on the swing and she said he found me because my feet extended out beyond the swing."
"0449"	"My roommate and I were swimming in a sort of pool with a cement foundation, but yet we seemed to be in a river. The water was quite black and we were hanging onto the side watching others dive in. We suddenly found ourselves in another section of the pool, but this was blocked off from the larger part. As we stood in the water, Dorothy Williams, the student instructor, told us we couldn't swim there because there were holes in the cement wall and very likely someone would slip through. Miss Stover, the teacher, came over and as she stood on top of the cement wall, she told us the same thing that Dorothy did."
"0450"	"I was on my way home from school with a big heavy suitcase in one hand and my typewriter in another. I had walked quite a distance before tiring, but now I was exhausted. However, there were two people in back of me who were rushing to catch the Berea bus as I was, so I put all my strength to keep up with them. It bothered me that neither of them offered to help me. Suddenly a bus went by, but I didn't know whether it was a Berea bus or a Cleveland transit bus, because the sides were green like the Berea buses, but the back was yellow like the CJS buses. Somehow I seemed to overtake the bus and the front was also green but I couldn't see the sign telling of its destination. The bus was suddenly gone and I kept walking. There were two little girls in front of me pulling a sled and I asked them if I could put my baggage on the sled. I did and held it to keep it balanced."
"0451"	"Once more I was swimming, this time in the pond in front of my grandmother's house. It's a fairly large sized pond, but no one hardly ever swims in it due to the numerous cattails and seaweed growths. It is known to have no bottom because of its base of muck. Well, on with the dream. It wasn't an especially different dream, not even exciting. Tom and I were simply swimming around. I remember remarking what a good tan he had. Oh yes, once as I was getting out of the water, the top of my bathing suit came down. Tom didn't seem to notice it, though, so I fixed it and we went on swimming as before. Pretty soon three boys came up. I believe they were supposed to be cousins from Pennsylvania. I recognized one named Mickey, but the faces weren't familiar. I introduced them all to Tom who by the way is my boyfriend. The next thing I remember is being at someone's house, but I don't remember where or who was there."
"0452"	"All I remember is coming to a lake in rather the dusky part of the evening. Looking down from what seemed to be a diving board, I saw to my horror, my boyfriend lying face down in what appeared to be the water. Thinking he was dead, I rushed over and as I drew near he looked up at me and motioned for me to go away in what seemed to be a rather disgusted attitude."
"0453"	"Again I can't recall the entire dream; but it seems some men were trying to catch my horse (my ex-horse, I recently sold him). Jumping fence after fence, in what seemed to be the same paddock, my horse was frantically trying to escape these men. Finally the strange men must have given up for I heroically entered the paddock and easily captured him. I remember bridling him and then what happened I don't know for I seemed to be on some sort of a wooden contraption that bobbed up and down in an odd way. Some person was walking with me when I was on this wooden board-like affair. Everyone seemed to be in good humor, at least I don't recall any bad feelings among anyone."
"0454"	"It seems I was riding in a car with some fellow I had a small crush on about 3 or 4 years ago and who I have hardly seen since. Someone else was evidently driving the car when we saw a lake and decided to go swimming. There seemed to be a lot of other people in swimming and enjoying themselves. Somewhere Jim left the dream, and I found myself swimming in a slimy lake full of seaweed, fish, etc. I had a strong desire to get out (no doubt due the slimy lake and fish--both for which I have a strong dislike). When the dream ended, I was out of the water, just standing there on the dock watching the others swim and wondering why they didn't mind the polluted lake."
"0455"	"Many people were at a house. In the dream it was our house, although there was no similarity to our real home, except perhaps the yard. Again my horse Tom enters the picture. I had left him tied outside in the yard and went in the house for something. Looking out of the window, I saw to my horror a young girl on Tom riding down this yard with 2 adults a man and a woman who had evidently given her permission to ride him. I was furious when I saw her on him (I never permitted many people to ride him as most people don't who use their horses for show, due to the fact that their way of going can be spoiled for the person showing). I believe I was a bit jealous too. These 3 people were running the horse very fast down a hill. My shouts to them to stop were useless. Struggling fiercely, I tried in vain to get outside, but people held me back. I hit at people and cursed them, but both blows and words were also useless. I remember one elderly lady seemed to be very shocked at my vulgar actions. She couldn't seem to understand my feelings to the circumstances involved. Directly outside the window was a tall steep wall, evidently the banking to a lawn. The wall must have been 12 ft. high and over the top I saw my horse plummeting downward. I was terribly upset, but still my struggles to get to him were futile, although no person was actually holding me back. Tom didn't seem to be hurt too badly, but someone evidently thought he was in misery and shot him. I was terribly hurt, depressed and sad."
"0456"	"Last night I dreamed I was in a garage which was on an incline. Parked in the garage was a Cadillac convertible. It was blue. There was a hose on the floor and I remember picking it up and spraying water all over the car. I can still see the water hitting the car and spraying back on me and the floor. My father came into the garage and said that wasn't the right way to wash a car. Dad said I should stand closer with my finger over the nozzle of the hose and wipe the water and the dirt off with a rag. When he left the garage, I went back to the former way I had been doing it. All of a sudden the convertible top opened a little and I squirted water into the inside of the car. I remember I felt suddenly frightened and tried wiping up the water."
"0457"	"I dreamed my father, my roommate and myself went out to a lighthouse in Lake Erie. It was a sightseeing tour of the deepest part of the lake. Somehow, when it was time to submerge, the only person going down was me. I don't' think I was frightened, but I was a little nervous because the man who was to go with me was late. I can remember worrying that my hair was going to get wet and that I was having trouble wrapping a scarf around my head. Finally the man arrived and ordered me to get into the contraption which was like a diving bell. I can remember the opening was a little below the water and I had to hold my breath in order to get inside of it. It was very damp inside and there was water on the floor. We finally took off and I waved goodbye to daddy and my mother from the peep holes."
"0458"	"I dreamed I was studying in the dorm. One of the girls from first floor came up and told me I had a telephone call downstairs. When I answered, I found I was listening to a record of a quiz program. The voice I heard was that of a boy who I have known for about 3 years, but not known too well. He was being asked a question which I think he must have answered correctly because he was given a reward. After that I found it hard to hear, so I hung up. The girls standing near me kept saying, ""We told you so."""
"0459"	"I dreamed I was invited to a party which was being held in a bowling alley. In order to get into the party, I had to roll a strike, then climb through the space where the pins had been standing. When I had rolled the stroke and climbed through, my girlfriend (Connie) was waiting on the other side. She seemed very disturbed that I was able to get in and we began fighting. I left the party with some strange boy and while we were walking away, a group of people came by. We could hear them making fun and shouting harsh words to a policeman standing nearby. I called to them then and asked why there were being so nasty. (I can't remember any more.)"
"0460"	"I dreamed I was entertaining people of my own age in a house which was supposed to be mine, but it was a house I had never seen before. I was unfamiliar with the cupboard and closets and every time someone asked me for something, I would hunt frantically, but would never find it. The person who asked would never be mad, but would look at me as if I couldn't help what I was doing. I can remember music being played and a great many people everywhere laughing. I can also remember thinking to myself that this house that was supposed to be mine could not possibly have been, yet I did not know where my real house was."
"0461"	"I was walking up an endless stairway. On each side of the stairway were murals or paintings of beautiful rooms. After each few steps upwards, the pictures would become more beautiful. The depicted rooms were not ultra-modern or of another age-they were beautiful, but simple. I finally saw the end of the stairway and ran as fast as I could, hoping that what would be beyond would be something special. When I got to the last step, I looked down and there was a beautiful garden far below. In the center of the garden was one small clump of red roses which seemed to stand out more than anything else. Then I was falling down toward the garden."
"0462"	"I was walking out of the apartment in which I live and I noticed that the people in the basement suite were moving. I went to the janitor's wife and inquired about the suite. She told me that it was available, but she had another one on the 3rd floor, number 18, which I might like. We went up to see it. (In real life, the suite is directly above my own suit, but is number 17.) She opened the door and I was astounded by the vastness of the rooms (again, in real life the rooms in the building are all very small). The rooms were ultra-modern. I was very pleased to take the apartment, but my husband then came up and said no. Mrs. Beals was very nice and pleasant."
"0463"	"I was walking along Euclid Ave. and noticed that all the windows were full of dresses selling for two and three dollars. The dresses were all very pretty. I came upon the Hippodrome Theater and noticed the billboard outside which had a picture of two men fighting on a rocky hillside. Suddenly one of the men was me. We were both bleeding. At the bottom of the hill a car was parked. We were rolling along the rocky hillside, going down. Another car came along at the bottom of the hill with people walking beside it. I thought that somebody would come and help me, but the people just watched a while and then left."
"0464"	"I found myself standing on the corner of W. 48th and Bridge Ave. On the corner stood a dilapidated old house. There was no door and I walked in. The house was being remodeled. The interior was very beautiful. I noticed one very large wall near an archway; it was completely bare. Adjacent to it was another wall. This wall was very narrow and cluttered with lamps. I walked down a corridor and came upon 4 bedrooms, then I heard footsteps and quickly hid behind a door. A young man walked in looking for whoever had been making the noises. All of a sudden I discovered that I was unclad. I then realized it was twice as important for him not to see me. Then all of a sudden he found me, but I was fully clad when he did. We walked to the front part of the house and there I noticed his wife. She was pregnant. They were both friendly to me; they explained that they were looking for a place to live and found this house. The lady who owned the house was against renting to young couples, but changed her mind when she saw how beautiful the interior was. I remember very well that the man's wife was very sweet and smiled constantly."
"0465"	"I was falling through space and weird animals were trying to grab me while I was falling. These animals were all ugly. One of them almost caught-it resembled an octopus but had teeth. All the animals were green. I kept falling and screaming every time one of the animals would try to reach for me. Then all of a sudden there were no more animals and I found myself in a beautiful room. I started to walk around the room. On the walls were mounted heads of the animals which I had just seen. I started screaming and then woke up."
"0466"	"I was walking toward a very large swimming pool. Many people were bathing as I approached the pool. I was ready to go in the pool and all of a sudden I noticed the water was very, very muddy and dirty. I jumped in anyway and I was glued to the mud. After a short time I saw the water draining out. Before I awoke I was standing in the pool."
"0467"	"I was in a downtown shopping district with two other girls. We were in a very big hurry to get someplace by 6 p.m. The one girl wanted to go to a clothing shop which was located on the 25th floor of a very old building. We went there and looked at some bathing suit. From here I remember waiting for an elevator. There was a man following us from this time on. We always knew he was near because of a very mysterious whistle. However, he never caught up with us. We were always in a hurry throughout the dream."
"0468"	"The dream took place on a very wide street in a residential district. I was laying on a mattress with my head on a pillow perpendicular to the street. I was laying on a driveway from someone's house. There was a girl sitting next to me, but cannot recall who she was. My psychology professor lived two houses down from where I was. His automobile was parked in front of his home and at this time he was standing by the two of us carrying on a conversation. As I looked up from my pillow, I could see him smile at me. That was all I needed because I really had a mad crush on him. He offered me a few pretzels he had and before he offered the girl any, I gave her a 2 cent long pretzel since he had those thin ones. The professor was quite disturbed over this and started for home. Later I went to him and apologized for giving her a larger pretzel than what he had."
"0469"	"I was in a second story room located above a building. A number of girls were in this room playing a kind of golf game. My psychology professor was sitting watching these girls play and I went toward him, sat down and started to talk. Then I found myself pushing a cart down in the flats (Scranton Rd.) After making a left turn, I had to cross a bridge. The bridge was closed, making it possible for a boat to pass. But I was going to try and get across before the boat came near. However, there was a long stump of wood across the bridge which made it impossible for me to go over. At this time the professor came to me and said something. Later in the dream I was with one of my girlfriends here in the dorm, but do not know where we were. We were just talking."
"0470"	"I was sitting on huge rocks which formed a breakwater. It surrounded a small body of water. There seemed to be several people sitting on this breakwater with me watching fish which looked a little like seals jumping around in the water. Everyone was afraid to walk across the water because these seals could bite so hard they could kill a person. However, they wouldn't bother you if you stood still. All the people had their legs tucked under them and were on the rocks. I decided to walk across the water. When I did, not one seal bothered me. But as I returned to the breakwater rock and stopped for a moment, they started to jump at me."
"0471"	"This dream concerned a sorority sister who was planning to be married soon; a sort of preview of the wedding. The auditorium was filled with thousands of people. There was an altar like all churches, but there were no pews. The people were sitting on stone bleachers. I was to be one of the attendants in the wedding and although not the maid of honor, I was to bring the groom's ring. The bride to be informed me that the ring was on a table near the altar and I was to pick it up before the service. The processional started and I followed the maid of honor down the aisle. I picked up the ring and started to leave the altar to go to my seat in the congregation. At that point, my costume was changed and I was just a spectator. The bride became frantic as she looked for the ring. Then I suddenly stood up and shouted, ""Here it is."" I tried frantically to get it to her, but too many people gathered around me and refused to let me through. At this point, the scene changed and I was with a group of friends, both male and female, eating in the hold of a ship. There were shells and mounted fish on the walls, and a foul fish smell. Everyone began talking and laughing and then I woke."
"0472"	"There was a large crowd of us coming through a field returning from a swimming party. A woods was in the background near a winding river. There were only girls and strangely, none of us had on any clothing. We were walking along nonchalantly when we saw a group of boys leaning on a fence. They were near some cars in a parking lot and were watching us approach. Showing no marked concern, some of us turned around and walked back a short distance to dress, while others merely stopped and dressed standing where they were. I was one of the first ones going across the field and just as I turned, I saw one of the two girls I recognized, both freshmen on campus, hold out a pair of red pants and put them on. At this point I woke."
"0473"	"We were sitting around the kitchen table when there was a knock at the door. It was late at night and we were startled for there are not many houses around us and not many of the people keep late hours. It was a peculiar knock--not like one people usually use. My father got up slowly and went to the door, opened it and saw the tramp. He immediately gave the screen door a push, the force of it sending the man reeling off the wide step onto the ground. My dad went out after him and a fight began. I was afraid he was going to hurt my father, so I picked up a knife and ran out the door. Mother following me. We stood there and watched the fight for a short time. Then, using the knife I held in my hand, I slashed at the tramp several times, until there was a great amount of blood on the ground. My father overcame the tramp, but being completely exhausted, he collapsed on the ground. Lying there, he appeared to have three hands. This woke me up. (The tramp was probably in his late 30's or early 40's.)"
"0474"	"Our final swim show was taking place in the pool this evening. However, unlike the Friday evening performance, there were but a few persons scattered throughout the bleachers. Nothing seemed to be going right. During the various numbers, the lights would go out and the spotlights would not be shining on the swimmers. Instead, they were flashed in the faces of the audience. The girls in the show were not in their positions on time and throughout the entire show, some were sitting on the pool edge kicking and splashing while watching the others as they went through their numbers. Also some of us were sitting out on the bleachers watching. In addition to this, all of the girls were laughing and talking and calling out corrections to the swimmers in the water. Another thing, we weren't wearing the new yellow suits, but had on the old swim suits which we had used for practicing."
"0475"	"This dream occurred at my home where a deserter from the army was now hiding. This soldier was the same young man I had dreamed about the night before. Our fruit cellar seemed to be very well stocked. In fact, it was overcrowded. We were living in our basement recreation room and using the fruit cellar for a bomb shelter. Outdoors bombs were being dropped, but the only visible damage was the presence of huge holes in the streets. There were road blocks at close intervals along the street and I was unsuccessfully trying to push my grandfather's large two-wheeled cart down the middle of the road. This seemed to be piled high with cabbages of all things, which weren't in the best condition. During this time, the blond lad was hiding in the house peering from the front window of the bedroom which was mine while I was in high school. All day he sat there focusing my dad's binoculars on the enemy soldiers who were patrolling the five points in front of our house. Only at night did he leave the house. At this time we would go for walks together."
"0476"	"I was in a house. It was a beautiful, large home with expensive furnishings. I went to the kitchen where I saw some people whom I couldn't quite recognize. I saw 4 dogs, one of which was a collie. I also saw a small girl, an acquaintance of mine. I then found myself in the basement where I was watching my husband (24) and brother playing pinochle. My brother (24) took the hand, but somehow my husband won money."
"0477"	"I dreamt I was walking across a bridge and just as I got across, the bridge fell in. I then kept walking along a road. Alongside were trees lining the road. I suddenly heard a tremendous thud, and when I turned around, a tree had fallen just behind me. I was walking along a road high above a ravine and just as I stepped around a curve, the road gave way behind me."
"0478"	"I found myself in an apartment where I lived about 12 years ago of my life. Before I had a chance to look around, the landlady's daughter (35) came out and hugged me. This part of my dream was peculiar, because during all the years we lived in that apartment, this lady never cared for me. She took me up to visit our old suite of rooms. In reality the rooms are quite small and plain. In my dream the rooms were spacious, light and beautifully furnished. The sun seemed to be streaming into all of the rooms. There was a lady in the rooms whom I thought I recognized, but she wouldn't look at me, so I couldn't be sure."
"0479"	"I dreamt I was in a beautiful swimming pool in which there were only girls swimming. Everyone was an expert swimmer or diver. It was as though there was a swimming show, for each girl seemed to have a special feat to perform. It seemed as though they were swimming and diving for a very long time. I wanted to join in the pageant, but I seemed spellbound. Suddenly something happened and I was in the midst of the aqua group. I knew just what part I had to do and I did it."
"0480"	"I dreamt I was standing on a corner attempting to cross a busy street. The light was against me, so I had to wait on a curb. There was something pressing me as though I had to hurry and get across for fear I wouldn't be able to make it across. I was in a hurry to get someplace, but I awoke before I found out my destination."
"0481"	"In my dream I first saw a group of girls standing in front of a school building. One of the girls I recognized as a high school and church friend. She was laughing and singing along with the other girls who were all standing in a circle. The group of girls stood there for a few minutes and then ran away from the building. I then entered a room in which sat my mother, sister, and her little boy. The little boy wanted to sit in a funny little round chair that was very dirty. I went over to a serving basket and removed a cloth with which to dust the chair. In the meantime the baby had gotten hold of a pair of scissors and was cutting something. I took the scissors from him."
"0482"	"I was sitting in a room surrounded by many people. Everyone seemed very excited and were all talking rapidly among each other. I was apparently surprised to see some of the people there. A man was there by the door, but he didn't say anything and didn't stay very long. I recognized many of the people as close relatives to me and my family."
"0483"	"As I first remember the dream, I was upstairs in a room with my sister-in-law who is a nurse. I was mixing some blue chemicals. We were talking happily. Next I was out in another room with my girlfriend from school. A teacher whom I can't recall was lining all the girls (many of whom I recognized and spoke with) in a straight line to have their tonsils out. I stood in the line at first and then finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend. We went downstairs and there in a little room off to one side was a group of fellows singing and laughing. We stopped and talked to a few and then we left."
"0484"	"I was at a summer resort. As I was going down the stairs into the beach, I saw on one part of this beach huge cockroaches. I hurriedly ran past them and safely went into the water. There were many others in the water with me and the shore I saw a little dark-haired boy playing in the sand. To the left of me by the water was a public beach and many were swimming there in the water. Later I went into the house where everyone was eating. A lady and her little baby were sitting by me. I noticed that there were little bugs around the table. Everyone seemed very happy. "
"0485"	"I was at a factory working. I saw a college girlfriend of mine. I went out to lunch and while outside, it started to rain very hard. I returned to the factory early from my lunch and asked my girlfriend if she would lend me her headscarf. She said yes and after putting it on, I went outside again."
"0486"	"In this dream I was downtown in Cleveland. I had just decided on a new dress and was about to charge it when I realized I had lost the charge plate. I told my parents when I got home and my father immediately called the store to cancel all charges. It was too late, however, as someone had found the plate and charged over $100 in merchandise. My father was furious and said I had to earn the $100 and pay him back this summer. I felt he was unfair because anyone might have lost a plate. I woke in the midst of quarreling with everyone."
"0487"	"As I walked in the dorm, I picked up my mail that was lying on the mail table. Mother always writes on blue stationery, so I picked up the blue letter and proceeded to read it. It turned out to be for another girl in my dorm. The contents were so engrossing that I continued to read it after I knew full well that it wasn't my mail. It disclosed the fact that her older sister was going to have an illegitimate child. I felt so ashamed that I decided to pretend the letter never came. However, my conscience got the best of me and I gave her the letter. She flew into a rage and chased me around the house. I pushed the bed in front of my room door and awoke all worn out from running so."
"0488"	"The feeling I experienced when I woke the other morning was one of depression and fear. I traced this feeling to my dream of the previous night. In the dream I suddenly found myself on the front porch of the dormitory I live in. X, with whom I am in love and date steadily, was standing at the foot of the porch steps and asked me out of a clear sky for his identification bracelet. He said he was in love with someone he had just met and that is all there was to it. This shocked me immensely and I begged and pleaded with him, but he would not listen. I ran into the house and brought out the bracelet, then very ceremoniously I fastened it on his wrist. He left without a word and the next thing I knew, I saw him in Mill Creek Park in Youngstown, Ohio, with this girl. A horrid feeling of lonesomeness, longing, and envy came over me. I burst into tears and began to run. I ran and ran for ages it seemed, then I woke to find this lost, depressed feeling still prevalent. It lasted through the day until I saw X again and told him about the dream."
"0489"	"In this dream I was visiting my fellow at his home. His small brother has a guinea pig, Buzz, which he keeps in a cardboard box beneath the kitchen sink. The wastepaper basket sits beside it. I was clearing off the dinner table and kept throwing papers, etc. in the wastebasket. After I had it piled high, I realized I had thrown everything in on top of Buzz instead of in the wastebasket. I hurriedly took out the papers and found Buzz half dead. I revived him by tossing him in the air. I then put him back in his box and proceeded to throw the papers in on top. I dug him out, revived him and did the same thing again."
"0490"	"This is one of the dreams I had last night. I found myself at home seeing for the first time the new house my parents bought. I understood it to be new, but it turned out to be a made-over model of my aunt's old farmhouse. I was disgusted with the whole thing, but I tried not to let my parents see it. I kept exclaiming how each thing was so nice and at the same time was trying to figure out in my mind how they could possibly like the atrocious thing. I remember the wall between the living room and dining room was nothing but a huge aquarium. The kitchen had absolutely none of the latest conveniences, including no linoleum. For some reason, I began to search for my old bicycle and was awakened at this point."
"0491"	"I dreamt that I was going to this banquet. Dad had it planned that this one fellow should introduce the program and make the toast. The fellow wore glasses and had dark hair. They gave us red wine and we had big red plums we were supposed to drop in the wine. Everyone started drinking their wine and the fellow still didn't get up to make the toast. Dad and mother were angry and nervous. I kept wondering why he didn't, yet it seemed as if it was the fault of the people serving us and not his. The wine was delicious and I wanted more, but I was afraid to take it. Then I was eating a cream cottage cheese salad with peaches on top. Still the toast wasn't made. There seemed to be confusion at our table and soon we were being served steak. Then I thought it was too late to make the toast."
"0492"	"I dreamt that I had to take a psychology test. If I missed the test, I would get a bad grade. I was over at Adelbert watching the fellows practice football. I had a little more studying to do and I couldn't make myself do it. When I looked at my watch, I was very late for my test. I ran all the way to the room where I was having the test. I only had a few minutes for the test. I could not stay over because I had lab in the afternoon. I was sure the test would be on something I didn't know. Sure enough, I was handed a piece of paper and then a piece of coal. It was reddish brown and I was supposed to tell what the reddish brown color on the outside was. I didn't have any idea of the answer."
"0493"	"I dreamt about the shoe store where I work every Saturday. When I started to look for a shoe for the customer I was waiting on, I couldn't find the shoe that I wanted. I became very angry because the stock was mixed up. Then suddenly the thing that was hindering me from finding the shoes was dresses in front of the shoe shelves. I was worried because the customer who was a lady seemed to be getting angry at me for taking so long to find her shoe. I went up to Dad who was the manager and complained about the condition of the stock. He told me where to find the shoe. Even then I couldn't get it. I hurriedly started sorting through pots and pans and all sorts of articles. I couldn't understand why they should be in a shoe store. I was very angry at my father for putting so much junk in a shoe store. I could hear the customer complaining about inefficiency."
"0494"	"It was Good Friday. I was in church with a young fellow who works in the same store that I do. We were supposed to make his girlfriend jealous. In front of me I noticed my girlfriend Mary. She said she was married. Her husband turned out to be a man much older than she was with a bald head showing through his thin hair. He also had a mustache. I was shocked she would marry such a person. I started to go up the aisle in order to kiss the cross. I noticed that I was carrying something in my hand. It was a bottle of cologne. The cologne was very yellow. When I came back, I saw my other girl friend. I looked for a fellow from school that I knew, but I couldn't find him. There was also a fellow that I had known two years ago. He was someone I had liked. I was supposed to go to a party he was giving after church. I felt how inappropriate a party was on Good Friday. I felt guilty that I should plan to go."
"0495"	"I dreamt that a fellow I know came to the house and we were supposed to go out. I didn't like him very well and I wasn't too glad to go out. When he came, I found out he was married to my cousin who was staying with us at the time. He was dating me in order that he could see her. They had kept their marriage a secret. My first reaction was that I was glad he married her instead of me. Then I was surprised and puzzled why my cousin would want to marry him. I didn't consider him a desirable husband. I had refused to go out with him and had even told her I didn't like him. Then I was riding in the car with them as they were going on their honeymoon. He held her hand and again I couldn't understand why she wanted to marry him. Then I was angry that they had used me in order to keep their purpose a secret."
"0496"	"I was living in a very poor section of town, of what town I do not know. I had to go away for some reason and it seemed as though someone went with me, but I don't remember who it was. When I came back again after about a year, everyone was changed and I was very sad because of this. The next part that I remember was in a bathroom. It was quite large and had a very large bathtub. Two girls were drawing water for a bath. One of the girls was a friend of mine who lives in the same dorm I do. She had her towel around her just as she always does before taking a bath. She was very excited because she was going to take a bath in such a big tub."
"0497"	"I had a date with the boy to whom I am pinned. We were with two other couples which were unfamiliar to me. We were swimming in a very large pool which was open at one end. At this end the water was coming in. The water was very muddy like river water. The next thing I knew we were on our way back to the dormitory and I was two hours late. I was very worried because I knew I would be campused for the rest of the year."
"0498"	"I had a date with a boy that I used to date about a year and a half ago. I did not want to be with him because I was afraid the boy I am pinned to would see me. We were driving along the road on the way to a dance. When we finally arrived, a girl whom this boy had been dating recently was standing outside waiting for him. I was very relieved. We did not go into the dance, but got back into the car again. The other girl sat in the middle. I was impressed by the weird atmosphere. It was very windy and misty."
"0499"	"I was sitting in the bathtub in the dormitory. A girlfriend of mine from home came in and we were talking. I asked her about another friend from home. The friend told me the other girl was not pinned any more. I was very surprised. Just then the other girl came in and she had just washed her hair and it was quite wet."
"0500"	"I was in a very exclusive jewelry shop looking for a watch and an engagement ring. The jewelry looked very cheap and I did not like it. Nevertheless, I bought the watch and picked out the ring I wanted. The ring was quite different from what I really wanted. The boy who was buying it for me came in and asked me why I picked one I didn't like. I didn't know. Then suddenly I was standing with my father waiting for a streetcar. He was carrying the watch and I was carrying the ring."
