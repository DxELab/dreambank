    "description": "Chuck is a young Ph.D. researcher in one of the highly developed physical sciences.  It might not be expected that such a person would keep a dream journal over the space of several years, but it just goes to show there is no predicting interest in dreams.  He sent us the first 75 dreams in the series and we coded them with the Hall/Van de Castle system.  But we know nothing about him except what comes through in the dreams."
