    "description": "Jeff is a 17-year-old high school senior who contacted us after he had kept a dream journal for several months. It is the longest series we have from a person that age or younger. It is also of interest because sometimes Jeff has lucid dreams. (We have no other series where lucid dreams are a prominent feature.)"
