    "description": "Ringo was 24 years old when he wrote down these 16 dreams in the fall of 1964, when he was taking part in a research project.  He was a junior in college and lived at home with his parents and three younger brothers (ages 21, 19, and 17). He played drums in a band, hence the pseudonym \"Ringo.\"  Note that at least three themes or activities appear more than once, suggesting the consistency of his dreams in a mere 26 days."
