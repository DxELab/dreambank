"0076"	"(2004-01-26 (13)) Ezra and I were in the water. The only way to get out was to get over this platform, under which an octopus/squid lived under. We kept trying to get on the platform, but the squid thing kept coming out. It grabbed me and pulled me under and I couldn't breathe. I got up onto the platform and the squid thing bit me on the right side of my hip. I jumped up and got fully out of the water. [When I woke up, it hurt where it had bit me] ."
"0077"	"(2004-01-26 (13)) I was at a park near the school with Ramona and Tiana. It was raining. We were on the swings, and then we were running from something. We ended up at this freaky castle thing that was in the clouds. I saved lots of people but I don't remember how."
"0078"	"(2004-02-11 (13)) I was at a strange haunted house. I went in there, why I don't know. A few people, who were all friends, had died. The rooms would change around. I went into this room with some others, which was a mirror maze, but you couldn't get back through the door. We all held hands as it kept getting darker. I got to the end and went through door into this waiting room. A friend of mine, called Suzanne stayed with this old man. I left that room. I went in a room with a chocolate cat person. It changed into a fluffy cat. I threw it into a light and it burnt up and hissed and died and went green. I went into another room and died. I was then a ghost. Ariana could see me, but said I was blurry. I helped Dad to find a friend of mine."

He came to our house. He and Ezra went into my room to find my diary. I shooed them out. I got my diary and went to the games room to put it in my safe. Ezra started talking to me and I put it down and Julius was behind me and I thought that he had read it. He took it but then put it down and I was bashing Ezra asking if he read it."
"0081"	"(2004-02-16 (13)) I was on this big hill thing during Phys Ed. A little pit bull chased me down it. While we were in the Phys Ed room, Julius was in there watching me. I dreamt I was talking to someone then Julius looked passed me to a girl (who was me) and a guy talking. Then I thought he had read my diary so he could make me jealous of who I liked except that it was him."
"0082"	"(2004-02-20 (13)) Julius lived where [Co-Worker-M-02 and Acquaintance-M-06 live] . He came over one day and that night Mom came over and we went under a tent with Ezra.

I went to this toilet cubicle that was in the kitchen after being chased by an evil clown. I was on the toilet and Teacher-M-03 sat down on chair at table. I recognized him but couldn't remember who he was. He had his legs folded and his hands were clasped on top, and he had this big grin on his face. I said ""Who the hell are you?"" and he said ""I'm Teacher-M-03"" and as he bent down to his suitcase I ran out of the toilet screaming. Then he turned into an evil clown."

"0092"	"(2004-05-13 (13)) Ezra and I kept going to this water park thing. We had gone there with Jayson, and Julius had gone there too. We were having races and people from school kept turning up, which was annoying."
"0093"	"(2004-05-14 (13)) I was at school which was really different. I went into the boys toilets by mistake. There were lots of photos outside. We got our school photos back, but it didn't have Julius and I got angry."

"0095"	"(2004-05-21 (13)) Ezra and Mom died but I didn't know. They were at home, but Mom was acting weird and she said she was going to feed the cats, so I followed her, but she was out the back and the door was still locked. This guy took me to the ""dead place"" and told me to go somewhere, but I realized they were going to kill me and so I ran back.

"0104"	"(2004-06-20 (13)) I was at some freaky place. I had two puppies called Chico and Widget and they were the same size. Some crazy stuff happened. I took Mom's car, but it was a manual, so I took the auto. I drove out to this place and got in and it was like a jail. I got Eli (Children of the Corn 3) and we went back, but the cops were chasing us."
"0105"	"(2004-06-22 (13)) I was at a private school. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) was there too. I wasn't sure if we were friends but we had to get out and I went to find him.

We all got in a car and drove to a salvage place, where Ezra brown-eyed some people. A nuclear power plant thing exploded. We had to get away from the air/smoke. I ended up at Kingsway shops (except it wasn't). There was a McDonald's inside. This Native girl and her friend were putting their face on this machine and stuff happened -- they turned French, blind etc. I was getting people and Widget into McDonald's. We shut these glass gate things just in time. Stuart (QAF) was there. There were about 8 or 10 people. I saw a tunnel and said that some people had to go through in suits and close the big shop glass doors and suck the air out. Some guy asked why I was the boss. Three people, including Stuart, said they would do it. We went through the tunnel and a big auditorium thing was there. We kept going and they went out and shut it. Then we were all inside the big shop again. The air started to clear up, so we went outside and saw some animals, and we let them in, but the air started coming back, so we shut the doors, but Stuart and someone were still outside. I ran through the tunnel and saw Stuart feeding this cat. I started banging on the window, and he looked up at me and he finished and ran to the door. I was going back and he caught me in the auditorium. We walked back. Later I saw an orange cat, the air was clearing and so we let the cat in. The air started coming back. Stuart was yelling at me to get back inside. I got back and had to lock the door. Stuart wasn't in sight. I found the keys and locked it. I went to find Stuart. He was in a bedroom."

The guy went into the back and the girl went to get in, but zombies (Dawn of the Dead remake like) got her. I drove off. I got out of the car, and the guy died. Some girl helped me into a big dark underground thing. She told us to stand, then didn't let others stand because zombies were watching. We all got up and went up this slide. She left and told us to stay there. The others wanted to go but I made them stay. She got back and we ran outside towards the sea. We swam and a zombie bloke came after us. We drowned him and got on a boat. [note: I referred to the zombies as 'DOTD ppl' LOL] ."

There was a little house nearby. I went there and there was a big, fancy girl room. I went into the closet where there were lots of dresses and Goosebumps books.

A while later, Ezra and I were in the lounge room. These bad guys that had held up Captain Spaulding (House of 1000 Corpses) walked in and asked where Mom's pickup was. We said ""Out the back"" and he walked back out the front and said ""I'll be back in a sec"". So I closed and locked the doors. A few minutes later they left and we went into the office. They had taken my monitor, which was worth $2000. We ended up in Cash Converters at Northlands and they were there. They drove off and we went in and found out that they had hocked it for $500.

So I went to leave, but I punched her (not slow!) and went to this beach type place near some water that was rumoured to be home to an evil fish. I sat down at the edge and this wave came and I fell under. I got to the middle of the water and then ended up at the other side. Chris caught up with me and tried to get me to come back because it was dangerous and he said he loved me. Then this rope landed on my foot. I grabbed it and I was pulled under water and I saw the evil fish and I managed to get to the first bit of water but some rope got around my foot and the fish tried to get me. Chris was pulling me up and I finally got up (after Chris had been pushed away). Then I went over to him and we had this nice romantic kiss and then the Christine girl came and saw and decided to give up. I'm not sure what happened but we ended up at this place in the olden days. Widget was there and was all evil and hissy. I met this girl who believed that I was from ""my time"". She gave me a note one day and told me to read it that night. But for some strange reason I didn't and something happened and she got in trouble and the note went missing. I can't remember much more, but I ended up at school and the teacher told me I had been away for a week and Cedric was in the class and said his real name was James."

"0153"	"(2004-09-16 (13)) I was at this house and there was this lady who always died at the same time everyday.

We all went and sat down at a table and there was a special day coming up and I was going to take Neil there because, actually I don't know, but he said ""Oh, you can't take me because you're getting married to Nigel"" and really quickly I was like ""We're not getting married"". Then I realized I was in love with Neil."

The other guy (call him Joe) started fighting him and they both had some cool moves. Joe won and I picked him up and kissed him, saying he was the man (all friendly stuff) for beating John Travolta. The next two ""Gods"" were a face of a lady in a square box (who Ezra talked to and that's what you had to do, because she was lonely and then she left) and the last one was the ""oracle"" (who was a face of a lady too). But when Ezra got there, we told him the whole thing was a joke. Then we were at some creepy China town place. They had little animals, and one tried to escape. I cuddled some cute animal.

"0231"	"(2005-01-06 (13)) Ezra and Jayson read my diary. I found out because they kept taking my stuff and they took two pictures of Timothy Olyphant from my diary and then they showed me them by giving me a bag full of stuff they had taken. I was really annoyed but they didn't say anything about it, they just smiled evilly. Then they wanted a million dollars off Peter Gallagher. I had his email and told him and then I had to go with Mom, Ezra and Jayson to somewhere. Also, it was the last day of school in Year 7 and Mr Macklin gave out all our work and I didn't bring it home, but Mom and had gone and got it."
"0232"	"(2005-01-07 (13)) I was at some new town and there was a boy and a girl who were special. They met after a while, but at first the girl and her mother were chased out of their house. Also, I knew them. The boy had a spaceship thing. Then we were looking at a school for me. We found the only school in town and it was munted. But I went there anyway. At lunchtime some lady shot herself. It had happened there before. There were Christmas decorations up and there was a sleigh in front of one house which two girls and I got into. It flew in the air. Then it crashed."
"0233"	"(2005-01-08 (13)) I was at a shop and Porky was in the back of the car with a water bottle in a container. I can't remember what happened in the shop, but Ezra and I had to run back to the car to hide. We were also at a pet shop and I had Porky with me and we were also at a ferret place."
"0234"	"(2005-01-10 (13)) There was a girl or maybe two (I think it was two) that lived with her/their grandparents. The grandparents were hell evil and mean. Anyway the girl/s ran away one night to this pool place. There was this maniac guy there and I was there as well and he started killing people. People kept falling into the pool."
"0235"	"(2005-01-11 (13)) This guy ran across a road to the other side which was all forest-y. This girl was there and anyway he started bouncing through the forests but like that game where you throw balls [I don't know what the hell I'm talking about here, and I have a diagram but I don't understand it] . The girl chased after him and when they stopped she jumped into his arms and it turned out they were cousins. He also did some bouncy stuff in a shop. I was in a cinema type thing and there was a movie of me and my friends of short clips of things we had done, but there were extra things on it each time we watched it."
"0236"	"(2005-01-12 (13)) It was the future, except we were all the same age as we are now. We, being Dad, Ezra and I, were at some person's house and when we left some guy had a gun and Dad did something and he got to our car which was really cool and small. Ezra ran down the steps and the guy shot and Ezra and Dad said ""FBI! Freeze!"" and shot the guy. We all hurried into the car. Then this other person was having a party and all these famous people showed up. There was this girl (a celebrity) who got romantically involved with this stupid guy. Her ex (another celebrity) was angry and got evil. Then, or before that, we were at home. An old friend of mine except I didn't really know her was there. We went out to get something from this place out in nowhere. There was this evil lady who nobody liked. Something happened and we ended up surrounded by clouds. This evil bloke sent us all back except for the mean lady who had to stay there for eternity."
"0237"	"(2005-01-13 (13)) I was at a haunted house with some people for some TV show. Mickey (Scream 2) was there. I ended up in a room with poison gas with another girl except I got out and then this dog chased me and I got in the house from another door. Then the dog took some clothes and we were told it was part of the show. But I hadn't brought any clothes. Jillian was there and some fat women. I borrowed clothes off Jillian to wear and some from a fat girl. Jillian said something about me stretching her clothes. Also this lady said to the girls something about wearing a bra and I said I wasn't because I forgot and don't want the responsibility. When I got the clothes off the girls I went into the toilet and so did the fat girl. I got changed and when I came out, Mickey was outside the cubicle covered in the fat girl's blood. Something also happened at Nana's but I don't remember."
"0238"	"(2005-01-16 (13)) There were these colourful mushroom houses. We went to a movie shop and got movies, they had Jackass: The Movie commentary and South Park commentary? Someone died as well."
"0239"	"(2005-01-17 (13)) I was at a two storey house which was my home, I think. Some noob was trying to kill me and some other people and he threw a bomb up onto the balcony. We threw it next door because no-one lived there. Some people from Jackass were there. There were these invisible buildings which you could walk through that sent off signals to the bomb and stuff. There was this train and it almost hit someone but the signal stopped it. I was then at a toy grabbing machine. I wanted a toy they had of me and I had got a toy, some time before, of Dad. There was more to the story, but I don't remember."
"0240"	"(2005-01-22 (13)) I was at some jail. I let Sark (Alias) out and this other prisoner guy go. The other prisoner fell down and couldn't get up and Sark got caught, I think."
"0241"	"(2005-01-22 (13)) Ezra had this thing which would make peoples legs go out to the side and their heart would burst. It didn't affect him though and I didn't want it to affect me. So I backed away, but Ezra followed saying it would only affect people far away and then I argued that people over the other side of the world weren't getting affected. I didn't get a reply though."
"0242"	"(2005-01-24 (13)) I was at a shop and I had Mom and Porky with me. Everyone thought Porky was cute, except for one noob. We were driving around in these gold cart things. Mom went up to some big fancy house that no-one lived in to meet ""a friend"". And people from school were at a shop/school place."
