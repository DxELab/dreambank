There were big spiders around us. When we reached the place, I saw a red building in the distance which I knew to be for female patients. It was like a building that I have seen frequently in previous dreams. I was employed at a modern printing plant. I worked with some women.

I was wishing he had taken me with him, but I guessed that it was against the rules anyway. Later I was among a crowd, and an attractive blond had fallen and hurt her ankle. Her back was to me and her dress was up above her knees as she sat on the walk. When she saw me, she came up to me and begged me to do something.

"512"	"(03/02/65)"	"There was a tall square house about 50 by 80 feet. Hot water running under the house was causing steam to fill the rooms. Someone said they were going to dry up the steam. I went inside to see how it looked in there. Someone else was there."
"513"	"(03/03/65)"	"I was in a building where a wooden floor was being repaired. One floor in another room acted strangely. It would tip down and then raise into an odd position."
"514"	"(03/04/65)"	"I was on a pass from an institution. As I walked down some stairs, the thought occurred to me that since it was wrong for me to get pleasure from seducing children, why was it all right for chess players to get intellectual pleasure from playing chess? Both seem to be a waste of organic as well as mental energy. I recalled C. G. Jung, who said mental illness is caused by the failure of the mental energy, or libido, to meet a certain situation. I reasoned further that this energy could not cope because it was too weak. And for that reason, it should not be weakened by seducing children or playing chess, but should be conserved so that it will be able to meet certain situations."
"515"	"(03/05/65)"	"I was standing in line to take a steam bath in a cabinet. I was the only man there. The rest were women. My sister was the last in line. Two women came out clad only in panties. I wished they had been nude so I could see their organs. I began to undress."
"516"	"(03/06/65)"	"There was a street with pock marks. Later I saw that it was paved with white blocks."
"517"	"(03/07/65)"	"I was shopping with my mother. I left her and came to a narrow street. There was a lady in a hole about 4 feet below the sidewalk. I jumped down there. Women were doing erotic dances. Men were there too. They invited me to stay, but I left. Later I was in a store with a lunch counter. (When I awoke, I did not at first recall the dream. I only recalled two squares above a straight line. When later I recalled the dream, I guessed that the two squares represented the room with the dancers and the store, and the straight line represented the street at the start of the dream.)"
"518"	"(03/08/65)"	"I was on a street. There was a national crisis. A truck was on a government mission. Something was being said over the loud speaker above the truck. The speaker was saying something about an emergency. I came to a highway."
"519"	"(03/09/65)"	"I was doing some paper work."
"520"	"(03/10/65)"	"I was in a hospital."
"521"	"(03/11/65)"	"A woman was on a cliff edge 50 feet high. She jumped, and I was afraid she'd get hurt, but she landed on a ledge a few feet below. I mused how I did not know consciously what she was going to do (jump onto the ledge or jump the 50 feet), but I knew subconsciously."
"522"	"(03/12/65)"	"There were giants pushing me and some other people."
"523"	"(03/13/65)"	"I was aboard a small airplane. Later I was on a pass from a hospital with my mother."
"524"	"(03/14/65)"	"A man approached me and said that he liked my body. Later my shoes were missing."
"525"	"(03/15/65)"	"I was eating at a lunch counter with my mother. She complained to the waiter about something. He said that she sounds like she is mentally ill."
"526"	"(03/16/65)"	"I was taken for an operation, but I was not told what kind it would be. After the operation, I was told it was an appendix operation."
"527"	"(03/17/65)"	"I was released from a hospital."
"528"	"(03/18/65)"	"There was a flower growing in a pot of water. I poured some water into it, but I discovered that it was soapy water. A woman was angry at me for pouring soapy water in the pot."
"529"	"(03/19/65)"	"I was living in a room, but the landlady didn't like me, so I moved out. Later I was watching a play in a theater with my mother and sister. After the intermission, hardly anyone returned to the bleachers."
"530"	"(03/20/65)"	"I was in an alley. Large cans were there."
"531"	"(03/21/65)"	"I was in a cafeteria. The food had improved."
"532"	"(03/22/65)"	"I climbed into the attic of a big house through a window. I wanted to get something. My mother and sister were in a room downstairs. My sister was upset because I went into the attic."
"533"	"(03/23/65)"	"I had two consecutive dreams in which I was defecating. In the first a woman saw me and I felt embarrassed."
"534"	"(03/23/65)"	"A man saw me and I was embarrassed again. In both dreams the feces was like a hard ball."
"535"	"(03/24/65)"	"I was beginning a trip when I recalled that I'd forgotten to do something, so I went back and did it."
"536"	"(03/25/65)"	"I wanted to go swimming. I went through an entrance, but I did not get an opportunity to swim."
"537"	"(03/26/65)"	"There was a gold plated stand near me with gold plated medals and crepe and other things. I wondered who had given it to me. My mother came, but she did not answer me when I asked her if she had given it to me. She seemed to be very depressed. She went back outside. I did not know what to do with the stand."
"538"	"(03/27/65)"	"I wanted to get to an underground place. I had to sink through a noxious smelling fluid to get there. The openings were about 2 feet square. Someone else was sinking through a nearby opening."
"539"	"(03/28/65)"	"There was a doorway leading to a door upstairs. Later I wanted to go up there, but the stairs had been replaced by new stairs that did not reach the door."
"540"	"(03/29/65)"	"I was on a street after dark. I passed movie theaters. Famous stars were playing at a theater I passed, but I did not enter. Instead I went across the street where I met my sister, and we sat down together."
"541"	"(03/30/65)"	"I was in a strange place. My aunt who is a nun (Sister Mary Jacqueline) appeared in the dream. I hardly recognized her, because her skin was so old-looking and stiff. After I left her, I had an agonizing feeling as I thought of myself getting old and looking like that."
"542"	"(03/31/65)"	"There was a building, and a swimming pool in the courtyard. Flowers were growing."
"543"	"(04/01/65)"	"I was looking for a new way to go to where I worked. I took a bus. I had to get off and transfer to another bus. When I got off the bus to transfer, strange buildings were all around. I went to a restroom to urinate. A woman who looked familiar told me. I was in the wrong restroom. I hurried to catch my bus. It was gone, so I decided to walk. I knew I was late."
"544"	"(04/02/65)"	"I met a slender, dark-haired woman about 20. She said she liked me and asked me to go to bed with her."
"545"	"(04/03/65)"	"Camels were being trained. There was a beam of light, and they had to stoop down about 2 feet to pass below it."
"546"	"(04/03/65)"	"I was defecating an extremely large amount. It was long."
"547"	"(04/04/65)"	"I was applying for work at a printing plant. I told the man of my experience."
"548"	"(04/04/65)"	"I was arrested. I was carrying two guns."
"549"	"(04/05/65)"	"I climbed over a fence to get away from an institution. Several people outside the fence saw me, and I feared that they would tell on me. A little later I sat down, and a Chinese boy about 6 came and covered me with a blanket. I defecated under the blanket so he wouldn't see me. Then I looked for a way to get away from the institution. I looked for the railroad tracks."
"550"	"(04/06/65)"	"I was working on a printing press. I was having trouble. A woman was there."
"551"	"(04/07/65)"	"I was in a hospital. Some male patients walked past some female patients, and the women opened their dresses as they walked by."
"552"	"(04/08/65)"	"I saw a rock about 2 inches in a diameter move. Then I saw a large spider under the rock, about an inch long. Later I saw some animals."
"553"	"(04/09/65)"	"I was looking up girls' dresses to see their thighs. A little girl was nearby, and I started to go to her, but a nun was standing next to her, so I didn't go."
"554"	"(04/10/65)"	"I was near a swimming pool. Later I was in a hospital, and I rode up an elevator. I came to a door that led outside and I inhaled the air and thought how wonderful it would be to be free again. But I did not go outside."
"555"	"(04/11/65)"	"I was walking past some private homes."
"556"	"(04/12/65)"	"I saw some animals. I left them and went up a street. Long cables were strung across the street. Buildings about 20 stories were on either side. But they all seemed to be slanting forward at the top. It looked as though there had been an earthquake, except that it looked unreal because all the buildings slanted the same way as though they had been built that way, and everything on the street below looked normal. There was no damage anywhere. Later I was told that the buildings were going to be razed. A man told me not to pick up some nearby stones, because they were copper. A woman came and told me the man had said she as 15/10 (sic) which he said is a good height."
"557"	"(04/13/65)"	"I was in an amusement park. The pool was empty. I did not have subway fare, so I walked."
"558"	"(04/14/65)"	"I was walking on a street, and I saw a woman who knew me when I had gotten into trouble with the police. I ducked out of sight. The block I was on was the one where I had been arrested."
"559"	"(04/15/65)"	"A patient named Young -- from a former ward -- appeared in this dream. He put his hand on my buttocks, and I said, ""No, don't do that."" A little later he was sitting alone looking very depressed. Then a young patient came (this dream took place in a hospital), and he became violent, and the officers treated him by poking 3 holes on each side of his head just behind the ears, and one behind the other. They used their fingernails to make the holes."
"560"	"(04/16/65)"	"I was in a narrow building. There was a mix-up about some letters. I was waiting for a letter from my aunt, who is a nun, to clear up the matter."
"561"	"(04/17/65)"	"I was sleeping in a dormitory with two patients in beds next to me. A patient holding a knife came and said he saw them having a sex affair. He attacked them saying they'd ""get this, now."" The patient with the knife resembled a patient on a former ward whom I had seen having sex affairs with other patients. His name is Carpenter.)"
"562"	"(04/17/65)"	"I'd just had an experience in an airplane, and I was telling an officer on a former ward (Mr. Thom) about it."
"563"	"(04/18/65)"	"A patient resembling a new patient on the ward appeared in this dream, and hugged me from behind. I had an erotic sensation when I felt his organ against my body. He has red hair."
"564"	"(04/18/65)"	"I was working on washing machines. I had to get a bundle of clothing to a place at a certain time. Later I was riding on a street car. When I noticed a strange street, I realized I was on the wrong street car. I went under a street car track that was elevated and I asked a lady selling cupcakes the price of them, but they were too expensive, so I turned to leave. But I was caught between the counter and the rail. I finally freed myself. I wondered how many people could fit in there."
"565"	"(04/18/65)"	"I was in a building with a high ceiling. There were plants growing along the wall on the floor. I started to put a plant where it would thrive better, but someone called me and I forgot where I had put the plant. I searched hurriedly for it."
"566"	"(04/19/65)"	"There was a small river. An old man went fishing there. When he returned, he said the water there tasted bitter. I had assigned a businessman to the job of checking the water. Later I was reminded of another man I had assigned. Shortly after that I was in a chapel, and two men started arguing and a riot began."
"567"	"(04/19/65)"	"I was a patient working on printing presses in a laundry. I wanted to work in the composing room, but I was not sure of my ability. A young boy was assigned to help me in the composing room. Later I heard that all the patients there would be transferred because we were able to see each other now. She seemed sad about it. My mother came and said she was going to a town upstate and would be back with the good news. I hoped the news was about my transfer to a Veterans Hospital. While I was working in the shop, I was wearing a hospital gown."
"568"	"(04/20/65)"	"A man wanted some other man to be his friend."
"569"	"(04/21/65)"	"I was among some girls about 10 years old. I was tempted to touch them sexually. A plastic balloon shaped like a crotch was by me, and I felt it. I was dismayed because I had been tempted. I wanted to convince the doctors at the hospital where I was confined that I could control myself if they released me. I said to a doctor, ""Is that why you won't let me go?"" I pondered deeply on how I could rechannel my mental energy toward creative endeavors."
"570"	"(04/22/65)"	"I was memorizing a musical movement. Later I was in a bed with a bed nearby that had a patient in it named Young."
"571"	"(04/23/65)"	"I watched some movies about the Orient. I was in a case and I felt awkward."
"572"	"(04/24/65)"	"My mother, sister and I bought a house and went there to live."
"573"	"(04/25/65)"	"I was with my mother. We had decided to change lawyers, and were going to see the new lawyer for the first time. We were walking toward the lawyer when I awoke."
"574"	"(04/26/65)"	"I was making a speech. It was longer than I had thought. A patient named McHale was there."
"575"	"(04/26/65)"	"A fox was being harassed by another animal, but it was all right after the ordeal."
"576"	"(04/27/65)"	"My sister and I hurried to catch a bus. My sister missed it. I saw her following the bus. Her dress was open in the center, exposing her body. She had a penis protruding from her sex organ."
"577"	"(04/28/65)"	"I was walking through a strange mental hospital. The jail wards for violent patients were old-fashioned. The semi-violent wards were more modern, and the others were most modern."
"578"	"(04/29/65)"	"I was on a hospital porch with a nurse. I asked her something and she answered yes. As her lips parted, our lips were drawn together uncontrollably, and we kissed. After the kiss, she was upset because we had just met, but she was not angry at me. She was worried whether someone had seen us."
"579"	"(05/01/65)"	"My mother and I were looking at a garage with a high gable. Then she and my sister went to a resort with a lake surrounding it. I did not go because I had been there before. After they had left, I wished I had gone with them."
"580"	"(05/01/65)"	"I was home from the hospital after a long time. My mother and sister had changed the landscaping and everything was strange to me. There were ground elevations in the back yard. They rose like steps. There were four of them. I was undecided whether or not I liked them."
"581"	"(05/02/65)"	"I was walking on a narrow street. A car was showing me the way, but I lost it. I had to walk through a narrow alley."
"582"	"(05/02/65)"	"I was in a strange place with strange machinery on the shelves. A man was cutting something on a power-driven paper cutter. The ceiling was about 30 feet high. A young man was trying to stop a large pipe on the ceiling from dripping. When it stopped, another pipe began leaking."
"583"	"(05/03/65)"	"I was involved in a crisis in a small country."
"584"	"(05/03/65)"	"I was working in a printing plant with a patient named Rivers."
"585"	"(05/04/65)"	"My mother drove me outside the hospital where I was confined. My sister was with us. I said we'd better not go far. Later I was standing alone on a street with no houses, and I saw our car down the street."
"586"	"(05/04/65)"	"I was with my mother in a cavern. It had been flooded by an underground stream. There was a plant about 10 feet long across some water, but I was afraid to cross it. There was a light, but I could not see a source. Later, I was walking through a muddy passage with a patient named Fugal. He found some fruit in the mud. I suggested that he wash it so he could eat it."
"587"	"(05/04/65)"	"My mother and sister were with me in a tunnel. There was a column about 10 feet high which did not quite touch the ceiling. It was moving toward us. (I observed later upon reading these three dreams, the similarity between the car in the street, the plank in the cavern, and the column in the tunnel.) I had a last dream, vaguely recalled, in which I seem to have had a thought that I would make a magnificent woman, and then seeing myself clearly as a slender, but masculine man and repudiating my first concept of myself."
"588"	"(05/05/65)"	"I was involved in something legal. I was among court authorities. Later I was walking outside of court buildings."
"589"	"(05/06/65)"	"I was trying to get down a cliff overlooking railroad tracks. A man resembling an employee in the hospital shop where I have been working sent an elevator lift to help me down. Later I was walking on the tracks, and feces kept coming out of my mouth. I couldn't stop it, and I was afraid I would have to choke before it would stop. The feces seemed to symbolize the indictment held against me for the crime I committed. It seemed to be telling me that the only way I'd get the indictment disposed of and vindicate myself would be to do something drastic like choking. (I had been hoping the indictment would be dropped so I would not have to go to court when I left the hospital, but I'm certain now that I will have to go to court for conviction and sentencing.) Later in the dream I came to where the tracks were fenced in so closely that should a train come, there would be no place to stand. I saw a train coming, and I hurried to find a part of the fence low enough for me to scale it."
"590"	"(05/06/65)"	"A man in a nearby bed was rubbing himself loudly."
"591"	"(05/07/65)"	"I dreamt about chess strategy."
"592"	"(05/07/65)"	"I had a dream in which a woman with an attractive shape was struggling. Some man subdued her. I saw a rifle protruding from between her legs. When I looked again, I saw three rifles there. The muzzles were facing inward."
"593"	"(05/08/65)"	"I was in a boys' reformatory. Two boys were sneaking over the fence to get away."
"594"	"(05/08/65)"	"I was trying to repair a platform, but it kept falling again. My mother was there. A pot fell, and I caught it, but it crumbled in my hands. Later I passed a bathroom where a woman was bathing a child about 12. Then I passed a bathroom with a drinking fountain next to a vanity type sink. I wondered what was in there."
"595"	"(05/10/65)"	"I was getting dressed to go swimming in a pool. I walked past some women with my shirt off, and someone scolded me for doing so. I apologized."
"596"	"(05/11/65)"	"I was operating a large piece of machinery. A piece swung loose, and I had to adjust something. A woman standing nearby was frightened when it happened."
"597"	"(05/12/65)"	"I was passing some stores. I stopped in front of a small shop. A dark-haired woman who looked like a gypsy eyed me suspiciously."
"598"	"(05/13/65)"	"A witch was holding people prisoner in a tower-shaped building. I was with some other people, and the witch was trying to capture us. We fled down some stairs to get away from her."
"599"	"(05/13/65)"	"In a later dream I was sliding down a pole between. Everything was unreal. I saw a human face with eyes that looked like cracked skin staring at me."
"600"	"(05/14/65)"	"I was repairing a printing press that had a piece dangling."
"601"	"(05/14/65)"	"I passed a room where a woman was powdering the faces of some teenage girls. A boy was having his face powdered too."
"602"	"(05/14/65)"	"I had a rubber doll about 3 inches long and I was trying to fix it so that it would excrete liquid. My mother came, and I hid the doll to avoid embarrassment. When I had changed clothing, I returned for the doll, but I could not find it."
"603"	"(05/14/65)"	"I was selecting a book in a library. My list was confusing, and the attendant became impatient with me."
"604"	"(05/15/65)"	"A girl about 8 was nearby. Her voice was familiar. It had a stern tone. (Her voice reminded me, after I awoke, of the voice of the girl whose parents had me arrested which resulted in the indictment held against me now.) I was lying down, and she was standing next to me. She told me that she had to put on a certain set of clothing, and she let me dress her."
"605"	"(05/18/65)"	"I was walking near an amusement park with a patient on the ward, and I was telling him that the lights outside the stores and theaters in my hometown look more orderly than those in Brooklyn. We passed a woman whose car had a flat tire, and we offered to help her change it."
"606"	"(05/19/65)"	"I was a patient and was not allowed off the grounds. I wanted to go to town for some reason and so I left the grounds without permission."
"607"	"(05/19/65)"	"I was studying the washing cycle in a laundry."
"608"	"(05/20/65)"	"I was in a car with my mother driving. The street was narrow, and I told her to watch that we don't hit the wall."
"609"	"(05/21/65)"	"I was getting juice from a food juicer. The juice was very strange."
"610"	"(05/22/65)"	"I had some kind of responsibility. Later I was in a wooden enclosure. Someone opened something and let cool air come in. Then I heard what sounded like excited chickens on the other side of one of the thin walls. I concluded that the air had excited them. Then the enclosure started to move like the trailer of a truck."
"611"	"(05/23/65)"	"I met a dark-haired woman about 25. I left her at her house. Later I was at a printing plant. A press was running and the type fell out of the form. I did not stop the press because I was carrying something, and I reasoned that the press would not be damaged if I let it run until I put the packages where they belonged. My mother came and asked me if I know where that woman whom I had accompanied earlier lived. After reflecting, I had a mental picture of the house, and I directed her to it."
"612"	"(05/24/65)"	"At first I was working in a laundry, and I was confused about something. Then I seemed to be at home using a washing machine. A little later I was confined in an institution. I was standing on a floor that felt like a bed spring, and looking through a hidden opening that led outside the institution. I tried to get through it to escape from the institution, but it was too narrow. I wanted to get out very badly, and with the force of my will I seemed to rush through the opening, leaving my body inside. I went rapidly down the street. I did not know whether or not the people I passed could see me. They behaved as though they did not. I felt elated at being free. I had the form of my body, but not the flesh. I passed some young girls and attractive women, and I was tempted, but I resisted. But I did not turn my gaze from them. I assured myself that if I had enough will power to get through that opening without my body, then I surely had enough will power to resist that temptation. (Yesterday I read from Nietzsche's works that a thunder storm symbolizes will power without the confusion of intellect. In the first part of this dream I was confused.)"
"613"	"(05/26/65)"	"I had run away from an institution, and the police were looking for me. I was startled when I saw an officer coming toward me, and I ran down a different street."
"614"	"(05/27/65)"	"I was walking with my mother. We passed a drug store and I wanted to see the inside, so I went around to a side entrance."
"615"	"(05/27/65)"	"I met a patient on the ward named Hogan. He said he was going to be transferred back to Ward E."
"616"	"(05/27/65)"	"I was sitting on a bench near a group of women. Some men were choosing a woman from the group to take out on a date. One of the men looked at me and said, ""What about the one over there with the partly bald head?"""
"617"	"(05/28/65)"	"I was trying to climb a steep hill to get to a certain street. I looked up and saw it in the distance. There was a railroad there."
"618"	"(05/29/65)"	"I met a young woman, and she questioned me about some best seller books to see what I knew. I knew about some of the books she mentioned. Later two young girls about ten were getting into a double bed in their room. They acted as though they were feeling erotic toward each other. They decided to lie head to foot. They got under the blanket and began to giggle. I don't recall getting into the bed, but I found myself there looking under the covers at them. As I watched, I had an emission, and they chided me for doing it."
"619"	"(05/30/65)"	"I had some responsibility. There were some people less educated than I in the room, and I was assigned to instruct them."
"620"	"(05/31/65)"	"I was in a small boat with my sister. There was a damn-like structure across the water, and the water level was lower on the other side of it. No one was allowed to go on the other side. Later I found myself on the other side alone."
"621"	"(06/01/65)"	"I was in Rome with a patient on the ward named Fugel. We were in a place with narrow halls. Fugel had something strange in his hands. He was saying, ""I'm doing as the Romans do."" Later a patient named Trout wanted me to buy an amusement park. He had a large amount of money to give me for the purchase. We were patients at a hospital, and I was being released. I suggested that he hire a lawyer to help him get released instead of buying an amusement park."
"622"	"(06/01/65)"	"I was in a building with the occupants' names and a sign below saying ""entrance."" I thought they should be in a different order."
"623"	"(06/02/65)"	"I was in a hospital. A patient, who is a patient on the ward named Young, was working outside. I was not allowed there, but I saw a doorway open, so I went out there."
"624"	"(06/02/65)"	"I was near some women and little girls. They were suspicious of me at first. One woman later became friendly. The women were dressing the girls to go somewhere."
"625"	"(06/03/65)"	"I went to a printing plant. I watched a printing press. The building had thick walls and a low ceiling."
"626"	"(06/03/65)"	"I was in a house. Outside there was water about 3 feet deep. I was afraid it was coming in the basement."
"627"	"(06/03/65)"	"I was in a house with my mother. Two containers of milk were delivered. One looked strange, so I showed it to my mother. Inside there was only white ice instead of milk."
"628"	"(06/04/65)"	"A dormitory where I slept was redecorated. I changed my bed because I did not like my place. Then I did not like it there, so I moved again."
"629"	"(06/05/65)"	"I told another patient that I was going to ask for a transfer to a different ward."
"630"	"(06/06/65)"	"I was dining with other patients in a dining room. When I looked up, everyone had gone. I hurried to catch up with them. The walls were thick, and there were narrow halls."
"631"	"(06/07/65)"	"Some teenage youths were playing a pinball machine nearby. One of them took a book off of a table. He had a devil-may-care air about him. He said to the others, ""Now let's look at this book and get some ideas."""
"632"	"(06/08/65)"	"Someone slid off the top of a small rug. A hem would have to be sewed on it to prevent another accident."
"633"	"(06/09/65)"	"I was behind a printing press against the wall. The press started up, and began to open. When the press was completely opened, it would be so close to the wall that it would crush me. I awoke as the press was pressing me against the wall and crushing me. I was terrified."
"634"	"(06/10/65)"	"I was with my mother. An alarm went off. My mother said that to turn it off, I must send an electric current through it with a lever that was on the wall."
"635"	"(06/11/65)"	"A canary in a cage seemed to be ill, and I gave it some water. Hours later I returned and it still seemed ill. It occurred to me that I had not fed it. So I gave it some seed. As the bird ate, the seed and the bird seemed to slowly turn. Then the whole cage looked like a box, and began to spin. And then the whole room spun, and I became dizzy. It was like a delirium. I was worried about the bird."
"636"	"(06/11/65)"	"I was operating laundry machinery. I was pressing the buttons on the switch boxes. A patient from a former ward, named Farell, came up to me. I had not seen him for a long time. He asked me if I am still so sensitive. (I have worked in the laundry for two months here at the hospital. A laundry was in my May 25th dream in which I was confused. I knew this patient for a year, until two months ago. We often discussed emotional problems, and we attended group therapy weekly.)"
"637"	"(06/12/65)"	"I was going to a certain market for my mother to get her a certain kind of fruit. The surroundings were unfamiliar."
"638"	"(06/13/65)"	"My mother gave me a choice about some fruit."
"639"	"(06/13/65)"	"I was on a bus. I got off to look at some buildings. When I returned, the bus was leaving without me. I asked a truck driver to catch the bus for me."
"640"	"(06/13/65)"	"I was in a gym with other people. My sister was there. She undressed to take a shower. At first I thought she had a male organ, but as she came closer, I saw that it was only her clitoris making a bulge in her groin. As she showered, she conversed with the men and women standing outside the shower stall."
"641"	"(06/14/65)"	"A nude woman was being tied to a chair. She was struggling."
"642"	"(06/15/65)"	"I was on some city streets. There were buildings. I came to a house. A witch was there. A windstorm came, and the house was damaged."
"643"	"(06/16/65)"	"I was looking for a certain building. I came to the building a little later. There were store fronts. One store had just opened."
"644"	"(06/17/65)"	"I met a teenage girl. She said she wanted to learn about words, literature, and writing. As she spoke, I saw an object, like a mirage, crescent-shaped slightly above my head. Then she went on to say that she liked be-bop music, and wanted to compose. As she was speaking about the music, I saw a rod-like shape emerge from the center of the inside curve of the crescent-shaped object."
"645"	"(06/18/65)"	"I was taking courses in college with some other students. We were taking an exam."
"646"	"(06/19/65)"	"I was lying on a floor looking through a mirror. I saw the reflection of two girls about 10 years old. I could see up their dresses and I enjoyed looking at their legs. They could not see me, but one of them turned my way and I feared that she was suspicious about something, or that I was exposed some way so that she saw me. I was hidden behind something."
"647"	"(06/20/65)"	"I was in an auditorium. I changed seats. Patients were being transferred."
"648"	"(06/21/65)"	"I had a gun, some bullets, and a knife. Some white, tacky liquid began flooding at my feet. The gun and bullets were soaked, but I cleaned them and loaded the gun. I did not tell anyone about the gun."
"649"	"(06/22/65)"	"I was a patient being transferred to another ward. There was some confusion regarding some clothing and books. Later I had some whiskey which I kept hidden from the attendants."
"650"	"(06/23/65)"	"I was traveling through unfamiliar streets. I was in an unfamiliar town. I went into a store and approached a saleslady."
"651"	"(06/24/65)"	"I was examining an object in the middle of an intersection that resembled the corner nearest to the house I lived in located in North Floral Park, N.Y. My mother came from the direction of our house. I guessed that she had spoken to the neighbor with whom we were not on speaking terms about the object. She explained something to me about the object, and then she passed me and walked on in the same direction."
"652"	"(06/25/65)"	"There was a flood, and I saw water everywhere around the houses."
"653"	"(06/26/65)"	"I had a gadget. It was a light switch that turned on when a section of the wall was pulled out. I showed it to a man who resembled an employee in the hospital's carpenter shop where I worked when I first arrived here almost five years ago. (He has not spoken to me since I was involved in a plot to run away from the hospital in December, 1960.)"
"654"	"(06/27/65)"	"A blond, attractive woman was teaching me to sell from house to house."
"655"	"(06/30/65)"	"I passed a church, and a nun called me inside."
"656"	"(07/01/65)"	"I was seated on a chair that was high from the floor. A woman was seated on the chair with me on my left, and a little girl was seated with me on my right. We were very crowded. I felt their thighs against mine, and it was a pleasurable feeling."
"657"	"(07/02/65)"	"Some men had been sentenced to take poison. Some authorities looked on as they took the poison. After one man swallowed his, a patient on the ward went to the table and took some of it. Later the whole thing seemed to be only an experiment, and it was only a moth or butterfly that had taken the poison."
"658"	"(07/05/65)"	"I was attending a meeting. There was an election, and a woman was elected. She made a speech which she entitled: ""God Has Linked Past and Future Together."""
"659"	"(07/06/65)"	"I came home with my mother. A stew was burned."
"660"	"(07/07/65)"	"I was sewing a garment together on a sewing machine. (I have been sewing trousers and shirts in the tailor shop at the hospital for about two weeks. I do not work in the laundry any longer.)"
"661"	"(07/08/65)"	"I was helping to paint columns in a building. They were about 20 feet high and 60 inches in circumference. On the ladder a patient named Williams was painting the top of a column. (This is a colored patient who has been sexually attracted to me. He has acted like a masculine lover wanting me to be his ""girl,"" but I have only felt annoyed at him; and I pity him, because he is illiterate.)"
"662"	"(07/10/65)"	"I was in a bed with my sister nearby. She was nude, and I felt her organ. Her clitoris felt very large."
"663"	"(07/11/65)"	"I started up a printing press. The ink on the plate was dry, and I was afraid that the press would be damaged."
"664"	"(07/12/65)"	"I was with my sister. A man admired her, and I told her that he would make a good man for her."
"665"	"(07/13/65)"	"I was with a colored woman about 25 years old. She was very friendly with me. We looked for a place where we could make love. She fondled my organ, and she was anxious to have an affair with me. (Yesterday the colored patient named Williams had made advances toward me which I at first did not resist, but I told him later not to do it again, and he agreed. This dream of the colored woman may indicate that I have an unconscious romantic attraction toward him.)"
"666"	"(07/14/65)"	"I was standing by a window. It was constantly lightning outside."
"667"	"(07/16/65)"	"I was teaching someone how to operate a printing press. I was between the flywheel and the arm of the press. Someone turned on the press, and I felt my trousers being caught in the press at the cuffs."
"668"	"(07/17/65)"	"I was on the grounds of an institution. A patient was getting a BX cable from a patient on the third floor. I had some electrical equipment. I was working on a project, and I was responsible for the equipment. I wondered why the patient needed the BX cable."
"669"	"(07/19/65)"	"I was with a girl about 10 years old. She became friendly with me, and we kissed. But I was not sexually aroused."
"670"	"(07/20/65)"	"I was wandering through the streets. I saw a girl about 8, but I did not approach her because I was afraid I would get into trouble."
"671"	"(07/21/65)"	"I was on a street. There was a printing press there about 500 feet long. There was no pressman around. Sheets about 4 by 4 feet were being printed. I tried to take one of the sheets out as they went along the conveyor belt into the bin. But when I took out a sheet, the other sheets began to jam. I could not understand what caused them to jam since I was careful not to jam them when I took out the sheet. I looked for a switch to turn off the press, but it stopped automatically. Several other presses were there. I looked for the way back from which I had come. I had a difficult time, because the street was jagged. When I found my way back, my mother was waiting for me."
"672"	"(07/23/65)"	"I went into a room, and a patient named Jesse Smith was cooking something unusual."
"673"	"(07/24/65)"	"I was operating a sewing machine that was making words like a typewriter. I was composing something original."
"674"	"(07/25/65)"	"I was a hospital patient. My ward had to go to bed early because some of the patients had misbehaved. I passed the bed of a patient who resembled a patient on my ward named Reynolds. I noticed that he was almost bald, and I recalled that his hair a few months ago had been falling out in chunks. (The patient is a close friend of mine. He has a thick head of hair. He is intellectual.)"
"675"	"(07/26/65)"	"I was walking through unfamiliar streets. I found myself in the rear of a Catholic church which looked modest, but artistic."
"676"	"(07/27/65)"	"I was in the yard in an unfamiliar institution. Sewers protruded above the ground about four inches."
"677"	"(07/28/65)"	"I was standing in a building above a sewer about six inches in diameter. I urinated, and as I did, some water came from somewhere and mixed with the urine. There was a column near the sewer."
"678"	"(07/29/65)"	"I was in a dining room. A long bug was on the floor. An attendant stepped on it and sawdust came from inside its body. Then a gust of wind came and blew the sawdust into the air."
"679"	"(07/30/65)"	"A patient on the ward named Zito attacked a patient named Trout with a switch blade knife. Trout grabbed the knife and threw it on my bed. I took it to the attendant in charge of the ward. He was a new charge and did not know from whom I'd gotten the knife."
"680"	"(07/30/65)"	"Some nude boys did a dance. Their faces were ugly."
"681"	"(07/30/65)"	"There was an oil leak in some machinery, and some men shut it off. The oil ran down a slope."
"682"	"(07/31/65)"	"People were gathered at a spot in a town on the bank of a river. They were protesting because the water had flooded the streets and the government had not sent aid to pile sandbags on the banks to hold back the water."
"683"	"(08/01/65)"	"My sister was in a room. An instructor was teaching her to do some exercises. I was looking in from outside the room. My sister was nude. As she did a summersault, I saw her organ. Then she seemed to sense that she was being watched and she turned the other direction."
"684"	"(08/02/65)"	"There was a communist plot. I was in a big, unfamiliar city."
"685"	"(08/02/65)"	"I was operating a printing press."
"686"	"(08/03/65)"	"I was operating a sewing machine."
"687"	"(08/03/65)"	"I was in a building with some women. We were dressing in bathing suits to go swimming. The women did not pay any attention to me as I undressed. There was something very strange about the place. There was a woman in charge of the activities."
"688"	"(08/04/65)"	"I had come home from the hospital. The house was unfamiliar. My mother was laying a linoleum on the floor. I went to a market. I picked some strange fruit off a shelf. It was on a vine or branch that also had leaves. The fruit was some kind of berry. The store was dimly lit with small light bulbs. I returned home, and my mother had finished laying the linoleum. I saw some places that were not covered, but my mother said to let it go. A fire hydrant near the house was leaking. And a faucet in a neighbor's garage was leaking. The plumbing in our house was shut off, so I urinated by the plug. A neighbor saw me, and I was embarrassed. When I went back upstairs, my mother asked me if the rag was still in the plug in the sink, and I said, ""No."""
"689"	"(08/05/65)"	"Some famous ball players were taking a trip through space. When they had gone farther than anyone had ever gone, newsmen said, ""They've gone beyond mankind."""
"690"	"(08/06/65)"	"I was a contestant in a quiz show. After I was quizzed, my sister appeared as a contestant. She knew some of the answers, but did not come out ahead of the several other contestants. My mother was in the audience. When the show ended, the others left the stage, but my sister remained seated there for a few moments and stared ahead as though she were in a daze. I was startled by her stare. Later I was with some other people. I was clad in a bathrobe. My mother came up to me and said she had bad news for me. She explained that I would have to go to court to answer a charge made by some man."
"691"	"(08/07/65)"	"I was operating printing presses."
"692"	"(08/08/65)"	"I was on the street, and I saw some children."
"693"	"(08/09/65)"	"I had some small animals in a container. They were squirming around. I was wondering what to do with them."
"694"	"(08/10/65)"	"I was in a courtroom. The chairs were numbered. I switched chairs with someone."
"695"	"(08/11/65)"	"Some communists were plotting something."
"696"	"(08/12/65)"	"I had just come home from the hospital. My mother was afraid that I would have to return. I had a motor scooter, and I drove it through the streets. I had trouble guiding it. I passed a patient named Reynolds, who was in an auto with someone else."
"697"	"(08/13/65)"	"I was with my mother in a Latin country. We were in a night club. My mother took some phonograph records upstairs to sell them. A man said it wasn't allowed. I was worried about getting into trouble, but my mother came downstairs and said the woman upstairs said she would keep us from getting into trouble. We went outside. Shrubbery was around the building. I became nostalgic when we passed someplace that reminded me of an emotional and spiritual experience in the past. We met my sister. A black cat appeared, and we were nervous because of the bad omen. The cat had a head like a dog. We petted its head."
"698"	"(08/15/65)"	"I was climbing over the ruins of some buildings with my sister. We had to climb over brick and mortar."
"699"	"(08/18/65)"	"I took a camel from a stall and tried to ride it. It was hard to control. After about _ hour, I managed to guide it back to the stall."
"700"	"(08/19/65)"	"I was a patient in a hospital. I was in a hallway that was off limits to the patients. I was only partly clad. I heard some men coming, and I hurried to find a place to hide. (Yesterday I heard that I was being sent to court to face the charges against me.)"
"701"	"(08/20/65)"	"I was trying to find a solution to a problem. I told someone else about it, and we helped each other find the solution."
"702"	"(08/22/65)"	"I was learning something. The patient named Reynolds was there."
"703"	"(08/24/65)"	"There was a piece of machinery that needed adjusting. It was not operating right, and parts were being damaged. I was worried about it. I tried to get to it so I could adjust it."
"704"	"(08/25/65)"	"I was on a narrow porch with my mother and sister. There was no railing. A flag pole was near the edge. It was two stories to the ground. The pole had a rope. I wanted to slide down the pole, but the height frightened me, and I was afraid of burning my palms. I thought of getting gloves. Then my sister slid down the rope. A little later we were on a very narrow part of the porch. I had to climb over my mother and sister to get past them. I nearly fell over the edge of the porch while trying to pass them. Later I was downstairs. The floor under the rug was soft in places, and I removed the rug to repair the floor and paint it. People were coming and going."
"705"	"(08/28/65)"	"Someone had an eye that wouldn't open. An experiment was made to test whether there was a defect in the eye, but none was found."
"706"	"(08/31/65)"	"I was lying in a bed in a dormitory. The patient on the ward named Reynolds was lying in the next bed. He arose and went to a bed several beds away and lay down. My blanket had been hanging over the edge of my bed and resting near his bed. I guessed that he had moved because he didn't like my blanket so near his bed. I felt insulted by his action. But I tried to see his point of view."
"707"	"(09/04/65)"	"I was walking on a street. I was in a state of euphoria. Clairvoyant visions appeared before me. Then a little girl came and asked me to lift her. I lifted her, and she thanked me. Then I had an emission, although I had no erection. I was very dejected because I had not tried hard to control myself. The visions would not come any more. Later I saw a sweater hanging on the handlebar of a bicycle. I took it to put it on; then I changed my mind. My mother and sister were there. (I left the hospital yesterday. I am now in the county jail awaiting trial.)"
"708"	"(09/05/65)"	"I was told to clean a swimming pool that contained muddy water. A lady told me to wait until the water emptied and then clean it."
"709"	"(09/09/65)"	"I formed an unromantic companionship with a little girl. I felt delighted that I had not been erotically attracted to her. (I went to court yesterday, and was released. I am at home now.)"
"710"	"(09/10/65)"	"I was asked a question pertaining to a test I had taken. The answer was correct. Then I was asked a question that did not seem to belong to the test."
"711"	"(09/11/65)"	"I was standing near a doorway in a hospital. Others were there. A heavy and slightly flabby man was standing in front of me with his back pressed against me. He was about 35. Then I left the hospital, but I returned to see someone. The patient named Rivers was in the dormitory."
"712"	"(09/12/65)"	"A bull that seemed to have human intelligence came behind me and held me against him. I did not like his advances, and I sensed that he wanted to have sex relations with me. So I broke away from him."
"713"	"(09/14/65)"	"I was taking a sheet of paper to the foreman in a printing company. There was printed matter on the sheet which I had printed on a press. I was walking through a hallway past private rooms for sleeping. Then I noticed that I was unclad, and I hurried into a room to put on a pair of trousers that was there. But it was so large that both of my legs fit into one leg of the trousers. Someone saw me and laughed at my predicament. I felt embarrassed and belittled."
"714"	"(09/16/65)"	"I was in a store. A man was bickering with a clerk, and then bought what resembled two beach balls."
"715"	"(09/17/65)"	"I was in a hospital. New patients were coming in. One of them put something on the chair of a patient who resembled one who worked in the tailor shop where I was working when I was discharged. He was annoyed, and put the chair in a position so that no one could sit on it."
"716"	"(09/18/65)"	"I was eating with some Oriental men. I helped one of them with some printing type."
"717"	"(09/19/65)"	"A goose was in trouble, and I tried to help. Later I was in a room and I tapped a beehive and the bees swarmed out. I left the room and closed the door. Someone said I was not wise to release those bees like that. I replied that they could not go anywhere so long as the door is closed."
"718"	"(09/20/65)"	"I was alone, and a monster suddenly appeared."
"719"	"(09/20/65)"	"I was filling some containers with some other people alongside of me."
"720"	"(09/21/65)"	"I was putting together rectangular pieces of various colors. My mother and sister were helping me."
"721"	"(09/21/65)"	"I was a patient in a ward where I had just been transferred. I was looking at my notes. A man at a counter told me he would keep them for me. The ward was a great improvement over the one from which I had been transferred."
"722"	"(09/21/65)"	"I was lying in the nude. Several girls about ten years old were around me. I became friendly with one of them. She seemed to be intelligent and creative and have deep feelings. And she seemed to have compassion. As she sat next to me, I held her hand in mine, and I rested it on my organ. I tried my best to forebear having an erection. I did not at first feel that there was anything immoral about what we were doing. She seemed to be fascinated by my body. Then, a moment later, I had a slight feeling of guilt. (I awoke at that moment.)"
"723"	"(09/22/65)"	"I did something, but my timing was not right."
"724"	"(09/22/65)"	"I was making something. Later I was wandering through a small town."
"725"	"(09/23/65)"	"I was a patient in a hospital. I was going to be released. I accidentally hit a young patient in the face. I was excused. Later I accidentally poked another patient in the face. He thought that I had done it purposely. I was afraid that I would not be released because of the incident. I asked to see the doctor so I could explain that it was an accident."
"726"	"(09/23/65)"	"I was on an upstairs floor of a house with my mother. Men were downstairs redecorating the rooms. They had moved the furniture on the floor where we were standing. The floor overlooked the first floor like a balcony. But there was no railing. The floor was slanting toward the downstairs floor. A radio console started rolling down the incline. I stopped it and I removed the wheels to keep it from rolling again. Later I had to urinate and there was no place to go. Someone told me to go to a folding chair and urinate on the seat. A man was standing behind the chair as I did so, and he was annoyed at me for doing it."
"727"	"(09/24/65)"	"I was laying tiles. I had to put only certain kinds down. My mother and sister were there."
"728"	"(09/24/65)"	"My mother visited me in the hospital."
"729"	"(09/25/65)"	"I was getting released from a hospital. Later a ward was lined up, and I asked where they were going. They had all their belongings. He said they were being transferred to a building where they would guard the building. They had been instructed for a long time."
"730"	"(09/25/65)"	"I was near the powerhouse in a hospital. A fire burned in a giant furnace. Sparks flew outside the building and something caught fire. An automatic sprinkler put it out. Someone told me there was no sprinkler inside the building, and it had to be constantly watched."
"731"	"(09/26/65)"	"I drew a picture of a hospital. My mother asked me if it was County. I said, ""No. County is much gloomier."" Later I was in a building. Its architecture was very artistic and attractive."
"732"	"(09/29/65)"	"I was taking an aptitude test to determine if I could play a musical instrument."
"733"	"(09/29/65)"	"I was in a dusty old building. The floors were strangely constructed. I went up an elevator. The floor seemed to have part of it cut out, in the center of it. There were concessions on that floor. I took the elevator to the next floor. A lady was selling strange cookies and I decided to buy some."
"734"	"(09/30/65)"	"One of the altar boys was missing at the church. Some people were discussing what to do. Someone said it would be unethical to go from house to house looking for a server."
"735"	"(09/30/65)"	"I was a patient in a hospital waiting to be released. Someone was collecting the letters that patients wrote on hospital stationery. They never did that before, and mine wasn't written yet. I would only have time for a few lines to my sister, but I guessed that she wouldn't mind, because I had been home and broken my habit of writing regularly anyway. A young boy about 15 was staring at me as I held the letter in my hand. Later I was walking outside the institution with two boys about 7. We went through a chapel where the pews were being moved sideways in preparation for Benediction. Then we walked through a crowd, and I accidentally patted a young girl on the belly. (She was about 15.) She gave me a friendly nod and I nodded back. After we passed her, it occurred to me that she may have thought that I was flirting with her. We came to a place where some benches were against the wall. One of the boys had to urinate, so he undressed and urinated against the wall. I told him to move to where there was a gutter at the bottom of the wall. It was the wall of a building. I held his penis for him and guided the urine toward the gutter. The touch of his organ excited me."
"736"	"(10/01/65)"	"I went to a neighbor's house to fix a heater. I didn't have time to finish the job. When I arrived back in our house, I decided that I had better telephone the neighbor about a valve that needed to be adjusted."
"737"	"(10/01/65)"	"I lived at home, and spent part of the day at the hospital. At the hospital I met a patient there named Farell, and I told him that I'm home now, just visiting to reminisce. There was an exchange of witticisms which he always enjoyed."
"738"	"(10/02/65)"	"I was moving bedroom furniture into a room where there was living room furniture, and the living room furniture into the room where the bedroom furniture had been. I was being released from a hospital. A patient named Yurrow was polishing furniture, and I gave him some mineral oil to use as polish. Other patients were surprised that I was leaving so soon after I was notified. They were leaving too and going to Alabama. I guessed they would stop at Missouri on the way."
"739"	"(10/03/65)"	"I was assembling something that had four legs. I was having difficulty."
"740"	"(10/03/65)"	"Some boys put some objects about 2 by 6 inches on a railing about two stories above a lawn. I was afraid they would fall, and I was afraid I would fall. Later there were furry animals. I saw one nude body of a man below me. His organ was pressed against me. I was excited and I pulled down my shorts. But when I felt below me with my hands, I did not feel anyone there, even though I still felt his body against my backside. As I was pondering the mystery, I heard my sister stir in the next room, and I hurriedly covered myself. She said, ""It's drizzling outside."" (I awoke then, and saw that my sister had actually said that, though I seemed to hear it in the dream. And it was drizzling outside.)"
"741"	"(10/04/65)"	"I was in a mental hospital. There were no bars on the windows. Above me there was a window with a pane of glass about 15 by 20 feet in size. A giant ape came and crashed through the window. The ape was wearing gloves. I was told that the ape had been hired to do that and the gloves were given to the ape to protect its hands. Then some workers came and led the ape away. Two patients slid down a rope through the broken window, and eloped from the hospital on a motorcycle. Later all the patients were lined up near the broken window and warned not to elope."
"742"	"(10/04/65)"	"I sat at a table waiting for food to be served. I hung my clothes on a hook above my chair, and sat clad only in a bath towel. I had to get up several times for some reason. There were women there, and I was embarrassed because I was undressed. As I was finishing the meal, I put on my shirt."
"743"	"(10/05/65)"	"I was making up a program for a show. Some of the words had to be spoken. Others were to be written. later I had to fix a leaking pipe. I had to urinate. I noticed that I was urinating on a repairman's coat, so I moved over."
"744"	"(10/05/65)"	"I was in a hospital. Some books from the library which I had been reading were missing. I went to the library to look for them. They had been borrowed by a patient named Fields. I walked through halls so narrow that I barely could squeeze through. The ceilings were slanty. I heard someone downstairs call me. I went to see who it was. A patient greeted me. When I looked away for a moment he put a lighted cigarette between my toes. I was irritated."
"745"	"(10/06/65)"	"I was getting a suit fitted. Then I noticed that five of my shirts were missing. Later I saw that they had been made into a tablecloth. I recognized the patterns. One was the shirt with barbershop signs printed on it. I was discharged from the hospital then, but I was upset about the shirts. I passed the patient named Reynolds and I told him I'd been discharged. I was on a narrow ledge, and a stout woman was coming the other way. She was annoyed when she had difficulty passing me. I almost fell off the ledge."
"746"	"(10/06/65)"	"I was with some women about 25. We were learning something from a book. We were all unclad. I held a book in front of me while we read. One woman was lying nearby on her belly. She invited me to sit next to her and study with her. Her hair was dark. She seemed intellectual, and she seemed to have spirit. We enjoyed studying together, and we were not distracted by our nude bodies being pressed together. We shifted to a different position after a little while, and I was lying with my legs against her right leg. My chest rested against her back, and I had my arm about her midriff. I became sexually excited, and I felt an emission coming. I was worried about spilling the semen on her body. The emission came (I awoke then)."
"747"	"(10/07/65)"	"An attractive woman dressed in pajamas sat across the room I was sitting in. She was about 15 feet away. I watched her as she spread her legs, and I felt attracted to her."
"748"	"(10/07/65)"	"I was repairing something. I had to hurry, because I only had a short time to finish fixing it."
"749"	"(10/08/65)"	"I was riding a sight-seeing bus with my mother and sister. At the end of the line my sister wanted to stay on the bus."
"750"	"(10/08/65)"	"I was being released from a hospital. I was told there would be a day's delay. My mother went to ask the doctor about it, and when she returned, she said he told her I could go right away."
"751"	"(10/08/65)"	"There was some fast action which I don't recall clearly. Then I saw the back of a nude man bending over. His body looked very masculine."
"752"	"(10/09/65)"	"I worked in a shop as a patient in a hospital. A boil had appeared on the side of my left hand below my pinky. I saw it swell until it resembled a finger about two inches long. Then it began to go down, but it immediately began swelling again. Someone gave me a bag of food, and I ate some. The shop workers were leaving the ward. I decided to stay on the ward because I was to be discharged in a few days and because of the boil on my hand. But after they left, I decided to go. I had difficulty because I did not know the way. I knew it was near ward 9 or 11. I told some patients about my difficulty and asked if they could help. I came to a strange ward and helped move some furniture into a living room occupied by a doctor. The doctor and a lady were asleep in a nearby bedroom, and when they awoke, they left the room and went into the hallway."
"753"	"(10/10/65)"	"I was in an auditorium of a hospital where I was a patient. An officer named DeCaterino told me to go into the hall and straighten a sign. In the hall an employee passed and asked me why I was there alone. I explained, but he didn't believe me. He made me stand in the rear of the auditorium while a movie was shown."
"754"	"(10/11/65)"	"Two beds were arranged at right angles. I was in one of them, and a patient about 17 was in the other one. The head of his bed was at the foot of mine. He was friendly with me at first. Then he left me and he went to the bed of a patient on the ward whom I know in real life. (He is mundane and cynically masculine, lacking any artistic sense.) When the young patient left me, I felt rejected."
"755"	"(10/11/65)"	"I was in a house with my mother and sister. I was fixing a stopped drain. I almost dropped the rubber part of the plunger into the hole. After that my mother put some plates of food on a table over another drain about 12 feet away. A plate began to spin. I reasoned that the suction from the drain was causing the spinning. The drain was much stronger than the one I had just fixed."
"756"	"(10/12/65)"	"I was with a middle-aged man and a slim younger man. Mother and I put my sister in a box. It was attached to the bottom of a plane. The younger man was the pilot. He took off. But when he was about 30 feet above the ground, the box fell because one side had not been attached. My sister was not injured. The middle-aged man said he would send the plane up again, but I would have to pilot it, because the younger man was gone. I was apprehensive because I did not understand some of the dials. Later I was by a body of water and some small buildings. I was shining some objects. Some of them had to be done over."
"757"	"(10/13/65)"	"I was having difficulty doing well in a room."
"758"	"(10/14/65)"	"I was matching some objects on the wall in a room."
"759"	"(10/15/65)"	"I was in a theater with my mother and sister, watching a stage show. When it was over, my mother said we had better hurry because we had an appointment somewhere. We walked outside the theater past a fountain. My mother kept telling my sister and me to hurry. (Before we came to the fountain we had passed under a staircase.) Later I was fixing chairs."
"760"	"(10/16/65)"	"I was in an auditorium. There were no chairs. I was wearing a brimless woolen hat. I took it off. My hair was thick and wavy. Some teenage boys standing nearby made disparaging remarks about my hair. (About seven years ago I tried to give myself a haircut, and it turned out uneven in some places. I boarded a bus a day or so after that, and two teenage boys were sitting behind me, and joked with each other about how my hair was cut. This may be related to my present attempts at self-analysis.) Later I was unable to walk for some reason, and a man who reminds me of someone I knew in the hospital named Goodhand or someone I knew in 1949 in a hospital, had to push me onto a stretcher. He wheeled me under a building and over some railroad tracks."
"761"	"(10/17/65)"	"I went under an overpass to an enclosed yard. Something that resembled a bed's headboard was lifted over the wall surrounding the yard. In a storeroom, I saw a number of headboards. One had a mirror on it, which was broken. Another had ornamental carving which I recognized as identical to the one I had had in my bedroom. A man came in, and tried to put the sides on a headboard so he could take it away. But the boards kept moving, and he could not attach them, so he decided not to take it. I reflected that the boards had seemed to be alive when the man tried to attach them. Then my sister came into the room with a large bandage covering her back. My mother came and we told her that my sister would have to leave the bandage on a few weeks. There was a cotton cloth taped over the bandage, and my sister peeled it off, leaving the bandage exposed. A little later my sister asked who brought the dates from the dining room into the kitchen."
"762"	"(10/18/65)"	"I was a patient in a hospital. A patient was doing something incorrectly, and an officer named DeCaterino would get into trouble if he continued. I helped rectify it. (I am not sure whether it was something incorrect or something immoral that he was doing.)"
"763"	"(10/19/65)"	"I was with my sister in a building. The furniture was dark. There were counters of dresses and there were offices. My sister drank some medicine to remove some stains on two of her front teeth. Then the stains moved to two other teeth. My sister asked a middle-aged woman about it, and she said that the stains would continue to move from tooth to tooth."
"764"	"(10/19/65)"	"I was in a hospital dining room as a patient. Patients were getting discharged. A patient named Reynolds nodded to me and I nodded back. An officer named Lambski (I am not sure of that name, but I remember him as ""Frankie"" which everyone called him. He always tried to be amusing.) As I went onto a porch, I said to him, ""Vive la calarooso!"" I said it to be amusing, though I did not know if ""calarooso"" was a Spanish word. I used it because it sounded Spanish. Some nearby Puerto Ricans smiled, so I thought perhaps it was a Spanish word. The officer hollered something back to me as I walked across the porch. It was in Spanish, but I did not hear the words clearly."
"765"	"(10/20/65)"	"I saw a cat on a stairway. Then I heard a voice saying, ""Did you work..."" At the word ""work,"" I awoke."
"766"	"(10/21/65)"	"I was asleep. Some heavy objects were on my chest. I awoke in the dream, and someone said to go to sleep. I replied that I had been sleeping. The place was unfamiliar and unreal. Symbolic spirits appeared in the dream, and I had some kind of mental problem."
"767"	"(10/24/65)"	"I was in a room with my mother and sister and a lady. My sister was lying in a bed. A lady was trying to describe something to my sister. It was shaped like two doughnuts attached together. She used several big words that meant buttocks, and my sister blushed, and seemed to be slightly confused."
"768"	"(10/25/65)"	"I was in a room partly below the ground. There was an entrance to what appeared to be a cave. Rows of sticks blocked the entrance. They stood upright. I broke one and looked inside. People were boarding an elevator. I was due for an appointment upstairs, so I thought I'd better catch that elevator."
"769"	"(10/25/65)"	"I was on top of a slope. I was carrying toilet articles. I had to move, so I picked up my toilet articles and left the spot. Later there was a toilet bowl standing there. It was stained and had an acid odor. I placed an open jar of mineral oil on the rim of the bowl. Immediately it began to sizzle. Then the acid in the bowl seemed to mix with the oil, and it seemed about to explode. I was afraid to remove the jar. I told some others about it. It was steaming like a pressure cooker, but the vapor was cold. I dropped a piece of goods in the bowl and it was immediately dissolved in the liquid in the bowl."
"770"	"(10/26/65)"	"I was in an institution. I left and later returned through an opening in the wall."
"771"	"(10/26/65)"	"I was in a place with my mother and sister. Others were there too. I had some clothing with me. It was damp, so I left it outside on a pile to dry. When I went outside to get the clothing, it had been burned, and there were only ashes left. (I just recalled that last night I dreamed that I left some shirts outside, and it rained. When I returned, the shirts were wet from the rain and full of holes. I wondered if the rain had made the holes.)"
"772"	"(10/26/65)"	"I was standing next to my sister. Her body was slender and her features were beautiful. Her skin was soft and pale white. My mother and a strange woman about 35 were nearby. My sister came near and rested her shoulders on my left arm. My sister looked lovingly and caressingly at me, and she seemed to want me to kiss her, so I did. As we kissed, she seemed to feel a little guilty, and I supposed it was because we were brother and sister. But she did not move away. I was dressed in pajamas, and my fly felt as though it were open. I felt a tingle in my organ, and I looked down, intending to close my fly. My sister thought I wanted her to touch my organ, so she put her hand on it. When she touched my organ, I felt uneasy, as though the pleasure of the embrace had been spoiled."
"773"	"(10/27/65)"	"I had to assume some responsibility."
"774"	"(10/28/65)"	"I was with my sister. My mother came dressed in a colorful costume, wearing a striped hat and carrying a cane. She wore slacks and a blouse. She had been acting on a stage. She said in a cheerful voice that the show had been a success."
"775"	"(10/28/65)"	"Some people had to go through one doorway and out the other. There was something that needed to be repaired there, and I tried to repair it. Later two girls about 5 years old had to crawl through a small hole. Their dresses went up as they did so, and I saw their panties. I tried not to be sexually aroused. They crawled back and sat next to me. I enjoyed their presence, and I continued to try to repress my passions."
"776"	"(10/29/65)"	"I was told to follow instructions according to some provisions. Then I was told of alternative propositions, and they seemed better to me."
"777"	"(11/01/65)"	"A boy about 10 was leaning his back against the front of my body. Then he walked away."
"778"	"(11/02/65)"	"I was near the ruins of a building. Later I boarded an elevator. I met a friend from the hospital named Reynolds. We talked about something. I told him we didn't he right thing. If we had done the alternative, it would have been wrong."
"779"	"(11/03/65)"	"I wanted to get into a building. There was a derrick about 10 stories high. I climbed to the top, and as it swung against the building, I grabbed the wall and clung to it. The building was about 40 stories high. I crawled up the wall until I came to a window. I then climbed inside. I had to crawl down the side of the inside wall to get to the floor. Later I was outside the building again where I met my mother and sister in a small building, and I told them of the difficulty I had entering the building."
"780"	"(11/03/65)"	"I was wearing a black suit. My other said I could not wear a brown suit because it is against the rules."
"781"	"(11/05/65)"	"I was a patient in a hospital. An obese patient killed a pigeon and began eating it. I felt repulsed. He was sitting on some bleachers. Later I told an officer, but he was annoyed at me for telling him. Then I was doing something, and someone was waiting for me. I tried to hurry."
"782"	"(11/06/65)"	"I was in a place with other men. A man near me began telling me that I have feminine charms. I became angry and I told him that I have a man's body and he should leave me alone. Later all of the men took seats. (That man reminded me of someone at a printing shop I once worked in Manhasset and also a fellow student in a singing and acting school I once attended.)"
"783"	"(11/06/65)"	"I was with my mother in a house. The lights and a radio set went out. My mother changed two of the tubes and the lights and the set turned on."
"784"	"(11/06/65)"	"I set some type in a printing plant, and it was put into the press for printing. I noticed something odd about the press. The type made an impression, but the rollers did not roll over the type, but on the side of the press instead. I was worried that maybe I had not set the type right, and that this was the reason for the malfunction of the press."
"785"	"(11/07/65)"	"I was working at a printing plant. A former employer was there. He was laughing. My mother came and told me I'd better contact the other places I worked so I could receive the money they owe me."
"786"	"(11/08/65)"	"I was riding a roller coaster. At a certain spot, I was ejected and I landed in a boat on a body of water."
"787"	"(11/09/65)"	"I was with my sister. We were patients in a hospital. I was making one kind of toy vehicle and she was making another. Later I began making the same kind she was making. We tested them out. They ran on cables like cable cars. We were scheduled to go before the staff regarding a possible discharge."
"788"	"(11/10/65)"	"I was getting something ready. I seemed to be guided by some destiny. A spell seemed to be upon me. I almost forgot something I was supposed to do. I finished in time and the spell was broken."
"789"	"(11/11/65)"	"I was leaning over a balcony watching two women converse. One was young and fair with a cute nose. She had a profound expression on her face. She was telling the other woman about an emotional problem she was having. The other woman was older and stockily built. I tried to get closer so I could hear what she was saying so that I could perhaps help her. But she shied away from me."
"790"	"(11/12/65)"	"I was looking for a church. I passed a hospital where I had recently been confined. I went inside and greeted patients that I knew. The hospital depressed me and I decided to leave."
"791"	"(11/12/65)"	"I was reading the verses to a song. I analyzed each line as I went along. The first verse seemed less emotional."
"792"	"(11/13/65)"	"I was with my sister. There were broken pieces of china on the ground and I threw them into a ditch. There was a pole in the ditch. The ditch was about 20 feet deep and about 15 feet in diameter. I looked down into the ditch to see what was there. I fell into the ditch. I called to my sister to help, but she said she was afraid to go to the edge of the ditch. I climbed the pole and was able to reach the top of the ditch."
"793"	"(11/13/65)"	"A man had a pill that would restore in an adult his childhood curiosity. (I was curious in the first dream, and the second dream seemed to be a way to restore my curiosity after that mishap.)"
"794"	"(11/14/65)"	"I was seated at a dining room table in a hospital. A patient across from me went to a different table. I had defecated before coming to the dining room, and I had a slight odor about me. I wondered if the patient had moved for that reason. The one next to me left for a different table, and a heavyset man sat there. Then two men sat at places across the table. They seemed to be effeminate. They made effeminate gestures as they spoke. I happened to look under the table, and I noticed that one of them wore a skirt. Later I left the table and walked alongside a young man. Everything outside was wet and muddy from a recent rain. We passed some burning torches, and the young man as a joke pushed me so that I stepped into the flame."
"795"	"(11/15/65)"	"I was with my sister. I was trying to do something. She became impatient, but I finished in time."
"796"	"(11/16/65)"	"I was in a house. In an island in the center of the street outside there was a man about 20 feet tall. He kept raving angrily. Finally some men took him away. An amusement park was put on that spot."
"797"	"(11/16/65)"	"I was working in a printing plant. A colored woman had an irritation on the nape of her neck. I gave her a cake of Sayman's soap to wash it. I wiped it with some of the type cleaner, but she said it burned. She said that some white person had thrown something in her hair that had caused the irritation."
"798"	"(11/17/65)"	"Three women about 25 were standing nude on sofas. I studied their mannerisms. One was heavier than the others and seemed more sophisticated in manner. Another was slender and subjective in manner. The third one was light complected (the other two were dark), and she seemed adventurous. The slender one went into a closet in the men's room and dressed into a woolen skirt and a blouse. A fourth woman, younger than the rest, appeared wearing a skirt and blouse. Then the other two got dressed, and they seemed to be relieved to be dressed. (While they had been unclad, I had studied the size and shape of the lips of their vulvas and I tried to see how they reflected the girls' personalities.) Later I was lying on the street outside unclad and a blanket was under me. I was reading a paperback book. The woman who had been with me inside were across the street looking at me. I felt uncomfortable and tried to find my place in the book. On the page someone had written, ""drop dead."" I recalled that my place was at the spot where the last letter of those words ended. Then a man carrying a book about a foot long and a foot wide and about 10 inches thick was holding the book over the edge of a balcony. He seemed to want it to drop. I reasoned that he may want something to happen to the book so that he would not have to return it to the library. The drop from the balcony was about 30 feet. Then a man came behind him and kicked him down the stairs."
"799"	"(11/18/65)"	"I was a patient in a hospital. I had to urinate and I went to a place where a wall the height of my waist hid my lower body from view. My trousers were down and my underwear was open in the back. A man saw me urinate and he commented to another man that I have a strong flow of urine. Later a patient was getting discharged and I shook hands with him. Then I went into the dormitory and lay in my bed. A man came by who resembled a classmate of mine in grammar school named Robert Effan. Two patients had an argument and went to the officer with their grievances. Robert Effan lay in the bed next to me, and my buttocks was facing him. I was nude. He fondled my buttocks. Later I went with the other patients to the shops where we worked. We passed a railroad siding. The man guiding the patients was dignified like a clergyman. Later I was near an old elevator. I was in bed in a strange dormitory. I hoped the patient in the next bed was friendly. In the morning the patients were talking about the dormitory. I felt very lonely."
"800"	"(11/19/65)"	"Some girls were performing on a stage. One was wearing an animal costume. Two others were made to look about 15 feet tall."
"801"	"(11/20/65)"	"I was with my sister. We were hired to assemble plastic model airplanes. There was much activity around us. Later I found a pile of pajamas and I tried one on. Then I saw a pile of women's panties and I started to try one on, then I thought how silly I was, so I put it down and tried on another pajamas."
"802"	"(11/21/65)"	"I was assigned to work on a mechanical apparatus. A man sawed one apart and showed me that something was wrong that made it not serviceable. The man was about my build and slightly taller. Some boys about 18 were lying in the nude. Some of them were having sexual relations together."
"803"	"(11/22/65)"	"My mother was trying to clean a horse's stall, but the horse kept trying to come in, so that she could not work. Later I was looking through a window and I saw a horse running fast toward my mother. I tried to open the window to warn her, because she was looking another way. The window would not open, so I put on a glove and broke the window to attract her attention. She heard me and saw the horse coming and she was able to get out of its way. I began repairing the window. Something was hanging from the ceiling."
"804"	"(11/23/65)"	"I was in a school building watching workers install an underground sewer. I was surprised how fast they completed a wall. Then I recalled that unauthorized people weren't allowed in the building because of men who molest children, so I asked someone where the exit was located."
"805"	"(11/23/65)"	"I was on a train and I found out that I was going the wrong direction. I went outside between the cars to get ready to leave the train at the next station. A girl about 7 greeted me from a running board about 3 feet above the floor. She seemed very sophisticated. I was afraid she would fall when the train jerked. I had a desire to hug her, but I thought how fragile she was, how a piece of iron from above her could crush her. When the train stopped, I had a desire to stay on with her, but I decided to get off as I had planned. She seemed a little disappointed that I was leaving. I walked through a dark street. I saw a shadow move and I thought it was a child. But when I came closer, I saw what appeared to be a pair of wings."
"806"	"(11/24/65)"	"I was laying tiles in a gymnasium. I had a small roller to use. Someone gave a larger one, and I decided to use it to do a better job."
"807"	"(11/25/65)"	"I was typing something. I could not make a mistake, because it was an important paper."
"808"	"(11/26/65)"	"I was walking with a woman about my mother's age. She had a picture in her hand which she said I must have torn from a book I had at home. I told her that I did not tear the page out, and the page she was holding must be from somewhere else. She was very upset, and I felt frustrated because I could not prove to her that she was mistaken. I was carrying two books."
"809"	"(11/26/65)"	"I was in a room with others. A sofa was facing the wall. A colored woman stood up suddenly and said, ""Well, if no one else is going to do anything, I will,"" and she moved the sofa so that it faced the room. Then the people who had been standing sat down."
"810"	"(11/26/65)"	"I was with my mother on the street. I had an 8-foot ladder. We wanted to catch a bus, but I could not take the ladder, so I looked around for a place to leave it. My mother said I should leave it right there at the bus stop. I was afraid it would be taken, so I walked down the block to a hardware store. The bus came and we missed it. At the store two young women were there, and when I asked them if I could leave the ladder there, they just grinned and shook their heads negatively. Later I was on the ladder against a porch with a table on it. I was peeling an orange on the table. A man came over and showed that he was indignant because I was using his table. Then he took one of the oranges."
"811"	"(11/26/65)"	"I was running a printing press. The ink dried and I had to wash it. A distinguished looking man came and sat on the next press. I had not cleaned that press yet, and there was wet ink there, so I warned the man. Then he got off the press."
"812"	"(11/26/65)"	"I was looking under a sink. I was startled when I saw smoke. But the only thing I could find was a rope."
"813"	"(11/26/65)"	"I was in an enclosed building with 30 feet to the ceiling. Howitzers were rolling toward the enemy. I was assigned to the front line. I felt a moment of fear as we were about to encounter the enemy."
"814"	"(11/26/65)"	"I was below the floor level in a building like a warehouse. I urinated. I did not stop for some time, and I was worried because I was urinating so long. I saw foam come with the urine and I was worried that it might be semen. (This morning I noticed that in all of these dreams there was anxiety.)"
"815"	"(11/27/65)"	"I was on the street. Then I found myself in the custody of hospital authorities and law officers. One of them said that my sister was an inmate in Sing-Sing prison. I was dismayed when I heard that. I had been away from home for several weeks."
"816"	"(11/27/65)"	"I was adjusting a pipe on a 20-foot high ceiling. I was standing on top of a ladder resting on the floor. The ladder began to shake, and I was afraid I was going to fall."
"817"	"(11/27/65)"	"I was in a restaurant. I was embarrassed because I was wearing a state issue coat from the state hospital. It had gold trimming sewed around it though it was a very cheap coat. I felt better when I thought of the trimming."
"818"	"(11/28/65)"	"A girl about 8 came up to me and said that if I came to her house she would give me some candy. I was writing something and I said I would come when I have finished. When she was out of sight, I tried to recall where she lived. One girl lived in one direction and another in the opposite direction. It was close to nine o'clock, and I wanted to get home so my mother would not worry. I went about 8 blocks, then I decided that it must be the other way. I decided to call a taxi. The driver said I would have to wait about 10 minutes. I became impatient, and started to walk. But I made a wrong turn and ended back at the taxi. Three other passengers were inside. I was hoping I would not get back too late."
"819"	"(11/29/65)"	"I was arranging something. My mother said there was something there that should not be there. I said that someone else must have taken out what I had put there and substituted the other object."
"820"	"(11/30/65)"	"I was walking on the street clad only in the pants part of a pajamas. A policeman stopped me and asked me who I was. I disguised my voice and spoke with a Puerto Rican accent. I said I am a Puerto Rican. He asked me why I was not dressed, and I replied, ""I go now to get my clothes in my house."" I had no house to go to, but I went to a house. A woman about 60 answered. I asked her if she could give me some clothing and she did."
"821"	"(12/01/65)"	"There was a horse and wagon."
"822"	"(12/02/65)"	"I moved a table and chair into a men's restroom. I told someone that they were just like the ones in the women's room. A woman asked me, ""How do you know?"""
"823"	"(12/02/65)"	"I heard of a fire in a brewery in St. Louis near the river. (I lived near there when I was a child.)"
"824"	"(12/02/65)"	"A large rat, larger than an average cat, was eating something. I was across the room from it. I saw its large teeth. Later I saw a small cat lying dead."
"825"	"(12/03/65)"	"I was in a commercial building. There was a hole in the floor about four feet in diameter and about a foot deep. Chicken bones were burning in the hole. There was much smoke. A flue above it was sucking the smoke with a great force. I was afraid it would explode. Then it began to rain outside, and the rain fell on the fire and began to extinguish it."
"826"	"(12/04/65)"	"I was steering a boat and it went the wrong direction. I blamed the boat's going off course to a hole in the side of the boat. I blamed someone for the hole. I believe it was my sister whom I blamed."
"827"	"(12/04/65)"	"I was with two other patients in a hospital. We were climbing up a shaft that resembled a dumb waiter shaft. We came to a floor where there were doctors' offices. A men's room was there. We had difficulty climbing up to the floor."
"828"	"(12/05/65)"	"I was in an auditorium. People were taking their seats. I was standing with a dark complected man about 45 who reminds me of a colored person I once knew. And I was telling that some man did pederasty with me. He told me to show him how he did it. I let down my trousers and shorts and I inserted his penis into my rectum. I was embarrassed because there were so many people around. But they seemed to be unconcerned about what we were doing."
"829"	"(12/05/65)"	"I was washing my face. I started to wash the bottom of the jersey shirt I wore. I wanted to wash my name off. An attendant came by and I hoped he would not reprove me for washing my shirt. He accused me of doing something which I hadn't done. He said I broke a rule. I told him that I did not do it, but he would not believe me, and he said he was going to punish me. My voice was very nervous. He left, but he still did not believe me."
"830"	"(12/06/65)"	"I secretly met a man about 25 by a stairway. We ate together, and had to watch for the police because we weren't allowed to eat in public. Later two men said I stole a suit from their store. I denied taking it, and then I left."
"831"	"(12/07/65)"	"I was a patient in a hospital. My ward was being transferred. We were walking to the new ward. While I was adjusting the books and holder I was carrying and putting it in my coat pocket, the ward got out of sight, and I did not know where the new ward was located. The books bulged from my pocket. I passed a patient. (He is a patient in a ward I was in when I was confined last year. He was from India, and used to sit on the ward in the lotus position.) He was sitting in the lotus position. I handed him a paperback book with the three Magi pictured on the cover. I said that I think he would be interested in reading it."
"832"	"(12/07/65)"	"I was having difficulty getting some clothing from a vending machine. I had inserted coins into it. A man nearby was operating an amusement park concession consisting of small automobiles. He came over and showed me how to operate the vending machine. He told me that when the machine discharged the clothing, it gave off heat that recharged the battery that operated the automobiles in his concession. When he pushed a button to operate the vending machine, a spark automatically went from the button to a switch connected to his automobiles. (When I awoke, I recalled that yesterday I was reading that criminologists say that emotional deprivation may cause juvenile delinquency, and that intellectual gratification can be a ""recharger"" for the emotions. I concluded that the vending machine represented intellectual gratification, and the concession represented the emotions.)"
"833"	"(12/08/65)"	"My mother and I went outside our house to clean a grated sewer. It started to rain, and my mother became annoyed. She said it always rains when you want to do something."
"834"	"(12/09/65)"	"I was about to go into a building about 500 yards in front of me. It was about four stories high. I do not recall why I was going there."
"835"	"(12/10/65)"	"I was climbing somewhere outdoors."
"836"	"(12/11/65)"	"I took some kind of test."
"837"	"(12/12/65)"	"I was with several others. We were going into a building where we worked. We had to walk on a narrow ledge several stories above the ground. The ledge overlooked a shaft that resembled an elevator shaft. I was worried about falling. We had to get to the door on the other side of the shaft. When I got inside, I saw that I was a half hour late. I felt that I should be excused because of the trouble I had to get into the building."
"838"	"(12/12/65)"	"There were some colorful insects on the floor in a dimly lit room in a building. They behaved strangely."
"839"	"(12/14/65)"	"I was arranging to stay overnight at a church affair. I had not expected to stay overnight."
"840"	"(12/14/65)"	"I was walking through an area about a mile square. The buildings appeared at first to be all seven stories high. Then I noticed that what appeared to be a sky was the underside of streets built at the seven story level and supported by the buildings. The streets were wall to wall, which gave the appearance of a sky. I went to the upper level. Later, I walked over an overpass, and I passed some caged monkeys."
"841"	"(12/14/65)"	"I was trying to get a ride with my sister. We tried to jump onto a moving vehicle that had handlebars in the rear, but we missed, so we walked."
"842"	"(12/14/65)"	"I was in a building with other men. Outside someone had dumped a wrecked car in the street. A little later it was gone. Then when I looked again, it was back again."
"843"	"(12/15/65)"	"I was a hospital patient going to the dining room. I had no shirt on. But I saw one on the street and I put it on. At the dining room, the patients were being served cafeteria style for the first time. I sat by a heavyset woman, and we talked about the change. A patient (resembling a patient at the hospital named Zambella) came, and was nude from the waist down. He tried to hide his nakedness by walking across the floor in a squatting position."
"844"	"(12/16/65)"	"I was in a room. A thick wall was between my room and the next room. Women were in there praying. They were studying to be nuns. One of them was taking her vows."
"845"	"(12/16/65)"	"I was in a place with other people. There was a toilet bowl that was about four feet deep to the bottom. Some towels were down there. I flushed the toilet and they moved. I regretted flushing it without removing the towels first. I tried to reach them. I reached one, and I put it where it belonged. I could see the other towels, but I could not reach them. (Yesterday I read that dreaming of flushing a toilet symbolizes the embryo's attempt to flush out of the womb the unwanted fetus that had been stillborn before its own conception."
"846"	"(12/16/65)"	"I was in a hospital. I borrowed a bed from a room. After I was finished, I brought it back. Two girls were lying on their bellies, one on top of the other. A young nurse was helping a woman patient, and I felt that I should not be there."
"847"	"(12/17/65)"	"I was in a hospital dormitory. I was in a bed, and a female patient was in one at the foot of mine. Later I was discharged, and I was afraid the female patient would tell someone about my being in the hospital. I went into a store and saw an officer from the hospital behind the counter. I knew that he was not a salesman, but a disguised house detective. I kept out of his sight so he could not tell the others about my being in the hospital. Later I was stripped from the waist up and I was exercising. I reflected that I did not have the opportunity to exercise my chest in the hospital. My chest became very protruding, almost like a woman's breast."
"848"	"(12/18/65)"	"I connected some object under the floor of a swimming pool to an electric outlet."
"849"	"(12/18/65)"	"I was operating an automatic printing press. Two middle-aged women were talking nearby."
"850"	"(12/18/65)"	"I was taking a plastic bag containing some feminine articles to give to my sister. My mother was there, and started to hum and sing, ""I've got a beard showing, and it shines upon my knees."" I was embarrassed, because the song seemed vulgar, and I didn't like others nearby to hear it."
"851"	"(12/19/65)"	"I was a patient in a bed in a dormitory. The patient in the next bed became friendly and I felt uncomfortable because I suspected that he was making a sexual advance. He became annoyed when I did not respond, and he moved to another bed. I felt that the other patients thought we were perverts, and that made me uncomfortable."
"852"	"(12/19/65)"	"I passed through a town on a train. No one knew the name of it, and I was annoyed. I decided to get off at the next station."
"853"	"(12/19/65)"	"I was sitting on a wooden box. I saw some tacks on the floor and I picked them up. Then I saw some pennies on the floor. As I was picking them up, an employee (Mr. Berger whom I knew at the hospital) said, ""What are you doing, picking up pennies?"" I nodded in the affirmative. I sat on the box again, but I was uncomfortable, so I tilted it against the wall of the cove."
"854"	"(12/20/65)"	"I was near a stairs, and I told someone that the easiest way to remember is to say words ending in ""or."" Then my mother and sister sat on a couch and told me to sit in the center."
"855"	"(12/21/65)"	"I was a spirit and there was a man 10 feet tall."
"856"	"(12/22/65)"	"I was walking up a stairway. Someone behind me pushed and I saw that it was Feeley. He smiled good-naturedly."
"857"	"(12/23/65)"	"There were about a dozen objects. I had to replace one that was square with a copper one."
"858"	"(12/23/65)"	"I went to a church affair. I only had an hour and a half to get back to work."
"859"	"(12/24/65)"	"Phonograph records were playing about past, present and future. The past was inappropriate."
"860"	"(12/25/65)"	"I had left a hospital without permission, and the police were looking for me. I had been scheduled to be discharged the next day. I was found later."
"861"	"(12/25/65)"	"Two women were riding a roller coaster. They were embarrassed because their breasts were uncovered."
"862"	"(12/26/65)"	"I put some objects in order. I wiped some of my feces that had dried on my chair."
"863"	"(12/27/65)"	"A respectable-looking man was riding a bus with a young lady. When they left, people said it was a scandal, their being together."
"864"	"(12/27/65)"	"My sister was slender. She wanted to have sexual relations with me. I had a euphoric feeling."
"865"	"(12/27/65)"	"I urinated in a booth. I was embarrassed when a woman walked by, but she paid no attention to me."
"866"	"(12/28/65)"	"I left a fair. Then I saw something interesting inside, and I asked the woman at the entrance if I could go back in. She reluctantly agreed. I walked on a high place."
"867"	"(12/29/65)"	"I was holding a needle and thread. The needle suddenly began working itself into my neck, the eye end first. I tried to pull it out."
"868"	"(12/30/65)"	"I was at a fence with Manhattan in the distance. I climbed over the spike points on the top, and I picked up something I had seen and climbed back outside. Then I saw men going inside and I pretended to be one of the group. A guard at the gate was suspicious, but he let me go in. A large bridge was nearby."
"869"	"(12/31/65)"	"I was in a large house with my mother. I put in some storm windows in the basement windows, but I replaced the windows outside instead of inside the storm windows. The walls were thick. I hoped my mother would not notice the way I put the windows in. She didn't. A large furnace was in the basement. Later I distinguished a material from an abstract object."
"870"	"(01/01/66)"	"I was trying to leave an institution."
"871"	"(01/02/66)"	"I climbed a hill of snow to get to a house where someone was waiting. I wanted to buy a newspaper."
"872"	"(01/03/66)"	"Someone told me that a patient named Cole was keeping a secret. Cole became nervous. He started blowing his breath out and swinging his arms. I pitied him."
"873"	"(01/04/66)"	"Some nuns used some tools. When they put them back, they put them in the wrong place. The room was dimly lit. Some sticky fluid was on the tools. I tried to put them straight in the place they belonged. Some children were nearby."
"874"	"(01/04/66)"	"I was walking with a man who resembled someone I met 15 years ago in a hospital. (He told me I think too much.) I was carrying a gun in my pocket. I tried to adjust it so it would not bulge from my pocket. I had a permit for the gun."
"875"	"(01/05/66)"	"I was on a hospital grounds. A female patient was walking nearby and looking very depressed. I pitied her. She was slender and dark complected. Then a matron came and led her to the ward. I regretted that I had not led her to her ward. Perhaps she would have confided in me why she was so gloomy."
"876"	"(01/06/66)"	"A lady was carrying an infant. I kissed the infant. The lady was angry at me. I apologized, and said I would take her on a date. She consented, but said she only has a few hours to spare. I said we would return in time. (Today is the feast of the Epiphany.)"
"877"	"(01/07/66)"	"I was with my mother and sister. Our car was on the road. My sister said she would park it at the corner. We were afraid she would not be able to do it, but she did."
"878"	"(01/08/66)"	"Some cultivated and refined guests were coming into the house. Later I was lost in a big building."
"879"	"(01/09/66)"	"I had been discharged from a hospital, and I went back to get something. A female patient was looking for a doctor. She was walking up a stairway that wound around an elevator shaft. She saw a woman doctor on the next flight of stairs and hurried to catch her. The patient was thin and plain-looking, about 30."
"880"	"(01/10/66)"	"I was discussing someone's behavior with a man about 55. He spoke about something the person had a habit of doing, and I replied, ""That's the way Plato did -- he separated things (referring to Plato's dualism)."" Later I was in a locker room and a young boy about 15 was standing with his back to me. He seemed timid, and seemed to be afraid of me."
"881"	"(01/11/66)"	"I passed a newspaper's building. The sign read, ""The Sun."" A canopy of metal and glass was hanging precariously about three stories up, and it looked as though it were about to fall. Some pieces of glass were on the ground. I told someone, then I picked up the glass. I was glad the sign had not yet fallen."
"882"	"(01/12/66)"	"I was at home with my mother. A hurricane came and the part of the house I was in was blown through the streets. It passed between two walls and then landed in a gully. After the storm I went back toward the house. The other houses were not very much damaged. (I awoke, and then when I fell asleep again the dream was continued.) I saw my sister and I told her how the wind had torn off the section of the house. (The house part that broke off was like the dinette in the last house we lived in.)"
"883"	"(01/13/66)"	"I was looking out the window of my house. There was land all around. Suddenly I heard an explosion and saw an object explode into fire about 50 yards from the house. A dog came and took some of the burning pieces and tossed them around. I was afraid he would set the house on fire."
"884"	"(01/14/66)"	"I climbed up the wall of a building to get to the third floor window. The lower half of the window was higher than the upper half, and I had difficulty. A man inside was looking on, but he made no offer to help me."
"885"	"(01/15/66)"	"I went to see some patients in a hospital. A movie was being shown, and I strained to hear what the woman on the screen was saying. On the grounds later I met a girl about 8. She was carrying a doll. I was attracted to her, but I forbore any immoral behavior with her. She was intellectual in appearance and manner. She smiled at me in a friendly way. She was leaning over the rim of a fountain and examining the fish in the water. As she went to another part of the fountain, she dropped her doll without noticing it, and I picked it up and gave it to her. She thanked me and smiled at me. She seemed disappointed when I told her that I was going."
"886"	"(01/16/66)"	"I was doing something, and then I lay in a bed and smoked a cigarette. My sister was asleep in a bed a few feet away. I was worried about burning the bed with the cigarette. Later I saw some tickets from the VA hospital in my wallet. Then I was working on a machine with a conveyor belt that slanted downhill. A man came to repair it. He was working at the lower end and I was at the higher end."
"887"	"(01/16/66)"	"Two squirrels, one male and the other female, spoke with human voices. They were arguing about something. Then the male embraced the female and they decided to make up."
"888"	"(01/16/66)"	"I was in a room with wax dummies. I touched one, and it felt warm and alive. I seemed to feel the whole body through my hand. A man was with me."
"889"	"(01/16/66)"	"There was a blind on the floor, and my mother said to put it back on the window. There was an artificial clump of bushes nearby with stuffed animals next to them. One was a tiger. I went up to one of the bushes and it seemed alive. Then I saw some live squirrels behind it. A web wrapped around me. It came from the bush."
"890"	"(01/16/66)"	"I was with my mother in a European city. A man told us to look up at a sign. It was a sign spelling out words that move from one end to the other. It was spelling ""Peace on earth."""
"891"	"(01/17/66)"	"I was visiting a hospital, and I was in the yard with some inmates. I was trying to explain something about three kinds of affection. (Yesterday I read about three motivations for pedophilia.)"
"892"	"(03/23/66)"	"I was on my way somewhere, and I took a shortcut through a gully. While I was sliding down the gully, a flood of water washed down the gully and I was soaked. After I reached the bottom, I walked on with my clothing soaked. A woman was there."
"893"	"(03/23/66)"	"I was watching a light opera. The woman who played the starring role was having some difficulty."
"894"	"(03/24/66)"	"I was with my mother and sister. Later a girl about 10 was nearby. I was attracted to her, but I forbore any kind of immorality with her."
"895"	"(03/25/66)"	"Some man made a trip in a balloon. After he came down, I was going to make the trip. But I had to run a ways to get to the balloon, and I was afraid I wouldn't get there in time. There was a bigger man than I with me who could run for me, but I was afraid he wasn't big enough."
"896"	"(03/25/66)"	"I was on a bed in a room. Another man was in a nearby bed. A woman came into the room and the man told me she did not wear panties. But when she sat down, I saw that she was wearing pink panties. I left the room to find a toilet. I went into a toilet, but there were women there, and I was embarrassed at the thought of using it in their presence, so I left and looked into some nearby stores for a restroom. But they only had telephone booths, and no restrooms. I was getting annoyed."
"897"	"(03/25/66)"	"I was on my way somewhere, riding in an army truck. I was lying on my back. A bird about a foot long was above me. I held it and rubbed its penis (which was under its tail) against mine. The streets outside were colorful, and the buildings were artistically built."
"898"	"(03/25/66)"	"I needed identification and a diploma to get a job. Someone offered to give the identification of someone else."
"899"	"(03/26/66)"	"I wanted to cash some checks at a bank. The tellers said I could sign an alias. I was worried whether I had enough money."
"900"	"(03/26/66)"	"I had to make a decision regarding my mind. Someone said my trouble is physical. I told him that when I first came there, I was given liquid medication, then it was changed to pills. (When I awoke I recalled that I have never taken liquid medication at any hospital.)"
"901"	"(03/27/66)"	"I was walking with a man I knew as a patient in a hospital. His name is Farell. We were looking for our ward. He told me not to worry, that we would find it. I passed a church, and then I found my way back to the ward."
"902"	"(03/28/66)"	"I was climbing a structure that resembled the Eiffel Tower. I was a little afraid of losing my hold. I was about three stories above the ground. Someone was down there looking on (my sister, I think). Later people were moving from apartments. A car and trailer stood in an open area, and a mattress fell from the sky. I wondered where the mattress had come from, since there were no buildings nearby."
"903"	"(03/28/66)"	"Someone offered me a glass of water."
"904"	"(03/29/66)"	"I was employed in an office. I had arrived for work, and I went to the room where the time clock was located so I could punch in. But the room was locked. Someone said the room was being renovated. I was worried about there being trouble about my pay. I told a woman about 30 about it. She was reassuring, and said there wouldn't be any trouble. As she spoke, I had a sudden urge to put my hand up her dress. I did so, and she had no underwear on. She resented what I had done, and I felt badly about it, so I apologized to her. (A few days ago, I overheard a patient relate to some other patient how he had put his hand up a woman's dress.)"
"905"	"(03/30/66)"	"I was being transferred from a hospital. Later some girls about 12 were indulging in sex play with some dogs. I was in a house."
"906"	"(03/31/66)"	"I was walking with another man and I was carrying a little boy. We came to my house, and as I started to enter, he asked me if I would walk with him to his house. As I reflected on his request, I felt a titillating sensation in my solar plexus. I agreed to go with him. Later when I went into my house, strange people were there. The door was open. I was afraid we had been evicted."
"907"	"(03/31/66)"	"I was at the door of a dark room. I heard someone inside the room call me in. I was afraid and I backed away. But then I felt a hand pulling me inside, and a feeling of panic and terror came over me. (At that point, I awoke.)"
"908"	"(04/01/66)"	"I was in a department store. Later I was on the grounds of a hospital which resembled the one across the street from one of the houses I lived in when we lived in St. Louis, Missouri. There was a wall about ten feet high from the sidewalk to the hospital grounds. The ground level of the hospital grounds was about two feet lower than the wall. (As a child I once tried to climb that wall to get to an injured robin. I think I succeeded in doing so.) In this dream I was on the grounds, and I was wishing I could climb down to get away from the hospital. I told someone that I chased a pig. I related how I caught it and it struggled. (Yesterday I read that though scientists can study the origin of life by tracing human life down to atoms, they cannot reverse the analysis and retrace their steps. Only the tracing of atoms to electrons can be reversed. This may have suggested the return to a childhood scene.) This time I was trying to get away from the hospital instead of onto the hospital grounds."
"909"	"(04/02/66)"	"I was being transferred from a hospital. later there was a liner with a smokestack. It was going along canals surrounding a city. Some men were planning to do something unlawful, and then escape by piloting the liner through some forbidden waters. I did not think they could do it."
"910"	"(04/03/66)"	"I was with my mother and sister, and I made some kind of decision."
"911"	"(04/04/66)"	"I left a department store and came into an alley. Some little girls were there, but I avoided them. I walked through a wooded area and I saw more little girls on the path. They seemed carefree and gay. Two of them flashed their eyes at me. I noticed the legs of some others. I felt tempted to become friendly with them, but I resisted. (When I awoke, I felt anxiety as I recalled the dream. Yesterday I read from ""Human Destiny"" by Leconte du Nouy that Darwin was wrong about natural selection. It was not the fittest that survived, but the most adaptable to change in environment. The dinosaurs were the fittest of their time, but became extinct when the climate was modified. I related that thought with my own inability to adapt to adulthood, and I believe that is why I felt so anxious. It made me ponder that adaptability is more essential to my survival than fitness or power to seduce. My power is useless if I can't adapt to adulthood.)"
"912"	"(04/04/66)"	"I had a cake of pink soap. A chemical made it porous. When I rubbed a layer of soap off, it looked white. I dropped it into the water, and the water foamed like a bubble bath."
"913"	"(04/04/66)"	"I started a fire and burned. Later when I looked in my dresser drawer, it appeared as though someone had been looking through it. I had a feeling of resentment. I saw a match and a sticker, and I took them to a room where I intended to burn something."
"914"	"(04/04/66)"	"I had a deep cut in my neck. I found a doctor and he gave me a mask to wear. I was too embarrassed to wear it on the street. I'd walked home, and in the house, I'd put the mask on, I decided. Then I met a lady about 35. She was dignified in manner. We said a few words and then I walked toward home. Later I tried to start the engine of a train. I put on a hot valve, then just in time I turned on the cold one. But the engine stopped. The foreman gave me a different engine."
"915"	"(04/04/66)"	"I was confined in a hospital. I asked my mother when I would be discharged. She said I had been given a merit. She and my sister were also confined there. A little later my sister began to cry. My mother and I wanted to be discharged. Later I felt like running around the grounds to limber. I felt healthy and in control of my passions."
"916"	"(04/05/66)"	"I was living in a house with my mother and sister. (It did not resemble any that I have ever lived in real life.) A woman investigator came and questioned me about some flowers that were sent to someone. I said that I had mailed them, but I did not know who had requested that they be mailed. Later my mother threw some garbage out the window. Our garbage cans were on the curb. My sister went outside and moved some of them. Then I went outside to look at them. I tried to pass the next door house, but a new stair and stoop were being built, so I had to detour. The neighbors in that house were not on friendly terms with us. I came to a tree with a branch shaped like a horse's head. It seemed to have real horses' eyes. They stared at me. The branch itself began to appear to be a live horse. I looked away, and a little later it appeared to be undernourished when I looked again."
"917"	"(04/06/66)"	"There was a man acting silly and childish before a group of people. After he'd left, a man came looking for him and was angry when he couldn't find him."
"918"	"(04/07/66)"	"I was in a yard in an institution. A garbage can was there. Later there was a word that was made up of two words. I had to use the first part of the word for some reason."
"919"	"(04/08/66)"	"I was employed somewhere, and I had to do something a certain way. I had to arrange pans."
"920"	"(04/08/66)"	"I was in a dimly lit basement room which had a dirt floor. A tunnel was outside the room. Birds were feeding on some bread. A hungry-looking goat came and ate some of the bread. Then two boys about 10 started fighting outside the door. A moment later I noticed that they were handcuffed together. One was a little taller, and his hair was long. The shorter boy seemed to fear him."
"921"	"(04/09/66)"	"I was in a room near a door that led outside. On the ground outside men were lying on their backs. Girls about ten years old were lying between the men's legs, and tickling the men's organs. When the men's organs became erected, they orally stimulated them. Later I was greeted by one of the girls, but someone called the girls and she had to go."
"922"	"(04/10/66)"	"I was sitting on a bed. A girl about 19 crawled over me to get past. As she passed, she jokingly said, ""We're engaged."" I rested my hand on her buttocks as she passed.

Then I met another boy about 15. He wore glasses and was intellectual. He spoke to me about the mind. He said that the important thing is the other second thought. (Before going to bed yesterday, I pondered the problem of whether so-called opposites such as male and female are in fact opposites or ""others."") Later I was with the first boy. As he walked out of earshot, a girl came over to me and commented that I was ""sure getting friendly with that boy."" ""You must like him,"" she said. I felt embarrassed by her comment."

They went down a stairs to the basement of a building. The boy wanted to do something drastic, but the mother held him back. Then she told him to bury a bundle of sticks that she handed him in the basement. The boy took it and went downstairs. (Yesterday, someone commented that in the dictionary a ""faggot"" is not a homosexual, but a bundle of sticks. I connect that with the dream. It seems to be related to my relations with my father.)"

The woman and I became separated. Then I met my mother. She thought I was planning to steal something. I told her I was not, but I did not tell her about the woman I was looking for. Later I saw a woman who resembled her, but then I saw that it was someone else. She was light complected, her body was healthy looking and she was very friendly."
"950"	"(05/09/66)"	"I was working someplace. I saw a collarbone come through someone's flesh. My mother said to come home right away. I ran south to catch a northbound bus. At the stop I reflected that I should have run northbound and caught the bus ahead of the one that was coming. The streets going east and west were numbered. I boarded the bus at 6th street.

"956"	"(05/16/66)"	"I was writing something about whether the human body had any meaning outside of the bare facts of life. I felt as though I had an orgasm, but my organ was dry. I was happy that I had not had one. I had a saintly feeling that my body was pure, clean and healthy, and I had a feeling of euphoria."
"957"	"(05/16/66)"	"I was playing a phonograph. It had a regulator to increase and decrease the tempo. It was a new invention that I had never before seen. The automatic kept putting the needle at a point away from the turntable made of material like a woman's panties. It had a snap on it like a corset. Another was made of stocking material (woman's silk stocking). A young girl (or boy) about 15 came and took them, saying they belonged to someone."
"958"	"(05/17/66)"	"I went into a church. A Mass was being said. My mother and sister were on the other side of the church. My sister was talking so loudly that she was disturbing the others. She saw me and called to me. Then she walked in front of the communion rail to get to me. She spoke loudly to my mother, who answered her. Then my mother followed her. The priest glanced at them from the altar. Later I was touring a residential area where I had lived years before. Other men were there. I wanted to climb a steeple. A man gave me a boost.

When it stopped, I made some noise and a nurse came to see if anything was the matter. Then she left."
"961"	"(05/19/66)"	"I was with other men. There were frame buildings like barracks. One did not have a basement and was several feet from the ground. Someone had put some feces under there. Everyone inside wondered where the odor was coming from. Later I was on a hill. Some material was there to stop erosion. I wanted to get to the bottom so I could go to the restroom and urinate. I slid down the hill, and my body made a groove. I was worried about the groove causing erosion. (When I awoke, I related the feces and urine to the body and blood, bread and wine, dandruff and sweat, snow and rain, wood and fire.) A creation, like a baby."

"968"	"(05/24/66)"	"I was with a married woman. We were looking for a spot in which to make love. Her husband came, and I slipped out of sight. He acted as though he suspected something. Later I was in charge of some production. There was some mechanical trouble."

An infant was there, and was crying and saying that a snake had bitten it. I picked it up and examined the bite on its foot. I looked for a nurse. People were around. Then I wondered whether it was a boy or a girl. I started to open its clothing, but I stopped because I was embarrassed because of the people all around. I came to a nurse's office and I put it down. I wondered what I would do with it then, after the bite was treated."

"975"	"(05/29/66)"	"I was able to purchase some food with some tickets until a certain time. I bought some canned food. Then I went back later to buy more, but it was too late. I would have to come the next day. I put the canned food I'd bought into a bin. Someone was advertising a new kind of tissue. I took some and helped advertise it. Later at the bin I saw that in other bins there were appliances like vacuum cleaners. I was surprised that they could be bought with the tickets. I had a moving sign with a girl in a nursery rhyme. Santa Claus danced gaily on the front lawn. He told a helper to polish his boots. Later I noticed that some fruit was missing from the bin."

The madman looked down upon the people through an observation platform. There were some nuns among the prisoners. I tried to escape. There were some prisoners below on a street within the madman's property. I was led with some others to the streets outside the property. I asked to use a phone, hoping to call the police, but I learned that there was a recorded voice that interfered with the connections. The madman was nearby and he jeered at me, suspecting what I had attempted. A policeman was nearby, and I cried out to him that I was being held prisoner. He listened and nodded."
"982"	"(06/02/66)"	"A man who was assigned to watch me at a hospital said he would let me run away. I had been assigned to raise the flag, but he said he would do it for me.

It housed a department store. I found the building, but I couldn't find the stairs leading to the shop. It was on the 8th or 9th floor. I climbed a wall to get to the shop. When I reached the window of the shop, I had a sudden fear of falling. A man was there, and told me not to think about what I was doing. I tried thinking of something else, and I wasn't afraid any more. (Comment: Yesterday I was told that I was being sent to Staff today.)"

I had to avoid a certain building, because it was part of County Hospital. Then a little later my mother was with me in a house. As she went out the door, she told me to meet her at Macy's.

Then they looked in my direction, and one said, ""let's go into the other room."" I surmised that they had been embarrassed in my presence. I felt resentful about it.

I had to buy something at a ticket office costing $100, then I tried to buy a ticket.

I had to hurry because I was to leave for somewhere with a group of people. Later, outside, I stepped down some concrete steps. A wall was being built around it. I accidentally knocked a piece of wet cement ornament with my shoe. I noticed that it was of wood set in the cement. A worker thought I had loosened it, but he saw that it was tight. The one on the other side was loose instead."

I wanted to discuss something intellectual with a man, so instead of speaking, I drew diagrams to describe my theories. The slim man saw me, and was angry at me. Later I obtained information about cancer cells, and how they are destroyed. There are three areas. The first is attacked, then the third, and then the center area is closed in upon. I drew a diagram of the strategy. Later I walked past a stage. A boy was standing on it. He had been at our house annoying my mother. I told him he'd better stay away from the house. He laughed and said, ""Did your mother tell you to say that?"" I replied that my mother does not tell me to do things. I said he will have to deal with me as well as my mother if he persists in annoying us. Then he left, and reappeared dressed as a girl. At first I did not recognize him, and I said to tell the boy that I am watching him. Then he laughed and I recognized his voice. He was acting as a girl in a play."

Later I was in the aisle, and I undressed. Then I went back to my seat and I asked myself aloud why I had undressed. An officer was nearby. I dressed and went outside. A real estate man was driving a car that had a camera-like gadget in it and the car resembled a police car. I was sure it was a police car at first, and I wondered why the salesman was driving it. Later the officer I had seen inside came up to me and said I should pray. I walked toward a bus stop to catch a bus. When I had gone a ways, I noticed that I had passed my usual corner. I missed the bus. I caught another bus and asked if it was going to Long Island. A woman answered no, but she said she would phone and find out how I could get there. She told another woman to phone.

The outside walls were stucco and painted. We walked through some hallways in some old and dirty apartment buildings. We were on the third floor and came to a window where I usually had to climb to a ledge on a roof to get to the place where we were going. But I discovered that we were at the wrong window. The ledge on the roof was too narrow at this window for us to walk on. So we walked back, and the man said he was going to tell others how poorly the people lived there.

Her voice had an excited tone as she said the words. Enclosed in the envelope was a newspaper photo and it pictured a parade with a colored woman in the lead. She was a celebrity. My aunt said in the letter that her eyes were bad and she could not read the name of the celebrity. I showed the photo to a stout colored man who was standing nearby with a woman.
