"001"	"(05/13/1999)"	"South of Canal St. in Chinatown we were using the Chinese factory after hours to frame pictures and glue them. Joe Fong cut out beautiful, eery, disturbed pictures of blue houses and glued them against black and white skies. He left glue bubbles everywhere. I went down to the corner to wait for my sister. I waited and waited. A guy came by and said, ""What are you doing?"" And I said, ""I'm not sure. If I wait here my sister will walk by."" He said, ""Then I'll wait for you."" I climbed up the ladder to look and see a few of the cards we'd made but really they were junk. William accidentally threw a roll of paper towels out the window onto a busy Chinatown street. Then Carlos threw a stapler out the window. Then a stranger threw a wrench. We agreed it was time to pour wet cement. One inch thick and boards on sides. The Chinese children were running a scam. I could see the sunlight in little girls' hair. Golden sunshine sparkles. I looked over my shoulder for Dora. It was an old show from a TV that was playing. I walked up a steep staircase and was trying to find where we parked the car in Chinatown. I remembered kicking the door 3 times. On top of the building was s steep roof covered with tiny Chinese lanterns. I started stomping lanterns and a girl said, ""What's wrong?"" And I said, ""My sister used to love these."" She said, ""Have you ever had a telepathic experience?"" And I said, ""Yes."" An artist in prison was standing up on a desk. His cell was 8-sided with windows and painted yellow. He was sitting tracing his feet and trying to paint a comma, huge, in one window because, he said, ""What's behind it goes on and on, like what's behind corners. Endless words. Endless space. He was happy drawing."
"002"	"(05/13/1999)"	"I was putting together a plastic bag full of buttons and sewing paraphernalia. It was time to break out of a Hong Kong prison and I was on the fourth tier cell block. I had to wait till the window washers were busy and distract them by throwing ping pong balls so fire hoses filled with cyanide could be squirted on passers-by. I threw a rock through a plate glass window. A thunderstorm had blown up from the south and a guy said I had to be real careful. (The job paid) $4000 to work Sunday through Wednesday with one day off. ""Now count the money,"" she told me, and handed me a stack of counterfeit bills. One five. Two tens, twenty-eight twenties and a $14 bill with (a picture of) millions of New Yorkers. She said, ""Leave or I'll shoot."" I had to squirt the fire hose uphill to wash the bubbles out of the grass. Then the boss lady said, ""I had 3 men working for 4 days and had to shoot them with cyanide sulfide. CLEAN UP THESE BUBBLES AND CYANIDE. Count the $4000. Two of them have the day off."""
"003"	"(05/15/1999)"	"It was time for Holy Communion in the church. Paula and the priest, left to get things ready but I saw cellophane packs of saltine crackers on the coffee table. 8 crackers to a pack. A guy was in church for the first time and I said, ""You know what they're gonna do with these crackers?"" And he said, ""What?"" and I smashed one pack with my fist. ""They do it that way at country churches."" And he said, ""Oh, I better sit in the balcony."" I said, ""It's the old Poplar Springs vs. Mount Gallagher thing."" I put another pack of saltine crackers in my knapsack along with a Webster's dictionary and a bruised banana. (I was) working a job proofreading and there was copy spread all over the table. Newsprint catalogs with long lists of job codes. The boss man said something to hurt Dora's feelings and I screamed out, ""Don't you ever do that again! I could hurt your feelings if I wanted to."" He said, ""Go ahead."" I said, ""There's no reason to hurt someone's feelings."" He said, ""Well I'll hurt yours. You're too quiet on the job."" I laughed and said, ""I'm proofreading. What do you expect with foreign languages?"" A girl, Thomlina, came by and asked me where the boss was and I said, ""What do I look like? A goddamn secretary?"" The boss had been temporarily hidden from view, but was clearly working at the heat press wearing a blue shirt. I tried to find something in my knapsack and while I was looking I scattered things inadvertently all over the floor. A guy said, ""You are too messy."" I said, ""It's my work station. It doesn't bother me. I do a good job. Just try to find a mistake."" But all the while I knew I'd fallen asleep on the job. I couldn't fit everything I'd taken out back into my knapsack so I started making selections on what to keep. The only thing that was really important was my father's black Webster's dictionary from college with the caveman writing. Under the flap of my address book where business cards were suppose to go I'd put rice cakes and a slab of peanut brittle. On the loudspeaker the pilot said, ""All those going direct flight from LA to NY back to LA non-stop."" I said, ""What's the point. You're just killing time. And anyway I was looking for the MetroNorth train."" He said, ""Try the ground."" I ran down the beach and there was a subway station in the sand. The red light was blinking and beeping. I ran. Other people were running. I knew if I missed the train I'd have to wait another hour (to meet Rudy). The sign said: <-- scenic tours Poughkipsee and I asked the token lady, ""Which way to NY?"" She said, ""Where in NY?"" I said, ""NY, NY."" She said, ""The city or the state? I said, ""Both."" She said, ""Not here."" I said, ""How do I get there?"" She said, ""Go wait by that yellow house. About halfway back and a few blocks over."" I said, ""Don't you know a street or anything?"" She said, ""It's the YELLOW house in the middle of the block."" I asked a guy if he knew a street name and he said, ""Try Dobbs Ferry."" I was thinking about Super8 films stuck on a broomstick like donuts and categorized with writing on white tape; or that was the eventual plan."
"004"	"(05/16/1999)"	"There was a cupcake on a stick at a bakery and I asked the guy, ""How'd you do that?"" And he said, ""With a homemade can opener. It cuts around the edges of corks."" There was laundry going. Mine, Carlos's and Marianna's. Carlos said, ""Watch those clothes!"" I said, ""I'm watching,"" but really I had fallen to sleep. The clothes going in circles were hypnotic. I was watching Marianna's clothes because she was very busy. The clothes were dry and I took them out of the dryer. 2 bras. One was black padded with cheap fiberfill. Very Sears and very worn out. The other was clear translucent mesh with black feathers around the top. I meant to try them on but I forgot. Dirty plates and congealed gravy were left on the dining room table. My mother said, ""Rudy's just got back from this job interview. Merri, make some gravy with this water. Jesus could turn this gravy into wine."" I said, ""Red wine on rice is not very good,"" because I knew they did not have white wine in the New Testament. She said, ""Well pretend there's wine in gravy and we'll leave Jesus out of this. There's water in the electric frying pan."" Blue on Cheerios boxes had a subliminal message, ""BUY ME"". Scientific experiments were done at the grocery store to see if more people bought bright electric blue boxes or powder blue boxes of Cheerios more often. Ross was waiting for the bus and she said, ""Do you have 3 bucks to lend me for some soda and some water?"" I said, ""It's almost dark. The bank is closed so I can't get any money."" She was pacing back and forth and sighing loudly in frustration. ""Can't you go down the hill to the bank and wait there all night for the bank to open? Can you send heavy eyeliner to Russia, and do you have 20 cents for the bus??!! (spoken frantically nervous and fast) I said, ""Lighten up"" Note: the next day I told Marianna about this dream and she said, ""Oh my god, I only had one worn out black bra from K-Mart and Les just got me a new black lace one."""
"005"	"(05/18/1999)"	"I was at the creek. An old lady who was invisible was sitting on the bank watching minnows. One of the minnows was her husband but she was the only one who knew that. I was trying to catch the minnows in my hands and cup my hands together to hold them there. The little fishy's iridescent scales sparkled in the sun. Dora was on the other side of the creek but no one could see her there in the sunshine. I caught 3 minnows and I could feel them flopping around. The invisible lady on the opposite creek bank was worried. I knew her husband had stopped flopping around and that meant he was dead. There was a tiny little boy in a birdcage. He was no more than 1/2 inch tall. He was swinging on the little bird swing like Tweety. I was making him a present out of a piece of red tape about 3 inches long and it needed a bow so I tore a piece of yellow paper that had sticky stuff on the back. I tore it vertically so it would look like a ribbon on the present. I was very excited to be giving him a present as he did not have any. I stuffed the present through the bars of the bird cage. The thing I wanted more than anything was sound effects from ambulances and she (Dora) went to all kinds of trouble to get these sounds for me. She knew I was intrigued by these and straight jackets. She communicated with me through a non-franchised fast food 'may I take your order' stand ((drive-thru)) The name of the old high school was Cecil B. Mills named after the black assistant principal Mr. (Clarence) Mills who could not speak understandable English. But half the letters had fallen off so they just rearranged the leftover letters to call it something else. Rudy had been hit and there was blood all over him dripping on his shirt and a photographer was taking pictures and I screamed at him to GET AWAY! Down the street at the grammar school the prisoners were doing the guarding and the guards got locked up. (Prison exchange program). You never knew quite what was going to happen next. Susan was sitting on the floor of the sewing room leaving Dana and Rover the blind dog a message that she had a present for them. ""A case of sodas!"" I accidentally hung up the phone while she was still talking but she couldn't hear the dial tone because she was still listing surprises so it was OK. I kept walking across the street and back with a card for tennis racket discounts that were in effect till September."
"006"	"(05/19/1999)"	"Trying to get out of the tree house with Evelyn. She first made a series of phone calls. We were on a weathered unpainted tree house platform hooked up by pulleys on chains and had to haul ourselves to the top of the circus tent. Barbed wire was everywhere and it would be a tight squeeze to get out alive but the union workers appeared to help us, only they didn't do much except tell us what we were required to have, how many people it'd take to get it, and how long. ""What you need is some air,"" the guy told me. What he meant was that air was softer than barbed wire to step on. The union workers cut the label off a hug 6 ft. tall bottle of Clorox with an electric saw and drilled it onto the shovel of the bulldozer. They radioed for a bulldozer to get busy. Harvey was sitting in the library between rows of shelves learning to work the computer. A little boy next to him was playing a video game, eating french fries off the monitor. He had poured ketchup all over the top of the computer monitor and dipped each french fry into the puddle of ketchup. And a little boy to the left of Harvey was riding a bump car and the kid kept bumping the bump car into everything. I was at the library to research layouts for postage stamp design. It covered 32 different layout designs on a grid plotted on the coordinates of logarithmic equations. The equations were based on the intersecting points of the drawings and letters (type) on the stamps. There was a picture on a stamp about American families; a cartoon that was suppose to be like the Simpsons but they had the hugging happy family, instead of them hitting each other in the head with chairs. I was angry because the postage stamp portrayed American families as hugging when they really wanted to hit each other over the head with chairs. A skinny British man with a hat made from a cloth flour sack on his head challenged Peter O'Toole to a challenge of disintegrating into the sand. They were attempting to travel through the sand on their elbows and disappear into the sand. I wasn't sure what winning was, because whoever won would have already completely disintegrated into the sand and wouldn't be here anymore."
"007"	"(05/20/1999)"	"There was a Moses hologram card with drippy blood letters like horror movies; about Moses and Jesus producers. On the back half was an invitation to church. In between the lockers loud music was playing sort of like punk stray cats, and punk rock kids were dancing in the hallways. They were so happy to be dancing they started throwing their clothes all over the floor. The music was so good and I was dancing. But eventually we had to leave the hallway and go home. Between 5-6 p.m. there was an advertising meeting. They said at 5-6 p.m. they were either closed for the day or out to lunch or very busy with marketing and will get behind and then you won't get your paycheck. I knew I didn't work there anyway so it didn't matter. While she was still talking I just walked away and she didn't even notice she was talking so much. I went back to the classroom. In the time it took me to talk to that talker lady he had gotten a 4-year college degree in chemistry. We talked about the vertical strength necessary to balance out horizontal weight. The original 3 bank robbers robbed the N train which went through Belton Honea Path. They took the horses back in the woods behind the tool shed. The man asked me, ""Did you see any bank robbers?"" And I didn't answer him because he saw them too and I didn't know what he was getting at with that question. "
"008"	"(05/20/1999)"	"Going to Grandma's, just over the bridge at Rocky River on Mitchell Presley's hill there was a rabid dog on the hill. He had gnawed up a carcass but you could see the left side of the hind legs. It was either a wolf or a cow. We locked the car doors. At our house on Maplebrook we'd never once had Doritos, but we had them. A big family bag. My mother said, ""If you eat those things you won't eat your supper,"" but she was eating them. ""They always make you thirsty,"" she said. And I got some water, because we never had cokes at home. ""I worked so hard on supper and now nobody's gonna eat their supper,"" she said, ""I boiled 2 eggs for supper but there's only one and a half left. A half is in the kitchen and a whole egg is left over from Easter. It's in that basket on the piano."" But we were trying to concentrate on reading the newspaper. It had funny headlines. It had a picture of a local high school Christian group and the headline said, ""GOD IS MOD"". It had a picture of Coach O'Rear. And then on the other side of the newspaper it had a high school drawing that was so bad it was good. On the wedding page it had a drawing of a guy's girlfriend and he'd scrawled out in black crayon, ""Look at those tits."" I was at a swimming pool and Dora was there. There was a swimming race. Dora was so calm. She said, ""There's no need to race."" Everybody was talking about whether swimming with a wet suit would make you faster, or the color of the wet suit that would make you swim faster. That film changing bag when you put your film in the canister, when the lights aren't out in the darkroom, or when you can't have the red light on in the darkroom, or even the amber light? I was carrying that around waiting to go to the ladies' bathroom at church and Merri Lindley told me to hold her two pencils. ""Hold these two pencils and don't get them dirty,"" she said. I had enough to keep track of without having to worry about those two pencils. I put them in the film changing bag and all the time I was worried that they were going to poke a hole in it. When I got off the train at West 4 St station, the 8th St exit, on Greenwich St. was a new ""Gay/Bi"" Coffee shop. The sign was pink and brown and they didn't finish painting it. Profiles were painted on it sort of mod. I'd wanted some coffee all day. Their coffee had some kind of cocoa or chocolate flavor but I'd never tasted it before. I drank it through a straw. There were 9 employees but no customers. 2 guys and 1 girl X 3. It was getting dark and Ester said, ""Merri, I just happened to be in the neighborhood."" ""What are you doing Ester?"" I asked. ""I'm editing a film about a rap star. His name is Sammy Junior Daby."" ""You mean Sammy Davis Junior?"" ""No, It's Sammy Junior Daby."" ""Oh"" I said ""You wanna take a walk?""Evelyn asked me. ""I don't have my shoes. People in this city get so uptight about going barefoot. I'll walk halfway with you, but then I have to go walk around the tractor tire. It takes a lot of practice."""
"009"	"(05/20/1999)"	"My mother and Aunt Linda were supposed to meet William at a restaurant for breakfast before church. The restaurant was on 41st St., in the 5 points part of Columbia. I wasn't sure if William was gonna be there because when I called the hotel, the clerk had no idea if he was there or not. I figured if he wasn't there, they'd end up taking me to church so I said, ""I'll run and meet you there."" I was wearing my camouflage army pants and Uncle Bob quoted a bible verse and my father yelled out, ""FIRST THESSALONIANS!"" I said, ""Dad, I didn't know you knew any Bible verses."" He just laughed and said, ""Would you get me some army surplus pants at Macy's?"" I looked around but I did not see any army surplus pants--there was one (pair of) Levi's rip-off, non-authentic army pants. While I was waiting 2 little kittens came and played. One was black and very little and young. The other was months older. The little kitten was making worms out of (blue) play-doh and eating them. Dora said he was trying to communicate that he needed to have some worm medicine. I could even see her watching the little kitten and could tell she was very concerned. She loved the kitty. The older kitten was a bit more reserved. I'd been wearing army pants for the archaeological dig--hieroglyphics on slabs of stone from Egyptian pyramids and tombs. The 5 inch slab of rock had hieroglyphics all over it and the scientist was scraping out dirt with a screwdriver. He'd scraping hard and fractured the Egyptian stone and said, ""Well, we might as well go ahead and smash it. It's broken anyway."" And he lifted it up and threw it down on the floor."
"010"	"(05/21/1999)"	"A lady was drawing the sky with 2 pastels. One was sky blue. The other was periwinkle blue. She was nervous and kept peeling the paper off the ends. The 2 layers of clouds were conversations between 2 people at different altitudes. So the wind currents blew the conversation and the clouds would blend into each other meaning the conversation was incoherent and that's when things got interesting. My father was picking out a place to go hang gliding in the mountains. I had a parachute man bout 4 inches tall and green plastic, and the parachute was white plastic connected with white sewing thread. I was getting my parachute man ready to throw him up in the air. I'd been making earrings. Circles with different centers. The dimension of the inner circle was about .75 as the outer one. Other earrings were oxidized dimes on the 'heads' side coated with shiny stuff to keep rust from getting in your ears. The CIA Bomb Squad was setting up bobby traps and wiring the aluminum fold-up tables with explosives. The children liked to sit under the aluminum table and I knew the CIA was going to blow them up. There were triplets who were about 5 years old, who came to the garage to play. They were wearing footie pajamas the color of lime sherbet. There was a basketball goal but no ball. The older children came to play--unaware they were about to be annihilated. They tried to detonate the bomb underneath the aluminum tabletop. Christy was waiting on me. She did not want to go play tennis. I was playing the piano and she said she was tired of waiting on me. I had NO INTENTION of going. Instead I climbed up on the roof and looked at the shingles. My father said we had no running water till he fixed the pipes. There were lots of doors to open to the basement and different people behind each one."
"011"	"(05/21/1999)"	"4 of us were in a car wreck. Me, the rich son (of the rich lady) who was driving, a stranger, and Sheena. We were trying to find home when the rich boy took a dirt road and went up on 2 wheels and there was so much dust you couldn't see. The car turned over on its side, upside down and started filling up with gasoline. I was not worried about dying but I was disappointed that I wouldn't get to finish learning the Chopin piece I was working on. I opened one window enough to start draining out the gasoline and shook the car to see if they were breathing. The stranger and the rich boy were but it didn't look like Sheena was. Finally she came around and said, ""What are you doing?"" I said, ""We had a car wreck, that's what."" The wooden box at Grandma's was painted blue and I was suppose to collect lumber scraps from off the woodpile. A coat hanger with a 1 inch square long board was attached to it with a wire and a cylinder tube and other pieces of lumber. They were falling all over the place and I couldn't keep them in my arms so I just let them fall and they were clanging loud. My Aunt Dianne's 'medication' was on the table but I knew that just meant they could afford a doctor to write a prescription for what they wanted. She said, ""Merri, don't WE want to dress up a little bit so the boys will wear suits?' I said, ""Let 'em wear whatever they want to."" She said, ""We,"" but she meant me. (You)"
"012"	"(05/25/1999)"	"Eddie and Harvey were working in the darkroom, which was light, and was actually Nanny and Grandfather's living room. The pictures were where the fireplace was and under Bryan Hunt's table in the middle of the room on the shelf level, close to the floor, were empty metal coffee cans that held pencils and paintbrushes. But Harvey was looking for real coffee. ""I want the instant kind!"" he said, and he meant ""Krasdale"" or ""Parade,"" in the plastic bottle that looks like it's glass. I wanted to help him but I wanted to watch him too. I remembered where I put it but he was having such a good time looking for it, that he was going to keep looking for it, because it was sort of like Easter eggs. I had all these tee shirts hanging on a hat rack where I was suppose to have fiber prints drying and then I spread them out on the couch, but I remembered that Jasmine sat on the right end of the couch on her break from class. I thought, ""Let me move these tee shirts over,"" and I arranged them so I could see one letter (not the whole word) from each tee shirt. Each tee shirt had its own personality. I said, ""Wait! One tee shirt's not here. I know Eddy didn't move it and Harvey didn't move it."" It was white and had blue letters on it. A post adolescent black girl was wearing my missing Ware Shoals tee shirt and stretching it all out because she had really big boobs. She was very cute and had a bad attitude. She said, ""Do you want this back?"" And I said, ""Yes."" She said , ""Well let me go over by the screen door where I can hear the music coming over the loudspeaker in the garage."""
"013"	"(05/25/1999)"	"In the kitchen there was a toilet and I looked inside and saw that I had dumped an ashtray full of cigarette butts in the toilet and forgot to flush it. ""My mother's going to kill me,"" I said. I went out to the garage and saw Eddie and his sister in the 69 Chevrolet Impala convertible. His sister was giving him a driving lesson. Eddy was screeching out and slamming on brakes and moving about 6 inches at a time before the car would choke down. I said, ""Eddie, have you ever driven before?"" And he said, ""No."" And his sister said, ""That's why I got really bad insurance because Eddie will probably wreck the car."" She was sitting in the back seat with her feet propped up on the back of the front seat. She was barefooted. She was laughing and Eddie was laughing, and there was barbed wire wrapped around the car. I said, ""Eddie, you're really a bad driver. Why don't you let me drive."" But I was a worse driver. I said, ""Well that's the road to Grandma's, and I've said that enough times."" All this time Harvey had been sitting under the table looking for things. The hotel swimming pool was completely in shadow. Carlos was there. He brought me a big raw turkey leg and a T-bone steak he'd microwaved for 4 hours. I thought he knew I was a vegetarian, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings since he'd brought me a present, so I held the turkey leg in my left hand and the steak in my right. I was developing my pictures in the fireplace and when I put the RC paper in the developer I saw pictures that came out of my film, but they were of Teletubbies and football players. And I HATE TELETUBBIES. I HATE THEM ! The teacher said, ""How do you get the NFL Football players and Teletubbies together for one shot?"" I said, ""I didn't even know they were there. I just pressed the button."" She said, ""My husband's picture was in the newspaper, because he either died or got a job, I can't remember which one."" Back in the kitchen Carlos finally said, ""Merri I'll put that turkey leg and steak in a ziplock bag. But not in the same one together."" I said, ""Okay."" And I went back to flush the toilet with the cigarette butts in it and watch them go around. I tried to remember if it was centripetal or centrifugal force that made the toilet water swirl around and go down."
"014"	"(05/26/1999)"	"Rudy had a computer made out of slabs of rocks. It had a sundial and 3 holes where he had to stick a Bic pen into a hole and activate the Morse code, which were 3 different horizontal knobs on a curve. There was no keyboard so checking e-mail was a very complicated and lengthy process and if he made one mistake he had to start all over. Rudy said, ""Merri, why don't you go get laid?"" Troy just sat there and I didn't know if he said that because he didn't want to show me how to e-mail or if he thought I was a loser with no boyfriend. And I said, ""It's not that easy for girls."" What he said and thought were different from what I imagined. A girl was in the back of the jeep with expensive hot pink swirly pencils. She said, ""Everyone will know I'm affluent because of my exquisite pencils."" I said, ""I like the plain yellow number 2 pencils."" She said, ""My pencils are so beautiful (that) I wouldn't even use them."" I said, "" Evelyn had a beautiful pencil. It was yellow and short and all chewed up."" Troy was sitting in front of one of the computers and poured out a big bowl of Captain Crunch with Crunch Berries and the Crunch Berries were unusually large. About the size of golf balls or a little bigger and it was pouring down raining and because of the comment he had hurt my feelings I was going out in the rain. ""It's raining pretty hard out there,"" Rudy said. ""You shouldn't go out in that rain."" ""Oh yeah?"" I said, knowing full well what he meant, so I walked out after I looked for my raincoat and could only find my jacket. I walked out in the big rain storm, knowing full well (that) getting laid was not my intention, but getting stuck in the rain storm was. At the end of the road (on the left side) was construction with workers on break and they were wearing what they wanted to wear and not what they had to wear, because they were in the union. One of the construction workers was an undercover cop. He looked at my coat and said, ""Anything in those pockets I should know about?"" I thought about it and said, ""No."" He said, ""What's this?"" I said, ""Allergy medicine. He said, ""Can you prove it?"" I said, ""I can sneeze and scratch my eyes."""
"015"	"(05/28/1999)"	"I was in the auditorium about 2/3 down and toward the front. I was waiting for Jeffery to come. I had waited 2 weeks. I was lying down on the bench where you were suppose to sit and put my head under the shelf desk there. He said, ""Are you keeping your elbow underwater?"" Then we discussed aspects of human behavior. I waited amidst the junk cars across the road from the factory. The driveway was a dirt road. The people couldn't run anymore so they just sat there. You could watch the factory people come and go. There was a film maker there and I had to ask him a question. Something about palettes. He said, ""Well, that'd be good."" People would go in the factory and go back out. They were whispering. Their heads would disappear behind the pine trees. I left the factory and came back and there was a lady; she had gray hair. The police came and yelled, ""Everybody down on the ground. And if you didn't get down, they would ""BAM"" knock you down to the ground. The cop went up to the older lady and pushed her down hard onto the dirt. It was a dirt road. I thought he was going to stab her, but instead he kissed her. I thought, ""What's going on?"" The girl from ""X"" (the band). We got thrown off the stage and she was screaming about the sound levels. We thought we could stall them to come down off the ladder off the high stage, but the crowd was too angry. Marianna was there. I was in the East Village near a trash dump and I saw all these pots and pans somebody had thrown away. I needed one but I didn't want to carry it, so I just left them there. I was enjoying a run in the rain, when I ended up at college. People were not learning very hard. I saw a picture of a bunny rabbit and ducks and a snowman. Instead of coal for buttons he had little pieces of wallpaper. There were flowers and it was very interesting. So was the duck. There was a dead bird that had been dipped in paint. There were also lavender feathers across one wingspan (8-12"") and somebody had attached a funky little (1"") baby doll inside the wing. It was not a sissy baby doll. The baby doll was glued inside half a broken eggshell. There was a lady who had been keeping an icebox on the roof. Inside it she had milk and a spoon and some sugar for corn flakes. She had some Cornflakes too. As far as I know she was an opera singer. She was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I said, ""What are you doing?"" She said, ""I found her stash. She keeps it under the table."" I saw the Cornflakes box and there was a chicken on it. Then the cops came up there. When she came tearing through the kitchen door, they said, ""Hold your fire! It's just Marianna. When we find him we'll have to shoot the perpetrator."" Marianna turned into the girl from X and I was holding onto a rope from the ceiling that held Marianna up on stage. The guy in her band was trying to put on a swim cap so he could put on a wig. We were suppose to pull up the ladder like pueblos but instead she threw the ladder into the crowd. I had gone running in the rain and stopped at the old YMCA and a guy in a room told me about the officer and in a suit and he said, ""Hey, You have blonde hair."" For some reason I decided to roll my hair and it was a defective hairstyle. I said, ""I'm going out."" The guy I had seen the previous night saw a white tee-shirt and he said, ""This would look nice on you"" and I tried it on and it was wonderful. He had on a Sunday suit and shirt that was very narrow so you ((he)) could not move both arms at once. "
"016"	"(05/29/1999)"	"On the subway. The first time I'd gone because it was raining and my fishing documentary film had been cancelled. I knew the fish wouldn't care if it was raining because they were already wet but nobody asked me. That time I'd walked home from 23 St. after taking the subway to there, it was a 23 mile walk. The second time I took the subway; I did not know where I was going. Mostly because my room was a mess and starting to smell and I needed to ask someone if I could take a shower in their bathroom because there was too much junk on the floor of my shower. On the train I met people from foreign countries. Many OBVIOUSLY different nationalities were speaking shared languages--though 3 or 4 conversations in different languages were going on simultaneously. The guy asked me, ""Where are you going?"" And I said, ""I don't know."" And he said, ""What?"" And I said, ""I don't know."" And he said, ""What?"" (for the third time) And I said, ""I don't know. "" ...and he looked at me funny so I said, ""I can't pronounce things because I have a cold."" And he said, ""Oh."" When I got to the diner at the 23 St. exit my bike was parked outside and had a tag that said, ""FOR SALE"" and I was about to tear it off when I saw a note in red ink that said, ""Merri, I paid a visit to your bicycle on your mother's front porch. -- Love, Zeb"" I was so happy Zeb had been somewhere close to me even if I had been asleep. I'd been collecting banana stickers and sticking them on everything around me and then the sticky stuff and 2 paper layers started coming apart. I went out walking. I was in search of army men--whole bags of them at the 99 cent store. There was only one bag of army men but I only had one dollar."
"017"	"(05/29/1999)"	"There was a TV show and I was in the live studio audience. There was a game announcer and an audience of contestants; possible contestants. The requirements to be in the audience were that you had to have quit smoking. There were 3 rounds of action. The lively announcer called names. If they called your name you were suppose to run up on the stage. The first opportunity was in round one of the action. You had to carry as many packs of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands, knowing full well it was the only time and place you could ever smoke again. You had to carry as many packs or cartons of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands and pockets--according to how much money was in your pockets and how much you could carry. They chose to smoke or not to smoke as part of the game. But to win you had to smoke a whole pack of cigarettes in 10 minutes. 20 cigarettes. In 3 rounds of the game show only girl was able to do it and she did it with ease. Those who chose not to smoke had to answer difficult geography questions. One lady dropped a bunch of packs of cigarettes and was tripping all over them and smoking flawlessly, using only one hand. We going to a picnic and my mother said, ""There is no iron in any of this food!"" Even if it is red or is meat. I wondered if I had a clean slate or if I was guilty--responsible for the lack of iron."
"018"	"(05/30/1999)"	"I was suppose to go to the psychiatrist office and there was a maze of hallways. The hallways were shaped like stiff angular letters of the alphabet. Some were dead ends. I was leading a horse down the hallway and sometimes he didn't want to go so I just had to wait for him. I was too early for the psychiatrist. I kept peeking into the offices on the hallway. There was a door about every 5 feet. A lady was at the desk. She handed me this big cup (like a big gulp cup) and said, ""We're going to test you for 3 chemical deficiencies."" I knew she meant for me to pee in the cup. I didn't say anything. I just kept looking at her like I understood what she meant, but when I opened the door to go to the bathroom, I walked away. Fast. I thought, ""Well, that certainly wasn't the psychiatrist office."" I walked back where I came from to find the psychiatrist. I was still leading horsey. I saw this office door and there was a second little doorway in front of the desk. Newspaper was taped 2/3 or 1/2 down over the doorway and you could see somebody's feet. I hadn't seen him before but I knew it was him."
"019"	"(05/30/1999)"	"He was sitting behind a newspaper that was taped over the doorway. He was wearing a suit (I could tell by his feet) and he commented on my hairstyle. ""It's the same as mine,"" he said. ""Do you ever look exactly the same on 2 different days?"" he asked me. And I said, ""No."" He said, ""Our hair is the very same color. On me it's called brown. On you it's called blonde. That's because I'm a boy and you're a girl."" He (the unidentified psychiatrist) was practicing writing, back there behind the newspaper. He had a yellow pad and an ink pen. He was practicing his cursive and he was doing very good. He was concentrating very hard. Then he remembered about the tape recorder and the confession of the murder. So when it was time for me to come in he was still behind the taped up newspaper in the doorway. The newspaper was not any further away than his knees. He said, ""You can come in now,"" and he punched his arm through the newspaper. Then you could see him. He just ripped the newspaper. ""You know, there are some people who are going to tell you that horses are not allowed in the hallway. Personally, it doesn't bother me but I'm just telling you, some people are going to give you a hard time."" I was telling him about horses' respiratory systems and why they can run so fast. I went into the garage and there were these boots sitting on top of the 50 gallon oil drum. I thought they were beautiful, until I realized they were imitation army boots and not the real thing. The fake boots had 3 inch cork heels and this made me mad. They didn't even have real shoestrings. They had imitation eyelets and zippers on the sides. When I lifted it I knew it was just too lightweight to be an army boot. In the room I had been looking for books of Dora's about kitties and about flowers. My mother said, ""Merri, where did you put those books? I can't find them."" I said, ""I know they're in a safe place. They were Dora's books. I love them."" My mother was not listening to what I said so I grabbed a glass bottle off the counter shelf and BAM. I broke it. I threw it on the floor."
"020"	"(05/30/1999)"	"I had to get up real early to go from way, way uptown to way downtown. I was rollerskating along the Hudson River. When I got about halfway there, I heard somebody yell, ""Merri."" So I stopped. They said, ""your name has been pulled out for SAG's film version of jury duty. I can tell you right now you're going to be on the jury for a month and a half."" The Sag group was on an island and I was trying to figure out how to get off the island to the left of NY with the moat around it (the island). I knew it wasn't too far to swim, so I left my roller skates, my bag and bag of laundry and tried the water. The water currents were run by electricity with waterfalls and suckholes that were powered by electricity too. What looked like rocks from the outside was not real rocks, but metal rods like those that build roller coasters. The metal rods and screws formed a framework and sheet metal was hammered over it. I looked like real rocks. The current (that) took me underneath and the waterfall was run by a machine just like the underside of a lawnmower but much bigger. It had a huge rotating blade that cuts. It came close to chopping me up. I was worried it would chop up my Mozart sheet music. I was in line at the grocery store. A guy in front of me shot a girl for talking too loud. He killed her. The moat around the SAG island was to make the jurors stay there even if they wanted to leave. I had tried to fight the currents and almost got chopped up. I thought about trying to roller skate across the river's floor, but I knew the skates would be too heavy and I'd have to leave my stuff. I finally decided to leave the rollerskates, bag, and laundry behind and try to escape. I acted like I was an enthusiastic juror, though I kept talking about what I needed to be doing. I was making an escape plan. According to SAG rules, I knew they had to take a lunch break. So I said that I'd go out to Wendy's and get stuff for everybody but I needed to use their boat. I put a cigarette out on the rubber raft because there was no ashtray. I hoped no one would see the smoke. When I got to Wendy's things looked different. There were 3 menu choices: salad on a stick. carrots and raisins on a stick. pineapple and coconut on a stick, and cantaloupe not on a stick."
"021"	"(05/30/1999)"	"Salad on a stick was a long wooden skinny stick with hunks of lettuce and tomato quarters. Carrot disks and raisins were alternated on the carrot raisin salad sticks. Spheres of coconut (about 4"" in width, and obviously cracked violently from the coconut shell were alternated with arbitrary slices of pineapple, ranging from 3 to 6 inches. The sticks were the diameter of a bobby pin and about 18 inches long. Cantaloupe was the only thing not on a stick so I ordered that and ate it the way we did on grandpa's farm. The cashier and I were having an argument about the way cantaloupe should be eaten. I said it was a question of geography--and the way I ate cantaloupe was proper farm etiquette."
"022"	"(06/02/1999)"	"I saw empty rooms on my floor. #1446 or #1456, but then it might have been #1256. The rooms were empty and so big and I was given such a tiny room. I decided to do something about it. I decided I would either talk out loud to Roseanne or type a letter. Then I got on my bicycle and I forgot about it. I was riding down the outside edge of the railroad track cross ties. On the other side was a subway train. I was in between the train tracks and the subway tracks and trains were coming in both directions. I could feel and hear the bike going, ""ba-bump ba-bump"" on the train tracks. The mechanic was projecting gears onto the sky and the metal was metal-colored and shiny. The gears moved in the sky. Miller Lee, who'd signed many contracts and screwed them all up said that last week's projection was upsetting to him. The American flag was projected into the sky with a banana stuck on top of the flagpole. I didn't know why that would upset him when he was so mean. The mechanic was working just south of the train station. The case worker's assessment said that I had accuracy problems and did not notice boundaries and to compensate with maximum efficiency they would give me the smallest room because I was least likely of all people to notice. I knew they were wrong and the opposite was true but I had a bicycle to ride and could not dwell on this topic so long. One empty room's view had a view of a university in the shade. I rode my bike and I stood against the fence in Grandfather Anderson's driveway. Their house was empty. After a while a girl, Gina, with red tattoo of a little girl on her arm (Gina was only about 12 herself) rode up and put her bike in the garage. She walked like she knew where she was going. I asked her, ""Do you live on the 14th floor?"" She said, ""No, I have been living here for the past 3 months. My father lives here too, but he's never here."" ""What are you doing?"" I asked her, and she said, ""I'm writing a business plan for Mr. Anderson."" I knew she meant Grandfather Anderson and not my father. my father was not so interested in business. I said, ""We live right down the hill through the woods or by the road if you go down the hill turn left and the second house on the right; if you need help."" I was angry Grandfather didn't ask Rudy to write it and didn't ask me if I needed a bigger place to stay."
"023"	"(06/04/1999)"	"I wanted to make a surprise for Rudy. So I decided to align window blinds while he was asleep. They went from the ceiling to the floor and had to be aligned properly to be right. I dropped a bottle of 'Duane Reade' suntan lotion in the toilet and I didn't know what to do so I flushed it. A lady in a wheelchair had balancing rods like a cross between 'Wheel-O's' and perpetual motion machines. She was trying to balance a cup of coffee on the iron spokes, but the bottom of the cup was round, so it would NOT balance. I went to the drugstore to get some film and when I got up to the cash register after waiting in line so long--that I had to balance mathematical equations while in line. When I got there, I said, ""I need a roll of 400ASA 36 exposure tri-X."" The guy found it. I said, ""Oh, I forgot. I don't need it after all. Jasmine will give me a roll in class tomorrow. I'll get some plastic notebook sheets and some tape."" He brought back a 6-pack of tape and after he rung it up, I said, ""Oh, I only need one."" He was angry by this time. But he got the plastic sheets wrong anyway. I did not ask for the other kind--I hadn't known they existed but they were exactly what I needed. I was so excited about working in the darkroom that it was hard for me to keep my clothes on. Next to the east River, Rudy had just gotten home from boxing class. His girlfriend was standing on the left. I didn't see her at first. I'd planned a breakfast picnic for Rudy. I had fixed scrambled eggs for breakfast but I accidentally turned the water spigot on and got water all in the bowl of scrambled eggs so I drained the water out and pretended I had not screwed up breakfast. No one ate the eggs. A deranged homeless guy was throwing a pitchfork at the cop next to the railroad. He screamed, ""Aim for the eyes!"" I had been crying over Dora on top of my bed. Sidney did not know what to do so he rode his bicycle out the door."
"024"	"(06/02/1999)"	"I was life guarding and a little boy broke the rules and climbed over the fence to the private hotel swimming pool. His friend was under the diving board and the little black girl was crying trying to find her father. I had to go back to my beach lifeguard position and hitched a ride with a Chinese guy in a VW bus and he parked in the middle of Houston St. in between the lanes of traffic going different directions. The beach went all up and down the east river except under Houston St. where the street ran straight into the water. I went to the sewing class. I had to sit on the floor and sew and I was getting a little confused. I was making a quilt, but what I was making was these smocks with a white round tab circle collar. I was trying to fold the smocks into squares and make them into a quilt, but there were too many poofy layers of stuff. So I just put it down and started on something else because I didn't want to be sewing. It didn't particularly interest me. Ron was in the garage and he said he had a piano he didn't play. The piano was stored in the basement that he never played and I was carrying around my blue Mozart book. It hurt me that he had a piano he didn't play. I went to Paula's and Claire said, ""Will you help us load the dishwasher? And I said, ""OK"" There was lots of silverware and I tried to put the utensils in those little compartment trays but there were so many knifes and they were sliding all over the place. There were big spoons inside of spoons. Big stirring spoons and a soup ladle. Paula said, ""Surprise, it's your birthday!"" It wasn't but I acted like I was happy about the party. On the ship there was a book and the book was about drugs and how each drug worked and interesting things about the drug. I was flipping through the book and I saw Dramamine. It had different ways you could use it and the chemical equation and a little picture of what it made you feel like. It showed one itsy bitsy cotton ball in a big empty brain. The next drawing had 3 or 4 cotton balls squashed in an itsy bitsy brain. The next picture had about 20 cotton balls stuffed in the brain. The last picture had about a million cotton balls stuffed in the brain. What it meant was there was a whole lot of nothing going on. Dramamine, CO2, poppers, ammonia and alcohol were listed with the cartoon drawings and the chemical formula. I didn't know so many household items could do other things. A very anonymous guy was extremely nervous on the elevator because he was a junkie and he needed his fix. The other book was a kid's book about the letter ""A."" There was a drawing of a little girl and she WAS the letter ""A"". Even though we were not suppose to take a break from physics, I wanted to have story hour and read this book (about the letter ""A""). I sort of liked the pictures but I sort of didn't. It was not how I would have drawn her, but she expressed something. She had on a dress and the book was very thick. I was looking at the book of chemical equations, but people expected me to be looking at the kid's book. Paula came into the room. She told me about 3 other books about the author (of the 'A"" book). I was sitting on the floor in her room and she came in because she smelled something burning. I had accidentally burned the wax paper pack of graham crackers . Burned them black. The burned wax and burned cookie smell was bad. Paula said, ""Come on out to the party,"" And I did. There was red wine and white wine and alcoholic punch. Relatives from my mom's side were concentrating hard to avoid touching any alcohol punch. Aunt Joe lifted up the punch dipper and slurped it real loud and said for me and Rudy not to do that. She said she slurped the punch to find out if there was really any alcohol in it, and they were not just trying to conserve the punch. But I knew she was trying to get drunk. 2 Mexican boys were riding burros or donkeys--going up and down, back and forth, back and forth on the overpass, yelling. They were laughing and yelling in Spanish and having a good time. They were riding with no hands (hands in the air) and the donkeys were running upright on their 2 back legs."
"025"	"(06/06/1999)"	"The music. It was Dora. Dora was there. She was so happy because we were making Chef- Boy-Ar-Dee pizza. The kind that comes in the box that you have to make yourself. It has a tall skinny can of tomato sauce and a paper package of cheese and you have to mix water with the dough and wait for it to rise and smush it out with your fingers and make it real flat. Dora was there. She was so happy because we were making the Chef-Boy-Ardee pizza. We were waiting for the dough to rise. I had mixed just a little too much water and it was all sticky. Some other people were there and me and Dora were in the back seat. We went to a place with a name... something to do with 'tick'. On Second Avenue I saw Ronnie Haynie. He was very busy talking to himself like he always did. His eyes were wide open. His hair very blonde and straight and long. Dora was here and since she was here we decided to go to the tennis courts. I didn't think that was possible but it was. She said, ""Can we play after dark?"" and I said, ""sure, there are lights."" She didn't have her racket with her. We went to nanny and Grandfather's and they said, ""What's all this pizza dough sitting around here for forever?"" Dora said, ""We're just waiting for a tennis court to open up."" My mother said, ""I saw that Ronnie Haynie. Every cell in that boy's body is abnormal! I'm going to take that stuff out of every single cell to try to straighten that boy At dark before daylight I skated home and 'low lifes' were hanging around waiting for a good victim to pass by. They saw me and the woman whispered to the man and I yelled but she tried to attack me anyway and a cop came and handcuffed me(her) and she screamed, ""You Bitch!"" at me but she's the one who got herself in trouble. Not me. I was just there. I got home and Dora was there! She had made a bed for me on the floor and when I told her about not getting any sleep she listened so sweetly to me. She cared. She had washed clothes for the trip and even washed mine while I was taking a nap and she washed the wrong clothes but I did not want to hurt her feelings. Her feeling mattered more than what I wore. Dora had baked 7 kinds of fake pastries and cakes (they looked real but you could not eat them--they were to be thrown and hit with plates for good luck. We were just about ready when Dora pulled off the top white tablecloth to reveal the carefully laid out pastries and fancy set table. She showed us how to throw the pastries and break them on the floor or plates for good luck. ((she had learned this custom on her international travels)) I wrapped a bible style turban around my head to keep the sun out. (of) Dora's pastries, 1 out of the 7 was tigers and when you squeezed them they would growl and attack the elephant pastries. I saw what I thought was a fake alligator in the creek--he was aqua green and bounced like a children's float. But he bopped downstream and attacked--he chomped the ducks. My father got the horses ready for the wagon trail and I walked behind the Crenshaw barn and found a commemorative 75th anniversary of the blacksmith iron table in the ashes. Evelyn had a film to shoot and she was sitting on the floor making plans. She said dresses would be cooler and that as many as possible would roller skate on ski-ropes behind the wagon like water skiers. The wagon went 70 m.p.h. and there was even a wipe out but Evelyn caught it on film. The white horse had been hammered in the forehead with a nail and a circle of blood was on his head. A jealous horse was the suspect. Part of kitty's face was caved in but I played with her and somehow got her face back right and her eye opened and she was SO HAPPY. She smiled and smiled."
"026"	"(06/07/1999)"	"(I was) waiting in the waiting room at some kind of doctor's office. There were other people there and my mind was on getting a pair of those fold-up plastic chairs. In this waiting room I had been searching for this pair of plastic fold-up glassed that they give you at the eye doctor. They were in an envelope in the bathroom. I was real excited to find them; that I went to tell the teachers at the grammar school that I had found just what I'd wanted. There were plastic and paper fold-up glasses. There was a lady with real glasses, but she had somebody else's glasses on (not her prescription). I was skipping school that day. I was trying not to get found out. I was trying to come up with a plan to leave. There was a typewriter there and I was trying to just type as fast as I could, and just hit any keys. The stuff came out on the page, ""x j l k , x j l k , x j l k , . "" But the letters were not in straight lines. They went up and down and up and down, in a sort of 'Navajo-ish' pattern on the page. I didn't say anything. I tried to type out some words. The patterns were nice. There were no vowels. I tried to type in a straight line but I could get no vertical action on the typewriter. It was all horizontal. I thought, ""I'll type up a grocery list."" But I didn't need to get anything anyway. I had run through the red light where the turn off for the grocery was suppose to be, so I was already past there. The phone in this waiting room office was ringing and it was Stephen and he was angry. He was trying to get in there (in the office door) and he was calling. He said, ""Merri, it's STEPHEN."" And he hung up the phone. On the way to the grocery store was the gray section, and a wooden shack with a sign on a wooden stick that I loved, and instead there was an Amoco station. The man in the car said, ""There's a grocery store in Albany."" And I was driving. I said, ""We don't have to go half that far."""
"027"	"(06/07/1999)"	"I met a woman on 42 St. who'd painted a portrait of Bryan Hunt. At first I thought she was a little girl. Then she was grown. Ida was next to her. She took her top off on 42 St. A store of 'Pranks and Horrors"" turned out to be a sex shop. I was looking for fake blood and anti-dizzy inhaler for the Olympic gymnast. William was driving the bus. Stephen was chasing the bus and stood outside the store waiting for me to exit into the parking lot. I had crouched behind the counter at the cash register. Stephen broke the door down and hissed at me. Finally he was concentrating on something else and I escaped out the door; and into a huge round building. It was cavernous. It was RC Communications. Lisa Hack came in and said I should at least say something nice about the art school I went to, so it would make the top ten. In the center of the massive round stone building was a room with a record player on the floor. Dora was picking out records and playing them. She played rock n roll songs we'd both loved in the 70's and early 80's. The songs she loved made me so happy I started dancing by myself. I was so happy listening to the music and dancing that my feet left the ground for short, and then longer increments. I became so happy with Dora that I started flying in the music room. I used my hands as rudders and cupped them in the shape of treble or bass ties in music scores, depending if I wanted to go down or up. I followed the air currents and was taken around the perimeters of the room. The air currents kept me from bumping into things. I accidentally made 2 guy (male) gymnasts fly with me. That's why he got angry. They were trying to practice and were worried about having to explain their 'flight'. I could go FAST! I was going too fast to stay in the music room, because of centrifugal or centripical force, and the small size of this room in the center of a circular building. I could go frontwards and backwards. People didn't look at the ceiling out of habit of nothing being there. I could see people working cleaning and waiting tables. And setting tables. I heard my name. It was Alicia and her girlfriend Joshua. They ran and ran after me and when I finally saw it was them I came down to talk to them. We laughed. They distracted the employees with stories that I was pregnant. And we were laughing because they were lesbians and pregnancy was not an issue. To escape from the huge round stone building without being found out, I had to fly out the basement door. Tom Haney was working taking people's coats out to their cars. There were commuter jets that exited from a trap door and orbitted the sphere that was that specific universe of the building. They were fighter jets and five of them came from the trap door; one at a time and in formation. Astroturf grew on the outside of the sphere and I had to hold on tight to stay grounded. The jets come within inches of my back, inches from annihilating me."
"028"	"(06/08/1999)"	"There was a reverse lottery. The only people who qualified to enter were people who'd had a brother, sister, or child in their family killed. Through this lottery a brother or sister could win the chance for their sibling to come back to life--but if you 'won' you gave up your own life. The committee killed you--I saw the committee and it was worth getting killed to give Dora a chance to come back for a while. My mother got real mad about me taking too long to fill out my lottery ticket for Dora's life. She thought I was afraid to die when really I was just looking at things. There was a 5 senses machine where family members could re-live moments--happy moments--and the last moments of life with their brother or sister's lifeless body, but very alive in the brain and soul. Evelyn was telling me about her trip to the White House. She said the 2nd lady (wife of the vice president) was breast feeding on the White House lawn; and she introduced Chuck over the loudspeaker as Springsteen. She said, ""Chuck Dean, American. As American an icon as Springsteen."" And Chuck said, without smiling or any expression, ""I'd prefer to be compared to George Bernard Shaw."" Alan and I were proofreading and there was a particularly long typositor order, marked   with   breaks   every   word   like   this. I said, ""Alan, this is an awful lot of typositor. We could set it on the machine, but you'd have to do a lot of kerning."" He said, ""It's going to be a busy night."" I was trying to find my pants because I was suppose to teach bible school. Clothes were all over the floor and there were a bunch of loose dollars. The dollar bills had flowers all over them and they were (bright, almost hot florescent) blue, pink, purple and white. They were BEAUTIFUL! I was worried I wasn't sure what we were going to do in the class, but Greg said, ""It'll be fine."" I said, ""I thought we'd make half clocks."" Only the numbers 12 through 6 would be used. I wanted to let the 6-year olds cut out their own numbers. Dora came back in and said, ""You found your pants. I knew you would."" She was very calm. A lady came in to Bible School. It was Ackerman's mother. She had a beige shawl around her shoulders and a beige sweater. I wanted to go give her a hug because she looked extremely nervous."
"029"	"(06/09/1999)"	"I had to go to the store to get a bathing suit because I was suppose to go to the beach with Elena. We were to leave on the 3rd of the month but we had not seen each other in 6 months. I had $15. I looked on the sale rack and did NOT see anything I even halfway liked. They were all very extremely UGLY. The only one of any merit was the bathing suit made out of wood that looked like an Eskimo totem pole but I thought it would not be good to swim in. The lady said, ""Go try this on."" And I followed her and... She yelled, ""NO! Go in there and take your clothes off and lay down on the floor."" She would then hold up the bathing suit next to you to see if it fit. It was the store's new shoplifting prevention policy. Since $15 was only enough for the sale rack I went to another department. On the way I pumped some lotion from a display counter and put it on my arms and legs. I saw the signs and a stretched out beach towel in mid-air--it was a gimmick. The sign said, ""Fake Male Model Beach Towel $262. Get 2 for $300."" I thought it was very overpriced, though it was a nice, thick, white beach towel. I was life guarding and it was boys' swim and there were little boys under the age of 12. Some had trouble swimming and the 50-60 year (old) adult confiscated all their floats. He said it was because their noise was unbearable. So the unknown and invisible superhero sent underwater attack tigers out in the water. First they clawed the man underwater and you could see streaks of blood disperse in the water. The streaks were the width of tiger claws where they sliced into the man's flesh. Just when the tiger was about to need to come up for air, the invisible superhero wrapped his tail around the knees of the Chinese karate guy so that they would get tangled up and bonk heads like the 3 Stooges. When I walked inland from the lake there was a left-handed girl learning to play the guitar. I was trying to help her but could get no closer than 15 feet away. I was right handed and she was left handed so our images were flopped and it was hard to help learn guitar from 15 feet away . She finally got the 'E' chord right and was playing it real good. Rudy and I went to college registration and my father said, ""I don't want any of that class stuff. I'll just lay here on the bed and rest until you get back from class and we can do something fun."""
"030"	"(06/10/1999)"	"We were looking for beach parking and getting nowhere. Bad traffic. We came up on a grass strip with pine trees next to a house with screen doors and windows. We were about to pull up when the man pulled up in his pick-up truck. My mother said, ""if that man can afford a beach house, he should at least buy some decent clothes."" Finally my mother drove right off the road and onto the beach. I wanted to say (that) there was a much nicer beach, but I knew it was best to keep my mouth shut. I told Britta, ""There's undertow water currents between the islands. Try not to swim there or you could drown."" I knew this was hard for her to hear because her sister drowned but Dora let me know I should warn them. Dora said (that) if she was here, she'd know NOT to swim there. It was dangerous. Valerie's dad said, ""My daughter drew this picture."" It was a vertical list drawing of a banana, a peach and purple grapes. He said, ""She's only in first grade but reads at a 6th grade level."" We knew he was lying because Valerie did not read so good. Even by 6th or 12th grade. Then he made her join the army because he said she was a loser. The sergeant was sitting in a straight chair. I was sitting on the floor with Valerie's head in my lap rocking her. She was crying. The sergeant had been mean to her. I started singing, ""Do you remember.....that kind of September...."" And the sergeant said, ""That song's too sad. Don't you know some happy ones?"" And Valerie sat up and we all 3 (me, Valerie and the sergeant) started singing together in unison the ""SUNSHINE, LOLLIPOPS, AND RAINBOWS EVERYWHERE!"" song. ""Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows, when you're near me everything is wonderful when we're together. Brighter than a lucky penny, when you're near me, all those rain clouds disappear when we're together!"" When we were walking on the beach we were looking for shells and we had been singing the B-I-B-L-E song. ""The B-I-B-L-E (spelled out in song, similar to the B-I-N-G-O song, but a different tune.), Yes that's the Book for me! I stand alone on the Word of God, the B-I-B-L-E, the B-I-B-L-E..."" We were looking for shells and I was digging with my foot and uncovered wooden eggs with houses' faces painted on them. The wooden butterflies were cheap, cheap, cheap and the church family wooden shells (eggs) were boring. Then, digging with my foot to get the butterfly wings, I uncovered a long red ribbon of World War II medals on a red ribbon. The buttons (attached to the ribbon) were funny. Dora said, ""Merri, you always find the most interesting things."""
"031"	"(06/11/1999)"	"They said, ""How do you get there from here?"" And I said, ""Walk down the Gray Court Road and watch."" They had on those Japanese shirts with the collar, and I said, ""How'd they get those shirts to stay so neat like that without any buttons?"" And actually, they filed their fingernails to a sharp, sharp point and sliced right into the flesh on their chests and stick the folded collar into the flesh; and as the blood dries, it holds it (the shirt collar) in place. That's how the people sitting in church stay so neat. Their shirts are attached with blood. There was the boss's son...........(incomprehensible)............. And there was a Chinese book and I was reading the title page. Outside the package, I didn't want her to see it, cause then she'd move. She turned into Buddy Wells from high school. He said, ""What are you doing on the train?"" and I said, ""I'm going to do my Christmas shopping."" He said, ""How do you get to the mall?"" I said, ""Well, you turn, and you get on the train. On the freight train. Or if you see a bus driver you invite him to come."" (and he'll give you a ride) I was starting to type on the computer ...........envelopes folded out of paper...inside out, outside in, inside out. They were mostly white or gray. Warm white, not cool white. The magic markers were in the Value Pack. I let Marty know I would have some pictures for him later. There were the boards. There was a chicken standing on the board in the windowsill of the restaurant. A waitress came to take his order. There was a boy trying to be all artsy craftsy, and I said, ""You don't have to be all artsy craftsy. You know what you're doing."" And then the (other) boys bashed him in the head. Rudy was on the Ferris Wheel. He was going around and around and around and around. I couldn't find the Ferris Wheel or a boyfriend. I was kind of connected and not connected. It was a very weird place. There was that board leaned up against the wall at the 6A-ish restaurant in Soho. Alex was there. There were dirty plates all over the table (on the outdoor table, just underneath an empty windowsill (there was no glass in it). I said, ""I'll just lean this board over against the wall. I'll just put it here and eventually I'll take it back to the kitchen."" There was some confusion about the boss's son. The guy, he thought I was just pathetic. He was very dorky in high school. He ended up being my boyfriend. He was freaking out. I knew he was on drugs because that's the way he acted. Everybody was hitting each other with boards. Lumber boards and ironing boards. Everybody was in pieces. At one point the whole family was on the wood stack."
"032"	"(06/12/1999)"	"I was suppose to go along the fence backwards until I got it down good and was on a horse but nobody showed up to meet me. Instead I wondered if the cows were angry that I didn't make an appointment. I just showed up. There was a family and I was the little boy and on Saturdays we had to line up and get a big plastic cup and have it filled with sulfuric acid. Then we had to stick our hand in the acid (my right hand) and scrub--hard. I had to scrub the 4 sides of the light post. It was trapezoid in shape. Me and Rudy were suppose to wash clothes and the washing machine was in the kitchen. It was going CHA-CHUNK, cha-chunk; CHA-CHUNK, cha-chunk; but no water was coming in. It was just mixing up the clothes like a blender. We kept throwing in more soap powder and even liquid detergent but to no avail. My mother was in the back room and she could hear us and we knew we were in BIG TROUBLE. There was an underwater cave murder. There was a pocket of air in the underwater cave and 3 guys were there. One was the culprit, one was the victim, and one was the survivor. The victim knew the end was coming and he became very calm. I saw his friend in the Duane Reade. He told me, ""I talked to him."" ""He was very calm."" I said. On top of the water I was doing a BIBLE CRUISE. I had to collect 5 gallons of holy water (for my mother) and then I wanted to mail it to her so I wouldn't have to carry it all the way through my travels with the Children of Israel. I got a 5-gallon box to mail it, but then I left if floating on a raft in the Sea of Galilee. I said, ""I like floating docks."" There was a news conference fashion parade with fashion tid-bits being spewed from a head atop a limo. The head with blonde hair was the size of a VW bug. She was telling what synthetic materials had been used in lining last year to make clothes more poofy."
"033"	"(06/13/1999)"	"(unable to sleep from 11 p.m. until 3:30 a.m. due to excess racket from new disco under my window. Horns honking continually. Dream tape recorded after daylight. ) At the great big university pool, that's called a natatorium, the floor was a clayish sandy color and rubberized, so your toes could grip good. A small group of grown-ups was sitting cross legged on the side playing a game that looked like marbles. But the marbles were round symbols of the state of South Carolina. They were in 3 separate code colors: (there were actually 4 colors; silver, gold and white. But there were many white marbles. There was only one bronze colored marble--it meant the same as the white ones but was much more valuable because it was rare. One of the 'marbles' was really the top of a palmetto tree, but chopped off, so it really looked like a furball. The other was suppose to be the moon. {{the palmetto tree and moon are on the SC state flag. White on an indigo background.}} I forgot what the third one meant, but it meant something. The grown people were playing marbles with the state symbols. I had to walk around the pool. I tried to remember that lady's name who was my WSI teacher at USC-M-O-U-S.... but I couldn't. I remembered Butterball's name. She was sitting on the floor talking to Butterball. The thing that I couldn't remember was why I was there at the pool. (Walking around the pool) I was carrying a cooking pot with some leftovers from supper in it. And it was leftover beef stew. It was in a pot with a handle and I didn't have anywhere to put it. I couldn't put in the water. If I put it down on the rubberized floor it would probably melt it. In my other hand I was carrying the state symbol marbles. I didn't have any pockets to put my marbles in. On the way up I had to sit in the car with this girl and she was driving me crazy. I tried to remember what she was so riled up about. But she was very angry about something and she kept going, ""eek eek grrrr grrrr augh augh."" She was a filmmaker. We were doing a film shoot about prostitution. I was busy messing with the camera. I took the whole roll of pictures of these 2 shoes; men's work shoes (that'd been) spray painted black. The were aligned heel to toe but one was floating about 2 feet up in the air, so it looked like somebody was walking up steps, but just the shoes--not the person. I took all my pictures of that. The lower shoe was propped up on an aluminum can with the label peeled off. The shoes belonged to Woody Allen. We were going around the city because we had to do this film about prostitution. And this girl was just BOTHERING me and she wouldn't leave me alone, and I didn't have any money to give her. So after a while I just hauled off and I bit her in the arm as hard as I could. I bit her so hard that it was bleeding and you could see teeth marks on her arm. Then she was all self-righteous and she said, ""OH, I'm going to have to go to the hospital and get a TETANUS SHOT! People bites are worse than monkey bites, and monkey bites are worse than dog bites."" I said, ""Well, you don't have to go to the hospital right now. You have 48 hours before tetanus sets in."" She was worried it wouldn't heal. She went inside where the doctor was and went under the deck. She said, ""The doctor said to analyze and see if you're the one who bit me in the arm. To see if they're your teeth bite marks. So pull your teeth out and put them in my hand so we can see if you're the one who bit me."" I said, ""I told you I WAS the one who bit you, and I'm sorry but you wouldn't leave me alone. It's just what I had to do."" I was waiting in line to go to the bathroom and a little boy came and he tapped me on the arm. He said , ""I have something from the lady for you. I'm gonna put it in your raincoat pocket. Now don't look."" It was wrapped up in a napkin. I was at the NBA basketball championship. I didn't want to be doing what I was doing but I had to. There were about 18 chicks; girls like me, and we had to wear these cheerleader uniforms. Blue shorts with stars and red and white tops. We had to do this choreographed dance and be all SMILEY SMILEY and sing the Star Spangled Banner. It was just crazy. You had to be all smiley smiley and it ended with a split and I hadn't done that in a long time, And I thought, ""WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT?"" It made me so mad I just got up and went to stand in the bleachers. When I'd rather be singing: (When I wanted to be going) ""and the rockets red glare (da da da dow)"" [sound effects like machine gun] ""the bombs bursting in air (eeaaaahhhh BOOM)"" [sound effect of bomb dropping] ""gave proof through the night (da da da dow, pow pow pow)"" [sound of machine gun followed by pistol] ""that our flag was still there (da da da dow, pow pow pow pow pow, eeaaahhhh BOOM"" [machine gun, pistol, bomb] ""Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave, for the land of the free, (eeaaaahhhh)"" [bomb] and the home of the brave."""
"034"	"(06/14/1999)"	"We were coming down off this mountain and at a certain point the fog; you came through the fog. You could see all these deer crossing the road. We were traveling fast but the thing is, we were riding on an elephant. There was a special sort of weird seat, and the elephant would pick you up with his trunk and put you in the seat. The Power Rangers were there. I was vacuuming. I was at this lady's house and they were taking down the Christmas tree. I was vacuuming and there were pine needles all over the floor. I just decided to get the pine needles up with the vacuum cleaner since I was vacuuming anyway. The thing was that with all those needles were the actual pine branches with the lights still wrapped all around them. And I was vacuuming. When I was vacuuming, the vacuum cleaner sucked all the Christmas lights up in there. Oh Man. I was trying to act like nothing really happened. But the pine needles and pine branches and Christmas lights were gone. At least it kept me from having to put away all those decorations. I was babysitting. Ed Bradley from 60 Minutes said, ""What are you doing Friday night?"" And I said, ""I don't know."" And he said, ""Would you like to baby sit?"" And I said, ""Well, how old are they?"" And he said, ""One year and two years old."" And I said, ""Well, that's the perfect age."" And he said, ""I'll see you then."" I thought, ""How'd that happen. He's awfully old to have a 1 year old and a 2 year old. I thought, well, maybe those were his grandchildren. I didn't know what was going on. But it didn't really matter. ......................ramblings about the noise... There were cement blocks but it was before the time of cement. So it was wet rocks. And this lady was saying, ""There's a crane moving these rocks into place for the drawbridge. Make sure that rock is on the level! MAKE SURE THAT ROCK IS ON THE LEVEL!"" They had a level with the little yellow bubble in it. But they were doing it the wrong direction anyway. But I didn't think bridges being level really mattered too much. Oh my god, it seems like it came along later. But.......ah.....there was a beach. Then it parted like the red sea. There was an exodus. And if you wanted to go swimming you'd just walk up there and then the waves would crash in from both directions. From the left and the right. Hello kitty. OK kitty. You're purring. That means you're happy. Then the water currents. They always came in from both sides. They would CRASH. They had so much strength for something as soft as water. There were all these water currents you could feel under the water. You could feel them at your feet and at your knees and then a different direction at your stomach, and a different direction at your chest...and you were lucky if your head was still sticking up above water and you could breathe. The water had you moving all different directions and unless you were a snake, there's no way you could keep up with it. It was in art school. A guy lived in the same apartment building. He said Evelyn had been there. But she was off shooting a film. And I was in art school. The guy who lived next door was sitting out in front of the parking garage. He was getting a car out from the parking garage. I said, ""I didn't know you had a car."" He said, ""Cars are underrated."" I said, ""I guess, but that's because I'm a bad driver."" And then he...... I said, ""What do you need a car for anyway?"" He said, ""To take a shower."" Then I knew what he meant. He meant that his apartment didn't have a kitchen or a shower. He said, ""I'm gonna go out running for an hour. But I'll leave the door unlocked (the car door) so if you need to take a shower you can get into my place. He wanted to go to the shower house at the beach. The brick one with a shower on the outside and on the inside. I said, ""There's a real nice restroom at Siesta Key. You could just go to the deli, but it's a really nice restroom. He said, ""Well, I'll think about it."" Then um......then there was a cheat sheet. There was a test in psychology/sociology. Usually she gave multiple choice, but this one was hard. I made this cheat sheet. I rolled it up and stuck it inside my sleeve. I was waiting for a chance to go to the auditorium and sit on the floor and take the test. I was waiting for a chance to pull it out, but it would make too much noise going, ""rattle, rattle"" so I ended up just running and playing, and I failed the test. I'm sure. It was about stupid things. The year certain things were invented. The year blah blah blah. There was this lady who was related to the boy who went to take the shower. She had this little bitty baby. It was one year old. It was a little baby. It didn't look 3 weeks old. It was happy. It didn't care what anybody thought. It was eating sliced olives. I said, ""That baby eat olives?"" And she said ,""He loves olives."" I said, ""I didn't know they would eat things like that with seeds in em'."" She said, ""You don't know a lot of things."
"035"	"(06/15/1999)"	"Evelyn  and I were in the darkroom. There was a very complicated process for processing film. The first part was the regular way. Then the part took several weeks. The film strip was very long. About 30 feet. After processing it you had to swim underwater to the island (1/2 mile there, 1/2 mile back = 1 mile total); and the man was there trying to rent out lifejackets--which were not necessary or even practical, because you had to swim underwater to process the film. Then when you got back the reverse negative printing took place. return from swimming 1 mile underwater with negatives held anchored in mouth. 2. heat water until steam and bubbles come up and the water boils out; salt crystals will have formed all over the scorched but not burned pot; attach 33 gallon black trash bag to enlarger between light source and easel. You are now ready to begin printing the reverse negative full size prints. Exposure time: 2 weeks. It was time to go, William said and Evelyn was waiting the 2 weeks for her paper to expose. Since she was still working, I dumped out my empty oatmeal box full of crayons and searched frantically for 'periwinkle blue.' Some crayons were broken. Some were not. I found cobalt blue but it wasn't the same. They had changed the color names to be politically correct."
"036"	"(06/15/1999)"	"A time lapse photo would click once every 24 hours. There was a kind of plant that had circle leaf things and Dora loved them. She had put Vaseline on the seeds (so that) when the leafs grew they'd be transparent. People were lined up to buy these plants that Dora loved. A lady said to me, ""You've always got your head stuck in a refrigerator."" There was a cross-country skiing escape route. Signs arranging the escape route by date of birth hung high above the road. There was so much snow and slush covering the asphalt so it was tricky skiing. The guy looked at me as if to say, ""You are older than 27."" I made a right turn. It was time to put some gasoline in the vehicle so I skied into a gas station on the right. I had to park on a hill and lean the hose because there was no on/off switch. I got distracted and gas overflowed onto the floorboard. The gasoline smell was rampant. I pulled a sweatshirt out from under the seat and threw it down on top of the floorboard to appease the situation."
"037"	"(06/16/1999)"	"The Rocky River bridge was washed out. It had been a big, big flood. my father was driving the car and my mother was in the front and me and Rudy were in the back. Dora was not there. my father was excited to drive across the flooded river with the bridge washed out. I wasn't scared because I knew he knew what he was doing. A piano was stuck in the middle of the flooded river. It had pull knobs like a very old pump organ. I thought I should say something funny, so I said, ""I could go practice the piano."" Nobody laughed. The piano had twigs and dried mud wedged around it where the water currents had been building debris up. The college guys said, ""We have 3 chemistry labs set up in the kitchen."" We were secretly playing with the Ouijee board because we knew we were not suppose to, as it was going against the Bible. There were job try-outs on St. Marks. A girl was standing on a piece of tape with no shoes and making faces. She got the job. The mermaid statue was concrete but she (the girl with no shoes making faces) stuck her head out from it--so you could see a still body and expressions change on the face. The next one had 2 statues with girls' heads sticking out. They were both wearing horn-rim glasses. It was called: Sisters. The lady on the greyhound bus said, ""This bus is half empty."" I said, ""You never know who will get on."" She said, ""Is the destination the Laurens-Greenville metropolitan area or just Greenville?"" I said, ""Laurens used to have only one name."" At the diner I couldn't concentrate because I was trying to figure out where I put my shirt. I didn't have it on. When I found it I started whittling a stack of thin young bamboo shoots. Manicure tools were attached to some underneath the ''leaf'' layers and I chopped the ends off with my knife. There had been trouble on the floor and Joey Holmes called a lawyer instead of knocking on the door and asking politely."
"038"	"(06/16/1999)"	"I was suppose to meet William at the state park. The state park had 8 underground park levels connected by elevators and steps. I didn't know which level I was suppose to meet him at. He had called on the phone to say that he WAS in the park. There was a vendor with a hot dog stand under an umbrella, selling popcorn only. I tasted it and it was very greasy and salty. I decided not to bring popcorn for the class picnic. Then I thought I might be in the wrong park so I went on the highway. (I was driving a car) I was suppose to take EXIT 7 but I missed it and I got off at EXIT 8. There was no state park in sight. There were wall-to-wall buildings. Tall and crammed together. There were flashy billboards all over the sides. Overpasses crossed over the highway everywhere. I knew I had to get back to EXIT 7 which HAD been the right place, but I wasn't looking forward to driving in the middle of all that crazy speeding traffic, red lights, buildings suffocating each other, loud tacky signs--general chaos."
"039"	"(06/18/1999)"	"We were at Frog Creek. We made a little camp in the sand without tents. The sand was quartz rock granules. Not white sandy like beach sand. The humongous fat guy was lying in the sand on a tractor tire. He was (((something)))))) all the time. He had a girlfriend. She refused to wear clothes. She was fat too but not as humongous as him, and she floated in the creek on an inner tube. She had a seamless tan. The humongous guy slept on a rug in the sand; he was eating all the time and sweeping crumbs over. This took nearly all day. The very fat man jumped in the water. (dove) She (his plump girlfriend) didn't have any tan lines. I had gotten sunburned and there were seams (as if the sunburn had been sewn on). There were some white slivers of skin where the sunburn wasn't sewn on. The seams connected all over my body--up and down the fronts and backs of my legs. I was wearing a one piece swim suit. The attacker sneaked in. He gripped my arm like a boa constrictor. I couldn't move it. The blood would stop and I would be rendered helpless. The man had gotten me under the cliff below the horizon under the guise of taking my picture. He had a toy gun that would shoot plastic toys and baskets and pop like a pop gun. Then my friend Brian showed up and I communicated by facial expressions that the guy was trying to kill me. Brian shot him dead with a real bullet. Guys were sleeping everywhere in the sand. Every time the water would wash up they would sink into the sand a little bit more until they were completely covered. My cousin the model (who died of a heroin overdose March 14, 1998) was there. She asked me to curl her eyelashes. She had a fancy eyelash curler from Europe. I tried to use the curler like she asked me to, but it hurt. It was not good. I accidentally cut off her eyelashes and eyebrows, and the ones that were left stuck out in all cock-eyed directions. I ruined them and I told her (that)I did not. She was very angry I had ruined her eyelashes and demanded we go to North Carolina to get them fixed. I had to ride in a van with all these model girls. And they were mad at me (because I had ruined my cousins eyelashes) It was in the back of a van with couches and they were all very obsessed with looking perfect, but nothing else. There were multiple ethnicities of beautiful models. They were all angry. It was my war. One played a mean joke on me. A condom balloon on a string filled with air and confetti. Only one girl was nice. We discussed Chopin Preludes and Bach, Variations Goldberg. We discussed Chopin's Preludes #7, #22, #41. We discussed personalities of the individual."
"040"	"(06/17/1999)"	"I was drawing the banister on the outdoor steps at the House of Representatives. The rail connected the tops of the vertical post and was attached to a window, the 2nd tall skinny window on the right, of swirly architectural style. Sidney came up and it was time for him to fly the jet. It was a futuristic jet and would do loop de loops and go real fast. I rode with him and was looking down below at the trees. We passed peach trees so I assumed we were in South Carolina. I could tell they were peach trees because of the shape of the leaves. We passed over an orchard of unidentified fruit trees. The fruit was round like grapefruit but white like it had been under a rock. The sphere fruit was hanging. There was a loose prescription bottle with loose Prozac in there and 2 Clonodine. The Clonodine were pink and white capsules which were suppose to appease withdrawal and induce sleep by lowering the blood pressure. I took the jet up but I didn't go that high because I knew I had to get back to ground level. I was doing artwork in 305 and a teacher pushed in the door with about 30 students. They were Orthodox Greeks. The man made an inside joke about Orthodox Greeks but I didn't get it. I don't even know what that is. He proceeded to tell me but I still didn't get it. The girl at the fast food check out was talking to people in line. She said, ""May I take your order please.......... next........... may I take your order please................. next............. may I take your order please......... next......... may I take your order please? There was lots of bread cut in half all over the counter. I said, ""I'd like some toast."" She said, ""We don't have that."" I said, ""Well you've got those rolls and you've got an oven, 2 + 2 = 4, just toast instead of hamburgers. She gave me plain raw bread. I took it and quietly sat down. Then I took my lunch tray back to the cash register. ""May I take your order please?"" and I said, ""I'd like this toasted."" She said, ""You should get a job here."""

"042"	"(06/20/1999)"	"I had to go to a party at 5 a.m. A girl wanted to give me a picture of herself. She was being crucified on a big pointed (whittled) stick and a big star was drawn on the reverse 18 X 24 photo and twisted her head in the middle [of the star] . When it was time to go, Marianna found me and said, ""It's time to go."" We had to film a special about church. Marianna asked me did I want to take on the semi-religious folks or the real holy rollers. I said, ""I'm not scared of the holy rollers and I might be disowned from my family for what I'll say but it's what I think."" They made us go through a metal detector at the church steps because we were not dressed appropriately--me and Marianna. I was wearing blue flip flops and Marianna's hair was not combed. Once inside they gave me a black pair of high heel shoes but I wanted to wear my flip flops so I put them on, on top of my flip flops. We were sitting on the heavy old 1920's movie seats and regular church people were sitting in Lazy-Boys. A lady producer came and got Marianna and when Marianna walked back up the church aisle her eyes were wide open and lots of make up and her hair was perfectly in place and combed. Then she pulled the mask off. The wig was attached to the top of the mask. The church ladies had made a super thin latex mask of Marianna's face with lots of alert make up and attached perfect and straight hair that was more yellow than Marianna's. Because Marianna hadn't combed( and wouldn't comb) her hair, the wig was attached (to the mask). Marianna pulled off the mask walking up the church aisle and said, ""I'm gonna keep this for when I'm too busy to comb my hair for the gallery. I was afraid she'd get in trouble for going against the church. On the desk I was writing, writing notes for my arguments against religion. It concerned Hindus and Buddhists, and the fact that they could be just as right as Baptists. It was a matter of perspective. I was getting bored in church so I dragged a piano between the rows. Then I had to drag the iron chair and it make a loud screeching noise. A lady brought a stack of hymns and choir songs for me to play. I didn't say anything because I had no intention of playing them. The sheet music on top said, ""When Jesus Calls"" in swirly writing. It was a threat. A little boy came and started playing at the piano for the first time in his life. I watched him. I wanted the church people to leave him alone. The preacher man told me he'd tried to call me and got a message about ""all-star free-lance terrorists."" I started laughing because it was the Simpsons and I had come very close to taping Reverend Lovejoy's sermon, but I knew my mother would call and get offended. On the Sunday Morning Bible News, the interviewer asked me religious questions about my dreams with Dora but I would not answer. It was sacred and between me and Dora. I went grocery shopping with Evelyn. In the vegetable section was a plastic bin with loose Cornflakes, artichokes on a stick in front, and dried bell peppers in back. (red ones, green ones, and yellow ones). Evelyn said (that) it was either wood chips or Cornflakes and they needed to get themselves organized. She was trying unsuccessfully to put handfuls of Cornflakes in a plastic bag. I knew I was suppose to get a bell pepper and when I broke it off and pulled it, a Mexican man's head was underneath the bell pepper smiling. (the pepper was regular size and the man's head was the same size as a bell pepper. The pepper had grown over the man's head.) ""It'll grow back,"" he said."

Me and Dora were printing pictures of each other in the darkroom and we had to expose the image underneath and focus on the bottom of the bed under the covers. I was printing pictures of Dora. Dora was printing pictures of me. I was worried Dora would see my surprise (for her) before it was finished. On the ship we had to jump out into the ocean and hold onto big wooden doors riding the waves. At Aunt Jenny 's house we were in back, in front of the garage. My cousin was singing. Christy.Evelyn was showing her, in the dark, her feature film and she had to get up and go do something. She had gone to move a 400 lb.

"044"	"(06/21/1999)"	"My father had built us a swimming pool. It was called a swimming pool but really it was just a muddy pond with a rickety bridge over it, more like a big puddle, really. The government said we had to have a drainage system, so my father rigged one up. He rigged up electric rollers, like in the darkroom, connected to an extension cord. The suckhole at the bottom of the lake was run by a vacuum system with a big heavy window frame. The cord got wrapped around the fan blades. I was trying to get it untangled so the filter system would work in our new 'swimming pool' because I knew we needed a drain and filter for healthy swimming. The water came up to my neck and finally I had to wait for the detective to help me get the filter system going. My aunt Dianne was dying and Elizabeth was alive and she was saying (that) the ladies had forgiven Dianne for sleeping with their husbands because she was on her deathbed. Their forgiveness made her calm enough to get very nervous about the fan blades. The lady then gave a test and rated you on readiness and though I could play the Mozart piece I could not keep the broken crayons off the floor around my desk. Papers were wadded up and sticking out of my desk and the floor around my desk needed sweeping bad. Finally a lady tested us on order, neatness and handwriting and then she told me to just go listen to music and draw. The desks were in a circle. I had long hair and I had gotten 3 wads of bubble gum stuck in my hair; separate wads, in the back, underneath, where it's all thick, and I had to cut it out with scissors, finally, because it was too matted up to do anything else."
"045"	"(06/21/1999)"	"When Y2K hit a nuclear war would be the result. On the radio they said that there was a possibility grocery stores would be closed for one day for WW III. They suggested getting some water and I decided on 2 gallons. I couldn't wait to go select my 2 gallons, and I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a box of spaghetti to go with the water because it keeps good and you have to boil water anyway during emergencies. Wheeling the cart around, I decided that having a box of Cornflakes would make WW III more enjoyable. So I put it (the box) in the cart. Since it might very well be our last day on earth I decided, I felt like, a soda sure would taste good, and I called Sidney to see if he'd like a soda too, and he met me at the store which also sold used tape players. I said, ""Sidney, this is just what I need. How much is it?"" He said, ""One is $3.00 and one is $4.00. Do you like the big one or the little one?"" And I chose the little one but I forgot to pay and didn't realize it till I got home. My mother stopped at the buffet table and sent me to pick out 1 1/2 dozen eggs and I could NOT find a carton that wasn't full of broken eggs. There were regular and extra-L(Large) eggs. One carton I found had flawless eggs, but when I touched one with my index finger, all 18 broke in unison."

There was a place in Chinatown on Grand and Bleecker that had them but was sold out. He said (that) he'd get more in by next Thursday. We said we'd come back and we did. More HAD come in but only 2 were left. So the guy I was with got those and he also picked out 3 copies lt was a very, very thick book, thick book that ""costed"" $7.99 + tax each. The guy said he'd also fix our shoes and when he carried the 4 shoes in his arms he cradled them like a baby. He dropped one. He was NOT communicating through English. The guy who was with me picked out 3 copies of the new 'art' but it wasn't what he had in mind. Writing,(seen) through bubbles and magnifying lenses was swirly, bunched up. (It was) writing about wolves and it was very hard, if not impossible to read. The books were about 12"" X 17"" and extremely heavy. The guy said, ""I spent $50.00 and got 3 books. One is for you."" I knew he'd done the math wrong, but I was afraid to tell anyone. I did NOT want the book. The alcoholic brother's key was stuck and William was making a very small cardboard harp for Stephen. It was made out of the top layer of damp cardboard and had real strings and a cross bar and little knots and swirly air holes. I was fed up with the alcoholic brother and Stephen's ramblings so I walked out and then I fell into a ditch they were shoveling dirt into and stacking in rocks. 2 little girls, sisters, and their brother had been shoveling rocks all day and my foot slipped and fell between the rocks. It was a narrow escape but I got out. The ditch was very deep. The mother was NOT digging. Me and Dora were babies just learning to walk. My mother made us learn to walk wearing high heels. We were only about 1 year old each and it was very hard, near impossible, to learn to walk wearing high heels. my father lets us learn to walk barefooted; we have to remember the rules to know when to break them."

Actually they were rectangles but with the vanishing points and points of view, the perspective and the way the sun was shining; therefore trapezoids. On the roof was a ??? I thought, ""I sure could use $3000.00 CASH, so I'll just go over there and shingle that guy's roof."" So I went over there and I looked at the roof. It was a simple inverted 'V' roof with a small protrusion in the back (which) I assumed was a bathroom.. The shingles were black like very, very coarse sandpaper. They were hand-broken in asymmetrical arbitrary shapes. There was a empty coffee can filled with glue (mixed with water) and I didn't put enough glue on the ceiling and they [the broken shingles] all fell on my head. Then I got the glue working and finished the back half. Then I was over halfway done with the front half. ""I don't believe I'm going to pay you $3000.00 after all. And I said, ""Well then I'm not finishing your roof and I'm gonna scrape off every shingle on your roof AND I'M NOT going to give you piano lessons. He said, ""350% of magazine writers said I should take piano lessons."" And I said, ""I don't have enough time for myself to play. There must be 15 people who asked me to teach them piano lessons."""

I worked next to a girl and in the back was a guy who checked basement statistics and he was unreliable and absent. We were printing negatives and there was only so much available space in the darkroom. The girl next to me was VERY BUSY printing photographs. Then there was me. Then there was the space where the guy usually worked. His work station. But he was too busy to be there. There were 7 coat pegs above the names and on top of the shelf was a lightweight collapsible mesh bag to hold 7 basketballs and the point was to play, bounce the ball like jacks. Onesies, twosies, threesies, but with the basketball, not a small ???. First I practiced and did it good. Then I couldn't get past onesies. I felt pitiful but there was nothing I could do. Some people could bounce it all the way to ninesies (sevens). Then I tried to print from the negatives. I was very said because I had NO; I did not have any black and white negatives to print of DORA. It was a page out of print. And there was nothing I could do. There was nothing I could do.* I tried to remember the names of those around me (the girl and the unreliable boy) and I couldn't and I got nervous and I sat in the desk and peed on myself I was so nervous. Then I picked up a magazine and dropped it on the puddle under the desk and I tried to act like nothing had happened. *""there was nothing I could do"" does appear twice very close together in drawing."

I had been working already 7 hours but most of that time was (wasted) because I was screwing things up and it was taking me much longer than it should have. First there was a comp to xerox on acetate and it had black writing and I was suppose to copy it onto a lined envelope (pale icky green heavy lined (as in paper lining, not lines) with yellow ochre crepe paper and the texture of the crepe paper made it very hard to xerox onto, especially with the acetate. I kept screwing it up and I was getting behind so I thought I should at least look like I was working on problems. I decided to work on the computer and when I double clicked a monster came on. He was sort of like Dracula with a wide open mouth. I double clicked [again] and he just got bigger every time. Then a ghost came up and he kept getting bigger too. And then I was trying to do the accordion folds and I did NOT need to glue the pages back to back like I thought I did. The teacher said, ""Why don't you take a break, the marker fumes are getting to you."" Jasmine came to pick me up and she was on her way to volunteer for a political campaign. We stopped at a restaurant and her friend was leaning against a wall at an angle. The waitress brought a thick, thick pizza cut in half only and my half fell upside down on the table. The man walking in the duck suit looked stupid. Jasmine went to the car and she forgot her Bible. She also forgot her fingernail file and architect's tube. I tried to put the pizza in a box that was too small because I knew she'd be hungry. I left too. I had to finish my comp and she had to work in the darkroom until daylight."

When I got home I was practicing 4 measures on page 3 of the Mozart Sonata in C K545. The door was slightly open because it was hot and this allowed a breeze to come through. My neighbor is very old. Since he had a stroke he cusses all the time. He heard me practicing and he was lonely so he said, ""Will you come visit me?"" I said, ""I can't, I'm going over to Evelyn's."" And I had 2 radios. I thought the music would keep him company so I put one station on classical piano and the other on talking. Then I went back to my room and he screamed, ""WHAT'S THAT GODDAMN RACKET?"" I didn't know if he meant the radios or me clanging on the stainless steel mixing bowl. The door was open 4"" with the safety chain and he was looking in. Since I'd burned the pot I was trying to cook oatmeal in the graduated mixing bowl."
"051"	"(06/25/1999)"	"There was a deserted summer camp with wooden shacks and in the summertime escaped mental patients would roam the streets. Actually it was a dirt road with a shortcut through the woods and some escaped mental patients, some in pairs, some all alone would walk back and forth on the road. I watched a lady sitting in a chair on the front porch across the road. The camp was abandoned but Rudy left his bicycle there and a green cotton blanket which I put on top of his sleeping bag--so I could sleep without unmaking his made-up bed. A mother was teaching her 3 year old daughter about faith in Jesus. She made her little girl stand on a chair in front of the stove with her head over boiling water with lots of hot steam. She made the little girl say, ""I'll love Jesus even if it burns my face off and I die."" The little girl was so afraid (that) Jesus was in the process of killing her--but just in time the mother clicked OFF the (electric) stove and said, ""How could you be so stupid? Jesus doesn't believe in electricity. Don't you listen to the Bible stories?"" The little girl was terrified. William used my film footage of this terrified little girl, with a shoestring tied around her forehead, as his music video; and he sang so sweetly about the scared little girl. Carlos came in with a calendar with Harvey's dots all over it and arbitrary squares (days) cut out across the year. The Carlos ripped it up into tiny pieces and threw it in the trash can. That perplexed me. William brought a new class member who had not seen his psychiatrist in 3 years. The little girl (was) taking dance lessons and they couldn't afford a real Bugs Bunny costume so they used a bright yellow bunny suit with a round stomach sticking out like a soccer ball. Then the script said the little girl got too tall to be a bunny rabbit. They held her like a tree with her legs bent and pointed very lady-like. William brought snacks for the class. He said the new guy was very shy so I stuck out my hand and he shook it. The new guy had huge buck teeth. Rudy was sitting against the wall staring at us but he would not participate. I came in the building on 12th St. and 2 very seedy guys, one old and washed up, were making out inside the doorway and possibly doing a drug deal. A guy with no legs was strung out and was pulling himself by his hands (on his knuckles) up the basement stairs. They (the stairs) were rickety and wooden. One guy told him to, ""HUSH UP."" I was trying to get past the derelicts and the vertical pole up the stairs. A man at the diner asked me what flavor milkshake I wanted and though I had NOT ordered a milkshake. I said, ""Vanilla."""

She had lots of apartments and rooms though, in the city and she helped people who had a difficult time putting things back on shelves. The rooms were bigger than usual. Big enough to put a table in the room. But because the lady did not have money, she had no plates. She had some leftover spaghetti and she dumped it in a pile on top of a newspaper for everybody to eat off of. There was one fork to share and she stuck it in the pile of spaghetti like a flag claiming Antarctica. She said she had to make sure if the lady left her i.d. card out on the table that she put it in the slot. We were in the waiting room. Cheap plastic and aluminum chairs attached to the walls so nobody would steal them. My mother and my father were arguing viciously and me and Dora and Rudy were sitting acting like we weren't there--not saying anything. My mother said, ""I send you to take care of the deed to some property next door and you sell it to Charles Manson."" And my father said, ""Jerry, I went and told the fella I had some property I needed him to help me take off my hands and he said OK and this is what happened."" She was screaming and crying and saying, ""I try and I try;"" with that horrible crying that makes you so nervous that you forget everything else in the whole world. my father whispered without raising his voice, ""If you don't hush up, I'm going to take you to that therapist. You know what I'm talking about and don't act like you don't."
"053"	"(06/26/1999)"	"The picnic was really an individual annihilation of a group of 30-40 feet tall female creatures. They were all very strong like super heroes and I was near 40 feet tall too but I had to fend for myself. I had no special powers. The individual annihilation had to do with available energy consumption and natural selection. Only the fittest could survive and we knew it was a fight to the death. There was not enough air on earth to breathe. The very, very tall women creatures would lean over until a tidal wave started and it was KILL OR BE KILLED. It was scary to be fighting over the air (that) I was hoping to breathe. Some of the creatures knew instinctively that the next tidal wave was their last and they were asking if (there were) any questions. There was a sand bar way out in the ocean and in between tidal waves the ocean only came up to some(one)'s ankles. The wave was coming. It was time to hold your breath and hope for the best."

One was cottage cheese and the other was an individual size container of Cool Whip--SUPERBRAND. I didn't know why my father had small individual servings. I had to go to the lake where relatives on my mom's side where having a family gathering. I did NOT want to go but I knew I had to. They were sitting on rocks at the river--which were covered with 3"" of water from the river. It was surprisingly clear for a muddy river. I knew I had to leave and to come back. I had to walk in the shady woods with Dora and we passed a contraption, number 5, on the obstacle course. It was circular cross-country skiing. Dora was playing on it but something stopped her. It was a(n) arrogant fat man in a white shirt and said, ""Can I take this apartment and take it down to the lake and bring it back."" And Dora said, ""Yes,"" so relaxed and calmly. I said, ""But...."" I was going to say, 'but it was my turn next.' But I knew I needed to swim at sunset. Swim hard back and forth across the lake to exhaust myself for all the aggression inside. I needed time alone from the relatives. Grandma and Grandpa and Aunt Bobbie and Uncle Bill had huge enlarged distorted eyes. I thought it meant they were going to die but I found out it was a botched obsolete eye operation they had had several years ago. There was a list of 5 phone numbers on a piece of paper. One number was 718-480-1188. One number was for Evelyn. One was for DORA. The circle of children from the family was sitting in the grass waiting to play. There were 7 heads of brown haired kids. I kept looking frantically for a blond-headed little girl. But Dora was not there. I was looking for her. The sun shined on my shoulders and I knew it was time for me to swim back and forth across the lake alone without talking to anybody."

A man was driving a light blue and white beautiful old car with tail fins. It was from the 30's or 40's. I had given him my keys but he didn't know and couldn't figure out how he was going to drive 2 cars at once. So he gave me back the keys and I walked home from the 'time and temperature' sign on the corner. My neighbor Maz was making room in his apartment and organizing and he had a friend who stared and never said anything. I started cleaning too and was very proud I'd filled a garbage bag with old newspapers. I knew the linoleum was very used because it was covered with very UGLY wall to wall carpeting. I decided to put a small old drawing table in there to cover the carpet. A man was interviewing me inside the apartment and asking me about the problems of dogs, people and cats shedding hair in apartments. I told him I was no expert on cleaning, but I used to clean this fancy loft for Bryan Hunt. Bryan came out and did NOT say ""Hi"" but started highlighting a pretty young girls hair. He had her chin on the table and her big blue eyes were staring open. It was very cold and I went to the Spanish bodega to get some saltine crackers and stuff to make oyster stew. There were no oysters and so I was gonna get just milk and butter and cook that, but it had disappeared from the shelves. Only odd Campbells  soup was there. Clear watery soup with 3 or 4 thin, thin brown twisted noodles and a few black beans floating amongst them."

Evelyn came and said (that) she had to go swing dancing, 'cause she got a new T-shirt with fringes. And I said, "" Evelyn, I don't know if they wore tacky shirts like for swing dancing.""

It had 2 big bare rooms with high ceilings. And the film crew from off (of the) movies they make, they were so fake, and I was TRYING not to even look at the party guest(s) because they were so out of it. And finally I laid down on the real bed and turned my back on them because they were so fake and smiling pretty. I was afraid too, and I didn't want to talk to them so I turned to my kitty and I talked to her. Take care, Armando. -- Love, Merri [Armando Perez, co-founder of Charas El Bohio (a community center on the Lower East Side), was murdered April 4, 1999] There was a protest and we went there in roller coaster carts on the rail. There were lots of us. It was for Charas. There were also many prisoners, demonstrating hand to hand combat, to show the crowd of investors what we were capable of. We each collected things to throw off the roller coaster and break. I took a white plaster statue to throw and break. We had to climb under the barbed wire and throw the objects to break out before we climbed under, being careful not to break them then, to save them to break later for the protest. Circus performers were there and they jumped from the press box onto a set of coiled box springs. I was all set to jump. I wanted to so very bad, and then this grown up lady told me I couldn't. I told her I WAS NOT scared of getting hurt. That I would be having fun, even if I did get hurt, and that I had just as much right to jump as the clowns (did). (These clowns were poverty-stricken and wearing very ragged clothes, and for that reason, I admired them more.) One was on stilts and he jumped onto the coiled spring mattress and another one did flips after jumping onto the springs, and another one did back flips, and another one jumped onto his knees. Team studio 305 was following the 4 white girls to Sunday School, when William came along and told us we could follow him on the highest altitude land pass trail to the lowest altitude destination. First I was scared until he told us the secret... The secret: that the ridge along the top of the mountain would eventually lead to a path, that lead beneath the waterfall. In the hollowed out space underneath the cliff between the 500 ft. waterfall and the huge rock mass it fell from at a higher altitude. He was so happy because he was surprising us with a cookout. A picnic under the waterfall and he even carried the charcoal and the grill down the long winding mountain trail, even though it was a lot of extra trouble."

My father was suppose to be driving the church bus, but we knew that chances were pretty good that he wasn't where he was suppose to be. We knew it was trouble when my mother went to look for my father. We were waiting to see if my mother tracked down my father. Dora was afraid to cry when my mother was there. I realized how pretty she was (when she was young) and my father was too. Dora was addressing a 24"" X 24"" X 4"" box to mail to the little boy. It was chocolate from Switzerland and snacks. Dora was concerned about the little boy because the big grown men in his family had been punching him hard in the face and before she would (take time to) cry (for herself) she had to help him. On TV there was a violent movie with grown men punching a little boy. In the background, behind the truck, the little boy's father was waiting for us to make a spelling error so (that) he could beat him up again. Movies about horses roping other horse, horses with their front legs tied together, were scary. I didn't want Dora to see such violence. She was already upset. The church bus came back. my father and a young man and his wife (both) with red hair (were with him). My mother was not there but had been watching from the top of the double decker bus."

I didn't get to play long when somebody said, ""STOP THAT RACKET!"" I said, ""Do you know Jasmine?"" They said, ""Shhhh. I can't hear."" I called on a phone, 377 Florida, and it was Bob Hess. There were 3 mirrors. And girls in black and white sequined bathing suits were busy staring at themselves in the mirrors and hugging them (the mirrors) and trying to look sexy. But then 2 girls had rolled up foam (rubber) with balloons, carpet and fiber contusions (were) sticking out. (You could see their heads sticking out from a circle, cut into the carpet roll; you could see their lower legs and feet.) On the roof pier we were standing and talking about Kerhonkson and I told them it used to be $179 for 3 weeks. Now it was $500 for one week. They were talking about how talented Beth Lanford was as an artist. I was drawing on the walls. The guy who'd been asleep in the orange tent was waking up. It was night. 3 obese ladies were walking in single file around the roof pier in mumus. (plural of mumu. Tent dress) A fella pointed at the ladies and said, ""No they're not. I is a man. I made millions toward boobs and hairdo's,"" but he shook his head NO!

All around my bed was an ashtray and ashes spread out in the vicinity of the ashtray. There were crumbs and pencils too. I sort of blew the ashes (I picked up the ashtray) to disperse the ashes and then I patted the carpet with my hand and brushed some of the crumbs aside. I had to do this to slide the door across to divide the room. It would not slide over the stuff. I just then looked up and saw a hanger at the end of the rack with a tag. It said, ""Rudy's first grade project."" It had a little hat and a space (for where his head would have been) and a shirt overlapped by a sweater and little pants and socks and shoes. Rudy unhooked the hanger and took the hat off. Then you could see his head when he was 6. There was a big gash and hair had just barely grown back from where they had to shave it at the emergency room. It hurt me so much to see what Rudy had been through. The hair on his forehead and sides was regular. Just the oblong tip top of his head had been shaved. [Me and Rudy] were on David Letterman together. I was in a glass booth and Rudy made funny faces and when I came out I sat on the desk. I slid the sliding door across, now that I had cleared away the debris. Me and my father were in the car, looking for a short cut. We had a map, but we were not using it. my father's sax was in the car and we ran across a young fellow with long hair sitting cross-leg on a blanket in Keith and Kevin's yard. I said, ""Nat, this is my father; my father--Nat."" My father took out his horn and let Nat play it. The Beeks, Keith and Kevin, were getting ready for church so they could not come out and play.

He had drawn Jackie and her shadow and made numerical notes about the proportion of shadows in relation to actual size and angle of the sun. Time is only an attempt to name the relationship between revolving and rotation of the sun and planets, our solar system, etc. Then in the office I heard my name, Coach Croxton was buying snack cakes from the convenience store, he was helping a small black boy across the street; but then, beat him up after they got across.

My mother wanted to watch a program on channel 4 about the 1700's. (It was the only channel without a game show on). She told me to switch the remote. I accidentally passed over the 149 and was going too fast and before I had time to stop, I had passed channel 4. [and the remote would not 'subtract' numbers] so I had to start all over again. My mother yelled, ""NO!"" I tried again to get channel 4 and I slowed down this time, but the numbers went over channel 3 directly to channel 5, skipping channel 4 and my mother said, ""Can't you do anything right?""

"062"	"(07/06/1999)"	"We were waiting for Dora to come back. I was looking in the supply catalog for surprises and so many pages of guns were in there. I went to the back porch and opened the freezer. I was looking for surprises. Instead I found a mixed up frozen clump of turnip greens and peas; I was suppose to cook them for supper in the electric frying pan. My mother said, ""I told you to cut up some cabbage for supper."" I said, ""OK,"" and tried to hide the turnip greens. I saw a headline in Helvetica, ""Kill or be killed,"" and it was talking about the attitude of the bear. He was 9 feet tall and spit was dripping out of his mouth and he picked me up and held me high in the air. I thought about the headline and I was trying to whack him on the head but my attempts were futile. I needed to get things ready for Dora to come back. She would be back soon. I wanted to see her smile."
"063"	"(07/06/1999)"	"I was taking a bath with bubbles and kitty was in the bathtub with me. She was floating on a little shelf similar to Yukon Cornelius. She saw the shelf of bubbles approaching like an iceberg and she did not know what it was. She thought it was solid until it came up to her and started to get her wet. She put her paw through it and it was nothing. She jumped up and ran away and I wanted her to stay with me. Me and Rudy were suppose to be taking care of things at the house. Behind the house the creek had been turned into a man-made lake. We were looking out the window when a sewer pipe busted and the lake was getting filled up with blood. I said to Rudy, ""Unless this is the 'Plagues of Egypt' something is bad wrong."" He explained it was the 'fowl meal': crushed up dead birds that were dumped in the water for the fish to eat. That's why it was so bloody. I was desperately looking for a number in the yellow pages of someone who specialized in that type of clean up. Rudy said, ""It's OK, my father knows how to make it (the blood) disappear (by) swishing it with brooms in the water. It sounded odd but I knew it would work if my father figured it out. On the subway the doors locked and the lights were out and I could not find the parcel I'd left in one of the many cars."
"064"	"(07/07/1999)"	"Me and Francie were playing. We hadn't seen each other in 13 or 14 years. Francie was wearing bright pink. She had bright pink pants on and wanted me to find some too. Not exactly the same. Jesus said, ""This is our clubhouse."" We were going on a bicycle trip, me and Francie, and I was riding alone first to meet them and the tube. ???. My tube and tire blew out. Since ??? busted ???. The airport seemed to do better. I told Francie, ""I'm gonna have to push my bike 'cause the...out the blowout."" Francie picked out a great ochre, tan, and brown turtleneck halter top and then she left. She had reasons. I had a hole in my pants and I wanted to buy new ones. ??? paid for the peddle pushers in the ???. We were playing World War III and we each had a real Lazer gun that looked like a toy but was real. I was laying in the floorboard of the backseat of a car in the parking lot waiting for the right opportunity to shoot my gun. I had 10 bullets. Then I remembered I had to get my bicycle tire fixed. I was upset since I was not sure if it was a real war or a game. I was picking out pants that weren't quite comfortable. I could not understand right now. The free samples were stacked high in a tray ???. On Elizabeth St. the closing door came down on my head. I had to roll under like army men."
"065"	"(07/08/1999)"	"My mother said, ""Who left this toaster on? You almost burned it up!"" She knew it was me. In the kitchen was a little boy who was playing the cereal game with boxes of cereal that he threw down from the cabinet when he climbed up on the counter. He was singing a song that he made up about Raisin Bran and Sugar Smacks. He started crying that all the boxes were empty. So I was sitting on the floor and I picked up Cheerios that had spilled on the floor and the big empty Cheerios box, and I bit a cheerio and I said, ""See, it's stale anyway,"" (to try and make him feel better) but it was not stale at all. Kevin was doing a card trick with $20 bills. On the stage were people in 'The Little Rascals' costumes. One of them was a cemetery with disjointed misproportioned people dancing ??? My mother had been real sweet with that little baby teaching him and I wondered at what age the sweet act stopped. I was worried about the baby's conditioning for later life. I wondered about experiments raising children. Kitty was hiding and somebody got all upset because they said, ""She needs a cardboard box like a turtle shell."" My mother was sick and it was raining and Dora asked me to go to the Korean deli and get an aspirin plant [a green plant with leaves that grew aspirin] because my mother said that's what she needed to get better, and Dora wasn't here to get it for her. My mother and Aunt Linda and me and Stephanie had to lay on the down blanket and they were arguing about who got to lay on the hot coals; and I went back and the coals had caught fire and I dumped paper cups of water on the blanket. Now my white down blanket (Dora's white down blanket that I got after she was killed, and that Chuck threw up blood all over when he died in my bed) to sleep under was soaking wet. I did not know what to do, but I thought I had done the right thing. My mother drove to see if I got the aspirin plants at the right place and stopped the car to see tomato plants wholesale at the gas station and she said, ""I've got more tomato plants than I know what to do with."" An ex-professional was homeless and walking near Tavern on the Green in Central Park. He was on the way to an off-the-books job. He said, ""Can you believe when I first came I had to work to pay $1,134.00 a month to share a room with 3 other people and I hated my job I had to work just to pay the rent."" I knew what he meant."
"066"	"(07/09/1999)"	"I was going to the hotel swimming pool with 2 strangers; a man and a woman and they each had backpacks and provisions. Army backpacks. The girl had to practice singing and she could not sing so good, so she needed to be by herself. I thought the pool should be able to fit 3 people easy but they wanted to know. Rudy was very little. He was learning to walk and my father had chosen a spot I didn't think was too good for such a little kid to learn to walk. It was down endless counts of stairs, from the top of the mountain to the valley. But my father was exuberant over climbing down the mountain. When we got there it was time to take the elevator back up to the roof where to pool was. I had a pair of goggles with alternation blinking lights. I'd put my contacts in but one eye hurt, and I realized I had not peeled (off) the foil and plastic cover. I peeled the plastic off and threw it down on the ground so that Dora would not put the plastic in her eye, even though my contact lens prescription was twice as bad as hers. Not being able to see made me calm. Rudy had to sit on the top floor with my mother; I was throwing the goggles up several stories. I had been playing on my guitar. Then I left. I was running down the subway stairs. I had forgotten to get a token. The train was pulling out and I didn't think I'd make it in time. A guy was shaking his raised fist at the train for not stopping. I had been weaving. We packed on to a WWII train, elbow to elbow, with people close together. It was very crowded. There was a sign for 1st, 2nd, 3rd class. People were rushing and shoving, being hateful."

"068"	"(07/11/1999)"	"I went in the auditorium. It was dark. Very dark. In the lecture final ???. The teacher was talking about social issues and their influence on composition. She showed slides of Mozart and Beethoven and when they turned the lights on Mozart and Beethoven were in the crowded auditorium and they were not paying attention. They were making faces and rolling their eyes and sleeping when they felt like it; and the class was trying to hear an intelligent conversation about them, ignoring their presence. 2 sisters were very old with gray hair. One was 96. She was older. She was the college professor. The other one was standing in the dark, trying to see any empty seats. She (me) was not paying attention either. The adult Sunday School class was having a discussion about ""stacking attendance records,"" so (that) it would seem like twice as many people went to Sunday School. ???. I did NOT want to go to Sunday School."
"069"	"(07/11/1999)"	"I didn't have any clean underwear so I was wearing a bathing suit. It was a one piece bathing suit from the 1950's, but when I had to go to the bathroom it was very inconvenient, as I had to get completely undressed. Then I found some men's boxer shorts. They were thick crispy cotton with pockets and racing stripes. I was wearing a fancy skirt for church and the blue boxer shorts were bunched up and sticking all out at the waist. I had been sitting in the desk at school biding my time; between getting undressed to go to the bathroom, pulling out my bunched up blue boxer shorts, and trying to think of answers to the questions on the test (that was) written on the blackboard. Questions were about Puerto Rico, apartheid,  and the U.S. government. I was lying on the floor next to a guy in the classroom. It was naptime. The guy was suppose to be my boyfriend because he sat behind me in school. He did NOT know the answers to the test questions on the black board, so he tried to look on my paper. The teacher down the hall was late getting there and when she did, the sign said, ""5B500."" We could hear the--all the students together in the classroom saying together, ""Hello Miss Johnson."" And she would say, ""Hello class."" ""Hello Miss Johnson."" ""Hello class,"" over and over. I did not have a place to sleep, so I had to sleep in the car, but I forgot to put on the emergency brake and it rolled backwards down the hill. I was in Charleston. At the College there were displays for Wonder Bread. Some bags were full and some had only 5 slices. I went to get some coffee at the snack bar and they told me they didn't sell coffee till after 10 a.m. I was asking people, ""Do you know my sister?"" I told them my sister had hired a doctor for the health services, and they said (that) they'd hired 13 new doctors since then. I kept searching for someone who had known Dora. Girls in ugly, HUGE, way too big shoes were sashaying down the sidewalk. One shoe with feathers was as big as a 10-speed bicycle and she had to move in angles to fit down the hall. That lady who crawled under the table on all fours was licking the floor with her tongue."

While driving, Rudy was in trouble because he took the hard top off the truck (that) we were in. And have experience throw at one interstate and not. Aunt Jenny was there and she.............she hugged me. Aunt Jenny . Aunt Jackie was there and the whole count was: onesie, twosie, threesie. That whole family had a bad attitude. I was happy to be sitting under the cardboard box, but Aunt Jackie said, ""You're sitting in the wrong place."" I had to cook but to ???, and I had a round aluminum pie plate to use, and I was ready to use eye #3 (center). I could not ???. Then they said this. They said, ""Boil, dry?""... ??? dry."

"073"	"(07/15/1999)"	"I was at the convenience store. A man and his son ran it. There was a front door and a back door, and large groups of children filed through. There were about a dozen of them. They were scared. Their faces were dirty. They had no shoes or shirts. On the huge video screen came a thunderstorm WARNING. Strong winds blew the children. There was big lightning and thunder, and the children had 2 daddies. Their fathers thought they knew how ??? We got them a place and ???. Dora was helping me with the last numbers (fingering) of the Debussy piece when I realized (that)I had forgot(ten) the negatives to enlarge so I could not print. ???

"074"	"(07/16/1999)"	"Kitty cat was in the darkroom with me. A piano was in there too. I had a $5.00 coupon for food but I'd apparently already used it for candy. I stopped and looked at the curling activator kits that were stacked up on the display. The girl on the box looked seriously coy, but she did NOT look fun. I was walking to the thrift stores in the U.S. national forests. They were on top of a mountain down a dirt road. At the first one I found 2 pairs of sandals that I LOVED. But they were tiny little kids' sandals. I hit them with a stick, in hopes that that would zap them up to my size, but no luck. It was 10 minutes till closing, so I left to see what was there. I had to check my bag and got assigned ""B"" shelf, and saw that the clerk lady had made inventory notes: ""Nothing good,"" on it. I was sitting on the wood floor of the auditorium stage behind the black velvet curtain waiting for cartons when NAVY AIRCRAFT CARRIERS went by in the ocean. The deck was ship-shape! While I was sitting there the ceiling collapsed. So they bought in cranes, wrecking balls and aluminum columns, of rectangular shape. I was sitting in the grocery check-out with my pants down; Wesley Cook, a Jehovah Witness, was staring at me because I didn't have my pants on."
"075"	"(07/18/1999)"	"There was a hot pink blanket 50 x 51 inches. The tag gave the dimensions. I was suppose to fold up the blanket but I couldn't fold it good so I wadded it up and walked with it on my head. On 8th Avenue I met a guy who was complaining viciously about art school models. We had to sit completely still. Complete. The pyramid. Dominoes were big. Evelyn was teaching a class called ""late prevention."" I wanted to learn how to get (to) places on time. The papers. I was in charge of picking out Christmas presents. I had folders and I was looking for Christmas paper. I was at work waiting for the time clock to hit 15 so I could go. I could go.

"077"	"(07/20/1999)"	"It was time to go Christmas shopping. We went to the grocery store. Me and Rudy and Dora. We were looking for a Christmas present for my father. Dora said (that) it should still be in the box, so he'd be down there waiting. We also picked out some strange Chinese vegetables but by the time (that) we got there ??? going bald. Then there was a cone-shaped wrapper with sea shells in it (that) you were suppose to boil. It cost $4.11. I thought it was too expensive. One was $7.87. I thought Rudy would like the pot pie, regular style, but Dora said smiling calm, ""We should pick something the whole family will like."" So we picked out a brand new color TV, still in the cardboard box. ""Leave it in the box so (that)my father will have something to open on Christmas morning,"" Dora said. In the meantime, I picked out a gray champion sweatshirt. It was $4.00. I was extremely happy with my purchase. We needed to watch the editing and there were 2 versions. It was black and white; tall gangly model girls with slicked back hair, draping their arms and legs over the arms of chairs in a very slouched way. They looked bored but thought (that) they looked compelling. Mary said, ""It's the same footage regular size and then blown up so big (that) you can't tell what it is. Do you see yourself?"" I said, ""No."" She said, ""I've got to do it over anyway."

A girl ostrich and a boy ostrich. The girl ostrich was running down the hill to jump in(to) the lake. Then she ran by me; I reached and yanked out 2 ostrich plumes. When the ostrich feathers ???, I looked and saw that the 2 feathers I'd yanked out were not feathers. They were fishing poles. ??? I showed the ostrich beautiful long plumes and she said, ""Those aren't mine. Those are fishing poles. They grow on boy ostriches."" I said, ""But I pulled them off of your back."" I remembered Mary was waiting for me and I said to Mary, ""How long till take off?"" She said, ""20 minutes."" I said, ""Oh, I've got to go home and pack."" Dora and I had to go to the bathroom. We went to Kentucky Fried Chicken's bathroom. In line Dora was raving about what a great meal powdered doughnuts and milk were. ""But don't ever mix Jello powder and Cool Whip,"" Dora said."

He was riding in the backseat with his parent; his parent put their hand over his face, crushing Allah's temples with thumb and fingers. The parent pushed their hand into Allah's eye sockets (with) thumb and 4th finger, shaking him till he was dead. His face had been clawed off. Old Indian legend told the story of Allah's death. They say all over the woods you can hear the screams of Allah's ghost moaning, ""Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah."" 7 times. Dora was in the back seat too. She heard the screams. When she tried to climb out of the window she dropped her schoolbooks. When I got out of the door to pick them up for her Jack was left in the driver's seat, on the right, and he had never driven a car before. The car started rolling into the creek until Dora saved the day. Homer was making a funny joke about Christian Scientists. The Bible prophecy said the tree would grow with boards nailed in different directions."

"084"	"(07/25/1999)"	"Me and Rudy climbed under the railroad trestle and down the hill; down a dirt path through the woods and over rocks. William, Ester and Ackerman came along. Ackerman was there without his mother, and without permission from his mother. I wanted to jump in and see where the river would take me. Nobody else wanted to swim, so I jumped in, in my clothes, and started going downstream with the current. When I'd gotten out of sight of the others, the river branched out into 3 directions. It suddenly got very deep. I was going faster and faster. I passed a good rock to grab on to, but I missed it. That was the first detour from the river. At the next fork it became unclear which one was the real river. The rocks on the side were extremely steep, and I let the current take me where it wanted to. I climbed up the tall, steep rock wall and over huge empty 50 gallon oil drums (that were) stacked up 7 or 8 barrels high. When I got to the top, I could see the others far away. I could see that the Con Edison lady was yelling at THEM because I swam down the river. I wanted them to jump into the river to get away from her. The Con Ed lady was mad about me swimming in the river, climbing over the barrels, and (climbing) over the rocks. She thought I was in too deep. She said (that) no swimming was allowed. I felt like Con Edison had no jurisdiction over the river, even if it (the river) did provide their electricity."
"085"	"(07/26/1999)"	"There was a little girl. She was an exchange student in a different place. Kids there had horses (that) they saddled and sat on, but didn't ride. I thought, ""What I need here is a horse and then the other kids will talk to me."" But when I got up on the horse the kids threw sticks and rocks at me. I was trying to make a cup of hot tea and I had the wrong kind of leaves in there. It was just water with leaves from outside I'd thrown in lukewarm water. There was a little boy. His name was Tiny Boy. I thought that (Tiny Boy) would not be such a good name when he was big and old. Out for a movie was a tiny little boy wearing my father's bright red coat. He had to stand on a chair so (that) the long red coat would not hit the floor. He was very intent on eating chicken legs. He had 3 in all. They were fried. I was hoping to see Dora. In the park near the river, the outdoor movie was $9.50. They did have chairs. I saw Paula there. She was training 3 priests. I sat on the curb in front of the house, waiting for the mailman. I needed to tell him about Dora's address and any left mail from people who didn't know yet (that) she was killed. She would come and play and make my mother and my father cry. I didn't want them to call. When Evelyn came over I was contemplating the spelling of: ketchup / catsup"

"087"	"(07/28/1999)"	"There was a girl monkey. She was scrawny and tired and she had one lone, limp ribbon tied in a knot around her head. It was red and looked tired. The knot was tied just over her left eye and the long end hung down right in front of her eye. I had to lean close to hear what she was saying. I leaned so close (that) I could feel her breath, hot, and smell the cigarettes she'd been smoking. It was the first monkey I'd ever known who smoked. Her upper arm (was) balanced on top of her head and her forearm (was) hanging down slightly to the side of her face. The cigarette was an extension of herself and she was tired. Her breath was stinky and hot. Chuck was gonna read one of his poems at a bar that was open on Wednesdays."
"088"	"(07/29/1999)"	"I was waiting for Rudy; I decided to take a shower and wash my hair while I was waiting, because it felt greasy. I didn't think I had enough time to take my clothes off too, so I took the shower with my shorts and t-shirt on. I took off my watch though, and took the barrettes out of my hair. Half way through I decided to go finish my shower in the bathroom which was Rudy's. There were about 12 inches of old bath water that was cold by now. I stood in the water. I pulled out the plug so that the water would not be standing when he returned. I forgot I (that) I had left my shower running full force; when I opened the door it was hard to push because of water pressure. When I got it pushed open water rushed through the door, everywhere. I decided not to finish my bath because the A train was waiting (14 St. to home) for transporting residents, from all over the school district to 14 St. The second leg of the journey was far more complicated and it was not quite time to leave yet."
"089"	"(07/30/1999)"	"We went to Aunt Joe's and nobody was home. So I went to the side yard, to look at the old junk car parked up on blocks there. While looking at the car I noticed a baby chick playing on the ground near my feet. Next we were at a hotel. 2 very annoying college girls were there. Their mothers were just as annoying but not as loud. The girls were laying on the bed face down, with feet crossed and knees bent. One girl was on her side. Dora came in and said, ""I believe you girls were going to leave."" She knew they were driving me mad. ???. My clothes were scattered all over the floor, hanging out of drawers and sticking out of closets. The college girls ???. ""You girls have a schedule to adhere to,"" Dora said, meaning: Check out time is 11:00 and Merri needs some time ALONE. In the hotel bathroom the baby chick was standing in the warm spot of light, until I missed the toilet and tinkled all over the floor by accident. It smelled bad and the chick ran away. A guy came out and was screaming. Someone had stolen his car. (It was) a blue early 60's model. He needed his car. This place is in the city, not the country. He was showing us the history of baseball, (showing us) the origins of baseball by driving across a dotted ball field. I said, ""This is the most boring thing I've ever done. It's no man's land."" Instead of studying the origins of baseball I was looking at the spider. One fake (plastic inflatable spider was) hanging from the ceiling. One was real. I had left the hotel, traveled hundreds of miles to the next hotel the next day; and realized I had left a huge mess in the first hotel. I had not packed anything. NOT one thing."
"090"	"(07/31/1999)"	"I was approaching an army camp with a fence around it. I was going to sign myself up. A WWII veteran was hovering outside and he was tired. He looked very tired. The old tired soldier lunged at me yelling, ""Where's my hug?"" I ran fast and said, ""Back then, up until WWII it might've been true, but NOT NOW!"" I ran fast. I was getting my official helmet. I put a pink ball on top. Someone, a guy, was looking for a clavicle. The only one small enough....he was a little boy, about 9 or 10 years. The man did the SPOCK SHOCK on him and his skeleton separated. He finished and then surged forward as if his head was a chicken. Me and Evelyn were doing a cartoon. We were discussing lower-cost animation from Mexico. Evelyn said that just South of the border everybody was doing animation and good. They had work tables set up outside. Everybody did. The cover illustration of Evelyn was NOT good. It was too light and did NOT look like her. I was carrying a machine gun through the park in Columbia where Aunt Jenny used to swing us. A guy was looking sneaky in the park. He was trying to steal my machine gun. Me and Evelyn got an apartment and slept on the floor. ???. Christian came to visit and he was lying on the floor next to me and he kissed me. Evelyn knew how long it'd been since I'd been with anybody so she yawned and said, ""I'm going to bed."" It was 6:30 p.m. He forgot something and he had to leave and come back. When he got back I was rinsing my mouth out with water. We started making out. He put on a tape of himself singing a Bread song. His sister came in bringing 2 presents for me. A small used tape player and a used microwave. I was happy to get them. We did NOT have sex because of the allegations that we had searched, and only found folding bicycles."
"091"	"(08/01/1999)"	"I was sitting in the backyard with a plate of scrambled eggs. I had forgotten to take the yellow part out so they were very dense. I had forgotten to stir them too. Then Dora came to the backyard and she had a plate of scrambled eggs too. She had taken the yellow part out and she had stirred them. Her scrambled eggs were light and fluffy. My mother called us to come in the house. Company was here. They came out on the back porch. I had been washing clothes. They were NOT folded, except the sarong I had gotten to give to Dora as a present. Dora. It was my birthday. Dora had a circle of rocket candles that go out and come back on when you blow them out. We just needed a cake to put them in. I blew them out. They came back on. I blew them out. They came back on. I blew them out and then you could see clear glass cylinders at the base of the rocket birthday candles. Ascending from the short glass cylinders was a wick in each tube. Then I understood how it worked. ""These clothes are a mess!"" My mother said. I said, ""The sarong is for Dora."" My mother said, ""Dora, your cart only has one hook and it won't stay on the ceiling. Merri's has 2 hooks and she only paid $7.99 for it."" I wished she would shut up. Aunt Linda said I cut my hair too short. She said when she cut her hair short about a year ago it grew back red and I don't like it. A group of us were in the elevator. Connie too. On the 11th floor you had to sign in. The lady behind the window said, ""Boys, step over to the side."" I didn't know which group I belonged to. Connie got lost meandering through the upper floors of the building. The country singer had big teeth and his brother did the echo part."
"092"	"(08/02/1999)"	"I was working at McDonalds. It was raining and I had to go in at 3 p.m. At 6 p.m. we got a break for 1/2 hour. I was going to run during my bread with the only person I liked at McDonalds. He was an old black fellow. I had skated down the interstate to see where the rain started. On the way I saw a roadside exhibition for the dethroned emperor of China. He had 2 ponytails on top of his head and he was calm. China had killed him. Coming back across the way, I gripped the rocks with my toes. There was squash and corn in the field. The cow was loose and she was nibbling. She preferred the nearly rotted vegetables. I saw the kids on the rocks. They were very happy. I wanted to remember their places. When Maria was unsure what to do, she asked her toy turkey what to do. She laid an egg and Maria cracked it open and it told her what was best. During my 1/2 hour break from McDonalds other workers asked me to go to KFC for them but, no, I was going to run."
"093"	"(08/03/1999)"	"It was in Ireland hundreds of years ago. There was a couple. They loved each other very much. He had very light brown reddish hair that was very curly. She had curly hair too. They were shepherds and made their living by making cloth from the wool they wove from the sheep. They dyed it in huge pots over flames. They wove it into cloth. They sold the cloth. It was beautiful. The girl even wove some cloth while it was still on the sheep's back. It was a very special sheep. It would stay very warm in winter because the new fur wool would grow under the woven wool that had been woven tight, tight against his skin in the summer. Then the rich people ran them off the land and amputated the man's legs to show them they meant business. I was in court to ratify an amendment which we decided by a majority vote. I was surprised how easy it was to pass an amendment. And it was heartwarming that congress met in am empty Sunday School room, with mismatched and broken chairs, on the 2nd floor of a church, on Tuesday evenings. Marianna opened a new gallery and was painting it orange and black. I wasn't crazy about the colors but Marianna had a master plan in mind. Community Access cashed in at an opportune moment by buying an UGLY horoscope calendar--6 feet long X 18 inches wide at K-Mart and insisting it be hung with the art. It was so tacky. I cut out to go to the zoo. I was watching the penguins. Ice was slushy on top of their lake. They were skating around having such a good time. They had their individual penguin huts that fit over them like a toaster cover but were solid. I didn't know how they got in there."
"094"	"(08/04/1999)"	"The cops came down to the Abrams' house. It was about the dogs behind the house. There was a conspiracy. The tree house was the hideout. I took secret documents and I was sleeping overnight up there. I took documents up to the 7th story wrapped up in cardboard to the tree house and left them for the other co-leader. I had to get down from the tree house to see about my mother. She had fixed supper and was staring at it. She was screaming out, ""Take me to Bull Street."" Everybody knew Bull Street was the state hospital for crazies. Then she stopped screaming and was dead quiet. Staring. That made me REALLY SCARED. My mother's condition was interfering with my tree house conspirator duties. I had responsibilities there. I had ???. The suave rich guy had a motorcycle and I was unsure of the stuff ???. Losing control with ??? and asked me did I want a ride on his motorcycle up to the top of the mountain to look at the leaves and the lake. I said no but then I was lying on a rock getting warm when he walked down swanky. ""KA 1 OK"" and the window uncontrolled evidence in the lake. The leaves were beautiful. Very much worth missing my shift of watch at the tree house. We rode the motorcycle up and down the mountain. The motorcycle and the stories were inconsistent. His tweed pants and wool sport coat were thrown on the mountain floor. I was running a time trial on an indoor track. A girl cut out in front of me and tripped me. I was mad. Because I was slower."
"095"	"(08/05/1999)"	"There was an overly fancy coffee shop across from the campus. You had to cross a big courtyard to get there and it looked like rain. When we got there the prices were extra high and I felt apprehensive about laying out that much cash for coffee. So I went to the next coffee shop a couple of doors down. It was a no-name place but just as over priced. I decided to leave before it rained and in my backpack I had a notebook page of writing someone described as eloquent. In there I also had a baseball hat to give the dishwasher. On the underneath side of the bill I had written as big as I could fit: ""I'll pay you back."" He was somebody I'd never seen before and would probably never see again. Then we went to a 7-11 type store and I thought, ""This is my kind of coffee."" I put my stuff on the ground and paid for a paper cup. But it was really 2 cups inside each other ??? went ??? spilled ??? were opaque ??? Dora ??? ??? 3 of at the very last ??? packets ??? moment I decided to get hot chocolate ??? where I'd get my stuff ??? of equal scattered out ??? contents ??? ??? and I said, ""My keys are in there. 4 keys. ??? then I took ??? pull ??? ??? relieved ??? backpack ...then I took the paper cup to the counter to pour my coffee and it was really 2 cups. And so I thought, ""Good, I'll get some for me and some for Dora,"" Then I decided to get hot chocolate instead because it taste better than coffee. I fixed it up just the way me and Dora liked it and I sat it down on the floor. A girl was taking off with my backpack. I knew it was mine, 'cause it was real old and the zipper was broken. And I said, ""That's my backpack,"" and she dropped out the stuff on the floor and there were caramels in there, individually wrapped in opaque plastic, kind of yellow ochre colored, with printing on them, and there were a bunch of packs of equal. They scattered all over the floor. To prove it was my backpack I reached my hand in there. I said, ""There's keys in there. There are 4 keys on a ring."" And sure enough it was 4 keys. And I said, ""There's broken glasses in there, broken right across the nosepiece."" * ......them out. Then I scooped out handfuls of sandy dirt and tobacco residue and bits of paper. Mostly dirt. ""See, this is mine,"" I said. ""Okay,"" she said. Dora was nowhere in sight and I could not give her her hot chocolate, so I sat it directly across from me and, sitting on the ground sipping my hot chocolate, I looked at the family photo album. The photograph was stained and yellow and it was people from the 1700's. It was Aunt Jenny 's photo album. The people dressed 1700's but I was determined otherwise. They were either 1700 or 1970. ??? The guy said, ""I haven't had a fake birthday party since I was 18."" He said, ""We'll have the party as the one approaches two."" He was talking about the hands on the clock and it took much longer than we thought it would. "
"096"	"(08/07/1999)"	"I was looking for a Section 8 place and I didn't know where to begin. I had a list. It had Fountain Inn on there. Chuck's mother said she had stayed there when she was an alcoholic and in school full time, since Chuck wasn't around to take care of her. Another place was on Avenue C and parents in prison went there to re-acclimate themselves to the mountain family existence of upstate with lakes. Chuck's mother said when she was too drunk to take care of things and Chuck was too drunk to take care of her; she stayed at the residential home in Fountain Inn."
"097"	"(08/08/1999)"	"We were in a classroom. Very, very thin green wax was on 9"" X 6"" strips of wax paper. I was drawing little objects with a razor blade. Then I would scrape around it and save the wax shavings. This scraping was on the state teacher's exam. Then the pennies grew into copper cookie cutters about the very same size as a penny. This time I scraped even better because I had practice, the first time. Rudy was very happy about the green wax. That I had gotten it ALL OFF. Then we watched a little girl and a little boy. He was oblivious, playing. She had 2 braids and blonde hair. She stared at him a long time. Then she bolted up to him, grabbed his shoulders and kissed him. Then he chased her into the tall grass, taller than them. I couldn't see them but I heard him say, ""Now I'm suppose to put my hand down your pants."" Back at class the puppies were playing on the teacher's desk. It was Mr. Holland. One peed in his water bowl and I washed it out with hot water from a deli coffee pot. Then it was time to go. Class would resume in 1.5 hours and it had taken over an hour to get there. The girl was playing the bass [that] I wanted to play. It was an unusual bass and most of the string part was covered up except a little cutaway for your fingers. On the way home I walked past a roadside produce stand. I ate a strawberry and got one head of lettuce. When I got to the Rocky River bridge at Mitchell Presley's (Ekom Beach) the bridge was washed out because of the flood, so I had to walk another way. I was walking down the old Chestnut St., an abandoned road a long, long time overgrown with kudzu. Near the railroad tracks was a [n] old junk car that had not worked in a long, long time. Lying across the back seat was a black-haired man nodding out. The officer said, ""He's O.D.'d."" He was gasping for air. He was dying. The officer said, ""Do you want to see him die? And I ran and screamed, ""NO."" I'd seen too many people die already. His little boy was left playing near the railroad tracks. He had a huge turban on his head, sort of 3-sided with his hair sticking out. His eyes were black. He'd been through this before and he was not alarmed."
"098"	"(08/09/1999)"	"There was a hot air popcorn machine on the counter. I was making popcorn. Jack was holding the electric cord from the vacuum cleaner next to the socket, waiting--ready to plug it in when the popcorn was done, because it would blow a fuse if they were both on at the same time. When I finished the popcorn it was in a bowl balancing in the sink and I accidentally turned the water on the popcorn and it got all squishy and sogged down to crunch kernel mush in very bottom of the aluminum pan, so I had to do it over. Jack was very annoyed with me because he was losing valuable vacuum time. I was getting ready to go running when Janeesha came by with her buddy and invited me to go along to supper. Her friend came with her and I heard her mention a Bleffel gathering from South Carolina. And I said, ""That's my family."" And she said, ""You know Jimmy Bleffel?"" And I said, ""My grandpa was Charlie."" She turned white and had palpitations and she had to go back home. We waited an hour and 45 minutes for her and I was mad. I missed my run--so I decided to go running even though it was getting dark. On the escalator off ramp, girl tourists were sitting on the ramp and I screamed, ""Are you crazy? Don't block the ramp!"" A guy with crutches was trying to maneuver around them. I went to get my running shoes and they were hanging from the ceiling from a string. Guys getting ready for football practice were there and one had very powdery lemonade. He poured 1/2 full of a plastic cup and he said, ""Kill it."" And I said, ""No. I'm going to pour it on my blisters. He said, ""Oh."" They were suppose to be decorating the Christmas tree but they were doing a lazy, half-assed job. Flags were stuck out to the sides. They were in a football pile-up and I was trying to rig the Christmas tree flags (red) up vertically at least."
"099"	"(08/10/1999)"	"There was this inside joke. Everybody knew it; it was mainly used by newspaper readers and TV broadcasters. And it was about JQ Adams. The first part of the sentence would go, ""It was JQ Adams' policy..."" and the next person would go, ""What was JQ Adams' policy?"" and the first person would say, ""It was JQ Adams' policy to tell them."" It kept going like that--over and over and over. And everybody laughed. I laughed too. I was laughing.... ""It was JQ Adams' policy..."" ""What was JQ Adams' policy?"" ""It was JQ Adams policy to tell them."" While this joke was being laughed about, I went down to look at the rabid dog. He was pacing back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. He was in this little half yard with a cement block wall around it. The cement wall was only 4 cement blocks high. This rabid dog was pacing back and forth gnashing his terrible teeth. There were big ole' claws on his feet. Dora was not afraid of the rabid dog, but I'm a little bit scared of it. I was obsessed with watching that rabid dog, even though he could jump right over that wall and get me. I was working out intricate fingering on the piano. I needed to think. I was going down to the basement and water was filling up like a submarine with a leak. I wasn't sure what to do, so I slid down the fire hose. The man with the big knit hat stuffed big with his hair would NOT stop talking. Every once in a while the standing joke about J.Q. Adams' policy entered all conversation. It was the fad. ""What was his policy?"" ""It was JQ Adams' policy to tell them."""
"100"	"(08/11/1999)"	"Two mental patients had a pet bird named Inky. He died. They buried him 59 feet underground. One mental patient said about the other, ""He's very famous. He's a computer genius."" I was driving my father's 1963 navy blue Mercedes down the Old Laurens road. The floorboards were rotted out and it ran on diesel. I wasn't paying attention and had no idea I had been going 85 m.p.h. in a 35 zone. I saw the cops blinking red lights in the rear view mirror. I acted like I didn't see the cops and they evaporated into thin air. A man and his son were hitchhiking down the Old Bradenton Road and I hitched a ride with them. We ended up doing spiral loops under the Manhattan Bridge and the waves were breaking on rocks. I had a wire 13-gallon trash can helmet on my head and I took it off. The driver said, ""Why'd you do that?"" and I said I had a premonition that we crashed and I was going to die today. He said, ""Oh."" The driver, he took us to a Christmas party at a stranger's. A lady there liked me. She had a leathered face and a croaky voice and had been through the ringer. I only had one leg and just tied the empty warm-up pants leg in a knot and let it hang. There were many dishes to wash from Christmas dinner. I just turned the water on and watched it splash them. I did not scrub or use any soap to wash them. The lady had left for me: mostly pairs of cheap metal sunglasses--all broke in half right across the nosepiece. She had a drawer full of those things. She was extremely organized. 5 partitions inside the drawer ???. She had asked me to keep the fire going for her so the place would be warm when she got back. Even the kindling and middle size sticks were organized and knots in the branches downhill slanted and turned to the left. I put a knotty twisted branch in the fireplace to keep up the fire. People started knowing my name and I ran through the dark back halls of the church basement, running from them. They were at my heels but I lost them around corners. I stood there still and faded into the background like a lizard. I ran up the cement floor basement stairs, in that still and faded dark mess, 'off limits' except for the janitor. I barely got away. William could not get a wire attached in the engine of his car so the radio would not play. So he rode his bicycle. He met us there. I was astounded he got there before us. We were in the car going fast. We proceeded to hang the show."
"101"	"(08/12/1999)"	"I was at a big NYU building on the ground floor. It was located around Bond Street on Mercer. There were 2 pianos there. An upright in the small room for practice and a concert grand Steinway in the big auditorium. The auditorium had 5 long rows of fold up metal chairs. People started filing in. In each seat were pages of text typed on white paper. I did not know what was on the paper, but I did know these people had come for some kind of convention. I warmed up a little bit in the practice room, but not enough. A lady at the secretary desk confided in me. She had just hung up the phone. She said, ""That was somebody donating a piano. Unfortunately, it's just an upright and those things are practically worthless. Anything but a grand just gets in the way, but I hated to sound snotty and inappreciative, so I accepted it."" I was so envious. I wished somebody would donate a piano to me, but I knew I was not a non-profit organization, so my chances were slim at best. I went in to play for the convention. They were suppose to be impressed that I had been out on the streets and was now playing classical piano, but they just yawned. I stood in front and said, ""Hi."" I had my music scattered all over the piano. Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven, Debussy and Bach. Two pieces by Bach. Goldberg Variations #1 and #8. I was missing part of Beethoven. I had 2 copies of The Girl with the Flaxen Hair. (La Fille aux Cheveaux de Lin) and Mozart Sonata in C. I wished I had learned page 7. It was beautiful. I had music to [Chopin's Prelude] Opus 28 #7, which I did not know. I had 2 copies of the Debussy. I could not find the rest of the Beethoven. The music was scattered all over the place and I got the pages mixed of music. I couldn't find anything. I started on back. I was getting nervous with the dead silence broken by an occasional person clearing their throat. When I lifted my hands to play they got tangled up in the electric cord (white) attached to the lamp on the left end of the piano. It had no shade. It crashed to the floor and broke. I said, ""Oops,"" and kept looking for the right music. After the uncomfortable ordeal I realized my main problem was not organizing the pages and getting the composers together. William came in and said he'd like some authentic Chinese food. He said I could order it take-out or get a cookbook from the library and make it myself. Since we were in the neighborhood, I got a cookbook from the local branch library. But the recipes did NOT seem authentic. There was green apple pie (sour) and (sweet) ""vanivalar"" ((vanilla)) ice cream sweet. There were pork roll sandwiches with lettuce on them, in 3-D shapes of pigs."
"102"	"(08/13/1999)"	"We needed to make a big circular hook rug. Somebody had thought, ""The underside weaving of carpet would LOOK good,"" but then the rug fibers flew all over the place. The rug was 6^X2. 2(6^). [mathematical formulas for flowers] There were 3 colors in the hook rug and dismembered carpet. Dusky blue, faded red and age-yellowed white. Handfuls were causing the disassembly of the carpet fibers falling out. I was trying to delegate hook rug game distractions for anybody working. A guy in prison, Tony, was cutting a hit record. The song was about his love affair. It was called, ""Death Row Marriage."" He got nervous close to the microphone. I forgot his wife's name, but she was pretty. He was handsome. It was all sad, but then he shouldn't have killed those people in the first place. A drag queen was all excited about permanent spray on hair. She (he?) grabbed the prison singer's butt."
"103"	"(08/14/1999)"	"I was catching a bus back from a foreign place. It was a long trip and many other people were on the journey. The bus driver stopped to take his break 15 minutes before we were due to get into the city. A man had been sitting next to me on the bus. He was Spanish. I asked him where he was going and he said, ""Nicky."" Later I realized what he meant was NYC (pronounced ""Nicky--""C"" as in ""cat""). We waited an awfully long time and the driver never came back. He had taken the bus keys. We were waiting in Aunt Jenny 's driveway. I knocked on the door, front. It was Lois who came to the door. She was busy. Bryan was not playing tennis. While waiting for the bus driver people began unpacking their lunches. There were pop tarts broken ""just right"" for a shoot. One was strawberry. One was apple. A girl brought out a chicken leg, fried, as big as a turkey leg, but it was a chicken leg. It was wrapped in many leaves of lettuce. I wondered what she did about the chicken bone. I said, ""You must be from California."" And she said, ""No, I'm from near Denver, Colorado."" I said, ""People in California eat lettuce."" She said, ""We eat more lettuce in Colorado. We try to get all out vegetables at once. About half a head."" Finally the bus driver came back and said, ""OK everybody, back on the bus."" We were happy to be moving. We got as far as the gas station. Everyone shifted responsibility for who was going to pump. The gas was $1.29/gallon. The driver went out and he never came back. We were sitting on the bus waiting. Eventually we were either air-lifted out or continued on boats through canals and floods. Some were large inflated rafts with paddles. Some are free (empty), waiting on the pier. I saw Dora. She wanted to hear the Mozart I'd been working on. She had barely chipped (her tooth) and the dentist fixed it lousy. I knew she could get it done right. I did NOT want to go to Say Smith's wedding/birthday party. That crowd was too involved in the town's business."
"104"	"(08/15/1999)"	"It was free lunch in the lunchroom. 2 kinds of soup they had: cream of tarter soup with pepper for grown ups. Rubber band soup for kids. The grown up soup was terrible. I put my finger in and tasted it when the lunchroom lady wasn't looking. 2 young girls doing charity work told me the kids' soup was much better. Both kinds of soup had 6-sided oyster crackers floating in the soup. The workers could nibble crackers but NOT you. So on the way up the hill I had to pass by the place where the escaped convict was hiding out. It turned out to be a huge misunderstanding. We both loved convenience stores. At the red store, department [the red department store] there were heavy duty shopping bags of freebies for the poor propped up next to the door. There were thick big robes but just too heavy to wear and too thick and very ugly. Those robes were USELESS to anybody. A huge necklace was on top of a bag full of coat hangars. It didn't take much kindness to give that crap away. It was all messed up [the situation of helping unfortunates] . It was all crappy stuff nobody else wanted I had been to the library looking for one in a series of books about an 18th Century girl. The librarian recommended a book with 3 stories about Africa. Novelettes. I got both books and was surprised. They didn't ask about my overdue books. I also picked out a Dick Tracy picture book. I left the library with my books and I ran into Sonny Klienfield sitting on a bench on a bridge. We started looking at my books together. Then I had to leave and I ran into Zeb on the other side of the bridge. He was carrying many plastic bags of costumes. We pulled them out and tried them on for Sonny. Sonny liked Zeb a lot. Zeb was busy and forgot to take his bags with him. I put on a mans' beige cardigan with dark, dark trim. About 3/8."" I said, ""Sonny, Zeb left his stuff all over the place."" And he said, ""You should be glad you have a nice man."" Zeb was not my man, but Sonny was right. Scott was sitting on the wooden couch looking at pictures of castles. He called them rooks. I called them castles. He was trying to think of the place this castle was. Somewhere out of state, he said. He said, ""It's not swamps but like swamps."" I said, ""QUICKSAND!"" He said, ""No, like swamps, but not swamps; with grass chest high. I was sitting in a school desk. A girl in the row to my left, right across from me was very, very annoying. She was a model/actress. She was going on and on about her head shots and disrupting everybody and finally I went off in a tirade to her. I was mad. I said, ""You should put as much effort into your acting and forget about the head shots for now."" She was simpering. I said, ""you should quit whining."" She was looking at a book of photographers and bragging about her Mother. She flipped the pages of the catalog and kept complaining and I said, ""WOULD YOU SHUT UP!"" I looked behind me and Mary Reynaldie was taking it all in with amusement. Her eyes were thinking. My father was making home made peach ice cream and you could tell when it was ready because it started coming out of the top. I was in charge of scooping it into 12 Dixie Cups. my father liked vanilla wafers with his. Soggy in ice cream. I was running a race and I forgot about the finish line. A little girl was balancing her bicycle on the curb, trying to get to the very top of the hill. [I assumed the finish line was at the top of the hill, but I was wrong] Exterminator inspectors came into the apartment. I said, ""I'm busy now."" He said, ""You'll be busy later too."" So I kept doing what I had to do of everything around Zeb's bags and my books and the clutter. I didn't have time to be concerned about my mess. I followed him through the door. He had a vacuum cleaner. I thought, ""He sure cleaned up my kitchen fast."" There were 2 brand new duck head phones and a fax machine on the kitchen table. I loved the new phones he put in. It was sparkly clean. He said, ""This is NOT your kitchen, it's your neighbors.' "" I knew he was right. WE went back to my messy place. 3 messages. I hit ""play."" I had left a message on the answering machine telling Dora how much I loved her and missed her. I could not remember where I called from."
"105"	"(08/18/1999)"	"I was maybe looking. The clerk said, ""Look in area 2"" I was looking for Santa Claus in the department store. The guy who worked there said there were 2 left. And I said, ""Where ?"" He said, ""Section 2."" I looked all over the store. I could not find not one Santa Claus. After a while he said, ""Don't you know Santa Claus is a puppet?"" I still couldn't find Santa Claus puppet, life size or any form at all. I was suppose to meet Brian at the meth clinic. I was waiting in the park near by asking people, ""Have you seen Brian, Have you seen Brian?"" But we were in Chinatown where anything can happen. Then somebody came and told me Brian had been detained but he sent something for me and would I please hold onto it and refrigerate immediately for him. I said, ""Sure I will,"" and the guy pulled out a bottle half full of meth (1/2 full by all other standards). I reached out my hand and the meth, it was all taped up with clear wide tape at the mouth of the small plastic bottle. Just then a woman came up. The way she reached her arm and grabbed the bottle and looked at me I knew she was an undercover cop. She slapped out her handcuffs. I smiled and said, ""Could I have a moment to explain?"" She would not have given me the time except the union rules said she must take her lunch break now, so I sat at the picnic table with her and explained. Then at night I followed her down a dark alley way and the metal teeth revolving door turnstile was the only way to leave Chinatown. She had looked hard at something... maybe I had nothing to hide? HA HA! There was a newspaper article about women in families who loved each other very much and one or both had been killed. It listed the ages and relationships (Michelle, 36, mother; Chris,6, daughter) I wanted a picture of Dora's hands--I could tell at a glance it was her from her hands. Her hands. Her eyes. There was a catalog with drawings of many soccer balls. Many different colors."

""Lucky you're alive."" The rocks got tangled and then POOF! Untangled. I was maybe, there were lots of magazines and 2 toy trucks, maybe a postal cart. First I saw a toy truck, flimsy, cheap, white with string. I didn't want to. There were wonderful magazines. ""Science News,"" ""U.S. News and World Science,"" ""Space,"" It was Alan's stuff."

It was an accomplishment to swim there and back alive because of the dangerous undercurrents. Out on the rock in the river, I was asking a guy about the alternative uses for ""x"" in an equation. I said (that) ""x"" was unknown but he said, ""no,"" (that) I couldn't use it that way because I was using it with people variables and not numbers. My mother had 2 TV dinners, frozen, in the cabinet. I did not like everything in there--only one part of each one: the grits from one (from the egg lump, grits and wad of ham) and applesauce from the port chop dinner."

To use as a weapon, someone had broken off the trophy from a plaque belonging to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I didn't think they had to go so far as to ruin his trophy. I was working for David Salle and he was married to a working class woman who'd made it big. She highlighted her hair. There was a 'Lose Weight Camp' for fat boys. To lose weight they would go down a huge waterslide standing up. Every once in a while someone would fall and I knew bones would be broken eventually. I was working for Bryan Hunt and he said (that) now he worked where he lived, but I never saw him around there. He painted a lady and I didn't think it was so good. I was staring at it a long time when I saw her thumb move over and over. Then I understood. He had a little gold object on the shelf. I stared at it. He had a barbeque grill on the floor in front of an old (oil) painting, trying to dry it quicker. I found a long sleeve, faded, white, men's (dress) shirt on the floor. I had spilled water all over it by mistake. It (the shirt) said Yves St. Laurent No. 38 Potion. It was perfume. I was trying to go in the door."

The Wofford Sales guy was still trying to sell options in Monday, Wednesday, Higher. I was not interested in the bricks or options so on ???. I was riding on the back of a horse with my father. I accidentally referred to the horse as Smokey and I felt like a heel. I said, ""Smoke,"" I knew I was wrong. my father said, ""Scooter,"" very somberly. We rode up a steep hill. I was looking, asking where there might ""They are there to KILL AND MAIM."" There was a hoodlum living in the Pisgah National Forest. She was hiding behind rocks.

My father threw a stick at her and she ran like a scared dog. Her posture changed. I went to Wofford looking for a piano and they were working on the roof and a guy was explaining Monday, Wednesday, Friday; lights inside, and buildings lit up on days of the week. We were waiting for the lady ??? the aluminum on the steps ???. Men condemned. The Simpsons had come on. I made an omelet for Dora. I turned on the Simpsons and the omelet stuck to the pan. The Simpsons were funny. Shirley Davis found the 5 rings she had lost on the (floor)."

Elena turned into Evelyn and we lived in the tree house above the ground floor movie (theater). She had $9.00. A guy captured me when he was walking around and around and around the town square. When he marched me around the town square holding a gun in my back, I was so scared I couldn't talk. I opened my mouth to say something, to yell,, and nothing would come out. He had a razor blade with the single edge blade and Dora grabbed it from him to try and save me and I screamed, ""Dora, DON'T!"" But she had already grabbed it with her hand, her palm was already way ??? She closed her hand to save mine and it got cut deep and bloody, bad from the razor blade."
"111"	"(08/26/1999)"	"A guy had seen an ad in the paper for alternative space. We went with him, me and a stranger. The guy was an out-of-state naive ex-con who fell for the ""$3.00 admission at the door"" trick: to enter an empty building. 3 bums total were lying in the foyer. 2 kept sleeping the whole time the admission transaction was transpiring. The list was on the door. (The list had) 3 columns. 30Bw was the lowest number, center column. It was listed in the ""no heat at night or on weekends"" grouping. I had been through that ""no residential heat"" after business hours saga and I had second thoughts."
"112"	"(08/27/1999)"	"There were goings-on at the Episcopal Church in Laurens. A cat was locked inside the church and she was afraid of people. She liked to sit on pianos and feel the vibrations. Don Ross and my art school sculpture teacher came in carrying a cat cage and a piano. But the cat had locked the doors behind itself. She wouldn't let them in. A crowd started forming outside the door, to minister to the cat, but she would NOT listen. She would hide under the piano or sit under a metal fold-up chair and look at the ceiling, which in her reality was the underside of the seat of the chair. There were 3 escaped convicts loose in the mall. They were trying to run a scam but one convict, who was suppose to be the lookout, just wanted to sit next to the radiator eating chicken legs. Back at the church, a crowd was forming around the door to see about the cat. They tried force and even the master key, but they couldn't get the door open. It turned out (that) Dora was in there comforting the cat and they were now friends. The church members began rioting because of their thwarted efforts toward good deeds. One guy and woman got in a fist fight in the corner and I tried to lure them out of the fight with snowballs, but I had no flavor juice. Just the snowball ice. Rudy said, ""Merri, you need some Kool-Aid,"" but he had to catch a helicopter. The address he gave was the church's medieval garden. I said, ""Rudy, is there enough room?"" And he said, ""...if there is on 34th Street. I'm just a little worried about the Math."" Mr. Patterson kept saying, ""If you get out of town tell the president our town sewer needs 53 turns to the right. The sewer is between the church and the bank. I said, ""OK,"" but I had no intentions of concerning myself with the town sewer. Not after how Mr. Patterson had carried on. My mother had built a strange musical instrument the whole width of the Bobo Chapel, but the strings were so loose they laid around on the instrument. When you plunked them nothing happened."
"113"	"(08/28/1999)"	"We were going deep sea fishing. I was suppose to be moving to a different cabin but I'd rather be fishing. The boat was very late getting there. Over 4 hours late and when it got there we were surprised it hadn't sunk it was SO RICKETY. An old man was suppose to have saved my black old shoes, men's, but he had lost them instead of putting them in a cardboard box. Finally the boat left but we were running 4 hours behind schedule and had to bail out the water that was filling up in the boat. Finally, finally we got to fish and the salty old bearded man was grumpy. Me and Dora got our fishing lines all tangled up and he made us stand in line twice. Once to get untangled and once for bait. 2 hooks were on a line and a safety pin hook at the bottom, because some fish preferred to big safety pins. Squid was bait, but sliced up small. There wasn't much bait in the bucket. When we ran out of bait, me and Dora had to get into somebody's lunch to find something we could use for bait. It was all wrapped up, the tuna fish sandwich with lettuce on a roll, in white paper and a very small paper bag. They'd eaten the first half. It was sliced in half. I tore the bag in excitement and we scooped out tuna fish from the center with our index fingers and baited the bottom hook with tuna, the top hook with lettuce. I caught an inflatable black toy pig about 9"" in length. It had alphabet letters, random, on it. Mary Susan Smith, a sissy girl, caught a swordfish."
"114"	"(08/30/1999)"	"There was a tiny chipmunk-sized lion. A female lion in body type, though gender was not an issue for this little booger. He was trapped in the cellophane covering a bunch of flowers: lilies, yellow, that we'd left on the floor the night before and forgotten to put in water. The leaves were curling brown. They were Molly's flowers. But she was laying on the couch and couldn't be bothered. I said, ""This little chipmunk lion is trying to box his way out of the cellophane. Don't you care?"" She would not move from the couch. It was up to me to kill the little creature for his own good, because that's how it was. The carpet was beige. There was a hammer nearby but I figured I would miss. So I hit him over the head repeatedly with a round metal plan. A flat pan. I had to bash him over and over and it got bloody. Just before the final blow, I said, ""I'm sorry,"" and watched his last breaths. It was gut-wrenching sad. But it had to be done. Blood was all over the beige carpet and folded-up clothes that were stacked on the floor. The couple married one year came strolling through the sliding glass door. I yelled at them, ""You could have been shot! Police would call it self defense because somebody could say they thought you were breaking in. Would you help me clean up this blood?"" But all they'd do was put a donation in the plate. She put in $1.00. He put in a five. She said, ""You sure are messy."" I said, ""Well, we were doing laundry. What do you expect?"" I had to go to the convenience store for the Sunday paper. The paper was empty. In front a Chinese guy was cooking bacon next to the door. The reason was incentive. Smelling bacon would make people hungry and they'd buy more. A band was playing in the store. Not real good either. The movie screen boy ??? ??? was a cult film about love in families and sex. Guys were hooting and hollering."
"115"	"(08/31/1999)"	"I had made a gingerbread cartoon for Dora and Rudy. I rolled it paper thin so when it cooked some huge thin pockets of air raised the base of the very, very thin gingerbread cartoon. The gingerbread was rolled as close to rectangular as I could get it on the metal cookie sheet. The gingerbread was rolled between 1/32"" and 1/64"". Very thin for cookies. The air pockets were 1/8"" to 1/2"" of air trapped between the metal pan and the thin gingerbread rolled out. The far right frame of the middle row (2nd and 3rd rows) had a picture of Ned Flanders on there I had made. He exclaimed, ""Who, me?"" I was excited to show Dora what I'd made for her and Rudy and to tell her who Ned Flanders was. We had to sit by the fountain and wait for the big flat cookies to cool and then we saw my father in line, real comfortable, with his arms folded across his chest. It was raining. Dora got a call over the intercom to unlock room #316 but she ignored it. She got called several times to unlock the door for this teacher of 316, but she knew the teacher was not sincere. So she politely ignored the repeated requests. She looked at the cookie cartoon with me and it started raining and I said, ""That's OK."" I know you've got people to take care of ,"" and I went to see Rudy. Rudy was in the schoolroom checking out the (spelling) test results. He had a copy of the teachers' key. A guy had copied the teachers' key in her handwriting exactly, and in his own writing too. He made 100, twice, but he cheated... personality... personality... personality... Dora was showing me the infinite microorganisms in water, in the floaty moss growing on a submerged rock. So many microorganisms. So many macro organisms. Endless."
"116"	"(09/01/1999)"	"Instead of being given a life, you were given a journey across the river to the other side. The destination was always to get to the other side. It was stupid to make any plans because the journey depended on the time of day, tides, water currents and temperature in relation to states of water: solid (ice), gaseous, (liquid), wind currents, changing shoreline and you may as well stop and gather something there. In the journey it was impossible to tell, and irrelevant to use the something or other. No hurry. No. Dora was maybe at the somewhere, not sure. Temperature water would turn into ice. Icebergs and younger something.  I was not sure what gender I belonged to. Dora was not a fancy man. She liked things simple. Watching the water turn to ice. Watching the small icebergs sink just a few inches to watch the water displacement though the journey was only to the other side with flips to, not sure, maybe tolenburg? There was no need to hurry."
"117"	"(09/01/1999)"	"I was registering for high school. I had to sit in the commons and then go to the gym building to register for gym class. There was a doctor checking knees and runners that were at risk (for knee injury). A guy I didn't know came in from the rain. He was a senior guy and didn't have to. He had curly hair and was tall. It was time for me to leave. IV. I need help. Too much to carry. I was thinking of Dora so strong I could not see where I was going. I wrote for a very long time and realized I had been there with my eyes closed. I saw fish eyes. 4 huge fish eyes. 2 feet in diameter. Please put on this comfortable cotton ??? print dress, still cold and crispy. I climbed up a tree on Sitgreaves St. I because if I didn't the opportunity would have been gone forever. I climbed so high--that ??? trying ??? I slid down."

Life guarding for 2.5 hours and left. Input VI."" Cookies were drying out in the sun--where we were going to be. I'd left ??? out at what trash in leave. There was an egg salad sandwich that I'd peeled the top slice of wheat bread from, and the sun had dried it all crusty. I had left my picnic directly on the asphalt of the tennis court and tried to put it in a very flimsy shoebox to carry it (the crusty, now open face egg salad on wheat, and some baked chicken and some sandwich wrapped in plastic and a vanilla bean. A little girl was cold and lost. I gave her the vanilla bean. I helped her get it open. It looked like a brazil nut. ??? 4 as constantly patrolling the area--but the Merit guys were clearly NOT who they appeared to be. There were NO LIFEGUARD. Not sure."
"119"	"(09/02/1999)"	"At the start of each day me and Dora were little girls. We would look out toward the horizon to see how far we could go. We'd see a bridge and sit on the bridge. Sometimes me first. Sometimes Dora first. By the time we crossed to the other side of the bridge, sometimes on bicycles, we'd be grown up. Then we'd take a shower one at a time, in the hotel room at the other side of the bridge--after which we'd be little girls again for the next day's journey across a bridge we'd discover tomorrow. It'd be time for us to rest now. We were playing a game we named ""hassle."" We were getting ready to go on a trip to the mountains. Rudy and I had drove down the highway to scout. We saw a drugstore they called ""Dora's"" because Dora had gone there. Then we went back to the house on Maplebrook. We had to wait for everybody to get ready for the trip. We were waiting for Dora. Sometimes she would be there. Sometimes not. My mother was looking for the visitors center to see the place where Dora's organs had been donated and she had 6 passed total. She had ??? I was driving--following Rudy ??? At the intersection nearest the Laurens County Fairgrounds. I make a right turn through a very muddy dirt road intersection. I thought I would probably get stuck but I didn't. Rudy was sitting in front of the ??? place and he moved over and said (that) I could join him. My mother was busy making an apple pie for the mountain trip to try to lure Dora back. I said, ""Well, I don't want any pie, and Rudy's favorite is pumpkin. She did not respond but went at the apple pie with more determination. She was spreading a mixture of sugar and cinnamon evenly on aluminum foil to take with us and bake the pie in, in the mountains, so it'd be hot. I tried to help, but I kept doing it wrong, so I quit trying and went back to the fireplace to join Rudy. We joked and laughed. A boy scout troop with loaded guns came across the front porch. Then a fat boy (scout) with a skateboard came on the front porch. About this time I found my father hiding under the stairs, trying to weasle in on the trip. The little boy stared and looked in the open door and my father said, ""Stand her and listen to Merri play the piano. I told the little boy. You don't have to. You can leave any time you want to."" I was looking for my gray hooded drawstring zip-up sweatshirt."
"120"	"(09/03/1999)"	"I was looking for my yoga class. It was a big empty gym with 3 classes going on. The perky cheerleader type was teaching what was SUPPOSE to be a yoga class, but I did not particularly want to get involved with her so I was waiting for the other teachers. About this time the cheerleading yoga teacher found the insides of a telephone and a plastic phone cover and she kept trying to put them together. She was NOT successful. While watching her flail, I was assembling the phone parts in my head according to spatial relationships. I figured it out by watching for the little holes for cords and the previous scribbling of old extension numbers on the quick-dial. I put the phone together for her and we plugged it in. The jack line was about 20 feet long and we sat the phone on the floor away from the wall. She watched it, waiting for it to ring. I went out on the front porch ??? in fact, my blanket. It was all wet. I spread it out on the front porch of the log cabin, but rain was coming in sideways, so I knew it'd take a long time to dry. (While) waiting for it to dry, I leaned out over the rail and saw a huge alligator in the creek. He was waiting patiently to chomp somebody at the first opportunity. About this time, Diane came in frantic to publish a newsletter about Elizabeth. She wanted for me to write why Elizabeth's life had been so great. But it was NOT. She was unhappy. That's why she died. Then she wanted me to draw a complicated picture on a tacky green and purple sale flyer. Dora came to get me out of the bind and she said, ""Have you been through the line?"" She took my arm gently and brought me over to the Bleffel gathering. I said, ""Are those green beans or green peas?"" And then Uncle Gene started cracking jokes about green beans"
"121"	"(09/04/1999)"	"We were at Rudy's place on the beach. There were tall, steep wooden stairs. My mother was struggling to carry a huge canvas bag with straps. Me and Bob Hess offered to balance it on our shoulders but my mother didn't want any help. The bag was full of broken stuff. I said, ""Rudy, do you have access to email? Can you tell Dick when you see him at the beach (that) my email address is: MerriAnderson007@hotmail.com?"" He said, ""What time is it?"" I said, ""12:45 p.m."" Rich said, ""By this time Dick's at ""Crackie's Bar."" I went to find him but I wasn't sure I was in the right place. I was listening to classical music compositions from the year 1962. I found a recording called #14. It was the one. My mother said, ""In Europe people get their bathing suits on inside out all the time, so the lining's on the outside, and it's considered rude to tell them. I was sticking toothpicks into a cold baked potato, trying to make their skins rotate like a windmill--but I just ended up spilling green beans into the bowl of gravy that was inside the stove. When the leftovers got cold, the gravy was congealed like jello and my mother said, ""Merri, throw that gravy in the trash."" When I scooped it out I could see the canned, french cut green beans in there like worms."

You are not here. Love, City Girl."" She was asking God to come closer to the beach where she was wearing a white hip-hugger bathing suit. And she was dancing by herself on the beach--very provocatively. She had her entourage with her. One was an Indian woman who didn't have her ""hide your face"" outfit, so she draped beach towels around her head in the fashion of women from ancient India. I found a tattered piece of paper with sitting on the floor. I said, ""Is this yours?"" I said, ""Dora told me."" Liz was in the high school office tacking green tickets to the bulleting board. It was a free concert sponsored by God to benefit unfortunate children. It starred Kid Rock and City Girl. The time of the show was 7 p.m."

I couldn't be sure if it was her prom night (that) she was trying to get ready for or (if) it was her Halloween costume and she was a fairy godmother. A tennis shoe was stuck to the skirt part of her dress. The shoestring (tie end) was stuck and the shoe was floating in the air. She was perplexed. I couldn't waste any more time looking at her and her predicament. I'd already let the lawnmower choke down once for watching her and it was HARD TO CRANK. I had lots of grass to cut that day. I kept having to turn the blade speed down because it kept going faster and faster. The blade was so low to the ground and CHINKING on rocks--""chink, chink"". The speed setting was getting higher all the time. My knuckles were vibrating from the push lawnmower. Then the higher blade was getting lower. My knuckles were getting white. Then the Chrysler Building was opened after hours for a big party. I opened the huge window blinds to view the entire city. In the center of the ""Cloud Room"" were bump cars. They looked fun. 2 girls of ambiguous sexual preference were wrestling and having fun. One especially had very sleek, defined leg muscles. In the stadium--bleacher part ??? people dancing. The crowd hushed when the James Earl Jones's reading of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven"" began. It was the version from the Simpsons. ??? basement. Me and Sarah squeezed through.

These tables, designed beautifully, were about my screw-ups in life. There were many. There was a stack--scattered--of photos of Dora--years worth of me and Dora together. The empty stack place was missed photo opportunities when I was screwing up bad. It was COLD. I got a coffee on 7th St. and went to the gallery. I needed clean socks. Marianna told me there was a pillowcase full. A plastic bag hanging there looked extra heavy and the weight of the bag was as if it were filled with mercury--but very heavy plastic bag of carbon powder in there--the bag was--the consistency of very heavy, very fine granulated into near dust, powder. It kept the bag from moving. I saw a sign for flip flops and though I was in a hurry, I vowed to myself (that) I'd get some."

To start the truck, you had to take off the passenger side door from its hinges and insert it perpendicularly, parallel to the windshield and at the back of the engine, furthest from the bumper. It was big and heavy and I tried to do it, but I couldn't all by myself. ???. There were slots where they were suppose to go. I took a break and went to the dark lunchroom. Maureen was there and so happy. She was singing along with the catchy tunes that were playing and when I knew the words I sang too. Darlene started dancing and spun me around and around and around till I was dizzy. When I was tired I went to sit in the bathroom closet which had a hole in the door where the doorknob usually is. In the bathroom closet, I turned the light off because the security guard would see me in there in the dark. They'd figure I was up to no good, when really, I was just resting, waiting for my turn to go to the beach. While I was waiting, I was suppose to be making up the beds, and while looking out the window--when I was suppose to be making up my mother's bed--I caught the blanket on fire. It was a very cheap white blanket of synthetic material and it had big red flowers printed on it and brownish-green leaves. I tried to pull the cotton blanket over it (beige), but it was all lumpy, this bed. And you could smell the burned blanket all over the place. My father came in carrying a pair of Hush Puppy Shoes and said, laughing, ""No wonder I had trouble getting these on. It took me all night. They're your shoes, Merri, not mine."" I said, ""Oh."" Rudy was sitting on the floor trying on some old hiking boots of ours from the closet. They were beautiful, but the sole on the left boot was flopping off in front."
"126"	"(09/09/1999)"	"I was taking a very difficult class in a deep, deep basement, far underground. It was 7 stories below street level and it was dark, but lights glowed enough. The first part of the test was scanning items on a grocery store scanner and bagging the fruit yourself. On this part I didn't do so good. Then we had to do extensive research. My research topic was to find out if the Kellogg's company actually did have any authentic formulas for their cereals, or if they had simply stolen the formulas many years ago from a small middle eastern country where English was not spoken. The man who wrote the textbook for this class had died many years before. I found a locked, buried box. In cement while investigating. Inside were copies for 2 long papers and an open text, bound, that said it belonged to Kellogg's. ???. Last was a Grade Point Average list. The papers--one belonged to a girl whose last name was Rosen and the other girl, last name Lyme. The note said, ""Rosen and Lyme, GPA 4.2. You girls really did your research."" Their research was about poisons. After this date (date on note) the teacher died. The girls hated him so bad they poisoned him. He, of course, knew this, but had been so impressed with their research that he went right along with the plot and was quite aware they were killing him. The general public did not know about the murder till many years later. A yellowed newspaper article, very small, told, ""Rosen and Lyme, Convicted."" Though they had killed--were in the process of killing the teacher because he worked them so hard; he was extremely proud of their diligence. By the time I found all this out the subway platform was deserted. I was the last one there and it was late at night. The train station in Harlem would be very deserted and it could very well be me this time!"
"127"	"(09/10/1999)"	"I was teaching Bible school without a plan. So it was pretty boring for the kids and they didn't particularly want to be there either. Near the end of the Bible School session I realized, ""We should have made a Bible movie!"" The kids could have dressed up like disciples and we could have thrown a few good miracles into the short film for action. It was the perfect plan--but it was too late. It was the last day of Bible School. I felt so inadequate. I thought the least I could do was to show the kids how to use the darkroom. My darkroom was in a 2-man pup tent set up on top of a dog house. The tent had collapsed and anyway, I had not figured out how to make the tie-down flap door light proof. So we ended up not being able to do that either. It was a big disappointment. A man was trying to decide if he lived on the Florida mainland or otherwise. I said, ""Chances are you do."" Marianna said, ""Merri, if you're going to teach Bible School, at least get the sand out of your shirt. Here, over the sink you can shake it out."" I hadn't thought I had sand stuck under my shirt but when I started shaking it out, huge clumps of sand kept on clumping out."

I was sitting in the way because ??? waiting around (ring?) being told I could not practice the piano during this emergency crisis. EMS knew I'd cause trouble if I could not do stuff (art, piano) so an EMS guy locked me in the bathroom. There were very high walls but no ceilings. He threw 3 bags of dope in there to me and said, ""That'll keep you busy for awhile."" I thought about it for a while and decided not to do it. I looked close and some had spilled out of one bag onto the counter. I thought it might be a set up or at least a placebo to see what I'd do so I tasted it. It was real. I didn't have works or a spoon, so I had to just sniff and I just did 1/2 of one bag and I didn't feel it much except time did go faster/slower at times. It slowed me down and ??? trouble ??? play ??? of the locker room ??? I immediately went to the bear section at the zoo and picked up a black bear cub. Somebody said, ""That mother Bear don't want her cub messing with no dope addicts."" I held the black bear cub up and he held onto me around my shoulders and neck. He held onto my arms. He was all wiggly and happy. I saw Johnny Gage and I thanked him for the birthday autograph he'd given Rudy 2 years ago. Carlos was staying at Rudy's. His landlord evicted him because he was messy. But it was not that bad. It wasn't. I did not think it was the cops' business whether or not you make your bed or cleaned up."

But I cried, NOT allowed to eat candy, but we didn't have any money anyway. Smokey had this white plastic frame (about 5 Ft. square) stuck on his face. It was stuck with some kind of glue. I was standing across the lake and I yelled, ""Hold on Smokey, I'm coming!"" But poor Smokey was getting nervous. He could not eat his feed. He started slamming his head toward the ground to try and knock the plastic frame off with all the force he had and quarter horses are STRONG. He was getting very upset and slamming this frame (stuck to his head) against a tree and I was trying to get there to help him. About this time--BAM--he broke half the frame off his head. Next jolt he got the white plastic frame off and started eating his food, chewing the way horses chew. We were in church--me and my mother and Dora. We were singing the benediction hymn when the preacher makes his plea for people to turn their life over to Jesus. He was standing in the center of the wide center aisle, pleading for lost souls when the cops barged down the aisle in uniform. They mumbled to the preacher and charged up to an unsuspecting girl who was holding her hymnbook singing. They said, ""Hands behind your back!"" And she calmly put the hymnbook down and put her hands behind her back and the rest of the congregation's singing dwindled off noticeably. A few hardcore Christians kept the song going but most were watching the arrest with wide open eyes. The gossip was already flying. My mother said, ""Hold my stuff. That's one of our clients who just got arrested."" And she followed the girl and the cops 15 feet behind them--with determination. Me and Dora had been left alone in church and for a while we didn't have to do what ANYBODY said. I had no intention of picking up my mother's purse and socks and stuff, but Dora said, ""We better."" So I put the dirty socks inside the purse but I didn't feel like hooking the clasp so I carried the purse by one handle, hanging open. Dora carried the church bulletin, the Bible and my mother's Sunday School lesson book. Then we were in the flower bed and I decided to root some flowers to grow because I didn't have money to buy any. Dora said, ""Merri, do you know how?"" I said, ""Well, not exactly, but I'll figure it out."" She said, ""Merri, don't, you'll get in trouble."" But by this time I had pulled up the tulips and daffodils out of the ground. They had not bloomed yet. They never would now. The bulbs and green stems were laying in the dirt and only wild onions were left growing alive."

Then a real (horse)... the horse had been attached to the merry-go-round and then he graduated to carrying and then he didn't want to follow the traffic signs so he did a U-turn in the West Village and stomped right over, all over everywhere because of these bent wire tree guards shaped like church windows--the stained glass kind. Then I could see why he was so upset. He (His) leg had been chopped off at the ankle. You could see exactly. I was flying the jet and not doing a very good job of it. I wasn't paying attention and didn't see the red blinking light. I couldn't remember if the guy said for me to push the levers down or up, so I pulled up and the jet's tail was scraping along the highway and making sparks fly. I said, ""DOWN."" The guy had to siphon oil from his car to put in the jet and he kept shaking his head in disbelief. The lady at the film and TV party made a joke about 10 hits of codeine. I had boxes to mail and clothes were everywhere. I had fun at the girls' and loved them and tried on some crazy outfits and even some lingerie, but I had to get going to mail my boxes and draw the Brooklyn Bridge in black, blue and red on a NY Times full page double spread ad that had lots of white space. I filled it up beautiful. The Brooklyn Bridge drawing was finished in the paper. It advertised nothing. Because I didn't get the jet in the right place, the store rent and was closed and the jet pilot fixed spaghetti, tomato sauce and raw fillet slabs of sword fish and it was TERRIBLE. So I went to changed my clothes and fell down the hill--but I only told him and my mother I was going to change clothes because I knew they'd say NO if I told them I was going to roll down the hill. The hill was huge, with grass, real green and scattered yellow, ""daisy-type"" flowers."
"133"	"(09/18/1999)"	"There was an electrocution being set up for at my job. I worked in the back as a type reader but really I was making use of all their great equipment: Macs, chromatics. The electrocution was going to happen in a big, glassed in booth so the witnesses could watch. 40 witnesses would be allowed. The elevator bank was filling up fast with news reporters. Mikes and cameras and people fighting each other for the best view. I had 20 pages to output, proof and correct, but I didn't know if this was the appropriate time, with this man's life ending live from death row. I sneaked out the front door (they told reporters to use the back door). It was the first time they'd worried about people sneaking IN, not OUT. I went out the front door to a blackout. I was skating up 8th Avenue when I got off--I was 6 blocks off course and the entire city went black dark. No building lights, street lights, or anything. I could not see anything. I was still skating fast and a bicycle rider crashed into me and knocked me down. He came back and helped me up. He said, ""Merri, they come ??? Chuck had come. Whether to live ??? my Chuck's knowledge and wisdom. We heard laughter and the place was under the water and the fake ocean had undercurrents. The waitress said 2 drink minimum and ??? Marianna and I didn't think that ??? ??? were trying to outbid each other ??? particularly if I was facing north ??? I said, ""No."" because I could not get in touch with the swimmer."
"134"	"(09/19/1999)"	"I went to Kerhonksen in the mountains during the off season. Dora was with me when nobody else was there and disappeared when any other people came. Kitty was there with us. We made a movie of her (the cat) walking slowly. She was happy. She was drinking water from a fire hydrant. When kitty wasn't there anymore we projected her big on the wall and she seemed to walk even slower. About this time, people drove in for a wedding. I was a little--A LOT surprised that John Harrelson was getting married to a woman. John was gay and the girl was not. The sandwich was hung from the table on a fishing line, and if somebody started to snack, it was pulled away. The bride's brother had spilled pills all over the place. I helped them find them. My mother met the girl's mother. After I introduced my mother to the bride's mother, My mother leaned slightly over the food. I heard my mother say, leaning over the food (for the wedding) ""She comes from JUNK"" I said, ""mother, that won't get things off on the right foot."" People I used to know. I hadn't typed since high school. A bus driver was going up the elevator and trying to eat a sandwich at the same time. (he dropped it and it went into the escalator and he fell and was laying on the escalator as it went up, still reaching for the sandwich, and the escalator was going to chew him up. He couldn't get up. There was nothing I could do.) I knew where the new testament ??? Same as home ??? State park and national forest was in S.C. and they kissed. People I used to know asked for actions then tranquilizers and promises of lunch. I said, ""You'll try to lure me."" I was thinking about that I didn't. ""I would care if...if... I could care less if I had lunch with......."
"135"	"(09/19/1999)"	"I was carrying the words behind me on a string (rope) up a hill. The hill was in the mountains. I'd been going up--slow, up higher--SLOW. I stopped to look at some music. A lady suggested I try to play the trumpet while I was playing the piano. She had already printed the programs with the write-up about trumpet playing with asterisked copy: *music stands available for $75.00. I didn't even try to explain to her that it was pointless, if not stupid, to try to play the piano and trumpet at the same time. You need both hands for each. And you can't look at 2 different sets of music and there'd be nowhere to put the music stand, much less have to pay $75.00 to get one. But I played some Mozart and went back to finish pulling my words up the hill. I was surprised to find that they were now riding along down the hill and even around curve by themselves. The brick that served as a weight to steady the load balanced the words when they got going too fast and the brick kept the words from flying off the edge of the mountain when they went around curves."
"136"	"(09/21/1999)"	"We were in a college dorm. Alan had to go to work. He was teaching physics. He was a good teacher. Dan was cutting a class (that) he didn't belong in anyway. He made chirpy talk in code to Alan--but I knew he was talking about going to get drugs. I wanted to scream, ""What do you think I am? A goddamn moron? A babe in the woods?"" I thought it was downright pathetic that he would even TRY to attempt to hide his escapades from someone with my past level of experience in drugs. He had time to kill until 9:30 p.m. when he had to leave to got to Queens for the score. He said, ""Do you want to come look at my drawings?"" I said, ""NO I DON'T want to come look at drawings you did in 1987. I've seen those stupid drawings a million times and they sure haven't changed since last time. You haven't picked up a pencil in 15 years. If you're an artist you gotta be doing art every day and not stupid drugs."" Everything (mostly) I said was true, except the part about seeing his drawings a million times. I had actually only seen them once but it seemed like a million times. He got so upset (that) he couldn't get the pill bottle open that was sitting on the table. He finally got it open and swiped out a handful but spilled them; his hands were shaky. He tried to break a xanax  in half like he was cutting back and swiped up a handful--quick-like, like in playing jacks. He put them in his pocket and left. This made me fed up with New York and I went to Florida back to my old art school to paint undisturbed for a while. Before I left I saw them throwing out some beautiful, very stylish, black standing lamps and I wanted to take one. There were 5. But it was 6 feet tall and a lot to carry to Florida without a car. When I got there it was night and I was appalled at the long distances between ATMs, when you didn't have a car. Kids at the steps near the ocean, hanging out talking to me. I resolved not to suck up to their brown nosing, even though I was lonely not knowing anyone. I went to a bar where they also fixed bicycles and in came girls who'd found 5 bicycles. Those deco lamps had folded out into bicycles. I was mad at myself for not getting one when I saw them tossed out. They were all identical--flat black Schwinns, sleek girls' model bikes. The girls were sewing square multi-colored scarves onto army backpacks. I left the bar and it was raining and I climbed in somebody's window, but walking across the floor the booby trap got me. It had rubber hoses and suction cups that would grab me and was like a rubber blanket of leeches. I finally got out and the art student recognized me. ""Aren't you the one who broke into my house?"" I said, ""I'll return your tape."" At least his place smelled like turpentine. I went into an all-night Chinese restaurant (looking for cigarettes) and to get a cup of coffee to go. She rang it up--$1.50. I said, ""$1.50 for a plain old cup of coffee? You can just throw it away. I won't pay $1.50 for a fifty-cent cup of coffee."" I felt like I had done the right thing."

"138"	"(09/22/1999)"	"I was engaged to a fellow I'd just met the day before. He was a waiter at a restaurant. He was Spanish or of some genetic background heavy on the black, black straight hair and deep tanned skin. I forgot the guy's name but since we were engaged I went to see him at the restaurant. I was carrying Rudy's tennis racket and Rudy had asked me to slide it under the equipment in the waiters' changing room. I put the tennis racket in a paper bag so (that) nobody would steal it. (its identity hidden) Me and my fiance and his buddy went to the beach and sat in the warm tidal pool. I didn't know either of their names, but it was pretty obvious they were gay. I said, ""Don't you want to swim out in the OCEAN?"" My fiancée's buddy said, ""NO, it's too cold."" So I went swimming in the ocean alone. It was not too cold at all. I went to a computer seminar and the girl next to me had a problem. 3 big pieces of popcorn were growing out of her chin and we were trying to figure out how to get the popcorn removed. On her face, the popcorn was dense and could not even be whacked off. We went to a 3-day seminar to try and figure it out on both Quark and internet. When I got back from the computer seminar I went to the restaurant at the beach. A guy told me my fiancée had died in a fire the night before. One report said he had been trying to rescue the fire victims. The other report said he and his buddies were smoking crack, dropped the pipe and burned the apartment building down. I went to see William at our new place. He was teaching. He had an office we could walk into. He said, ""Merri, your fiancée was killed last night."" And I said, ""I know. What day is class. Do you wanna got to the beach?"""
"139"	"(09/25/1999)"	"I was going on a horse, riding on a horse to somewhere. My father said, ""We're gonna go real fast so hold on. And I got the smile 2/3 bigger  and maybe Carlos said something. The shelves were empty. Empty going on forever. Christmas maybe, not sure Something about 25,000 feet. Left. Right."
"140"	"(09/25/1999)"	"I was sitting maybe in the hallway. Trying to organize things into categories. But really it was a waste of time because the system of organization I was attempting made NO SENSE. And it would really be confusing for the girl I was suppose to leave it for--in a canvas bag. And she didn't even know me. I decided to scrap it all and start over. I noticed the window on the top floor of a high rise and on the outside of the window was another white canvas bag. This one,not sure, and I wanted it so I had to open the window and back out. A lady came out the door and needed to take the elevator down. It was making strange noises so I said, ""I think you better walk down the stairs."""
"141"	"(09/27/1999)"	"I was working for Bryan. He was having a big Christmas party. It was for Jewish people and shrimp was the hoopla for the party. A big bowl of big shrimp. I was suppose to work at the party and I was trying to get there but the subway trains were new. We longed for the day when the E train went directly from WTC to 34 St. But now the trains (3 to a train) cars--entire cars switched like musical chairs--only the seats were never the same. People kept forgetting their stuff. I found 3 black bras--1 real nice on the subway seat and it came close to fitting. And a great clear plastic dress with mirrors, so you could see the side off your boobs. It had some white plastic and was shiny. I wished it was black. I was training for the marathon and I kept saying I needed to run before 8:30 because it would get dark. The train kept turning but I got to see Dora! She had some make up and it was rolling around on the floor of the train. She didn't need it anymore. She had to leave before dark because my mother would not let me play outside after dark. I said as long as I get out the door before dark, I'd just do what I wanted to. I'd just get in big trouble when I got back. I went to use a theater bathroom in Tribeca and there were waste receptacles that said, ""Oyster shells."" ""Vodka Bottles."" But not one for regular old trash. It was snowing hard. The party was quickly getting g started. I heard bits of conversation. A guy said, ""I've been to re-hab 3 times."" Everyone there was Jewish, but I didn't think Hunt sounded Jewish. I figured Jews were a passing interest for him like the Tibetans had been. There was a big, light-colored, unpainted, sanded and matte-waxed--rather, buffed piano there but Brian had chopped its legs off. I assumed he did this because he'd watched Schroeder playing the piano on Charlie Brown Christmas. I lost my Mozart Sonata music and I was frantic about it."
"142"	"(09/27/1999)"	"We were at the creek watching stuff. I had taken pictures near the creek of the way the creek has changed its course over the years. We were watching people awhile--even terrorists and people up to no good (drug deals) and of some very knobbly trees and the way the background, the fruits looked stacked up--like grapes at the fruit stand. Then Nancy from the NY Times was pointing out photo opportunities--the rolls and rolls of RC paper with the column count and derogatory description about Uncle Bob's letters to the NY Times columns ??? A guy was there I liked and I couldn't keep my thoughts straight to count the columns and measure the depth. There was a place on the hill I had been and another girl was there now and Nancy said this was the best picture and to wait and watch the girl. Meanwhile Dora and I were sitting on my mother and my father's bed and a funeral procession was walking--lots of people walking by under the window. Dora closed the window because the people's feet were making noises shuffling. Lots of people walking under the window and they were making excuses...it had been a mixed-up and misunderstood group death of a family and Dora said her bank had taken out a little money at a time--$5.00 to insure her for the strong likelihood that this family would not stick around to pay her for her counseling services. She wasn't mad, she had just had enough. A knock came at the door. The first time I ignored it and acted like I didn't hear it because I got so little time with Dora. I didn't want any distractions. But later the knock came again and a little voice said, ""It's Sue. Susanne from Miss Wilson's up the street."" Her voice sounded shaky and I was worried about her so I went to the door and apologized for not answering sooner. But later the knock came again."
"143"	"(09/29/1999)"	"I was down at the pipes. I wanted to play in the creek and make a dam and I had to go past my mother. She was standing on the hill and I knew better than to play because the ??? Its not that different. ??? up the roots."
"144"	"(10/01/1999)"	"We were at this lake. It had islands and was about 5 acres big maybe bigger. William was driving a speed boat in the lake. He was going fast. He took us for a ride and we went around islands. He could make big waves by the wake of the boat. My mother was standing just out from the bulrushes near the edge. William was careful not to make big waves cause he knew she couldn't swim. I said, ""This is a pretty big lake."" my father said, ""There's one much bigger."" I said, ""Where, my father?"" He said, ""You turn right, down the hill at the automotive service center."" And he took us there. It was in Highlands. We couldn't drive too far down the dirt road because of the ice and snow. The lake was frozen over and beautiful. It was nearly a mile long even though it wasn't as much as 100-150 feet across. We went ice skating every year in the winter when we were little. My sister had been killed. I had a little sister. She was 3 years old. Her name was Toya and she was crying and having a screaming fit because she wanted to leave and go home. I said, ""Toya, how old are you?"" And she said, ""3."" I said, ""Do you remember coming here with Dora?"" And she said, ""No."" And I said, ""I came here with Dora ever since I was a little girl like you. You see that tree stump?"" She said, ""Yeah,"" And I said, ""Dora sat there--right there with me while we put on our skates. She is still there when I look at that stump. Do you mind if I go sit on that stump and think about Dora?"" And she didn't mind. She stopped crying and ??? and she let me sit on that sump as long as I wanted to. There was a rubber duck in the bathtub. There was not much water, just a little bit around the drain. It was floating. Then a real baby duck, the same size, came to play with the rubber duck. The real duck had just been hatched 2 hours ago, but he could already swim. They played around in the bathtub all afternoon. I was taking a class and I had to do a project on the computers. One sister was riding a bicycle. One was playing tennis. I had to delete the tennis player sister and there was no way to bring her back. She was real big on screen--about half the entire screen, running off the page. The other sister that was left was teeny tiny on the screen, riding a bicycle. She was 1/2"" tall."
"145"	"(10/01/1999)"	"I was playing the Steinway with a black gospel band. I couldn't play anything without music and they were trying to cure me of that. I was trying to explain that classical music told you exactly what to play and how long to hold notes and how fast to play it--it tells you everything. I was pointing out ties and phrasing. Every mark means something. And I said, ""Those guys didn't waste ink!"" The black man smiled and laughed a happy little relaxed laugh and he said, ""Baby, black people go from directions that's invisible! And we're gonna try and teach you! I thought that was a brilliant thing to say. And when we played, my part was to slap down the wooden music stand ""BAM"" real loud with a slap every once in awhile. It was fun and I liked it, but I almost accidentally chopped this guy's head off. Then I had killed the plants cause I forgot to water them and we had to get some more with the dolly cart at the factory. Plants were wrapped, half-assed in brown paper and stacked to the ceiling. If you got one they'd all come falling down on your head and probably kill you. I was in a very old stone castle--huge--hanging over the ocean at the edge of a cliff. I was forgetting things. The roof was leaking. I wanted to watch the waves but workers were pestering me with government papers to fill out."
"146"	"(10/02/1999)"	"I was in Florida at a motel. We were doing a show and art was on ??? slabs and things were sparse and I couldn't understand why the opening was from 8 p.m. till midnight. It was cold so the girls put their socks back on. They had left their socks and jackets on top of the art. This bothered me. Stephen was in the other ???. Stephen was pacing like a caged animal. Jasmine was riding it out, drinking a soda and thought ??? The brother was ??? he did NOT want anybody ??? dimension and you could work ??? from Bunny. You could walk over the ??? the men also walked."
"147"	"(10/02/1999)"	"This guy I didn't know, his name was Hank. He had worked for 20 or 30 years for Metro North because he loved Massachusetts so much. He had to get up very early in the morning. He loved Massachusetts and had been saving his money so he could find a farm and buy it for himself. He wanted to marry me but we had not even met. My friend Rosemary said, ""Merri, go to Massachusetts with Hank and see if you'd like to go there to live and so I did. To me it looked just like South Carolina. Almost exactly like Grandpas farm. Rolling hills and cows. There were a lot of baby cows. All less than one year old. They were jumping--jumping up from all 4 legs at a time. I said, ""How do you make these calves stop jumping?"" Because they were making it hard for me to walk. They were jumping up real high. Their little hooves were about 4 feet from the ground. There were lots of them too. Hank was walking out there in the pasture too but I was walking by myself. He was being very nice to me and I was chewing bobble gum. Lots of it. When we got back from the pasture, Rudy said, ""Merri, you've got bubble gum all over your face."" I had been blowing bubbles and popping them so I could hear the sound and I didn't even notice. I went to look in the mirror and sure enough, bubble gum was stuck all around my mouth--it covered my lips and went up to my nose in some places. I couldn't get it all off. Hank wanted to have sex with me because we were getting married. I didn't love Hank because I didn't know him and there was no chemistry but after all we were getting married. We laid down on the floor and he was on top of me when my mother yelled from the kitchen, ""Where'd that muffin go? Half's for Linda."" I went to help her and the muffin had fallen to the floor and crumbled up. Now there were only ??? left and all but 2 were wrapped for Christmas presents. But the shape and the icing leaking through the paper--you could tell it was cupcakes. 2 were not wrapped but they were specially decorated for Christmas. One had a Hershey's kiss on top. The other had a big horsey cheap, blue Christmas light stuck in the icing. By this time the broken muffin had multiplied into many more muffins--of different kinds (but none the same kind as the first one that fell). There were 5 new muffins that came from the original muffin. Blueberry, purple, cranberry and 2 more I didn't know what kind. At a parade we were weaving a hug American flag--a choreographed weaving of hundreds of people carrying 12"" wide rolls of cloth--red, white, blue. Each strip of cloth was about 100 feet long. Nobody bumped into each other. 2 boys or else very short men were tap dancing out in front. My mother wanted to watch the tap dancers. A fancy lady in a self-important hurry asked me where she could go for lunch. I told her, ""Go to the penthouse at the Hilton,"" because I knew she didn't want to eat any cupcakes. A girl was soaking wet and running around screaming where was her walkman somebody stole it. Bonnie came with a radio and threw it down on the concrete and smashed it and then ran real fast and flung herself bare-legged down on the concrete, sliding head-first and scraped her knees up something terrible."
"148"	"(10/03/1999)"	"There was an empty swimming pool. The first day's photos were from slides, but nothing was there. Just blank slide frames where an image should be. There were unappreciated business opportunities and then slides of empty hotels and hotel swimming pool and I went swim, slip. A pound of prevention. I tried to put the slides in order like I was suppose to. The thoughts and images were starting up in my head:... ???... ???... ??? most things it seems like. I needed to finish putting the slides in order. Empty swimming pool photos and pictures of me, age 4, and a hotel. I had to stay away from side-tracked Christmas surprise him. I had to go to the shopping center to set up the hospital appointment. He acted not scared but he was."
"149"	"(10/03/1999)"	"I was in a home for crazies. I sat in an office of staff, watching an old b/w movie about a man who lost his soul to gambling. His brother was good. He was on a train. Fighting a war. He was all muddy--his helmet too. The staff members danced in a line. They were too busy doing nothing to eat. One said, ""What do you do, get a glass of milk and oatmeal cookie before bed?"" I wanted to yell, ""POP TARTS"" But my mouth was full. I was chewing on Dutch apple pop tarts with vanilla frosting. I ate them both. They were good. I was not a staff member. They had papers that said I was crazy and I understood why they thought that but I knew better. It just didn't concern me enough to bother with what they thought. It was not important enough. I was doing my laundry in a basement and the ??? It had been in his family for years. A watercolor I had done was on the floor. It was a study of the door to the others and how colors change the light that is on both sides. The door was cracked open but not very much. Not enough to walk through. Three colors they had out there they had over there do not exist here, so I had to use yellow and purple and green. It was a mess of a quick study to capture a thought for me--worthless to anybody else. But the big do-gooder president of the ""help-the-crazies house"" thought it was making good use of the crafts program. He couldn't have understood what I meant and would have just thought I was more crazy and I didn't care a flip about what he thought of me, so I didn't say anything. I got my laundry out of the dryer and tried to fold my sheet. I cannot fold it good. It was light blue and flannel and it was wadded up like a lump of scrambled eggs from McDonalds. I met a little girl and a teenage boy who was beautiful, but not pretty, and he couldn't have been a boy or a girl. I said, ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" And he said, ""I let the boy decide that."" There were 7 little newborn puppies and kittens laying on their stomachs watching TV with their eyes closed. I tried to make sure they all had room because they couldn't walk yet. I made sure they were warm. One was a tiger kitten. His name was Tiny Boy 2. He was beautiful but his head was like a grown-up tiger and could look mean. He was about 6 inches long. The girls were in combat uniform and had devices to change their voice when they spoke and some had masks on their heads, but I could tell by their hands who was who. There were hand signals to go with the words--some words were from street gangs, some from Castro's speeches and some from Martin Luther King. Evelyn was in this group, but she had been taken to jail for race mixing. I was in colored town, helping a black lady whose baby was sick. I was cleaning and doing laundry for her. We were walking down the road where Vera used to live. It wasn't paved cause it was colored town and the city didn't bother to pave those roads. Colored people didn't much have cars. They walked mostly. When we were way past the houses a black and white cop car passed us. The lady said, ""You go ahead. I ain't gonna cause you no more trouble."" I walked ahead, not sure if the cops had spotted me. They turned around and came back to get me. They said it was worse because I was working FOR a nigger. They took me to jail and told me to go to cell-block 5A. When the cop un-cuffed me my elbow bumped into his arms and they all screamed at me. I wondered which cell Evelyn had been in. The cells were glass booths. They took my clothes and gave me a sheet. One cell was a glassed in bathtub and the other was smaller--a shower stall. I took the bathtub so I could lay down if I could sleep, even though I was scared to sleep because I could see in their eyes. Rape was in the cards. There was no window. Since it was glassed in there was no air and when I used up the air I saw a tiny window that could only be opened if a bar was undone and water was turned on full force. The window was high and to prolong your life for air, only meant you were gonna drown later when the glassed in cell filled up, which it was doing. Then, just in time, an inmate came and unlocked my cell. Men prisoners were allowed to roam free. He had on a dirty white t-shirt with black writing and stringy red hair. The other prisoners hated him because he was a rat. He fought with me and got me down on the ground. He was on top of me and I could feel his stringy hair on my face. The prisoners and cops didn't help me. My kitty came to my bed to wake me and I hit her--thinking she was the rapist."
"150"	"(10/04/1999)"	"I didn't have any money so I went to this cafeteria restaurant that had a different set-up on Tuesdays. According to their level of ""difficulty"" (only in terms of physical labor--output of energy necessary to complete the job) there were different pay scales. For wheeling around the dessert cart to tables and keeping it stocked you made $2.10/hr. Bussing tables was next on the ladder and on up to dishwashing, floor scrubbing and table setting. They gave you your cash at the end of your shift and I was gonna come back tomorrow. The sign on the blackboard said $8.50/hr. broke down to $5.60/hr after taxes. So I could make $40 in one day and that would help a lot. I was roller-skating behind Rudy and a stranger named Justin. I passed them going uphill. They acted like they didn't see me. I met them outside at a restaurant. Justin was going to get married---they had rented the restaurant to have a private wedding. I made a comment about the fancy-fake restaurant--a smart-ass comment and I offended everybody there. The only thing I could do was leave. On the way out, Jasmine was coming in. She wanted to paint and my paints were on the floor. I was learning to use meringue as a medium. Not from the pie, but from my mother's mixing bowl before she got the pie finished. Haney called me and said, ""I'm doing a show at Cooper Union."" And I said, I just had a show there. I heard you practicing with a black lady who was screaming."" The lady who told me and Evelyn she was broke was lying. She had seven dollars stuck in her bra."
"151"	"(10/05/1999)"	"We were going to the Beeks's house to watch a movie at 8:30. It would be over about 10:30. There were lots of things I needed to be doing. There was a clothes line pole that needed to be climbed in the back yard. There was the red wooden chest--one of the very first Coca-Cola products. Inside the red chest were beautiful pictures--b/w 8x10's of my father at about 18 years old. He was beautiful. You could tell he was an athlete first and foremost. Miss Pat said, ""Do you all want to go out for a drink before the movie?"" Miss Pat didn't drink. I said, ""GOOD HEAVENS NO!"" The thought of sitting on bar stools waiting, staring, when there were so many projects I was jump-up excited over. They brought a box to my father's station anyway. But I didn't have time. It was a nice box."

She looked good (straight) for a change, so when she asked me to go in the car with her, I said, ""OK,"" even though I had my roller skates and a couple pairs of shoes to carry. I rode in the car with her to 22 St. out of state. She asked me to run upstairs with her. By this time there was more stuff to carry. She had keys to a room and her stuff was there. She talked on the phone to a guy she liked. He was a male prostitute. I did not find him appealing in any way. The building floor on 22 St.--something fishy was going on there with girls who rented rooms in this place. They rented some full-time, but you could tell what they were doing. Something fishy was going on--you could tell by the sounds ??? but then intense frantic conversation. Liz knew who rented rooms in this place. She rented it for 12 hours. Liz got half the day and the male prostitute took the other half. The male prostitute rented it for secret activity (that) only the girls of the house knew about. They made little inside jokes and that was sad. Because they thought it was cute. She came back and now she's fucked up big time on drugs. We needed to gather postage stamps. Blocks of 5x5 stamps but somehow the total was always 10, not 25. Some stamps were unusable because the circle perforations had been popped open and exploded like bubble wrap. Stamps were all over the floor ??? and under them was a coke vial and Liz sniffed the last coke and threw the vial out the car window. I was trying to go to sleep. I wanted to take a nap. I'd just got off my shoes when a knock came at the door. He said, ""Your 12 hours is up. Where's the guy? Finish up and get out."" I said, ""WHAT!"" And he said the maids were coming to put clean sheets on the bed and then I understood. I wanted to tell the girls, but I knew they would not listen anyway so I started gathering up my stuff to get away from this dangerous place. My bags, now more and too heavy, so many, so many shoes and my roller skates and something a guy said made a piece of paper wrinkle in slow motion. Smooth wrinkle. The (male prostitute) guy left something on the shelf. He was looking for it. I said, ""Next to the TV."" He was finished the 12-hour shift and the girls were relieved but soon it would show up. I was alone again and knew I should have kept to myself in the first place."
"153"	"(10/07/1999)"	"I was in the lobby of the house for crazies. I went just outside the gate that was open. It was a black metal gate. I slammed it hard and watched it bounce back and forth off the other side. But metal. It more like sorta reverberated less and less until it was still. Smaller. Echoes of the big slam. Then I went and sat in the tall metal chair outside the gate. The metal chair was standing on concrete. I got up after sitting in the chair a while, kicked it over to slam down on the concrete. BAM. CLANK. Mike came out and said, ""Stop making that chair so angry."" And I said, ""Chairs can't be angry. The sound can be angry. I made the sound, but chairs are just there. We try to make them angry or cutesy, but really they are just chairs on concrete. Then I was sitting up in my bed. I could see the people but I didn't know if they could see me."
"154"	"(10/08/1999)"	"Grass would not grow because the dirt was packed down in front of the porch where we played and we were working on the yard. I was suppose to fix it, but I didn't know what to do, so I was stacking sea shells into the dirt, every few inches, to get some air into the ground. There were 3 kinds of shells I was sticking in and I put them in rows. I was real careful putting them in."
"155"	"(10/09/1999)"	"I had to keep things together with 12 miles of nuts and bolts. Things were a mess, but I knew it would work out OK even if it was too confusing. It was quiet. People had fallen asleep. He had written a long letter to his friend in Hawaii, about malaria, the black plague and its contemporary equivalent, but things would be OK--when the happy music was going. Some black guys were ??? thank ??? They danced better than me--a weird kind of crabwalk, sergeant, Russian rap dance, but I was catching on. The dance would make everything OK. If we could locate William Bagwell, and straighten out people lying. It was a lady from the phone company. She said so. I said, ""You're at your desk. You have a wrong number."" She said, ""Do you have a copy of your phone bill so we can proceed?"" I got scared and hung up. I didn't think the lady at the phone company would care ??? Take Rover for a walk."
"156"	"(10/09/1999)"	"I was taking a masters course at NYU wearing a YALE t-shirt. Rudy like dthe t-shirt. It was very old and blue and worn out just the right way. I was going to give it to him, but I was wearing it now. I'd have to give it to him later."
"157"	"(10/10/1999)"	"We were given 2 pieces of hard tack in the army. Really it was just burned toast. I was taking windsurfing/sailing lessons in the water on the west coast of Florida. The water was clear and aqua blue at the same time. The water felt good like cool nothing against my skin. I swam out with the windsurfer and by the time I got out deep enough it was a sailboat, bugger than a sunfish, smaller than a catamaran. Just when I was about to start, waves were coming in big. Across the bay I could see a beautiful city from another century. Maybe it was St. Petersburg, Russia. The domes on top of the buildings were shaped like breasts. Then a huge big wave started coming. Before it hit, the water sucked backwards. Then the huge wave hit. A little notch was cut out of the wave for me and Dora--like a lawnmower cutting through the water. I asked the instructor, ""What is that?"" And he said, ""It was a tear."" Somebody big somewhere was crying. ??? I was cleaning up the bathroom and kitty's cat litter box and a mouse dropped to the floor. I heard my kitty said, ""Fresh mice!"" I was living in Chinatown off Allen St. and we were late for school. I stopped at a fish and vegetable market to get a school lunch but they were trying to make hamburgers. Because we were so late for school, me and Dora were taken to school in a police car. The halls were big and outside. There were galleries represented there and in front of Marianna's spot her and Carlos were playing in a rhythm section unenthusiastically. Carlos was sitting back playing 2 tall African drums and Marianna was standing in front playing maracas. She handed me one and I shook it and hit the tall African drum with a stick. But it wasn't loud enough. I wanted to smash it--bang it LOUD. I couldn't get it to play loud enough so I left. I rode my bike back through Chinatown. In the museum, David Foxworth and his gang were lounging and making fun of misfortunate people. They were mean. I didn't like them. In the bathroom, Faith helped me wash my hair. She was helping me get ready for school and I was late again."
"158"	"(10/12/1999)"	"I was taking a writing class. There was no teacher there so we were goofing around. Nick was there. Sometimes he was very quiet. Sometimes he wasn't. We were all getting sleepy. It was night and we had nothing to do. Nick laid down on the floor on his stomach and I did not think about it but I went and laid down on top of him. It felt good and he rolled over and we were front to front and he got up to take his shirt off and just that second the teacher walked in. Nobody had done the assignment, because we didn't understand what to do. The teacher left and we were suppose to continue but things fizzled out. Me and Nick and Rudy walked to a mall. It was partly closed and partly opened. We stood in front of the automatic doors and watched them open and close. We walked through the closed part to the open part. Nick had to go to work at his job. He was a security guard. He worked nights. I went back to class and spilled a couple of tiny drops of soup onto somebody's paper. They had written with black ink on pale blue paint. It all blurred and ran into each other. 4 lines of text in all--2 above, 2 below. It all blurred and blurred till there was nothing left and it was my fault. Then the teacher and Jasmine came in to do a reading. None of us were expecting this. Nobody was ready. A fat country boy read an eloquent piece about growing up in Madden's Station. I yelled in excitement, ""That's where we kept the horses!"" It was inappropriate that I yelled but I kept pointing out Madden's Station to everybody around me. Jasmine came in for the reading in a floor-length black dress, lace. She was dressed to listen. I was trying on pretty bras. A black lace one and a white lace one. I did not want to cover them up with a shirt so I walked around in the black bra and forgot I wasn't wearing a shirt until the big teacher came in and then I remembered (that) I had been fooling around with Nick and she would think it was more than it was and kick us out so I put on a white t-shirt. At the basketball game we were reading at center court. A riot broke out. A housewife lady in class was counting out pills to share, getting them stuck in handfuls of sand. They were green. I didn't even want any but she said, ""At least take 5. (that's a years supply)"" The riot was getting bad and Jasmine said, ""Go to my house on Clinton St."" It was a very tiny house. 8 feet X 8 feet. It had a sink and a couch. In the sink were chicken leg bones and empty KFC boxes. Jasmine came and said, ""I'll give you a ride home. Go look in the car."" I opened the hood instead of the car door and it was full of lettuce."
"159"	"(10/13/1999)"	"Keith had gotten a job working graveyard shift for Bryan Hunt. Bryan had assistants 24-hours and I was there just hanging around a little. It was over for me. I was just showing Keith the automatic doors. Keith was having a delayed reaction, at age 39 from when his father died when he was 12. He had 2 drinks and threw up. Then he asked for a beer by name. It was a quart of beer in a bottle with a handle. The beer also settled your stomach. Keith said he wasn't sure this job was going to work out because he had too much time to think. He sat on the floor against the wall thinking and drinking beer. It was the end of the world and people were trying to escape. I knew the only way for me to get through the gate was with a little red wagon. I was pulling little kids in there and we got in just before the gate clanked down. Then I saw the tennis courts and I wanted to play. Tennis was what I wanted to be doing. And then Dora was playing Chopin and she told me some things to help. But the children were still in the little red wagon. My cousin, Deb, came and she was going to have a rough time. She didn't have music and she was nervous. The man at the gate where I pulled the kids through thought I was the teacher for the kids at this gifted and talented school. I let him think that but I knew I was one of the kids just taller. We got in and I wanted to play Mozart and a girl offered to show me the hard parts. She went down the hill with her Mother and the piano was in a warehouse where construction was going on. You could hear the Mozart with the hum of machinery and the bang, bang, bang of hammering and the clink of big iron bars. The girl and her mother never came back up the hill."
"160"	"(10/14/1999)"	"I was in a bar with people I didn't know. There was a little girl with blonde hair. You could tell it was real blonde because the light shining on the face, the little tiny hairs on her arms and face were blonde too. She was staring in the mirror and I was staring at her. We did not move. Still like chess men. We were back in the TV couch room. She had gotten accepted to Wisconsin State and met a guy 5 days before. They were getting married. She left and I was laying on the couch with her fiancée. I was laying on my back and in front of the TV but not watching it. He was laying on his back with his head in my lap. He had a bald head. He rolled his head from side to side on my lap and it felt good. Then the blonde girl came back. She was exasperated. She said, ""What was I thinking? I'm NOT going to Wisconsin and I'm NOT getting married. The guy got up to try and change her mind but she was already gone. I put on a thick cotton gauze yellow dress. Daffodil yellow. It had one inch shoulder straps but I unzipped the dress and let it fall to my waist so when I walked it dragged the ground and the wind would blow and it would fly out like Batman's cape behind me. My kitty liked to walk just inside the wind tunnel of the dress. I was walking down Washington Sq. When I noticed people staring at me and I realized I was half-naked. I went into the first building on the right that looked friendly. Sure enough there were apartment keys in the elevator. I pushed 3 and 8 but I knew I was going to 11. The dial had no numbers just notches. 2 dials. One above the other. There were 12 floors. I stopped at 3 and 8 but I didn't get off until 11. When I got there it was a fancy apartment but in a way it was very plain. The refrigerator door was open. The house was very neat, but inside the freezer was helter skelter. I set out to make some ice. I filled an ice tray and put it in the freezer. I left the freezer door open but the ice made so quick I could not believe it. I took out the ice and set out to make some more. If I closed the freezer and refrigerator door it would make real fast, I bet, but I had to leave. The folks coming back might shoot me if they came back on Sunday afternoon and a stranger was making ice in the refrigerator. I was in a chicken restaurant that was expanding. They had crazy rules--old/new. They guy in front of me ordered a chicken breast and baked potato. I didn't know what to order so I didn't order anything. A girl and boy were teaching me to dance a dance. The girl was teaching me. The boy was taking pictures. I didn't know which way to go. I was standing in line to go to the bathroom in a school. Then a black male teacher came in with a line of little kids. They all had to go to the bathroom. It was taking way too long. Long. The teacher told the kids to unbutton and unzip their pants and drop them while standing in line so they would get done sooner. The children's eyes told me they were scared but they were scared NOT to do as they're told so they stood in line with their pants down looking scared in their eyes."
"161"	"(10/14/1999)"	"Recalled in my head. I was at the beach with my mother and Dora and Rudy and Tom Brandon. We were at a gray motel. All one story and spread in a line perpendicular to the beach. We were looking for shells. Tom found a bunch of chalky conch shells and piled them up in a plastic bag. I didn't find many shells because I was looking at the yellow pages. My mother had told me to find a hotel for next years vacation and make reservations. I called one place. The guy who answered the phone didn't feel like talking. He said there were a whole lot of hotels around, but it would cost around $70,000. I didn't say anything, but I knew I could never pay the bill. I asked him if he was sure there wasn't anything else. He said he thought we should go to Smoky Lake at Chimney Rock. I said, ""That's in the mountains."" He said, ""I know."" I said, ""Well we want to feel the salt in the air."""
"162"	"(10/15/1999)"	"I was in a huge ship. It was so big you couldn't tell you were floating on the water but you were. It was night and I was sharing a room with Dora. She had the top bunk and I was sleeping on a shelf. There was not a window at my shelf--it was actually under water level, but inside the ship, so there was plenty of air and no water. Rudy's place to sleep was on a shelf way down the big room past a little tiny window. You could see the horizon--the sky and the water. It was night. The sky was not black at all but went on and on and the water was full of sharks and things you could feel but not see. Me and Dora were trying to sleep. Rudy had gone to perform with the Blue Rain Boys. People were making noise. Complaining and whining. I went to see if I could get them to shut up. I could not. 2 little boys in between the rows were singing. They were singing good but their Mother pushed them to come and sing for us and this, being forced and scared to sing, took away their desire to sing. They were scared in ???. My mother came and kept wanting to watch everything I was doing. I knew she was their only to criticize and tell me I was doing everything WRONG WRONG WRONG. I went back to sleep, to try to, on my shelf. The Blue Rain Boys had gone on a 24-hour performance ???. Stephen was trying to get in the door. He was trying to force it open and use people in manipulative ways. He sat there 24 hours waiting on me to come out. Alicia came in and she was proud of me and she laid down with me on my shelf and hugged me calm reassuring tight. We went to sleep in a hug. When I woke up we were holding hands. The inside of the room was the inside of a huge sphere. There was a rope swing attached to the center highest point of the dome and a long long piece of rope there to swing on. It was for pent up fun and to experience the laws of geometry and physics ??? distance, coordinates, angles form the ??? bisect the ??? hypotenuse ??? bisect to triangles, points ??? 3 dimensional, 2 dimensional, C= kick off point where you ricocheted from the wall. ??? point where you swung from ???/ torque ??? rest of your life, but D (D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L + top of point of sphere to continue inevitably). You could continue swinging the rest of your life, but D (or the final stop swinging) would be the last point this would continue from. ??? 3 dimensional triangle (pyramid) Swinging in the sphere was so much fun. It took you to another place without a name and away from all the other people and distractions and noise. I was swinging for a long time until I got sleepy. I was very tired and I kept trying to sleep but I could not sleep for one reason or another. A fire had started and the fire truck came and I couldn't figure out where they parked because we were in the middle of the ocean. The fire chief said that Rudy had left a wooden spoon in a teflon frying pan and left the burner on and this had started the fire that was now out. The rain had put it out. The fireman said he was going to sit the teflon frying pan out to catch the rain for 3 days/nights. ??? stuck for life ???/ my 9th grade home room ??? Harassing me with loud inaccurate ??? He would not press charges. 12. Rudy was out on tour anyway and my mother was in the good seats waiting for a performance. I walked out. ??? how silly ??? white trash make fun of me and laughed at me ??? motorcycle and rode with him to a gas station/drugstore near 232 St. I went in for cigarettes but there was only make up. Lori Hall from my 9th grade home-room was in there laughing."
"163"	"(10/16/1999)"	"There was a 5-story house in Tribeca. Boxes of shoes (used) were on the floor and I found some shoes I really liked. There were a couple of very annoying chicks looking for shoes. When I was leaving I ran into Lisa on the ground floor. She was organizing things. She put a read polka-dotted dress on a coat hanger. It looked like a little girls dress. It was for a daughter who didn't exist yet. Lisa was organizing, organizing and I was feeling bad because nobody would spend time with me so ??? in LA. So I boxed up ??? All down from the ceiling. A few other people were locked up ??? and I got busted. I was in jail ???. In  jail, people were ??? and when I got up to get my sentence (in line) he told me instead of TIME. I asked could I go get cigarettes but the jail keeper said NO. ??? no. When it came time to see the judge we were standing in a line. Tribeca was moving over a block and the drag queens were taking over the block. Very tall zipping up their dresses. The cops caught me and I was in jail and when I came up in front of the judge they said my sentence was to rat. The guy before me, they told him, ""We're doing a 'buy and bust' over at 7th St. and you'll probably be shot dead."" It was his first offense. He was a nice kid. Then it was my turn and the lady judge said, ""Your spot is on 26 St. gaming strip."" I said, ""the West Side is not my territory. I don't know where that is."" The judge said, ""YOU BETTER!"" And I skated by and sure enough it was the gaming dock and ramps and roller blading and basketball and lots of drag queen hookers and regular hookers ???"

"165"	"(10/17/1999)"	"Me and Vicki Davis were sitting on the floor in the gym. There were tables set up and lots of strangers and a foreign man, an important fellow who was very neat at a table by himself. There were lockers and gym baskets between the stage and where we were getting ready. We had a Bugs Bunny record to play. We both had books to read and she was dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and I was dressed like Fidel Castro in shorts. We practiced and it was funny but when we went on stage we were 45 minutes late. People were already yawning bored. We failed miserable. I forgot my book to read irrelevant passages from and I had to go back to the locker and get it. Vicki forgot her book. I could not wait for it to be over. Neither could the audience. We were going to take photographs with Jay Mills. He was meeting us at the gallery. He usually rode his bicycle in from Connecticut. He had a favorite hat. It was a McDonalds hard hat. It was obviously a rare out-of-city hat and it had been stolen. William said Mills should wear a NYC McDonalds hat in the city because then nobody would want it. We were getting ready to go and Jay Mills said, ""Merri, you need to get your camera and your lens and your film. They're all in different places inside the gallery."" And it was like hunting for Easter eggs."
"166"	"(10/19/1999)"	"Dora was sick. In the airport I found a fireplace and made a fire to keep her warm. I propped her up on pillows and tried to make sure I put a log on to keep the fire going hot and not die down. I had to keep leaving and come back to check on her because there were things I needed to do. There was a drugstore in the airport and I was going to get some things to help Dora: some medicine, Vaseline, and on the way I had to walk through the high school commons and there were lots of tables filled up. I met a table of 3 misfits. A very intense quarterback football player who used to be a heavy drug addict and was not rehabilitated and bearing down hard writing on his papers--trying to straighten up and fly right. He was studying the 12-steps. He had 2 friends there. The one girl--she was very butch, husky, with a bad haircut like an adolescent boy would get in a hick town barber shop on the half-days when they were busy (Wednesday and Saturday). She was gathering information. His other friend was a morose black girl. She sat without talking at the table with her fingers laced, elbows wide and resting on the table. She was deep in thought. She never looked up to see anybody. She was the only one who saw the big picture. The tables were metal made to look like fake wood. They could fold up. William came to the school to teach a class and mostly guys were taking it. The rehabilitated football player and his 2 girl buddies were taking the class as one person. Other than me, the rest of the students were guys. The football guy and friends (3 counting himself) wanted to dress up as Bible characters. They were going around trying to find a wolf skin so he could be Abraham or Moses. ???The 2 friends were his lost sheep. I knew William already, so I could be me. I said, ""William, right now, I want to smash the table with a hammer, just to hear the noise."" He said, ""OK."" /??? Sitting on high stools. The guys were working hard. One guy was painting the table green and when he painted it, it became transparent and green. See-through metal green. I remembered Dora and I went to check on her. ??? tampon stuck and went to the doctor ??? about 3's and 7's. We were standing in line soaking wet. I was wearing long thin cotton pants for running and a thin long sleeve cotton shirt, soaking wet and I was cold. Then I ran to see Dora. By now I was dry from all the running and not so cold. At a church they were lining bags to take to shut-ins. A lady, she said it was donation bags I was going to take one. (they all had coffee, eggs and other stuff in them) but Dora persuaded me not to. She said it was not a sin to steal from the church, but it was a sin to take anything from the kind old people."
"167"	"(10/20/1999)"	"I was working on an art project where Max Fish is on Ludlow St. It was daytime. We had a conveyor belt darkroom set up but first I had been rubbing wet paper on a cocoa metal box to lift a transfer copy of the letters from. The transfer was lifted in tiny little couscous like beads. By the time I finished the first one it was midnight. The art stores were closed. A crazy (retarded) lady from the building had been ranting and raving in the middle of the street in the busy part of the city. The cops brought her--since the lady was going to sleep, unaware of the art supplies she wasn't using. I left a sandwich on the counter. Jasmine was helping the lady and Jasmine let me use her tissue paper, since when she woke up there would be more. This time I got more and the big letters lifted, though the small letters (ingredients) had been near perfect the first time. The gallery was being rented out for a wedding and the bride was a no-show. I was supposed to get married but my mind was on the art project in the darkroom. I was invisible to the wedding guests who were looking at their watches. They had forgotten to get drinks to go with the cake. So a takeout delivery was made: one pint of O.J., a 12 oz. can of apple juice and a couple other cans of juice. I put them in the refrigerator and left. The guests were at the table waiting for fireworks and instead all they got was mustard and ketchup. I was walking up 1st Avenue and stopped in front of a storefront. Inside there were 5 lace slips from another country, another century. They were marked $30.00. I didn't have the $. The poems were scattered on the floor of the empty bar and the guys were leaving to go check out all the topless bars. They asked me did I want to go, but I knew it was just out of politeness and instead I wanted to stand in front of the window of the closed shop and look at the beautiful slips on hangers. $30 apiece."
"168"	"(10/21/1999)"	"I was waiting with Dora. We were traveling together and Dora wanted to send her friend (a stranger) a thank you note. There were several pens around but Dora was looking for a pencil. I was getting impatient but Dora wandering around semi- clothed, or unclothed and I'm looking for a girl named Dianne, to thank her. I was holding a ginger ale in each hand, one for me, one for Dora. There was a concrete slab. It hovered about 12"" ground even though it was heavy. It had a handle and there were 2 other variables that steered and 3 variables that also chose direction. One was sex (male or female). I was sitting on the concrete slab. It was big. They were so excited when Rudy was there, to go to church, but he didn't want to go, so it disappointed everyone. And Elizabeth (my cousin who died) could be very forceful when that could be useful. There was an empty apartment but it was in Columbia and quite a long commute."
"169"	"(10/22/1999)"	"I was running in the marathon. At first I didn't know till I realized it was a run for Dora. I had run the first 14 miles when we came to a small wooden house. A man inside was practicing piano. The ??? I got a drink of water and was tired, and was hoping someone would come and help me carry the bags. Then Dora came and told me to throw the bags in the ditch. I said, ""But Dora,"" And she said, ""I'll take care of it."" So I threw 'em in the ditch and she was right. Just before I left ??? needed to get 3 gallons of milk for coffee ??? railroad tracks ??? walking ??? going ??? ladder ??? teach ??? over to make myself to see him ??? ??? because the race would finish without me. The priest Harry Grover was dying of cancer and couldn't stay around for me to talk to him. A fellow was practicing piano ??? A case of mangos was in the route cut open with a razor. They said, ""Suck the juice, it will give you enough energy to win. I sucked the juice. It gave me energy. They said they had a bathroom every 4 miles ??? I went to the bathroom and started back running, throwing my bags in the ditch like Dora told me and she picked up what was important. I was running ??? Where the music stand should be a pile of ??? but when I touched them they were ??? ??? TV newscaster said this was the longest stretch of ??? ???

I had been sitting under the steps. I got up and ran without looking and didn't even know I had been hit by a train. 2 girls asked to go with me and they stopped at a store selling African drums and rhythm instruments and one girl sat down with the drum between her knees and the other playing castanets and a crowd gathered, swaying and the big video screen showed pictures of the girls. They did not look like them and close-ups of a girl and boy kissing who were sitting the next park bench over."

William dropped me and Evelyn off at his parents' house to go downstairs and further downstairs where the action was. William needed to go to work. ??? 7:15 we lost in warning. William's family ???. It was night and since his mother and father were vampires, they were not home yet. His brother was standing on the stairs and said to stay while he went to??? I went to ride the rides. William had 15 brothers and little sisters. They functioned on the outskirts of reality. He had 15 brothers and sisters. So many that the little ones had to sleep out in the backyard. The puppies were warm. His oldest brother was a drag-queen ballet dancer who whined and complained. A waterslide connected the basement to the above. Evelyn had thrown her bags and clothes and books she was carrying below the basement to lighten her load and when I tried level 6 and step on a pile of books and papers, toys and clothes, the foundation (pile of junk) slipped little by little and gave out under me to the level below. I was lost. William's little brothers and sisters were playing. The littlest one (a girl) hoped ???. I slid on the water slide but I knew not to scare her by talking to her. We just played together. No street signs only parking lots and a hungry cat. 20 guys (2 rows of 10) were sleeping on the floor and woke up and asked when I was to play with the little girl; and then the just-near-adolescent boy was admiring my rebellion and we became friends till his father the vampire came and slapped him around and it was time for me to go back to the ground level, but the water slide flowed downhill, the foundation had given way so I had to walk the long way up the ramp and through the parking lot of the Arby's which was right across the street from William's parents house. The driving instructor hit me with the side of the car but I told him I could walk. The security lady said she'd call an ambulance for me and did I want a smoking or non-smoking ambulance. I said non-smoking but I could use a cigarette right about now. Just before daylight, William's oldest brother, already a vampire, came in flapping his arms and came and asked me to borrow $5. He said times were getting tougher for vampires these days."
"171"	"(10/23/1999)"	"We were on a winter vacation in some people's house who were not there. My mother said they kept it real clean and we got sand everywhere. It was cold. There were 3 houses. Ours next to the water (on the right if it was behind you--left if it was in front of you). We were trying to pack up to go but we kept accumulating more and more stuff. The basketball court was 2 doors down. At center court was an adolescent girl just developing. They had her on the news and the bleachers were full. Kids were making fun of her and she was upset because the extra weight of breasts interfered with her swimming time (added seconds, kept her from winning). They used a stick pointer and pointed to her breasts and leered at her, calling her the best swimmer in the world, but they didn't mean it at all. My mother said, ""Merri, go to the grocery store and get some bread,"" but there were 4 loaves already. So I told her that. I made 2 pieces of cheese toast and my mother said didn't I see the newspaper article? That cheese got a bad write-up. I let it keep toasting, not caring about the newspaper article. She rolled her eyes and shrugged her shoulders. It was time to go. A crack dealer tried to get me to give him my $10 so he would have an even thousand. I walked back through the door and he went through the door to the inside. I had to go to the gym and it was full of a few teenagers in Lazy-Boy chairs. The boys were all smoking cigarettes, holding them very awkwardly and believing that they looked very cool. The coolest kid was a shy one not smoking whose hands moved very specifically with accurate intent. It was cold and I said, ""Rudy there's a sunroof and we've missed all the sun."" It was our last day. ??? all this sun. I had to go get Rudy ??? and sun, and when he saw a different family and different furniture, he realized and came back outside. I was already going up to the sunroof over an open-air parking garage that stuck out (the roof) over the water. My mother was packing things to go layered between towels. A journalist was doing a story about a young tennis player and her family who'd sold many houses to fund her tennis. The girl was picking up rocks and labeling their type----volcanic, ore, quartz, etc. and the article drew a map of where the girl found the rocks."
"172"	"(10/27/1999)"	"I was running in the marathon. The route went through the woods and over the rocks at the creek. 2 guys had finished long before I did. When I finally finished I went to talk to them. They didn't want to talk to me. ??? I thought they would be my friends now! They were sitting on the bench outside. I went to talk to the other finisher but he was swimming laps underwater so he couldn't hear me anyway. Then we were walking on the beach. my father was leading a horse. He loved the horse. Sometimes waves would come up and go over our knees--to the horse's ankles. I was worried this would upset him but my father kept walking slow and steady. There were little lines left in the sand when the waves slid back down. My mother said this was from rats that were underwater dragging their tails. I said, ""There aren't any rats in the ocean,"" And she said, ""Yes there are. See those lines."" I walked more careful. I looked back to find my father and he was gone. Then I spotted him far away sitting on the very edge of the bleachers on the sand. I could tell it was him by the way he sat all loose. There was a volleyball game that was going on the beach. One team needed another player so I played. Then the game moved inside the gym. I came in and right away it was my turn to serve. I said the score, ""1--20."" We were close to losing. The ball was too flat. It wasn't even a volleyball but that didn't matter as much as it needing air. The first time I went to serve I missed the ball altogether. Then I hit it over and it touched the net and went over. Like a let in tennis but I didn't know what they called it and their rules were confusing how it was OK in tennis but not OK in volleyball. We stopped playing and the other team, the good team who won, told us we could sit on the floor in the narrow part until the next game. They got to sit in the bleachers."
"173"	"(10/28/1999)"	"Anna was very upset and cussing a lot. She was standing outside the church downtown. Tommy Cox came by and we started talking and touching each other and I said ""I have a bottle of wine,"" and he said, ""12 St. Whole foods is closed but we can climb over/under the fence."" The fence was made of bones. Filed down and sharpened into spikey points. Other security measures. We got there. I went back for my wine and saw Anna and she was very upset. She was saying FUCK a lot. She said she had to strip for the cops. She banged her head down on the piano keys. It sounded like she felt. Tommy came back and his sister offered me a vinyl mini-skirt in memory of someone. I wandered off, avoiding discussion of the skirt and walked in the back yard. A bird cage with individual tiny cages 4 x 3 x 3 inches held about 30 birds of all kinds. Some were real live birds. Some were toy birds. (plastic and synthetic toy birds. Cheap toy birds/expensive toy birds. There were dogs too, running in the back yard. Back inside our hands were finding each other and we started messing around when he had to go work in the kitchen of the restaurant. He acted like he knew how too. I was in bed with 2 girls. We were laying there when the waiter from the restaurant came and gave us free breakfast from Tommy in the kitchen. It was hard to eat laying down. I spilled my vanilla pudding onto the bed (sheet) and forgot about it till I rolled lover on it."
"174"	"(10/29/1999)"	"We were at Aunt Joe's house. Me and Rudy. We were trying to get used to being there without Dora. Then real quick Rudy was a tiny little baby but he could talk. He was embarrassed. He said, ""Merri, it's time,"" I said, ""It's OK, it happens to everybody,"" and I looked for the diapers but when I found them he was all grown up again. Other people were in that weird room at Aunt Joe's now. The room with the piano. It was a group from the country church who were becoming Bible sellers and encyclopedia salesmen. One guy said, ""When you first start the company can't afford to hire you. They lose money training you. But by the time you finish you can't afford to leave. You owe them too much so you have to keep working. Jack Nicholson was in the room with the country Christians. He was making faces. We were suppose to be practicing Bible sales pitches but I as practicing Mozart. I was practicing the 3rd movement (rondo) of the Sonata in C. (the part I don't know good yet) the music was all the way across the room and I couldn't see it good and a lady yelled at me to stop. I was sad to stop. I was trying to get the part above high C. ??? ???/ Bible sales pitch . ??? I lost it at the part ??? A girl was reading and memorizing a paperback book (worn out) called Bonfire Vanity for her pitch. It was laying near the piano. I picked it up and threw it across the room as hard as I could. It landed under the radiator. The cover came off and it tore apart. The girl said, ""that's my book,"" I stared at it under the radiator. We left and we were in the car. Dora was driving. Rudy said, ""Merri, I think I should tell you, I'm beginning to get a heroin addiction. I said, ""uh-oh."" He said, ""You're the only person I know who would say that."" I was looking at his strung out girl-friend. Trying to see her pupils. ??? and when we were walking. ??? said, ""I want to show you something. ??? They're on the second floor. ??? nationally. I let myself get lost from the group and walked into a ??? in an empty room. There was a piano there but the lady at the desk said nobody had played that piano in years and they weren't gonna start now. ??? let us go up the stairs. Then when we left she was in the crawl space under the stairs next to the door and I said some people are just unhappy. I was completely lost trying to find Dora's house--walking up and down the sidewalk looking for people who could help me. There were lots of people but they weren't the right ones. One girl, I thought she was wearing me overalls with the physics laws written on them. ??? the TV guide and I was trying to find the Simpsons. I walked into ??? and bumped into the man and I said, ""I'm sorry."" ??? see a lady pulled her cape ???Evelyn. I asked Evelyn, ""Don't the Simpsons come on anymore?"" and she said, ""Yeah, but at fucking 4:00 in the afternoon."" We were mad together."
"175"	"(10/30/1999)"	"We were sitting on top of the hill and the rain was coming. I was sitting on the floor in front of a low table balancing a frying pan. I couldn't decide whether to cook the bacon or the eggs first so I chopped--sliced the bacon up and threw it all in there together. 3 eggs, 3 pieces of bacon, scrambled. When it got close to finished cooking--but too runny--I don't like runny eggs--nobody was there to eat them. A social worker offered me a huge bag of cheap Halloween candy. She had it slung over her shoulder like Santa Claus. She said she didn't want it. It was cheap candy but did I want it. I said, ""I have one piece of Godiva chocolate Alan gave me, do you want that?"" And she popped it in her mouth and made sucking noises and said, ""Ummmmmm."" Alan was there trying to read aloud the pages I'd typed. Words were missing all over the place and every ""t"" I typed came out an ""f,"" so when I typed ""it"" it came out ""if."" And it didn't make sense. He picked out sentences here and there and Stephen was trying to roll over on me and twitch his body in a sexual way. I said I have to leave. The rain was coming. I went to Chinatown and ordered a small soup and rice. I as looking for a used appliance store (junk shop) but instead I found a take-out restaurant. The girl behind the counter wrote a poem for me about me. She said I was a little girl in the poem, in a beautiful spriteful way. She read the poem in English but wrote it with a black sharpie in Chinese on the paper bag and gave it to me. My soup came and it was time to go but part of me wanted to stay with the Chinese waitress. I went on to the thrift shop and found what I'd been looking for. A pair of flannel men's pajamas. Size S. Someone had spilled globs of clorox on parts and I knew they'd look beautiful if I soaked them all in clorox. They had short sleeves with navy blue piping. This was their one fault. I went to the loft and Marianna was sleeping on the bed, on her side with her eyes opened. Mary had painted a map on the door with watercolors of foreign countries. Green maps and (land) blue frothy water. She started very intricate, blending green into tan and blending water to shoreline, but she ran out of time and got increasingly sloppy. She started at the bottom. The door was on the inside. I didn't know my exact address but I assumed it was on 20 Street somewhere around 2nd Avenue. Door #1. I wondered of any deliveries would ever get there, but that's the closest I knew to where I was."
"176"	"(11/01/1999)"	"There was snow outside. Snow iced over on top. Crusty snow. Outside the side window that tracks had not messed it up yet. The hook was big. It held up Christmas trees. It was near that time. My mother picked out 2. They were delivered and they bent over scraping the ceiling. One-legged Delores spoke to me on the steps and asked me how I was. I said, ""OK."" She was talking about did I give blood at the hospital. I was watching for Bellow. His ear. One was mixing dough in the sink and I said, ""Do you have to take this much space?"" And she said, ""Yeast needs warm water to activate."" And I said, ""That bread has yeast in it? She said, ""Yeah, want some?"" So I took a glob. It was shaped like the inside-out and the outside-in of a shirt. I was looking at slides on the light table. They were shaped like iMacs. They were of my art and were frothy pale colors and sanded down on the edges. On top were circles. On the back of the bookcase, packages from rocket toys were hanging, according to height. Tallest ones on top. Instead of saving them, the girl had saved the packages. I tried to understand. I forgot about rolling my film because of the slides. The timer was gone and I got all mixed up on my developing. I got so ??? I lost track of time. ??? 1:1. Stephen barged in and said, ""Look at me."" ??? developing. I got so confused I took the top off the canister. It was cracked and old. I hadn't even put the stop in. I realized over half the developer had leaked out and I mixed some in a plastic cup. I dumped it in and occasionally agitated when I remembered. Stephen was angry. Mad. Nuts. Screaming. Ranting and Raving. Trying to get me to look at page 18. I wouldn't. The sound wouldn't go. I forgot what I was doing with my chemicals. I took the top off. I rinsed with water and I had not fixed yet. Stephen started yelling at a guy named Mark. He (Mark) said he saw him, and he'd do karate. He (Mark) said, yes, he did think Stephen's capable of killing me. I agreed nonchalantly. He started showing his karate kicks and hits in the darkroom. 2 girls started rolling seductively on the floor and I said, ""Silly girls,' because there were pictures to print and not much time. A party was at a loft--suspended from the ceiling on ropes and bunji cords--with only a minimum amount of stretch. I jumped up and down on the loft and it bounced like a boat on water. Nick and the girls got scared and I saw the girl as she overlooked the living room with fireplace below; said she'd invite me for dinner when it got cold. She said, ""You can bring anybody."" Nick said they photographed his chest for a poster for World's Gym and he never did weights. I knew Stephen might come back. I left the loft with folks, friendly. I was going across the bridge by myself. On the negatives were pictures of my art with some pictures I had not taken of the 1st Baptist church came out clear, clear, clear. A torn envelope with Jasmine's cancelled checks from long ago were in the darkroom drawer. They were pale green."
"177"	"(11/02/1999)"	"At the beach like Cherry Grove, but up north. Stephen was trying to get in and I was trying not to listen. He followed me into a department store and made crazy accusations. I went to look at little girls bathing suits. He followed me. His voice was going on and on and I couldn't hit stop so I started humming to cover it up in my head. William was there and we were reminiscing about Ackerman. He wasn't here anymore. We gently dropped his photographs (one each) in the ocean and watched the waves take them away."
"178"	"(11/02/1999)"	"There was a lady in the vegetable section of a grocery store. There were Chinese vegetables there. She was picking at vegetables and saying awful things to her son, ""Jack Anderson."" Her name was not Anderson and she was saying awful things about the name. I told the little boy in the stroller, ""Jack Anderson, be proud of that name. Anderson's a great name."" A lady was standing on a hill saying, ""Dick Anderson [my father] cusses all the time."" She was emphatic. I said, ""No he doesn't. He never cusses."" She said, ""Oh, that's what I meant."""
"179"	"(11/03/1999)"	"Darlene was standing in front of a very tall building. She was crying. She said after 59 years of acting she'd given it up. I told her, ""That's good, I've never been happier since I gave up acting."" She said, ""Can you get me some grapes?"" I said, ""When it stops raining I'll go out and get some in my hand."" The smaller ones were old, old grapes. Raisins. I was going towards there but ate most of the grapes. Then we were at a big, big loft. They were getting ready for a party. Food they were getting ready was all over the counter. A lady had a special roll (bread) and she dropped it on the counter. I picked it up and handed to her and she threw it as hard as she could against the stainless steel sink. She said she was not gonna eat it after I touched it! Then she started crying and she said she was a little upset this week since she'd just been arrested for punching 2 cops in the face and a black man. I said, ""I can believe it. You've got a temper on you."" The hard roll was soggy now from picking up traces of water in the sink. Joe Fong was writing Mayor Guilliani a letter about trash cans in the city. How the mayor put all these fancy trash cans all over the city, and Harper screamed, ""Harlem, Harlem, Harlem."" but James was doing a survey of the left out places and James had written down the East Village and I said Chinatown. By now there were jackets all over the concrete ground in front of the building. There were 2 little girls. When they were asleep the families did operations on them that changed them into each other. Their minds were the same but their faces were changed so they looked exactly like the other (Merri=Dora, Dora=Merri) when the little girls woke up they didn't know, except when people called them by the wrong name. Only when they looked in the mirror and saw the other sister did they know something was different. But in time we got used to seeing the other sister's face when we looked in the mirror. This was OK. Dora smiled back at me. But then the parents did another operation to put an old man's head on my body and when I looked in the mirror I was an old man. I had never seen a little girl with a gray stubble beard and stubby, prickly, gray, white, black sprinkles of stiff chopped hair on her head. She took the puppies out and let them run loose and play in the side yard. They were brother and sister puppies. I wasn't suppose to let them run loose but I did anyway. I was running under bridges instead of over them on the lower (upper) end of Manhattan."
"180"	"(11/04/1999)"	"Eileen was teaching class. It was at the Y. Everybody had read and since the pool was open--though after closing when school started). We were going to do an extra class there. I carried a scribbled list of notes and climbed over the fence and looked up at the lifeguard chair I knew so well. Then it was time to go to class. I went to the bathroom. One real skinny girl who considered herself a hot chick, came running into the stall 2 doors down and was sick at both ends. Then she was throwing up on purpose and with all the bad noises coming out of there I opened the door to see if she was alright. She was trying to suck water out of the handle (where you flush.) I said her name with a question mark at the end of it. She said, ""My story is gonna kick ass!"" A lady was staring into space at the table. I heard my name. ""Merri."" Dora called me but it was a man's voice like Raymond's. I heard this. It was the way Dora said it and no one else. It was getting cold and me and Christian laid down sorta close to keep each other warm. We pulled up the blanket. He dumped a gallon bottle of Chanel No. 5 on the sleeping bag. I said, ""That won't help you sleep."" So he left me and slept close to a guy. (the only other person in the room) and now they were warm and I was cold. I walked up the hill with Harvey. Oncoming traffic made Harvey not want to walk close to the edge. We held hands and when we got closer we looked at the cows. Some were mad."
"181"	"(11/09/1999)"	"I was thinking up a place to take pictures ??? People ??? you for me ??? so big logistics. You could sign out the tripod. The lens focusing by your mind. No ??? horizon ??? focused, focused manually. Individual lens. Your focus coming. A horizon absent ??? She wasn't ??? Focused good on the horizon. ??? all I said, but I said I liked some things. The toilet was in the background blurred. The seasons change."
"182"	"(11/10/1999)"	"It was cold. Getting colder. Short sleeves. I was looking for a kitten. I wanted stripes. I found some Canada Dry inside but all he had was ??? 100% followed of her because the windows ???. The package was ??? The lady said, ""you see, we ???"" I said, ""ANTS are not how you get AIDS!"" and I pulled up the pajamas like some....."
"183"	"(11/11/1999)"	"We were locked in a monastery. Me and Harvey and a lot of other people. The girls had to wear jeanie outfits and do Arab hula dances with crazy leg twists. I decided to leave the monastery during outdoor dancing but Harvey couldn't decided if he wanted to leave or not. He was afraid of the cult leader."
"184"	"(11/12/1999)"	"It was early in the morning. It needed to be earlier to catch the bus to the outside parts of the city and follow people at 6 a.m. The next day I got up early so Dora could sleep and I followed the people to the Y. I left home at 5:30. When I cut through the locker-room it was full of loud, sweating, very strong women. You could see their muscles. I drew a huge, long skinny 8 the length of my forearm on the inside. I drew another line and then decided to fill it in. I wanted some paint the color of blood--but then there were so many colors of fingernail polish like blood that I painted it in with red fingernail problems. (text says ""problems"" instead of ""polish."" I was in the way of the big, strong, sweating basketball players in the locker room. Some who were already late to leave. We were waiting for the Russians to bomb us. WW III. They had a landfill on a strip which they never checked. The baseball field was nearby. There was a floating aluminum lounge chair in the water. I got 3 containers of cake icing from the freezer. Even though the Russians were gonna bomb the landfill and us I had to see the cupcakes."
"185"	"(11/13/1999)"	"The cops said, ""Why are you kids playing baseball up there?"" I said, ""Because it's flat and there are some trees."" He said, ""Don't you know that's a crime scene? Go inside."" Some kids went inside. I sat in the back of the car. Nick was there and Randy. We were all in a loft gonna go and go out and there was a stranger and once we were, me and Nick and Randy in the same room. Awkward situation. A girl asked me, Will you walk my dog at 10:00 hours and at 14:00 hours?"" I said, ""OK."" I was at the top of a huge pit and I dropped a pack of cigarettes down the pit and then I accidentally knocked the dog into the pit. He was lost forever."

There was a toilet ??? spears ??? going to be in the contest ??? at grandma's. I made a bow and arrow and put 2 rubber bands around ??? I wanted to win no matter ??? ??? Alan was standing behind the bunk bed. He had 3 very young, little brothers and sisters. It was the story of his life. The game had questions. Even about cartoons and ??? Beach and the other side. Too much cat hair ??? Cat hair was everywhere. ??? Everyone in 13 e's brownstone got a fan. It was chintzy. Very much with me he had in common. 3 cats I could find. 1 cat was for me."
"187"	"(11/16/1999)"	"Rudy had a girlfriend who dyed her hair blond and she was leaning over sick between her knees in a fold-up chair. Rudy made a joke about me being absent from work always in Chicago. I'd be at a bar. I was working at a copy shop where the old cemetery should be. There was a guy boss and 3 women who'd been there since it started. One was way way past her prime but she acted all coy like she was 20. If you listen your eyes would know the difference. One was a Chinese lady. When she shook my hand, she took off my rings. Her hands were all greasy with some industrial oil and she told me, she had known, ""Hell yes, she did (know) Amelia Erhart. I hated working at the copy shop, attached in such funny ways. Outside before closing, I was going to make a break for it. A man stopped me with a nice, thick green towel that needed the ??? A worker showed me a sign with accordion map folds up high and told me, ""When I first started here, I'd climb up and straighten out the papers on the sign,"" and I said, ""Good for you."""
"188"	"(11/17/1999)"	"Joe had been living in my place. I had moved. A lady was talking about all the loose boards I had left all over the floor. They were 38"" long, some of them. She said, ""You didn't do much with the space, did you?"" And I said, ""No."" She said, ""Joe is now staying at the St. James."" Corinne and I had climbed down off the roof and we were shopping at a place where they sold very, very old items in categories. Ladies hair bows with watches attached. They came in different sizes and ladies had worn them at parties many, many years ago. Some in the 1800's, and I wondered what good a watch was if they couldn't see it. Corinne already had her bag full and we were wearing the same kind of pants. Heavy blue work pants with ducks on the inside of the waistband. The waist was all stretched out on Corrine's because instead of keeping her hands in her pockets she hooked her thumbs over the waist of the pants. We got something big. She didn't have any more room to carry it so I offered to carry it in my bag. Cloth that had been folded up. In the barn yard, Bob was saying he wanted someone to make a film before they bulldozed the place. I said I would but what I wanted to film was him and it would not be nice. He had peed in the dirt under the trough of the barn yard and you could see the line wet in the dirt. I was given an office on the 4th floor of the church. I was the new chaplain for 1 year. The choir was singing. Little boys were spitting off the roof and I filled my mouth with toothpaste foam and went and spit back and we were all laughing and spitting at each other."
"189"	"(11/20/1999)"	"I was sitting up in a tree with Dora, trying to figure out what my name was. We were thinking and thinking and we couldn't come up with anything. Dora said if we left soon we could see the monkeys pick bananas while they were still little. An elephant was bamming against the tree trunk. This steady rhythm was putting me to sleep. Dora said, ""My mother says at least when the mean boys are down there doing gang whistles and throwing sticks we know we're not alone."" If we were dying and we were alone nobody would know and it would be sadder. I was folding up a piece of paper and sticking it under my leotard. There were no drugs in it but I knew the way to fold it. It was about time to go to college. It was a long drive and we were running out of money. Dora said a couple of girls were looking ethereal, like angels, they thought because they'd lost too much weight and they couldn't think straight. First we had to drop off other people. I was last. I needed socks. When someone gave me $20 back I had $21.44 but the bill at the shoe store was $76.44 and I couldn't figure out why. I didn't even need any shoes. I needed socks. It was a shoe store. ??? had been given a choice in ???. The red plastic brown trash bag was filling and the chimney at all crazy angles like it'd been in a bad storm at sea. They asked Michael what he had to say about the house they'd given him and he said it doesn't believed it would be in the neighborhood. I also picked out 8 hairclips I didn't even like. They had stupid butterflies of them. They ran the bill up too high. I wanted some knee socks. Knee socks. I wanted white or black but they only had tan."
"190"	"(11/21/1999)"	"There was a long line at the SSI Office. We had to wait in line. Then the fat lady printed out files on each person. While we were waiting I went out to the parking lot. A man was in the car sleeping. When I went back the files had been spit out of a computer. White paper with blue writing. They were all connected--leaflet style but accordion folds between people. I looked at mine. It had the first whole section of the 3rd grade South Caroline history book. It started with the road sign, ""You are now entering historical Laurens."" It had information about the run. The lady at the desk said, ""This is the longest file I've ever seen."" I thought I would get in trouble for looking, but I only looked up mine. It was almost 5:00 on Friday. The lady was not back. I went back on Saturday and the line was out the door."
"191"	"(11/23/1999)"	"We were meeting to go on a camping trip. It was 11:14 at night. Evelyn was asleep when I called her and woke her up but I told her she could go back to sleep once we got going and sleep till we got there. It was the mountains and my father had made sandwiches for the trip. Peanut butter and jelly or peanut butter and cheese. I peeled the American cheese off, for it to be plain peanut butter. These were cut in triangle halves. PBJ's were cut in rectangular halves. WE sat in the boat at night rocking in the water. Then I was in a walk up that came out in an alley like down on Mercer Street long ago. I was with a tour group. They started singing the Mr. Rogers song, but I was the only one who knew all the words. I spotted a wad of cash and I put my foot on it to keep the wind from blowing it away. Next to it was a black plastic bag--thick plastic. It was a bag of loose money. 1's, 5's, 10's. I picked up the bag and joined back in to the Mr. Rogers song. We went back up to the hotel apartment and I had already made a mess. Clothes were everywhere. On the bed post were 2 long old old cut-up t-shirts that had belonged to a very old couple, very much in love, who had to leave quickly. They were long t-shirts faded white, thick cotton with the sleeves cut out. The man's had a neckerchief of faded navy blue, same material as t-shirt and I took them from the bed post. By now the money in the bag had turned into granola bars and peanut brittle. Grandma punched holes in a can of milk to mix with coffee."
"192"	"(11/24/1999)"	"At the meth clinic they were building 200. The real animals were falling off the school lunch. Not a bus you remember. And in the fall I met who's not coming and they cut ??? There were firemen hoisting themselves uphill on a pulley. 4 firemen. One was a woman. They had a bucket of water each and one had a plant waterer. They were waiting for the 5th fireman, a woman who would not use the usual route. Just then a very fat black woman dressed in Sunday clothes cut loose in a wagon pulled by 4 black horses, sleek and strong. They would not go up the hill toward the firemen but down the hill and crazy curve to the right and stop. They did this twice from the same starting point--where the uphill horizontal pulley started. The 3rd time she had passengers riding--a rich preacher she'd met on a Caribbean cruise and someone else. The horse went crazy and kept going right toward the picnickers down where the hill leveled off. I watched to see them hop up out of the way. It was funny but they were scared and she was screaming apologies. Finally the crowd, some in bulldozers and high machinery, circled around the worn out horses closing them in with the angry crowd and closing off my view. I'd been sitting outside the doorway, trying to catch some sun between the shadows and a man kept offering to let me use the headphones from his car generator to save my batteries. I went in the car with him and others --he offered me tapes to listen to too but I told him I had my own. We were going fast around a curve when my door flew open. He was yelling, ""Shut the door!"" An 18-wheeler got close up on his tail--inches close--because he slowed down too much. It was crazy for him to worry. When we got there I had a waitress job at a dark coffee shop that looked like a bar. After not-too-long a fellow worker started talking cult-talk to me and I realized they were trying to get me. I had tables to wait. A guy had asked about bagels and I said, ""What's spread out all over the counter, that's what we've got,"" and offered him the tasting bagel to try. He said he'd have whole wheat toast, no butter just jelly, cut diagonally. I tried to cut it but the knife ripped it instead and there was nothing to do but toast the bread, torn into 3 pieces and explain. When it came time to get paid, the cult woman gave me $50 in Confederate money. I put up a fuss about it and said ""I need money."" She said it was probably worth a lot more but I turned it over and the price tag on each bill said 40 cents. She was in charge of the weekly office cult. That was the name in big letters on their church. Weekly Office. I started screaming about their no-good lying cult and walked off with Theo who'd asked me about some towels sewn together. Evelyn came by and we went to a thrift store where 3 blue jean jackets hung on backs of chairs. One had names in ball point pen--boys names across the back. One had a black sharpie drawing of a boy in a hood with rhinestone studs at his elbows. One had pockets in a weird place. Evelyn found a bright aqua teal blue coat she liked. I had to lifeguard. Mary was covered up to her head in the sand and she got up effortlessly as the sand fell away. I got a phone call that Ed McMahon was casting a movie in my home town. I walked to the Long Island watershed district and looked over the high wooden fence that ended. A patrolman said he couldn't arrest me for looking at the fence, but if I touched it to try to get over he would arrest me right then. I touched it and found a foothold to start climbing when he left. The only path I had not tried was one that looked not like trying--that it lead us nowhere--a footpath. The others were car roads. There was long since trampled grass and a shell from boiled peanuts with one peanut left inside."
"193"	"(11/25/1999)"	"The new chef was a preacher too. He was gay. When they asked him to say the blessing he said, ""Dear God, Please let me get to know the guy next to me, as a friend."" People opened their eyes and shut them back and wanted for him to say a meaningful prayer. The silence was thick. People kept their eyes closed except to peek. Finally, when nobody would move, he added in desperation, ""I said as friends."" A girl threw a school lunch tray with straws in white paper wrappers at him. Straws were everywhere. It was the 15th floor. A man was on the highway overpass cutting chain link fences with a chainsaw. It was dangerous work, he said. A passage way ??? overpass ???"
"194"	"(11/26/1999)"	"I was with a stranger who was trying to convince me and everybody else she had the best sunglasses. She didn't have them with her so she would break into cars and try them on and say, ""See these? Mine are like this but better."" It started raining. I was making a collage with elements of the periodic table. It looked very much like the periodic table but helter skelter. The traffic cop pulled away and all my elements in different type weights and different industrial colors blew all over. I couldn't find some. There was a boat tied to a cement dam. I sat in the boat and rocked it in the water. It felt good. I lost the boat and was pulling myself, arm over arm, by the rope back to the dam but then there was a current swinging me in a huge counter-clockwise circle. The current was stronger than me. Rudy and Lisa were relaxing near a pool. Rudy was in the pool and walking back to the Isle of Palms-ish hotel. I started, hesitated, then Lisa came out and waved. I had a playground (grocery store) ball. I kicked it and asked Rudy to go get it. He was in the water. He said, ""If you wanna be on the Oprah Winfrey show, you go get it."" Oprah W. was doing a show about lovely city pools. We left the ball. Then Rudy went to practice swimming against the current in the lake. Troy and another guy were practicing too. I was picking up green beans from the dam and taking them to the front porch. When I went back 2 were all wet and flattened out. I asked the guy in the passenger side where my beans were and he said he'd been using them for band-aids on his ankles. Rudy and his swimming buddies were eating rice from stainless steel bowls. Eating from bowls the other one held. It made a little circle. One said, ""We don't like to look like we work for a living."" On the ramp a futzy girl in a huff brushed me aside and I said I'm not taking the boat anyway and started dancing like a leprechaun, singing. She imitated me and I started singing the Violent Femmes. ""Just last night I had forgotten of just how sick I had gotten and just how sick I had become.........."" She didn't know this. A guy chimed in and she flirted with him and they went away together. 2 snakes were kissing in the shallow end and a baby snake bit my toe. Alan said, ""These 2 computers are bubbling--bubbling! Let me take a look."
"195"	"(11/27/1999)"	"""Caligula,"" I whispered to my mother through the crack in the bathroom door. I could near her peeing so I had a little time to run. She had told me, according to her will, that for my past wrongs I had to go to jail and then live in a group home and do all the shopping and housework and I said, ""Then I get nothing. Take me out of it. I don't want your money. You can't tell me what to do."" Her lip started quivering and I couldn't tell if she was hurt, furious or just insane. I thought, very briefly, about going on to jail to shut her up but the thought of living in a group home with grown women I had nothing in common with was unbearable. I wanted a soda. I went to 3 delis--one had dry cleaning all over instead of groceries. Cans of 'easy-off' were in the refrigerator cases. The next deli I went in was filled with ladies clothes on racks. People moved too slow, fingering the fabric in sweaters. I went to the church and slept sound through the sermon. Then they played a very stupid movie that we joked about for days afterward. Marianna was on Houston St. telling me about space 468. Stephen was trying to get closer and closer. Then Marianna was now Eileen and Eileen was holding necklaces very gently and telling what chakras they signified. Dora was behind me. I looked back at her. Eileen was in front. I looked at her and her handful of necklaces--gathered from people. She'd talk about the special qualities of the necklace and then return it to the person. They hung without tangles. There were piles of leaves in the living room. Stacked up against the walls--in the way of the door. John Kaufman had splashed red, green, white, black and pink paint all over himself--over a skin toned body suit. When I'd first hugged him in church I didn't even notice it but later he pointed it out."
"196"	"(11/28/1999)"	"We had gone out to celebrate in Little Italy at a restaurant started many years ago by the mafia. A sign at an old old hotel next to it said Tamiami Trail and this was comforting to me. A lady ??? said it's an old Indian path all the way from Maine to Florida. She was talking about the abandoned building down the street and her frustration buying the building. I said, ""Where does Zeno live? ??? I grew up with him. I saw him at the 7-11 last time I went home. He looks awful. She acted like she didn't hear me. She was in love with him. The waiter brought food. We were reading stories. Eileen was in the special seat and she was looking at the kid's book I did in art school. There were not enough chairs at the table. I got more for 2 fraternal twins. There were leftovers that looked better than the food but I was too chicken to ask him to leave it on the table. Shrimp, crabs were left over and they were waking up in the kitchen, wiggling around. I threw one on the floor to teach him a lesson. His claw broke off. I tore some of the sweet flesh to share with Dora but her mouth was full of cookies. The class was reading stories. Eileen had an empty brown paper bag. She would tell a story and 3 little baby mice would appear where the empty bag was. When I blinked they turned to 3 baby chicks. The phone was ringing on the table. A guy from NYU played the 'sound pitch,' which was a tuning thing for musicians to check and see if they're in tune. ""It was very simple,"" he said, ""Yeah, I play for the philharmonic. (the sound pitch.) He spent all his time writing songs about squirrels."
"197"	"(11/29/1999)"	"A city guy had been learning to chop wood and needed lots of practice. He started on chopping lumber strips. Then boards. Then thin, thin logs without bark. Sawdust was ground into the ice and I was laying a fire with the wood scraps and newspapers in the center of the ice for when we got cold and needed to warm up. The ice broke and part of me knew if I stepped frontward even more ice would break and everyone would drown in hypothermia water. The safest thing was to let the ice break and my father swam under the ice like an otter (seal) and I wasn't afraid to let him know I needed help. Then he was cold and I wasn't and we did the backstroke down Chestnut Street and it felt like I was skating. We were going to ride horses and needed to get a halter and I realized I needed a construction vest to work the halter. I found one I liked too. They were different shades of yellow . ??? Pre-washable, a horse harness."
"198"	"(11/30/1999)"	"There was a hill. People with guns were hunting people and wild turkeys. Children with guns could hunt people too. Fishing was OK for non-people hunters and I had a rod and reel and the bait kept getting took. The guy in the tiger suit had taken the head off (of his tiger suit). He said, ""This lake wasn't here this morning. It probably doesn't have fish."" ""Oh you have to stock 'em, don't you."" He said, ""Yeah."" I said I could catch fish at my grandpa's and bring them here, but the water had already drained out (of the new lake). Cats were there. Lots of gray cats. Kitty's ancestors. Cuddles' descendents. I looked at their eyes but none of them were her. (my kitty) One cat had glasses. Black glasses. A boy had leukemia for 8 years and stayed 8 years old an extra 8 years so really he was 16. A guy on top of the hill said, ""What kind of MS does your mom have?"" and I said, ""The 2nd kind I think."" And he said he didn't think I was right."
"199"	"(12/04/1999)"	"We were in a place that had to be Cleveland. In front of a brick project like building was a swimming pool with lots of chairs around it. From a far distance I thought it was a zoo and monkeys grooming each other. But I got closer and there were no monkeys just people. They were all doing each other's hair. I'd never seen this race of people before. There were all one. I walked further and it was a Bleffel family gathering in a room and at picnic tables. A lady I didn't know wanted me to draw her picture. I didn't want to. I told her I could write her name on a piece of paper. She told me her name but she wanted a picture too. People were making a mess. A guy fell asleep and let a lit cigarette roll across a beat-up vinyl couch with foam rubber sticking through. I handed it back to him. A guy yelled his name and my name and went to hug me. He was laying on the bed. First he wasn't him. Then I could see he was my cousin John just waking up from a nap and I hugged him. A clean-up crew came by with a clean-up poster offering to clean for $5. I thought there must be some mistake. That at least they left a ""1"" out. Then the family was off to 6-Flags to get the special deal before daylight. We rode the roller coaster backwards through water that was coming off the roofs. Then in the bathroom my mother said she saw a man's arm without the man in the front doorway. I got separated from everybody. They had cars. I had roller blades. I didn't know if they'd left buy it was 6:23 a.m. by now (it was 6:03 on the roller coaster) and now it was broad daylight. I skated down the interstate farther and farther. I passed exit ramps. Then I realized I was alone and that they were probably waiting at the gate till the park opened regular at 8 or 9 a.m. I knew that the further I went the further I'd have to go back. I kept going. I was later at a hotel room. Debbie was there. I had a small bed. She had a water bed. Little by little the room got messier and messier. Fruit rolled all over the floor. I found a xerox paper box. Inside under my bed, Debbie had put 2 open packages of sliced rye bread, the front pieces all clawed and mangled. Behind that was a bag of Thomases English Muffins, all soft and squishy. 4 of the 6 were there. I was watching a cartoon I'd never seen before and making the color and resolution change by hitting buttons on the remote."
"200"	"(12/05/1999)"	"A girl from China was closing the windows. Eileen kept opening the windows. It was somebody's birthday. We didn't know whose but Eileen had baked a cake. There was a ramp. There were rules--you had to worry a lot about the rules till you crossed the ramp and you could see from the other side it really didn't make any difference in price and what you could carry. There was an old house that was made into new apartments without doors. I was supposed to be moving there but I didn't understand where one apartment ended and another began. It was not a loft. Out front was a big old oak tree with low branches and a table had been built around the tree, in a big square, with room for people to sit in chairs between the tree and the table. Lots of apples were stacked up on the table in a pyramid. They were green apples and huge--about the size of soccer balls. Alicia was there with her girlfriend whose name was Rex. I kept walking in at the wrong time when they were getting all touchy feely private with each other. Rex told me, ""Why don't you just draw a rope and I'll hang myself."" Guys at the table around the tree were laughing and talking. Seven African children were naked, playing in the mud. Covered in mud. This was in appreciation to their mother. They sat at the table all around her. I was looking for a box to prop my head up on. A wood block. On the sidewalk people were confused. A huge crowd dispersed. I didn't know if it had ever been there or not. I was up the street talking--listening to a lady whose mind was somewhere else."
"201"	"(12/06/1999)"	"On Christmas Day Nanny and Grandfather told me to run to the store and get something for dinner. I went to Chinatown. Things were open and busy. They were teaching cooking classes in the meat department; cooking swordfish. A pig that had been killed and bled lay on the counter dying--you could see in his eyes (that) he hurt. And the lady who had owned him and killed him stood talking to him, trying to soothe him as he lay dying. I went to the other refrigerated room. I picked up a chicken. It was $3.03. Another one was $3.05. It was $1.79/lb. I was trying to find one for less than $2.00. I knew they did not want to cook anyway so I left without getting anything. Walking up Mott St. someone said, ""Miss, you dropped a bill."" And it was money. I folded it up and put it in my pocket, only to find out later it was counterfeit. The edges turned pale blue and blue grew into nearly half the bill and the ink disappeared. I went into the grocery store and an alarm went off. Screens at every checkout read ""CODE 207M."" Then a guy came to see why the alarms went off and he said, ""Oh, it's because you're really an A65."" I was in the freight elevator with Bryan Hunt and he said, ""You fell asleep on the couch 4 years ago for 5 hours and when I woke up you were gone. The bed at the foot of the bed and you were gone."" I said, ""I don't remember that."" And he said, ""I'll ask you again tomorrow."" And I said, ""I won't remember it then either."" We were flying in an airplane over Columbia. Rudy spotted a beautiful house next to the zoo and the river and the highway. We parachuted out and across from the house we landed in a bunch of scrappy twisted up vines and late fall underbrush with clearing in between. I said, ""This is what I like."" My father held up 5 strands of barbed wire fence, some new, some old and rusted, for us to roll under. I got barb wired stuck in my face and the doctors did not know anymore how to pull out barbed wire from the skin."
"202"	"(12/07/1999)"	"In the darkroom we mixed chemicals in empty soda bottles with the labels taken off. The developer looked just like ruby red grapefruit juice. Mark was pouring it out into shot glasses and taking a swig and then dumping a shot glass full into the developer tray for good measure. There were so many kinds of juice at the store it got confusing and you had to look real close. I was looking for orange pineapple. It had mango and lemon juice in extra. There were 4 kinds of juice in bright orange cartons and boxes of cheap store brand and ice tea powder mix in canisters stacked too high to reach. The cheap ice tea mix was $1.99 each. The price was confusing for the orange juices, mostly $4.99 but one was $2.99 but it was too high to reach."
"203"	"(12/08/1999)"	"Evelyn had crazy long sleeve shirt cuffs. We were in a room. She had been editing since 3 p.m. It was now late. I had been getting in the way at a restaurant they were building in the basement and a guy saved me the keys on a necklace that had been broken but had an extra clip in the broken space. I lost my money in the drawer. Zeb came by the construction-in-progress restaurant was now serving. ??? morse code, waiters, and construction workers were running into each other frantically. I got nervous ???. I made sounds in my throat and laughed to make up for not being able to talk. Rudy called and asked me to pick up some grape pull taffy. I asked the lady at the candy store for a Kraft pull taffy. She gets it while I touch M&M's with my fingers, individual M&M's. Yellow peanut M&M's. My favorite is a lumpy one. She comes back with a gift basket wrapped in cellophane with 4 bottles of squeeze taffy and lots of other stuff. I tell her I cannot pay for this. It is not what I want. She gets mad. I had too much to carry. I knew the basket would get heavier with time. Rudy says in case of WWIII we should go live on the roof tops where the gas wouldn't get us. 5 teenagers ??? fraternities and sororities. I wanted to ask ??? Words stuck in my throat. Zeb had come and gone but I saw him outside the restaurant. Evelyn had just left for the train and Zeb looked at pictures of John Harrelson. He asked about Dora. I was crying. Old streets of NY along the wharf had been renovated with cobblestones. Very rich married couples who came to dress as drag queens were staying in cottages along the wharf. One was undressing frantically, throwing clothes everywhere, slinging clothes, ranting and raving, ??? watched the show. It was hideous, with ???. A guy was cutting squares off his shirt. There was a prison with square windows in the cell doors chest high. The windows were there because the prisoners had nipple rings and liked to show them off. There is hair all over their stomachs. There was an art show. The work was terrible. The art that won first prize was a big seahorse sculpture, big feathers, fake plumes of blue and aqua went down and down. 2 flips."
"204"	"(12/09/1999)"	"There was a tree house. There were 2 stores on ???. 2 sets of 2 people each shared each tree house. The tree houses looked out over the snow. One had a better view. Me and Corrine shared the tree house without the good view. There were puppet shows in the tree house and Jasmine was teaching 2 classes on how to make puppets. ??? There was snow in the real, but projected, scenery and the branch started breaking. I grabbed onto the branch I was standing on, very high, with brick walls. Fall. I was assigned the ??? ??? was prettier on the thought there were, Merri!"" When I climbed up on Annie passed by and climbed up the tree and held on but I was standing up on the edge. She went away to hide. We were in art school, and they were having a picnic. We had to bring something, and I brought a very little strawberry shortcake. Corrine brought a huge strawberry shortcake. Someone brought a pumpkin pie that was runny. Corrine's cake tasted good, but I just tasted one bite. The cakes were just alike except for size and shape. The art school had a big sign, 3 feet deep and 20 feet long, that said, NO STUDENTS KILLED BY CARS THAT RAN OFF THE HIGHWAY. The next time I looked it said: ""SEVEN STUDENTS KILLED BY CARS THAT RAN OFF THE HIGHWAY, Please have parties on campus."
"205"	"(12/11/1999)"	"There was a high cliff that lead to a long cave underneath. A lady said, ""Look, roses."" But I was in a hurry to get there and not sure if they'd let me in. Regulations were stiff. You had to be perfect. I know I wasn't perfect but that I had made some progress. I lined up. And older lady, a stranger who was sometimes my mother, was saying who got to go down the waterfall. I wanted to go down with no hands all the way. When I finally got to the bottom it was time to down the falls again. It was fun sliding down, but a long walk back up and so very steep. I carried some sheet music with me. 12 sheets with exercises and scripts. I went past the cliff and to the overpass. Too many cars were there. I had to get some ice and there were small 8 oz old containers with the ice all frozen together. A few have three ice cubes and six ice cubes and are melting, a few, and the lady at the counter said, ""Here, why don't you take this?"" and it was 2 huge trash can lids, beige plastic; put together and filled with ice. I didn't know how to carry it. There was a dance--and a play being rehearsed behind a wall. Empty chairs were lined up but nobody could see anything. People were sitting on the bed--4 people. Dora was trying to talk to Marion Woodman. The dance was in a circle and also divided into 2 sections. One was full. The other was space. Dora was sitting with a cereal box upside down over her head--a kind of kids' cereal that doesn't exist anymore. She had eye holes cut out. To see. I was dancing, sometimes in rhythm, sometimes not. They played the B-52's J(song) Rock Lobster and the dance floor was filled with rocking chairs. I didn't rock I danced slower to the slow-down part till I curled up on the floor. We were at the grocery store, me and Dora and Meredith, and we were looking for on-sale desserts. Most were the cheap yucky kind. We wanted to get something for my father, but I had a feeling it was for us too. Cakes went around on a vertical turntable. Some had pictures--one had a carousel but messed it up with stupid Cindarella-ish stuff. Some were green. I was holding 2 very small almost deformed tomatoes in my hand. At the dance Jo Anne Brownlee asked me to tell her what happened to Dora. I went back into the dance to get Dora to help me tell her. Then I went outside and sat in a chair and waited. Jo Anne asked me some things about my father and said, ""Isn't he just such a good person?"" and I said, ""But when good is too good it's bad."""
"206"	"(12/13/1999)"	"I went to a Army/Navy surplus store. I was buying a pair of gloves. They were suppose to have been my father's but the man at the desk wrote the sizes with a blue ball point pen on the inside wrist of the gloves. my father's hands were bigger than mine, so these were not the actual gloves he wore. The man still had my father's information in the notebook. I couldn't remember if my father had been in the army, navy or marines. I told the man I'd like to get a whole army outfit, just like my father's, in my size and he said it'd cost me about $40,000. I went to a pep rally and a girl was doing an offensive cheer. I thought it would hurt people's feelings. She was spelling out something that started with a ""B."" Then I heard a beautiful sonata from a composer whose name started with ""H."" Zeb had walked to Coney Island and the man with him was fat and strange. Awake. 3 days after, he was amazed by Zeb."
"207"	"(12/14/1999)"	"My clothes were all bunched up under my sleeves. Clothes kept coming off and then the bag of groceries was on the floor and tomatoes were in a milk carton--a plastic see-through milk carton and half a loaf of bread and other stuff. Useless junk I didn't need or want. 3 pineapples were in the bag. These I did want. Fresh pineapples. We were in a fancy restaurant. My shorts were under my blue jeans. There was a dinner. My clothes kept floating off. There were Brussels sprouts and most people didn't like them. A girl was collecting, salvaging Brussels sprouts. At the deli, Rosy Lucille stabbed in the back. I asked for a quarter for my 2 dimes and 5 pennies but Macy's knew for used ??? I didn't know if I had already run the NY marathon. Rudy said, ""don't forget about your run."" I tried to call Lisa, but I reached Paula. Paula heard Lisa's voice on the recording."
"208"	"(12/16/1999)"	"We were at the beach. I went for a walk with 2 strangers--a guy and a woman. The guy had recently discovered a work habit of Schumann. Movies were playing at the north end of the beach. Playing in the water--scenes projected of houses became real. The girl started whining. Children needed time to learn. We were walking in the shallow, shallow water coming up around out ankles when the girl she understood. The girl threatened and needed to know and told her, ""I don't care if you go live in that purple house and never came back."" It was over. The waves kept lapping up on ???"
"209"	"(12/17/1999)"	"We were at Grandma's. In the front room. I had been very very busy and tired. I had hung one art show and taken down another and instead of resting, My mother wanted me to go to church. I paused to rest on the way under the railroad tracks at the creek. Railroad ties were stacked up under there. A strange lady wanted to clean them up but I said, ""Don't, they're holding up the bridge."" Then we went to Grandmas, me and my mother and Rudy. My mother finally said ??? we have to go to church. People were there and strangers. Grandma was there. It was the front room. I was tired. A guy I didn't know, divorced with 2 children, told me, ""Why don't you get a beer from the window sill?"" and I pulled back the curtains and saw beer bottles and glasses of orange juice. Grandma had put them there for people who wanted beer. I took some beer and forgot where I put it. I was tired. I wanted to leave and go to sleep. Rudy didn't go to church. ??? a dark skinned lady who was lying told Dora she needed groceries for her baby and Dora believed her. I don't. I was mad that Dora helped her instead of taking me home to rest. They took the car and went away. I was looking for a specific type face on the computer to weave a story about 2 women, 3 men. I typed the letters and the letters turned into their clothes. It said Happy Birthday ___________.??? A famous artist, woman in a magazine, had a photograph in a magazine of an old pink chair painted pale pink. She had a picture of a penis only painted pale blue. She was about 100 years old. Only the penis, not the man, was in the picture. Dora was not back yet. When they came back, they had just gotten back from the Office Depot, changed cars and drove all the way to Greenville and I wanted to go home. Then the lady was stealing a burlap bag of vegetables with maggots, flies from Grandma's porch. An old old man from India was leafing through a scroll of writing--and knowing exactly where. Then the scroll became his robe. The knowledge from his robe became a book in 2 volumes, each about 10 inches thick. Miss Pat was Keith. Hank Finley was with Keith. I went to hug Hank. I didn't have a bra on. He said oh this is what he missed; he'd been divorced 15 years. Me and Dora and Rudy got in the car and we stopped to roller skate and the lady said, ""Couples only,"" and I was on the ramp. I said, ""I can't go down the ramp?"" And she said, ""No."" I took one skate off. Children with hardly any hair were milling around. The hair they did have was scarlet red and very silky and straight. Some were pale blonde--but hardly any hair. It caught the sun."
"210"	"(12/18/1999)"	"""What every scientist dreams of--cannibal microbes!"" was in all the headlines and newscasts. A woman scientist had been doing research and the next generation of bacteria in the petri dish--little baby microbes--were red cannibal microbes and they attacked the mother bacteria and ate her up. Then they became little black beetles, allowed to roam free in the Duane Reade. The lights were turned off in the store for the beetles, which didn't like strong light, and people were given flashlights to look at them walking up boxes. (product boxes) I was with Elena. African tribes were bathing in the canal. Some sort of religious ritual. Elena said, ""You sure have gotten fat."" And I said, ""After I got off the meth I gained some weight."" She said, well, that's good and bad. We had to get the N train shuttle which went from Queens, and a car had dropped Harper off to soon, because she said 9th Avenue was OK, and the car dropped her off at 9th Avenue in Queens. She was complaining. I walked down a shortcut from Ave B, through a construction site, to Avenue A, only to walk right into a new store/studio space that was full of artists. One side of the room had a table with tons of boxes of Dunkin Donuts stacked on it. A girl I didn't know named Colleen was having the party, and was glad I was there. The people's art was terrible, but they thought they were good artists. I didn't show mine because I didn't respect their work. A fake guru from India, a very thin old man with white hair was serving the meal. He didn't take vegetables, only meat, and 3 pieces of chicken, and 2 pieces of some other kind of non-red meat. The girl didn't want me to leave, but I had a plane to catch. I was in the plane and it stopped over in Richmond, Virginia, which was just half a block from South Carolina, the street I grew up on, so I asked the pilot if I could get out instead of flying on to NY and transferring planes and going back to South Carolina. He said it'd be OK, but not to tell his boss. He drove down the highway under an interstate ramp and let me off. Dora was there waiting for me at a restaurant table. My glasses were broken right across the middle, and the lens was cracked in half too. I tried to screw the little wire pin into the front and it came back out and curled all over the place. I tried to glue them but they fell apart. Then we were in a boat, and I tried to put in my contact lenses. One was big, the size of a soccer ball, and looked like a globe. (the world). I couldn't get it in my eye. The next one was clear, but hard like glass, and I couldn't get it in either. I was looking for blue Popsicles, but they were out, so I told a stranger that red were almost as good."
"211"	"(12/19/1999)"	"There was a big concert. The band was other worldly but sometimes was Bowie. At lesser times it was the Rolling Stones and rarely Pink Floyd. I danced. Danced like crazy to ""Hang on to Yourself."" I had 2 pony tails on the sides of my head like handlebars. They were bouncing. I was dancing between rooms. The walls were thick, thick marble. Big and open. Between 3 rooms were 3 big wide open doorways. You could stand in the doorways until it was OK for you to go into the next room. I was in the middle room. Doorway to the front room. It was smaller, but still big and airy--thick marble. There were chairs in rows. Empty chairs. I was dancing. There was an old iron fold out tray with blue paint and sharp sculpture tools inside. Stephen had been acting crazy and I needed to keep the sharp objects away from him. My father had got an elephant. He also got a new young colt because Scooter died. He was living in a trailer and had a story telling class there. 4 people were there. Me, my father, a girl and a boy. Girl--about 20 and Spanish. Guy--about 25. black. He read his story and kept going faster and faster. He was saying things a pro football player said, talking tough and arrogant, then finished with words to Rappers Delight.......hip, hop, hibbidibihoppi and hip hip hoppin, etc. My father and the girl said it was real good, but I said, ""I couldn't hear you. I couldn't understand you. What you say matters to me more than what a pro football player says and words to a song. I was feeling brave to give my opinion after being in Eileen's class, but his feelings were hurt. I went in the kitchen and there was a mouse-person scampering on the floor. I thought, ""Oh no, someone's been sleeping with the hamster."" And there was a big ear with dog feet. I said, ""What's wrong with that dog? He's deformed."" And my father said, ""He feels bad because he's black. He looks how he feels."" I thought that was rude of my father to say in front of the black guy, but really it was deep and empathetic. my father had a cheap internet print-out of tricks to train your horse. But I thought my father was better off following his own feelings than a so-called expert stranger. I walked down the stairs and through a crowded restaurant. I had been laying out in the sun and lost my top and I as looking for my flip flops. I walked with my arms folded across my chest and hoped nobody would notice. A natural disaster happened in the sea near Switzerland or Sweden. Due to the energy in the air--lightning--the energy of the waves. To avert mass destruction a group of people had climbed up on each other's shoulders and let the lightning electricity strike them, flow through them and into the water. One woman died--because she didn't believe she was strong enough to make it. She didn't believe. Her husband carried her across the beach by the legs--stiff as a mannequin. She had on lavender sweat pants. Then I had to go to the hospital--Beth Israel--to see somebody I didn't know who. I walked up 7 flights of stairs and didn't find them. One the way out I found Dora in a group of people and she said wait for her while she went into the Duane Reade. She came out with 3 giant candy bars and I wondered why. When we went out the metal detector she gave on to Ricky Shell who was the bully. I told her I'd go get one to replace it. He had taken her favorite. But she was giving them all away anyway. I was suppose to be going to Dr. Stastny. I kept walking with Dora and I didn't know where he was."
"212"	"(12/20/1999)"	"""Why don't you serve the ball over here. Serve it at the person you like when they go by,"" the girl leader said when we were walking around the gym in single file. The newspaper covered the event. There were 4 pictures. All patterns. 2 were: (drawing of 2 of the patterns) The girl didn't know the story was about her until she saw the patterns."
"213"	"(12/21/1999)"	"There was an old TV show with America's sweethearts. Paul Lynn and Mary Wynn. They now both lived in my building and were old and crazy and sat at a table talking about the good old days. I made a sculpture out of kitchen sponges and wrote on it: I can't do things neat. There was a contest to build a chair with paper mache and a little table attached. I had been working on the computer till I wore it out. The 7, 8, 9 and 0 keys had broken off and there were just little pipe stems. I got indents in my fingers from punching so hard. There was a 3 hour TV show--a cartoon with a real movie too about a band called the God haters. It was a life story about a man dressed in black who was a dancer and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. The tall tall guy had a vest on and over his stomach was printed--healing. He had on black sweat pants."
"214"	"(12/21/1999)"	"There were 3 deep sea fishing boats. The boats were different. One huge, huge boat, as big as an aircraft carrier. They were fishing for different kinds of fish, but big fish. Big strong fish that could pull the boat. Barracuda and other fast fish. my father was fishing for sword fish. That's what I wanted to fish for. It was pulling the boat. There was a man overboard. Flailing his arms and screaming. my father jumped in and swam to save him. We were printing in the darkroom late at night. Corrine wanted to print some secret words. She didn't have a negative. I told her it was possible to cut the words out with a razor blade. I had done it before. Some bigger letters. Some very small and intricate. She loved it and wanted to silk screened them yellow. Industrial yellow. She could cut her letters out and silk screen the photograph yellow. I handed her some razor blades--single-edge with cardboard covers (over the blade) in her hand. f u m t it. g d o. and this was a poem about the girls mother and it was so funny we read it twice. I went outside downstairs to have a cigarette. In the lobby guards were smoking inside because it was night and OK as long as nobody found out. I went outside."
"215"	"(12/22/1999)"	"There was a prisoner. He was locked in a room sort of in a basement, but not quite--a separate room--a pod at the high school. He was going to be released the next day. I could hear him over the intercom crying. He wanted to talk, so I said OK, come talk and he left the locked room. Before daylight I walked along down the hall I saw 2 women security guards looking at his cell. They were dragging the bottom of a drainage pit, with pipes. An iron gate was over it, to see if he had hung himself. I was walking in a mall and went in a store, when I thought it was a thrift store. An attempted too-sexy girl with red/white flowered, split-legged pants languished on the counter in a pin-up position with her middle-aged boss in a suit. The clothes were cheap and over-priced. I looked and left. At another store me and Evelyn were looking at bras. One was too big. It was green. Stretchy lace. The others were bright primary shades of cotton. 2 colors each (blue/red, red/yellow, blue/yellow) Rudy was in a swim meet, up on the starting block. I was cheering him on. The gun went off. The others dived in and Rudy stood ready. I pushed him in. I didn't realize it wasn't time for him to swim yet. I made him get a false start. After this happened a few times, he gave me a black waterproof time watch to wear on my arm. It was a watch too. I was sitting in the creek. My legs were bruised with some lacerations. I was trying to push a pill through my skin to heal. It was where my mother had hit me. My mother got a camera to take a picture of it. The picture showed one of my hands on my leg. But she insisted it was a boys hand on my leg and screamed. She said she'd only caught both hands on the film she'd know who it was. I knew she would not believe me, so I didn't try to explain. We were in a cavernous big auditorium, on the way to high school elections. There were 3 guys running. None of them were from our school. One of them was sitting on the floor voting for himself repeatedly. One was handing out bookmarks. One was drawing pictures of himself. People were forgetting to vote."
"216"	"(12/23/1999)"	"I reached underneath the piano--behind the music stand--above the strings, under the wood. People had stuffed trash there. Candy in baggies, used Kleenex, paper towels. I kept grabbing handfuls and always there was more. I was moving from 2 places. Grandmas and the log cabin. I had cleaned out from under the bed and nailed up what was in a closet--a board over it so it looked like wall. I said to Rudy, ""Don't let me forget to take down that wall."" Rudy went to take a shower and his hair was sparkly blonde like Marianna's. It was luxurious in the shampoo bubbles. My father brought a fellow over. I was wearing my overalls backwards because I put them on that way to see how it worked and then I didn't have time to change them. I was packing to move. The police were at the door. my father came and told me he brought this fella over and told him he could make a special milk shake drink. my father handed me the milk shake cup and ice cream. I had to stop cleaning. The police were knocking. My mother surprised us all by shouting from a hidden bathroom. She was taking a bath. We didn't know she was there. It was time for breakfast, she said. It was french toast. Stacks of it. Rudy put a piece (of French toast) in the sink and watched water run over it. My mother put 1-1/2 on my plate. Rudy got as many as he wanted. There were 30--40 pieces of french toast on a platter. One waffle square. And a 3rd tray of waffle-ish french toast. The man was still waiting for his ice cream. The police were still there. The ice cream man had a picture of a shadow of a wolf. He kept saying, ""You can see the wolf but you can't see his eyes."" Rudy and me looked at the picture and it could just as easy be a bunny. my father said the man needed to hook up his computer to see his e-mail. There was an electrical outlet in the closet, but I tried to explain to my father it needed a phone line too. There was a tray of plants. A man was asking me for Valium. I told him I didn't take that stuff anymore. The plants were dancing. Flowering, budding and growing leaves in comparative unison. They could see. They were facing each other."
"217"	"(12/24/1999)"	"I was in Spectra. I was looking for 11"" x 14"" and 8"" x 10"" plastic sheets. And contact sheet plastics. I needed some sharpies and a phone machine tape and some make-up and the Asian girl I'd met at class put them on the counter. I taped the pens to my knuckles. She brought 3 packs of contact sheet covers and I told her I only needed one pack, and the 8"" x 10"", 11"" x 14"" plastics. Finally I got them exchanged and sat at the bar stool there smoking over the counter. I had a bunch of rose thorns (no flowers) and wadded up used tape to my left, sitting on the bar stool. The thorns were poking into the plastic so I squished the sticky tape till it stuck underneath he counter and I stuck the thorns to the tape. Jasmine had a huge picture of puppies. It was B/W beautiful with the little black dogs in the center. It was for the front page. She used a filter that would make them pop more, the girl who brought me the stuff only charged me $5.84, I just didn't say anything about the other stuff, because she'd skated out on her break. A man's dead mother, Maxine, called. I talked to her son, who was alive, and annoying, and I told him I was on a borrowed cell phone in a store and I had to stop talking because the batteries might go dead. It was costing her money, this talk."
"218"	"(12/24/1999)"	"I was in a grocery store wondering if I could make chicken soup. I wondered if you bought a whole chicken and dumped it in a pot of boiling water and let it boil all day and soup happened. It was delicious soup. Then I was wondering if I could put it in old peanut butter jars and little thermoses and have a little each day of the week. I thought I would spend one day cooking a week, but I never did. I was waiting outside with 3 strangers. 2 guys and one girl. It was a shopping mall museum with art hung real close together. They were taking pictures. One guy wanted his picture taken in front of a painting with lots of green. I said, ""This is green."" A lady asked me did I remember knowing any of the painters and I said one. One contemporary painter, buy you wouldn't be interested in that. I couldn't remember his name. Corinne was wearing blue jeans. She was saying they were old and her favorites. She said there were creases worn into the legs where she'd squat down and lean against the wall of her high school parking lot, smoking cigarettes. She said it was so good to smoke in wrinkled blue jeans. She liked to breathe the smoke in deep. Jasmine was having her evening class party in Ft. Lauderdale. 598 miles away. Alex and I were discussing John Tong, and the guy who makes lists. Elena was looking for her denim skirt. She had a fever. It was hanging on the bathroom door knob."
"219"	"(12/25/1999)"	"There was a house in the country out in the sticks. Me and William both won a weekend at this special program house for gifted and talented students. Couches, beds, alarm clocks, dreams, newspapers. Things were everywhere, but OH so sparsely. We would discuss. Thoughts would merge. Conversation that thrilled and challenged your mind. I was drawing my dreams, on the newspaper of the day I dreamed it, and they were making good sense. William was watching it all. Nick slept on a couch and set the alarm to go off every hour, but it would ring every 30 minutes. I'd write my dreams within the ramp, crossing the bridge, convinced. William opened doors. Fine artists began becoming more conceptual. Conceptual artists were starting to paint. William had gone around his hairline with a very, very thick magic marker, black, to get some painters thinking. But then they (the painters) shaved his head. It was all stubbly like a baby chicken's head. He went to talk to the lady in charge (about the program, not about his hair). A young woman, black, had asked him to help her understand her dreams. I left to go to the bathroom. My aunts had come to see what this gifted/talented program I was in, near their land, was. They were obnoxious and loud. In the bathroom I had (hid) my face behind a painting. Then I locked myself in the bathroom. They finally, FINALLY left and I looked out the screen and my mother spotted me and they all started back in. I said, ""Please, My mother, just DON'T."" Inside, away from the family terrors, William was working with the girl. She was pacing. William told her dreams are only able to communicate through images and surface tension. She said she was gonna go think about that for a week. Dancers were balancing. (Touching the railing with only their toes, every other dancer in the line had both feet touching. In between those were dancers with only one foot touching. The were balancing in mid-air. Looking like elegant divers about to enter the water in a graceful back dive. The ones with one toe touching had the other foot bent at the knee, toes pointed, angled back toward the head. Girl dancers. The lady said we could keep the house free till after Christmas. 8 weeks. And she could get $150. per winter for each person. I still didn't know which category I belonged in, the thinkers or the painters. Mostly I'd been talking about my dreams and drawing pictures of them with a black magic marker on sheets of the day's newspaper, dreamed then, The NY Times. Little kitty was with me there--finding secret trap doors behind walls that only kitties could fit. I could keep her there too. Zeb was there. When the first guy left we were chasing him and sticking his head in the mud puddle, playing. Zeb stuck his whole head in the mud puddle too."
"220"	"(12/25/1999)"	"Me and Dora were playing tennis. Doubles. Dora was serving. I was at the net. We talked strategy. Dora told me something to do. Drop back and take the backhand side. The stadium was packed for a big baseball game. On a diamond. Then there were 3 small games going on. On long narrow rectangular fields with one batter each. A huge 50 ft. hippo escaped from the zoo. It was huge. At least 50 feet. It was big enough to crash through the stadium and onto the baseball field. They caught it and were going to put it in a swimming pool to keep cool. They pulled and pushed, but he pool was too shallow but it was all they could do. Then a bigger monster escaped and came toward the baseball field. They thought it came to see how the game was going. Just then, a strong, heavy woman from a church softball team came up to bat and the outfield moved back against the wall. ""This woman could hit. Her hair was loose. Long. Blonde. (dyed, roots growing in) A small little upscale coffee/sandwich shop opened on Gregg St. I was working there. Bryan Hunt came in and ordered a muffin in a T-shape with mustard spread evenly on top. I was just smacking it on top, the mustard. The other boy who worked there, he was about 13, he showed me how to do it. He said you just go slow and take your time. This is how Bryan Hunt liked it. Bryan said, ""Why'd you open a shop in this bad neighborhood?"" And I said, ""It's Clark and Division, isn't it? It stays busy."" And he said, ""It's not Clark and Division."" And I said it looks like Clinton St. but Chicago and he said, ""Yeah."" Cops'll come in here asking for something and they won't wanna pay. They'll try to force you into the bathroom and deposit their sperm in you and Ackerman will get it all on film. Then I was at the high school. They were in the auditorium in orange, mad-flowered suits, re-using sentences from a health food company giving away free samples of yogurt. Very small containers. I took 3--vanilla, chocolate, cherry. I went in the math room. I kept walking in circles, and every time the students in the desks were getting older. 10 circles, 10 years. I was telling Nick the woman gym teacher/coach was in a scam marriage. He didn't know. I told him the story. The woman coach was a lesbian. The man was gay. So they just got married and both kept being gay, but the town people didn't bother them, because they knew they were married and this made everything all right."
"221"	"(12/26/1999)"	"The waves were big. Strange boats of cardboard with tube-ular collapsible legs were for the ocean. These boats were stored in the dirt closets. They were about 2.5 X 4 feet. They were dragged behind people and to the vegetable market. Kayaks were for the water slide shoot and would usually turn upside down about 3 feet from the starting line. The younger kids in college or just out asked me why couldn't I talk like I wrote and why couldn't I write poetry that looked like my art. I said I'd been doing that (art) longer. A girl told me coins was her thing. Old coins in paper bags or loose. She sent me messages with one coin each. One said, ""Follow a bridge till it washes out."" It would take 10 hours and I was excited to see what I found there. The girl was ??? (Little mice attached themselves to the cats' hair and turned into plastic monkey toys. I tried to get them off the cats, but then there were just too many that would replace them.)"
"222"	"(01/01/2000)"	"There was an open space with tables. Very low tables close to the floor. About a foot high. People were traveling back and forth the long distance in between tables. We were sitting on the floor, swaying to the music. A guy who seemed very happy left to go jump out the window. Rudy heard he was going to jump and went to talk to him. But there was a high fence all around the playground with rusty razor wire on top. We looked up and the top was caged in with criss-cross razor wire. I told Rudy, ""I don't think I'll try to climb the fence here."" A guy ripped up the fence from the bottom high enough to crawl through. He stood with his fists clenched like superman. my father was sitting in the car waiting for us but the car kept moving to different parking lots. Dora was sitting on top of a grassy hill with me. She had brought us gifts and disappeared. 5 gifts. 4 or 5. More than 3, less than 6. For me and her she had little see-through bags of make up we didn't need any more. Brand new, expensive make-up. We didn't need to open them, but I held them, knowing one was hers, one was mine. There was a little girl. She asked me to teach her to roller skate but we only had galoshes, rain boots and no shoes. We put our feet inside the rain boots. The boy who had seemed so happy had jumped out the window. The authorities were looking for Wes. They reported that he had sent messages filled with profanity--both intentional and intelligible. Spoken messages. They were mad because Wes said the Christ Child was no more than a toy in the attic. There was a knock off toy store that sold cheap imitations of kid cereal. There was an imitation of Cap'N Crunch called ""Crunch Something,"" but I was looking for the real Cap'N Crunch. The fake one had a price tag that said $1.29. There was real Kelloggs Raisin Bran. It cost over $4.00. I looked behind the bottom aisles--trying to find Cap'N Crunch and found some toys. The ones on the left were useless. Cheap plastic toys. But there were arrows with Batman and Robbin on front. There was an expensive black rubber pencil holder with Batman and Robbin on it."
"223"	"(01/02/2000)"	"I was suppose to visit Valerie's mother at 8:30 a.m. I called Rudy at 8:30 and he was at work instead of going with me like we'd planned. Rich had the ??? so I called Mrs. Snyder ??? On the way me and Dora were going to the grocery store or clothes store. Grocery stores had sprung up everywhere. I asked Dora how a town this size could support so many grocery stores. There were too many people in the grocery store so we went to the clothes store. She was picking out cat food for kitty, but I told her kitty wouldn't eat Friskies. She liked grape jelly better. But the grape jelly (1 quart) was runny and almost empty so we didn't get anything. Valerie's mother was getting nervous, and taking out art books. Learn how to draw books. The salad--I accidentally dumped it upside down in the fridge and there was white dressing and I tried to scrape it out with a spoon. Sitting down on the floor were girls to make paper dresses and paper underwear. I was getting ready to leave. Valerie had just gotten off drugs and my mother kept reminding Mrs. Snyder of the date. That it hadn't been that long. Valerie's dad was laying on the floor and I told him, ""Yoga is a good thing."" He said, ""Yeah. It is."" My father had a xerox copy of a story I'd written at age 9. The handwriting was neat. He had legal paper too. Uncle Nat and my mother had been collaborating on a business scheme. The code numbers said so. My mother said the patrolman didn't have my phone number and was trying to call me. I was helping some little kids get ready for church. But instead we were playing. I was throwing them acorns and was showing them what a pineapple was. We split the pineapple and were ripping the flesh out with our hands--tasting it when I realized we were already one hour too late for church. Their father came to get them. He was black. They were different nationalities. He came to get them when we were playing mid-stream and took them in up in the balcony. In the back of the balcony were portable toilets, but the door was fake wood to look like the church. Ladies in the choir were singing awful and I decided to go the bathroom to not listen. A guy opened the door and I stood up. Later I went to Elena's. She was asleep and would not wake up."
"224"	"(01/04/2000)"	"I was in a lot of rooms. Basement rooms. It was art school and there were parties and art going on. I did a few lines of coke with a girl on the floor. She had a whole lot of coke in a clear plastic round cylinder, the size of a film canister but bigger circumference. We left there. They wanted me to see some other artists' work at this school I had gotten a scholarship to. People would introduce themselves and give me their credit cards. I had a stack in my pocket. They were Dora's friends. A boy who'd just gotten his credit card that day wrote his number in red ink on the card and gave it to me. I found a girl under a table with more coke and did a little. She had pills too and a red glitter drug I'd never done before. A girl bought me a beautiful night gown of mesh white lace, purple and blue. She said she'd already called the doctor. That I was sick. I did not want to go to bed. So I left and went to a part of the art school. It was where new students hung out. People from my art school were there. Lessie Fitchet, Rich Godfrey, Annette Guilliano, Lisa Hack. I smiled, they smiled like no days in between. I mixed 3 drink glasses. Soda, soda with orange juice, and soda with OJ and liquor. I went to wait for Dora at a basketball court. A girl's mother was blindfolded, handcuffed and hung--dangling. I was teaching the little girl to paint. We were painting on a big white t-shirt. Azaela flowers. White and pink and fuchsia. She painted so thick the white paint glopped off and splatted to the ground. I said, ""That's OK. It's just like bird plop and birds are always doing that near flowers. It looks just right."" Then a little boy, 12 years old, was lead across the stage. They injected him before he knew it and he became calm. Then they electrocuted him--currents of 2000 degrees till he was burning hot and turned to a small lead statue. His hands were handcuffed behind his back. His hair was dark and shoulder length. His clothes were dark dark blue and black. I touched him. He was burning hot. They put him on a shelf to cool off. When he cooled off he would go back to normal size (the statue was about 12"" tall) but his hands were still handcuffed and the handcuffs were double locked with a hardware store vice-grip saw lock that he would have to go ask them to cut off at the hardware store and then try to get the handcuffs off. He was accused of questionable behavior."
"225"	"(01/07/2000)"	"I was up in the tree house drawing on a J.D. Salinger book. I climbed down from the tree house. I got news that Tom Brandon was coming, so I went back up to the tree house and started researching books. There was the darkroom and so many activities to report on. Nick was not saying anything. He was waiting. Wrestling on the floor. Rolling around with some person who wasn't there. Tom and Nick and Wes were all ??? book ??? things are............ I was waiting in the tree house for William. I was trying to read a book but I was too excited to concentrate. It was Halloween and William was bringing two masks. Every year I was Frankenstein. I painted a big red gash on my forehead under the mask. You could not see it through the real gash on the mask. I had to leave and come back and in that time William had brought 2 masks. One was the usual Frankenstein. And one was a clown mask with crazy possessed eyes and kinky hair. I saw the clown and for the first time in years I wanted to be something other than Frankenstein. Usually I slicked my hair back and pinned it under a skull cap, but I thought I could pick it out with an afro pick into a frizz ball fro and wore big old polka dotted pants. A girl came up to the tree house to ask me to help her slick her hair back. She had black hair. I don't know what she wanted to be. I needed small bobby pins but all I could find was needles. I left and was riding a horse near Mount Gallagher church. It started raining. I ran into 2 fellows who said it was time to switch horses so we did. This new horse had no saddle. I had to ride bare back without a halter or stirrups. It was a beautiful horse. Smaller than a quarter horse, much larger than a pony. Dark brown--dark chocolate like. It felt good to ride him bare back. Marianna was waiting to do William's costume. I had followed with tracing paper. They had sugar cookies. William was tasting a big one. One was crumbled and bitten. ??? party. Harvey had gotten married to a woman named Ava who was young and not a U.S. citizen. She was pretty if she'd keep her mouth still. She constantly moved her lips around in every contortion lips can make--scrunching them up, wiggling them, puckering them. It was worse when she ate. She started eating a big plate of spaghetti with that mouth of hers going like crazy and I had to leave."
"226"	"(01/08/2000)"	"Dora was back. But she was very fat. I knew she wouldn't stay that way. Her butt was huge. Then she was gone and I was going to see her. I was trying to look nice but the make up I put on came out in red racing stripes over my eyes. We were going to hear the best band in the world in Charleston. I asked at the door is it free and I could hear outside the door anyway. It was not free. I left. ??? leftover framework. I was working on the assembly line of a factory. One toy came through. There were no other toys. It was a toy (small machine gun sized squirt gun filled with Gatorade. The original Gatorade. Yellowish green. It was made of see-through milkfish plastic, white. You could see the Gatorade. It was the last one. I had to get it for Rudy. I knew he would like it."
"227"	"(01/09/2000)"	"I was in Chinatown. The weather was bad. It was cold. We were waiting. People were milling around outside. Most were down on their luck. It started to snow very hard. The wind was blowing. I started to walk. A guy in an army coat started to walk with me. We were not talking. We had our hands deep in our coat pockets and our shoulders hunched up in our collars, heads down, walking into the wind. We got to the first hill on Chestnut Street, in front of the Arnold's house. This is where he got off. I kept walking. I was very early or very late for basketball practice. The locker room was empty. Guys in football uniforms were sitting on the floor in the gym lobby where tickets are sold. I was sent to a group home for wayward girls. We were going on a visit to visit the maximum security group home for extra-troubled wayward girls. They were sitting all over the place on platforms and stairs, complaining that they wouldn't let them cook because of the fires they'd started. They were looking for more trouble. It was pointless to try to make conversation so I went to sit at an old piano on a platform amidst the movie theatre (auditorium) seats and began to play to myself. I hadn't noticed until I started playing that some of the keys were broken. I tried to play anyway but it sounded awful. 2 do-gooders--one man, one woman, walked down the center ramp aisle with crazy eyes--drugged on their own sense of self-importance and feeling so good about themselves in a tranquil way when really they were patronizing and condescending and had no idea what was going on. The man recorded my music and was so glad he got a wayward girl on tape and I told them the piano didn't even work. I know we'd never see these 2 again and he only wanted things to appear like they were going good. The lady shot a B/W film strip and it was in a little plastic canister. She was going to show it but I knew it had not been processed anyway. I left before she showed it. I was wearing my most favorite shirts to play in a tree, but then the red shirt bunched up too much over my 2 green shirts and bag so I took it off. It was time to leave the 46 St. No-cooking beach house for extra-troubled wayward girls. Jasmine was going over some letter spacing with me. She found 3 places in a title I'd kerned that she thought were not perfect."
"228"	"(01/10/2000)"	"There was one day to go back to Cuba. I wasn't (going), but Americans mostly came back alive. In the huge sand-covered arena mothers were crying. Their children were tortured and killed and you could never tell when your number was up. I went back to USA and my friend from Cuba had to go. She borrowed my car to get there and was worried about how the girl's mother packed her lunch. Since chances were she wouldn't come back, we were worried about finding her--or finding the car floating in the river. Bad things were happening. ??? My friend made it back from the torture with her hair dyed blonde and she was looking extra perky. She looked so American. You would never guess her for one of them. I was working in advertising. That very day I was going in to Cliff Freeman's group. And one guy was extra flashy. He was telling me to lock doors and go back and check them. The Cuban girl got back just in time for the train ride. Doctor Allen was sick and he was in a hotel so he could get some rest . He wanted me to reserve a room for Mrs. Allen so she could rest, but that was OK cause Mrs. Allen didn't feel like looking after him. On the train we took the last 2 seats. We went right by an amusement park and I later we could see it in the distance--on the horizon over a mountain. Pieces of paper were on the floor at angles. They were soaking with paint, green paint. We were in a speed boat. Rudy was holding a fishing line in his hand, no pole or rod and reel, and we were slicing through the waves. He kept latching on to a tiny baby fish. This is what he wanted."
"229"	"(01/11/2000)"	"It was New Year's Eve. I had talked to a nice man on the phone. His hair was gray. He gave me his son's phone number to call him. It was New Year's Eve. So many people were in Times Square you couldn't even move. I kept going out to see how the crowd dispersed and dwindled shortly after midnight. People moved refreshments to a card table in the basement. I had forgotten to call the man's son. I saw him in the basement. He was sad, overweight with blond hair and an overall dejected look. Not just about New Year's Eve, about life. We went to the darkroom. Jasmine was trying to straighten out the darkroom. Downtown Lee had out razor blades and push pins and change all in his canister and Jasmine had spread the junk out on the counter. It filled every inch of space, the junk. I wanted Alicia to shoot it with me. She suggested 3200 speed film for the shots. We were shooting New York clubs that had existed in the past. There were rugs on an empty space--expensive and woven--more like beautiful mats. They were pretty big and cost a lot. The cheapest one I thought I could afford but I never closed the deal. I liked the back side of the rugs. They were cotton fibers on coarse burlap backing."
"230"	"(01/12/2000)"	"I could hear somebody practicing the piano. I knew it was a girl. It was intricate fingering. She was practicing the same measure over and over. There was a 50 meter swimming pool. After a while I jumped in with my clothes on to swim some laps and first I was trying to swim holding a board. It was too hard. It was like a rudder gone haywire. ??? A case worker was going to take my picture. Allison's chair was empty. The Key Food was having a big parade. A Spanish man was drinking lots of juice to advertise the fruit juices and they were filled with fruit--coconut, bananas, mango, oranges ??? trying to impress me ??? I was going back to art school in Florida. I was happy. I was still doing art and most people who were good artists had turned to other jobs. I stopped by the meth clinic to get some change I'd left there in a jar. Dimes, quarters, nickels. They were having a Christmas party but I didn't feel I belonged any more. People were waiting impatiently for their meth. I went back to pack my stuff for Florida. There were 3 rooms, each with a little couch or bed. I had a little kitten. I put milk on me and squatted down over her so she would lick me and it turned into Rudy and we were making out. We fooled around a little and stopped and turned the light on and he said, ""You started it. You aren't gonna be afraid to be in a room alone with me now, are you?"" and I said no. It was late afternoon but warm and I wanted to go to the beach. my father was gonna drive real fast to get there while I could still get some sun. Dora didn't want to go but I wanted her to go. I took a sweatshirt and a towel 'cause I knew it'd be cold afterward. Marianna had gone back to do her old job for an assignment. She was CEO of a murder investigation of an all white mafia motorcycle gang that went from NY to Hartford, Conn. The 3 suspects were scattered out and William and Mary were helping catch the bad guys. (murderers)"
"231"	"(01/13/2000)"	"I was taking a class. The teacher was a male teacher and we met in restaurants and over at his house. We were taking a different class on a different day too. We were meeting at a fancy restaurant. 2 women had sat down at a table--it was a booth (banquette"" in fancy places they call it.) The waiter was slicing their fancy fish appetizers for them when they could have cut them by themselves. I needed to get around them and I stepped on one seat, then on the table and over to the other seat to get across. One lady left the table. She was offended. I had to go see my teacher up the stairs. He had fallen asleep on the floor. I laid down next to him and fell to sleep for a little while too. He couldn't remember when the next class was. Before I woke up a girl I didn't know had sat down at the table patiently, waiting for me. She was knowing. She waited patiently. She had cooked some pasta for us for dinner. When I got back it had gotten cold. We poured it from the pan. It was half cooked. I tried to eat a bite but it wouldn't even twirl on the fork. It was stiff and stuck together--gummy on the outside, hard on the inside. The girl said it was just right for her but I said, ""I'm gonna have to cook this some more. I hope you don't mind."" Then we were going to Arizona with some homeless people--her and the teacher. I was unpacking socks from shoe boxes I'd wrapped in gray socks and throwing out the boxes. A storm was brewing. We went to Frog Creek. The water was cold, cold, cold till I got used to it. A stranger named Bob was standing in the water. Computer traffic was fastest through 32 Street. Then we were at 34 St. 34 was too crowded. Love, Merri"
"232"	"(01/14/2000)"	"I was moving. The first place I saw was OK but not great. It was sub-level. The next place was very old. I had looked at the schedule to find when I could practice piano. I had 6--11 but I knew I would not be up so I wrote 6--10. When I came back to the place I found a very, very old strange piano there. It was a couple of octaves short because they said most people didn't use those keys anyway. The keyboard was warped so it was unusual to play. (see drawing) Your hands had to reach over and down and not just flat. But to have my own piano I could get used to it. Zeb came by. I saw him on the other side of the street and I said, ""Zeb,"" quietly and he heard me and came over. He was looking for music and I gave him all mine, but then I re-shuffled and gave him Mozart only because I know they would get along."
"233"	"(01/16/2000)"	"There was a man living in the woods. He killed people with a knife and ate them. I was trying hard to make a plan with Rudy how we could get across the woods when the man wasn't too hungry and where he might not roam today. The man had papers from a city office that saved his right to kill and eat people. I tried to lead him away from Rudy's path with chicken legs. There was a little girl who had been living in a wooden box. 3 X 3 feet, for 7 years. She had been in concentration camp and slept in old classic cars since she was 7 years old. I was going to adopt her. The papers said I got $444 a month... I was sitting in a chair in the thrift shop next to the locked gallery. I found a bathing suit, all stretchy. Jasmine came to see me and phoned that class was cancelled. That we would have class Saturday morning."
"234"	"(01/17/2000)"	"Nick invited me to his wedding. He was getting married in the water like being baptized in the ocean. He was marrying a girl named Claire. Really she was 2 girls named Claire smashed into one. I was standing on a hill watching the practice run they were filming. I was confused. It looked like a baptism to me, except for the sailing crew operating a bunch of pulleys underwater. I didn't have time to go to the wedding. Alan was on a TV news talk show. They edited the interview with him so he was just saying a string of pronouns. ""I you me she you she me it."" Then it didn't seem at all like Alan. I was sitting on a table with a green background and tiny white stripes--dotted (teeny circles) like a tick tack toe board--stripes about 1/2 inch apart, maybe 1/2 and about 2"" long or 3"". I smeared the dotted stripes with my hand and made them go different directions and they were beautiful--laminated under the table top for ever and ever. An Asian girl named Malaysia was watching. She said it was beautiful. She asked how'd I do that under the lamination. I didn't know. It just happened. I had 2 sweaters hanging from the ceiling. A me-sized sweater and a kid-sized sweater."
"235"	"(01/18/2000)"	"We were at the lake--sort of like a big round fountain. People were around the outside of the lake like numbers on a clock. Dora was in a little room off to the side, watching TV with her legs crossed Indian style. She was picking up useless things one by one and dumping them in a trash can ??? then I tossed out some sour milk in a quart container I had. There was some half and half that had gone sour too. I looked at the calorie content as I tossed it away. We were waiting in a front room. I was wearing the Winnie the Pooh pants Evelyn gave me. An Asian guy with thick glasses and trendy hair was wearing Winnie the Pooh pants too. He rolled them up to show he had Dumbo the Elephant pants under those. He laughed real loud and said, ""Wardrobe provided by Michael Ackerman."" Dora drove the old blue station wagon over to Tom Haney's house. He was having band practice and there was a piano sitting out front. First I wanted to play . Then I knew I didn't have to play to show him. I knew and this was enough. So I didn't even though I had my music with me. I was wearing pants--blue jeans with paint all over them and a green shirt that said ""Fort Moultrie where the pocket would've been. I was glad I was not dressed to try to impress him. A guy with long dark hair had his head down and I said, ""Hi Pete,"" but it was not Pete at all. Me and Dora laughed that I had made a mistake and Tom was uncomfortable and he didn't know what to say. We went to Eileen's house. It was in the lower East Side. It was always Christmas there. A big white apartment, bright and airy. I was waiting for Eileen. She was getting ready behind the bedroom/bathroom door. We were talking through the door."
"236"	"(01/20/2000)"	"I made up a little song about sine and cosine, like in math, and I was working equations and singing the song. Out front there was a crowd and video cameras were watching everything and a little baby boy with blond hair just died instantly. His mother came shrieking out of nowhere and snatched up the baby and fought through the crowds like it was nothing. In the crowded store Delores was stealing batteries--one legged Delores and telling me to hush up when I kept on staring at the batteries she was putting away. We were building a loft. It was me and Rudy's space. I could see Alex through the glass. Cups were outside. People in the front were handcuffing guys to the side they were handcuffing 2 more guys. I had been eating a very small apple pie (tart). I told the police I lived there. I had to mop the water that had come through the floor. In front of the gas station I was laying in a lounge chair. Lisa was in the other chair. We were laying out topless. We were both getting sunburned. A snowball fight was going on. They were throwing snowballs at each other, packing the ice real hard like rocks before we threw. She was not a very good aim. My snowball turned into a triangle, sharp in the air and veered off--bouncing up sharply high in the air at a 90 degree angle from where it landed."
"237"	"(01/21/2000)"	"I was at Vicki Davis's family's house. They had so many pound cakes in the refrigerator you couldn't shut it. I thought there were 2 ways to get the refrigerator to close--eat some of the cake or take the pies out and re-arrange them. They fit nicely. The mother said, Aren't y'all getting tired of potatoes?"" She answered herself, ""Yes,"" while the others said, ""No."" One yes, three no's all at the same time. We were in a multi-level office. Dr. Stastny was there working away at a computer. He didn't look up. All I said, ""You hit the letters. I don't know what you did, but it worked."" He kept working and went to the other level. An older man art teacher came. Stuff was spread out all over the floor. He had linseed oil. He said, ""Brush that on there real thick, real quick, then rub hard on there with colored pencils--browns and greens. Hard lead pencils. I did and the husks of the corn cob pipe kept getting deeper and deeper and spitting out Styrofoam with sparks. Then he knocked over the linseed oil. It smelled good. There was a little blond girl playing drums like crazy. She was keeping time with her feet and playing a great drum solo. Some hip young kids came in from a road trip and told the art teacher they'd been to Texas and did he know (they listed characters from the Simpsons). The man said he thought he knew them and they laughed even harder. They were making fun. I was on the sidewalk with a blond young man much like Tom Fink. We kissed on the sidewalk, just where ??? I wondered if time would re-arrange itself differently. Eventually he went his way. I went mine. We both made each other happier for the time. We held hands on the sidewalk. I had to cut 4 X 4 or 8 X 8 matts. Me and Enrique and others were at a 2 day county fair. We were walking and thinking and in the middle a lady asked me to go trade in her lotto ticket for her. It made me mad. I took the dog with me and went through a door that was closed. I found a souvenir suitcase that said, ""European Tour, Fog."" He had tossed it out. I was going to cook weird shaped spaghetti and dye it dark green. It needed 2 days to dry."
"238"	"(01/22/2000)"	"I was working at the pool. At the deep end there was a lady I needed to save and there was a swing set. On the side next to the swing the lady got out. After I swam over to the swing set. I was shaping the letters out of metal and adjusting them with a wire I clamped shut with pliers. I got finished attaching Linda's name to the swing set. I was clamping the hooks tighter onto the letters to make sure they wouldn't fall off. There was just enough time to swim to the deep end and look at light under a microscope. I had to be finished by 12:35 at night. A girl was coming on duty then. I wondered if Dora had been swimming too. I had forgotten one thing. It was quicker to dive across the corner through the water than to get out and walk across, so that's what I did. The school was P.S. ""?"" on 67 Street West. Corinne was teaching photography for 12 weeks. First she taught 6 weeks, then we agreed she needed some time off and I'd teach for her for 3 weeks and then she'd finish the 3. I said, ""I'm gonna make those kids print good and I'll make 'em get the dust off the negatives."" Then I realized I always got dust on the negatives and then I was a real slack teacher. There was no use. A girl was very afraid of her mother. So afraid she ran away and left life-size cardboard photograph cut-outs of herself all over the backyard. 3 of them. One was in the porch swing out in the back yard with her boyfriend. The cut-out was smiling and smiling. The girl was different ages in the photos. My mother came in tearing her night gown off. She was standing in front of the window. A knock came on the door. It was something about Dora. Something terrible had happened. The lady called through the door because the wind was blowing so hard it would blow the door into pieces if I opened it. Something happened to Dora. I had to go find her. It was cold. I stopped at a roadside fruit/vegetable stand and they had watermelons grown into the shelf like ingrown toenails. The were $3.99/lb. I took a silver metal pencil sharpener out of the kids' toy box as my free gift so I'd have an extra one just in case."
"239"	"(01/23/2000)"	"We were on top of a hill that went straight up from the road and on the other side of the road houses went straight up from the edge. We were shooting bottle rockets at the windows of the houses--watching to see if they caught on fire and exploded. Most would just fizzle out in the curtains but finally on the 3rd house, which was painted pale gray-blue the bottle rocket exploded and started a fire. We could see the room glowing from the fire, and flames leaping out of the window. ??? ??? She (My mother) needed $10 and my money was coming and she was so stressed out with worry she was limp. She was leaning all over me asking for the ten dollars. She asked my father. It was then I realized, I'd forgot and I tenderly helped her across the road. I told my father I'd meet him later. O looked for surprises but ??? ??? Pale blue-gray sorta at a slant near which we skated. The hill was on a slant too, the same color. People would get used to playing on the hill. We were going to eat and the only soup they had was filled with corn chips and Styrofoam and this is not what I wanted. I went to the store and I couldn't tell the difference between lettuce and cabbage but Nick smiled as if he knew all along how to tell the difference. He suggested I call the American Dental Association and ask them."
"240"	"(01/24/2000)"	"I was looking at a stack of maps. I was shocked to find South Africa, Ireland and France adjacent. The maps folded out in accordion folds and you could piece the world together. I unfolded the United States and looked at South Carolina. It was not a map divided into counties but showing rivers, streams and lakes. All the names they'd put on the rivers were wrong and they'd put a huge lake in near the middle of the state and just called it ""Fishing Lake."" They'd put a big straight river (about an inch wide on the map which would indicate 200 miles wide. They called it ""Fishing River"" and it started from nowhere with a waterfall. But the shape of the state was right. I'd been looking for comic books anyway--not maps. The salesman was very nice but he should have been working at Barney's and not a post card shop. I needed to find a comic book for an art project. There were 2 styles. Straight and type. The moon. Auto figures. 27 kinds of type, each fraction a figure. I needed to find a comic book because I didn't know any figures good enough to make a poster of them. There was a new Superman Comic Book about a mop made into a girl. Her hair was the mop head. I didn't want to use her. Neal Crotts accumulated ??? I was on a trip straight through the marsh. I was looking for a comic book store on Charleton St. The man had told me about the Little Rascals. They were telling them to just mix with water to make it come out. Dora cried and said for 9 years she couldn't communicate with me cause I wasn't there and now I wanted to exchange thoughts all the time. I pushed her off the path. Then I felt awful. Accusations were coming from everywhere. I had to keep going and the accusations kept coming."
"241"	"(01/25/2000)"	"The little girl was pouring wine--white wine into glasses. Not too much though. The she filled it up to the very top. She wasn't coming back. It was sunny and hot and a TV ad for black hair products in humidity was being shot on the beach. The girls changed from one to another. It was hot and sunny and they were worried about me getting sunburned so they put sand on my face and told me somebody else would be coming back by. The little girl turned to go out the door. She wandered between here and the door and the door and there. Stephen Sprouse came and was sitting in a wooden chair with arms. He had on a plaid suit like a little boy--with shorts, sitting sideways when the other chairs were front to back."
"242"	"(01/26/2000)"	"I was on a family vacation in Florida. A storm was brewing. It got all quiet and still and I decided to make a run for it. I got outside, down the steps and the wind picked up again and driving wind. I hid behind some Palmetto bushes and Jay Mills was there and we watched a huge condominium sliding down the highway, like a mac truck going 100 m.p.h. After if passed we started running under a parking garage to go sit in the ocean where nothing could fall on us. I was sitting at a restaurant table counting my quarters. I had 12 quarters. 3 stacks of 4. One of the quarters was a Krusty the Clown quarter. With a bubble top. I was looking at it when a guy and a stranger sat down at the table next to me and said, ""Well, are you about ready to go?"" and I said, ""I don't even know who you are,"" and then his friend came up. They grabbed me and said, ""You're coming with us."" I tried to think quick if I'd done anything wrong. I had no drugs--nothing illegal--so I started to yell. They picked me up by the arms and feet. I struggled. At first I couldn't speak. Then I reached out to grab a customer at another table. ""I DON'T EVEN KNOW THESE GUYS,"" I screamed and finally the guys put me down. They were annoyed that I had mixed up the plan. I looked at a little piglet. I wanted to leave at that time. So I unplugged the alarm clock and threw it out in the yard. I almost hit some man with it and I apologized but it was funny so see his expression to see an alarm clock to come flying through the sky. An alarm clock, staring, ringing.??? I was carrying yellow gloves and lots of business men and women filled the bathroom. Paula ??? ....and maybe the nights too. There was free stuff. Me and Lisa got coffee and I knew better than to put packs of mustard and ketchup up in my back pocket because I'd forget and sit down on them."
"243"	"(01/27/2000)"	"We were driving down the road past churches when the girl said, ""Windows up!"" I figured this was so the town could water the trees and make the birds sing but really--it was because the black choir was singing on the steps and they (the girl yelling instructions) didn't want the sound to come through the windows. I was driving in a car with a man I didn't know to Brooklyn. I needed to take the Williamsburg Bridge but he said he wasn't gonna go over that bridge in this snowy weather. Rudy was approaching adolescence. He kept doing the wrong thing. We were shooting a pump air rifle at the moon. A B-B gun. I pumped it lots and lots of times, trying to shoot past the stars and then when my cousin came to shoot there was no pressure left, he said. Rudy was going to come in the house till he grew up. I could not find my bra. I had left it on the ground . I could see a dark spot in the grass that was probably it but I didn't feel like climbing out the window to get it. I was more interested in the music I was hearing. I said, ""Do you hear that? Do you know what that is? It's Mozart's Sonata No. 17."" It was beautiful to hear. It kept playing though there was only one page of music. I had a very, very long hat. Pockets were in it and shells were attached and water was in it and Eileen was rounding us up and I couldn't lift my hat to put it on. So I dumped out the water and took off lots of the shells and detached the useless end of the hat so I could lift it to put on my head and get on the bus. Then I decided not to wear it on my head at all, but I put it in my back pack. We were in an old, old dark room. Me and Eileen and a man. Old. Older than us. Old enough to know lots of things and forget lots of things. He opened a bag of rich smelling coffee on the counter. A little cloth bag. He scooped some coffee out with an old white plastic spoon. The coffee was rich and dark and smelled good. The old man was sad because he said his son never came to see him or talk to him. Eileen told him his son was there 2 weeks ago. Then she told him about the visit. The man did not want to remember. The visit was not how he had wanted so he would not remember it at all. They were reading a script in school desks. 3 people. The girl agent in between coaching the homeless man eating chili while he read and getting it all in his beard."
"244"	"(01/27/2000)"	"I kept walking down the stairs to the basement which had a window just at ground level. There were 2 twin beds in the basement, the window between them. Outside the window I could see chickens. 3 of them. When I got my camera the click scared them. I scared them. They started running and the shudder jammed up and I missed the shot. I was upset, it had been a wonderful shot. I could see the still photograph. I snapped again. The shudder stuck again. The rooster flapped his wings and ran and ran. It was another good shot. Then I saw the cats. 3 of them together in the sun. Yellow striped cats. The were happy in the sun lounging. To the left of them were 4 cats. Big yellow striped cats playing the was kittens play but they were grown cats. I tried to take a picture. The cats ran into the chickens. They were all running every which way. I thought of Linda and how she'd understand how much I missed the chickens. The pictures of the chickens I would have had if the camera was working. Then in the spot where the cats and chickens had been were children selling earrings they had made. They didn't know me. I wanted to love them. I loved them but I did not know them. 2 girls and a boy. The boy was an Iranian little boy who'd just lost his front teeth. He had made very intricate earrings to sell with glass beads and buttons. I said, ""Did you drill these holes yourself?"" and he said yes. ""That's a lot of work,"" I said. ""You did a good job. My name's Merri, too, so you just have to remember one name,"" I said. The other girl was Merri Lindley. She never said anything. The Iranian boy's father came up. He wanted the little boy to operate his little tiny earring stand like a hard-core NY street vendor. He) was very business like. He had a beard and the other Merri thought he was showing the first signs of Parkinson's disease. So was the little boy. She said it was genetic--there was little hope."
"245"	"(01/28/2000)"	"So many pairs of pants hanging on a rack by the side of the road down a hill on the left. Mostly blue jeans, painter pants, khakis and some nicer stuff at the bottom right end. Disguised royalty was picking out an occasional pair of pants. Not very often. I needed some pants and I found just the right ones and I put them in the back to hide them in case the rich guy wanted them. They were next to some large print fuzzy hounds tooth pants and jacket on the bottom right end. Linda said they were some designer's a few years back. She was tiny from the size of the jacket. Walking/running down West Main Street, I HAD been able to run, hop and fly (from very very long sustained hops) and it started to rain. A horse was beside me, walking toward the stop sign on Academy Street. We were in confusion. Structures were falling. A paint brush covered over the dirt with paint, a dust film anywhere were falling and ??? we'd communicating in the same room but through a phone. She ??? on the floor a few ??? from ???. Carlos came and picked it up. I was sitting next to Dora in a swing. She missed my father's eyes looking into hers, saying, ""Look at me."" Then Rudy was next to me and we were going to Dora's run. I had a broken blister but I was gonna run fast. I was riding on Dora's shoulders. Then she was a very, very old man. My mother kept taking Dora out of the grave to display once every year. She explained to people that Dora was dusty 'cause the dust built up underground. That made me mad. Dora was beautiful no matter if she was covered in dust or an old, old man. We were in a picnic line for Dora's run--me riding on the old, old man (who was Dora) his shoulders. When I got to be too much to carry, I still held onto him/her but I picked my feet up under theirs (his/hers) and helped lift their feet. The hot dogs were almost done. Many people were standing around, waiting for second helpings. I had been waiting in line. The hotdogs were almost done. I had to go first. Dora and I had gotten separated."
"246"	"(01/29/2000)"	"The city was filling up with water. We lived on the 6th floor of a loft under the Manhattan Bridge. Water was coming up fast. Water started trickling over the window sill and the waves rolled over the window, rolling waves. Our ankles were wet, then up to our knees--water was running fast. Over the chairs and desks--I looked around. The boys who cut the telephone wires were there too. I was still miffed they had cut the telephone wires and electric wires and cables. The window opened onto a wall of another building. You could climb ??? ??? wanted to. The water was getting higher and higher. I'd missed kitty. I hadn't heard her for a while. I said, ""Rudy, where's kitty?"" and he said, ""Oh no, O left her in a cage on the bench next to the door."" I reached under water and grabbed the cage. She was barely still breathing but she recovered. I ran out the door and decided if everything worked out OK, but now it was war if they retaliated. Lock it from outside. Lock in the mean boys who had cut the wires. I knew they could escape if I didn't lock it. I went back to the loft when it was back to OK. A girl, a dancer. After the rains, she was stretching out ??? stand up in the grass still wet from the rain."

We ran for cover. Because it was raining, the orchestra was not sure if they were gonna play. Too much trouble to get down the dirt road. They were still undecided. While they were deciding a few case workers strolled through and sat in chairs, occupying these chairs. While the philharmonic was deciding whether or not to come. They piped in Aerosmith and Ozzy Osborne and Black Sabbath, AC/DC. We were dancing in the balcony aisles, me and Dora. I was freer in my dance and was finding strange rhythms within the music, using my hands like rudders to a sailboat. I had taken a shower in the kitchen and the living room carpet got all wet underneath. It was someone else's turn to take a shower when the Charleston Philharmonic came to the backwoods. I went to the basement to use a computer. Alan was there. He straightened out many tangled wires that were my thoughts. He was working on a project. Trying to update a system that was archaic. He came in and announced to the staff that he had something for them. He waited till all 4 staff members came to sit around the table (after they turned their TV game show off) and dumped K's and Q's out of the bowling bag. Inside was mostly some of those pale ivory folders, some colors, he was holding in the bowling bag that was broken in just right after many years of use and a satchel that was somewhat falling apart. Alex had been working part time freelance at an ad agency. I knew something was up because of his attention span and his preoccupation. HE had lots of money. He was in and out. There was a young boy and a young girl. The boy was photographing the girl. I told her to hold the cat so she'd get some real expressions. The family was staying at the beach. When we got back, Alex was standing outside in a towel. He was hiding out. They were after him for something. I tried to get him to tell me. I could see worry in his face. He brought belongings. He told me to get all the damn animals out of there. He couldn't think. Eileen was doing a class and asked us to act out cleaning. People acted vacuuming and sweeping and scrubbing. I stood leaning against the wall. My father came in to get rid of Alex. He took a shower and stood in front of class in his towel that didn't reach all the way around. I went and told Alex he had to leave. He panicked and told me they were after him. The cops came. He disguised himself and a black man claiming to be him said wasn't I gonna kiss him good-bye after all that time we spent together. I didn't. I said goodbye. Then Alex, disguised as an old man, started running knocking things over with a gun inside a stocking cap he held in his hand."
"249"	"(02/01/2000)"	"There were a bunch of army men sitting on top of a school desk out in the open. Several different kinds of army men. Someone told me those had been Chuck's army men. Chuck's mother said Chuck used to play out in the busy highway in front of their house when he was a little boy and he caused terrible accidents. Philip Martin said he was going to kill Chuck with the very pistol Chuck had traded for the army men. But when Philip went to shoot Chuck, the shot gun shells were too old and he didn't know how to re-pack them. The school lunch room was busy. It was just before lunch. It was the most hectic time. A lady worker asked me if she could have my orange. I didn't really want to, but I gave it to her. I was riding in a car with a sunroof with Elena. I wanted to hear. I was hearing the song. It was beautiful. Debussy. Claire de Leu (La Mer) and it went on for 2 hours. I was humming. There was an aluminum barn. Chuck was bammed on the outside doors of the aluminum barn the cows were in. They were getting mad and ready to stampede. A swinging gate went across and back against the fence (180 degrees). The little boy could fit between the fence and gate but the cows were gonna be mad! I showed William Chuck's army men. He loved them. My mother had planned a Christmas dinner party. Invited me, her and 3 guys she wanted to match me up with. She said she'd picked the seating arrangements by chance--over and over till they came out how she wanted. I started telling her about Chuck's army men and she walked away."
"250"	"(02/02/2000)"	"Jasmine was in an office in front of the darkroom. She had come there long ago as an intern and began telling stories. Even about a roll of art tape. She had lots of stories to tell in one day and the other girls, at recess, crowded around to hear them. Years went by and now she had a big office and a key to it. As soon as I finished moving and cleaning my room I could go to the darkroom and print. I went ??? It was big and nice and I looked for a way to make the oblong and ??? Jasmine had to leave and looked at the new darkroom. My mother came by and was putting lady-ish touches around. I got on the train. I went to see Ziggy Stardust. The next show was at 9:30. It was ???. Nothing could be. I got dressed in the only clothes there. A plaid skirt ripped off short. 2 young girls--Lolita types--were giggling and dressed like school girls and an older man was list--giving them a ride to school. It did not matter they were late. They might not get there anyway. I walked by the church where little girls in green girl scout uniforms were lining up. Lots of them. Little ones, taller ones. There were lots of other little girls--little--4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years old. Not much older. They were sitting in the church yard around a tent, when they lined up there. Across the street. Hundreds--thousands of little girls, little, were sitting in the grass at the Presbyterian Church. More were coming. They all sat on the grass and clapped their hands fast as hummingbird wings and the dresses stayed still. You could see thousands of blurred little hands clapping, the girls cheering, there bodies still, sitting in the grass. In their spare time they sewed on patches, squares divided into triangles. I walked out a door into the snow. When I was returning to the inside of the Woolworths, a foreign family that spoke no English was coming out. The little girl, about 3-4 years old, was ancient. I accidentally bumped into her as I was coming back in. Since they didn't speak English, I didn't say anything. Then the child said to me, ""You could've said excuse me!"""
"251"	"(02/03/2000)"	"It was 10 minutes till. I was going to a dinner party. I wanted to stop and get a coffee. It was Eileen's class and dinner party. On the way I stopped at a square cinder block house. It was Christian's. I could hear him practicing the piano. I climbed on the roof (ceiling) and took an overhead photo of the piano. Now I had 2 pictures of pianos. The other was at an angle--like a shot of a car. I got to the dinner and assumed I was late, but others were coming in late too. We were splitting for cocktails. At my table were people I couldn't relate to. A boy and girl in love who only had eyes for each other. 2 women with grown children and all they did was talk about their children. A very, very tall horsey woman who didn't talk much sense was stuck with me for conversation. Her sentences were live wires--popping around (hopping around?) in crazy directions and going suddenly dead when the power went off. Snakes, black and vertical, in the air. ??? I had stopped talking. I was given 2 names to write on the black board. Lots of TOSOKO. The people next to me were trying to be polite. ??? We both wanted to hear and Dora picked some off my plate with her hands, because she had no plastic fork and because she liked to do it that way. ""Leave some for me,"" I said. It was the end of the world. Highways were empty. I took the car as far as it would go up frontage road to connect to the highway. A guy drove up the wrong way on an exit ramp and asked me directions. I was standing outside the car--looking at the road."
"252"	"(02/04/2000)"	"I was getting ready to go to a birthday party with Dora. I was trying on different shirts. She was sleeping in the hall, sitting against the wall under a light. She was past being concerned with such things as appearance. K-Mart was said to be having a sale on old Halloween masks from the 30's. The masks were wax metal, you could put them inside your mouth, bite down and the mask would grow out over your face. But when I went to buy some, and buy extras for friends and experiments, K-Mart didn't exist any more. It was as if K-Mart had never existed. I went back to get ready. A black boy with a fairly new dope habit was on our front porch. He needed a fix and was getting antsy. He started yelling at his friend. He was getting desperate. I went to take another shower in the outside shower. ""2 showers a day?"" a fellow said, who was trying to get a conversation started. ""Yep,"" I said. And that was that. I was wearing a 1950's, early 60's one piece aqua-blue bathing suit to take my shower but I wanted to be naked outside in the world. Stephen had been up at the green house, sitting inside a red car, holding $10. out the window, hoping a dope dealer would pass by. I still had to get ready. I put on a black shirt. I took it off. I was wearing a blue shirt, very high on the waist, and I put on a bra under it and an olive green shirt of Dora's over it. I could see down my shirt and it was sexy to me. Before I left school, I was helping some very small children get down the steps of the church. One little boy was not any higher that 4 inches. His leg joints and bones, one--one leg were made of wire. A dentist did the operation, and instead of attaching a foot, he attached a huge index toe to his wire bone leg. He went down 2 steps. They didn't have a teeny foot his size. Minutes to work. Gauze and overwork were everywhere. The little toe-boy's father came in and picked him up, because coming down the stairs had worn him out. I was living at Grandma's house. The case workers were coming out to make sure it's alright--clean-wise. Grandma had left it pretty OK. I didn't know how to give them directions to get there. All I could think was Grandma's house. I'd never needed more that that and didn't know how to say."
"253"	"(02/05/2000)"	"There was an organic salad to be made. There was a photograph of just how to do it, with baby red cabbages and chick peas and garlic that looked just like chick peas and artichoke hearts and celery and other stuff. We had 3 weeks to make it. It was suppose to be organic. Rudy was in charge of the project and had an insulated bag to carry the salad all over the country and to London if necessary. In California there were organic vegetables at every shop--but there was a beach and we wanted to spend our time there. When it was time to leave I couldn't pick my clothes up off the floor. I stayed at the beach house. There were security guards making the rounds. One fixed a big plate of grits and breakfast meat. I was trying to tell him we grew up on grits nearly every day. He was not listening to me. I was talking but nobody would listen. Then it was time to get back to the salad. Rudy came back and we went to Aunt Joe's and Uncle Gene's. Their house was changed into a summer camp for rock and roll kids and the other side for Christian youth. There was a sign out front that was orange. It said, ""Fishing @ 90 m.p.h."" I was confused by the sign. It seemed too fast to be fishing. Uncle Gene had painted a sign and a ""Anderson"" coat of arms on a black board with white paint. The letters were blocky like he made them with masking tape. It made me mad that he took our name for his yard. The crowd was getting bigger to make the salad. Dick was in from London. Lots of hip rock and roll kids talking with Rudy, laughing, getting lost in his stories. The Christian campers had started moving in on the other side of the house. They were--each group--trying to sing their music louder. A lady, a boy's mother from the Christian group, was next to me, working out on the weights. When she yelled, ""sliders,"" a guy with big, black army boots would slide down the pulley and kick me. I asked her what they were doing. She said if I was not gonna listen about god they were gonna beat it in to me. I was getting sunburned. Very sunburned. My hair was getting white from the sun. I was waiting."
"254"	"(02/07/2000)"	"We had been pole vaulting down a river. There were patches of sand and rocks. Sometimes you'd get your feet wet. It was cold in winter. This was the way to get downstream and across to the other side (river bank). We were going to have a picnic on the highway at a rest stop. There was a newsstand. The walkie talkies didn't work. There were no ""no picnic"" signs. We decided to live at the picnic. There was a teeny little trailer for me. Very teeny and very, very small on the inside. There were dancers, enough to make a tribe. Mess, clothes, used towels scattered around and NO BATH MATTS! So I went to the store where they had lots of bathmats. Pastel colors I didn't want. It was small and square and almost black. Then I saw the one I wanted. It was like a shammy with Velcro all around the sides. There was a history pageant. A trip back to the 1700's. People were walking across a stage. People walked across the stage--a line of them--they were not used to wearing clothes like that, and looked more like a herd of cows than people. I stuck out my feet to look at my silver slippers. They were beautiful. I went to show that I knew how people walked then--wearing all those hoop skirts and everything. The girls in the pageant were vain. With the centuries old, and dresses they wore in the latest styles. Then I went to Linda's store. A guy who was Linda's partner had hurt his back. He had called a special cab to come in the middle of the historical pageant and pick him up. The historical pageant had to start early because it was mostly old people in the audience and they were falling asleep. When I left Linda's 2 people were there. A man and a woman. I knew but didn't know. A different guy connected??? There was a man, a politician, wearing a suit standing in the ocean in his shoes. Waves came over and he would run. Campaign promises he wrote in the sand and the waves wiped them away. The politician laughed like crazy people. I had to go to an address in Chicago. 330 something north side. A strange cab stopped. There are not yellow cabs in Chicago. I was working on something and when I looked up we were on the inter-state--an abandoned parking lot outside the south side of Chicago. The cab stopped there. I had been putting make-up on in the car. Now he was going to rape me and kill me and I knew this. When we passed a sign that said ""69th St. South, I tried to jump out of the car. He locked the doors. I honked on the horn--reaching over and fighting and hoping another car would help. College kids packed in a car looked and sped away laughing. I started praying out loud and saying Bible verses, because I'd heard this sometimes diverted killers. Some of the words I got wrong. So I knew he'd know I wasn't really a dedicated Christian. A girl called Rudy from Chicago. He remembered 2 cab services that he suggested she try. Metro Cab and Mary Alice C"
"255"	"(02/09/2000)"	"There was something going on. Criminals had escaped, 100 or 150 of them and they were traveling in pairs. There was a front little porch room--but bedroom because a bed was on the porch, that had screws and a screen door. You could see outside and outside could see in. There was no light on the porch so I screwed a light bulb in a cylinder that came from the wall -- so my father would have a light next to the bed to read from. There was no lock on the door but my father was not scared. When I was staying there, the criminals were on the loose. When I was screwing a latch onto the door, the 2 criminals came to the door. They asked if they could come in and rest. They were very nice and quiet, so I said OK. I told them I was just on my way out and asked should I go by the police station and tell the cops they were there. They said, ""No, that's OK."" And they sat on the bed against the wall waiting. Alan came by and brought me some Xeroxed sheets of music but some of the music was absent. Just empty spaces across the page. Music and nothing. I had taken a present to Raymond. Alan was sitting in the only ??? I was on Prince Street with Rudy. Topless sunbathing with Lisa. I didn't go with Lisa. I stayed where it was raining waiting for the rain to end. I could see the shacks--a lot of roadside stands. I tried to make instant soup but it clumped up. The case worker said if a cup was missing it meant someone had escaped from prison and ??? A train set and all the rush hours were different. A favorite ""Little Rascals"" episode was on. ??? I was scared of my mother. I wasn't looking where I was going and I ran off the road down the hill. Down and down and down to where there were strangers. She said sweetly, ""She's alright."" The strangers they were tall. A very tall, slender, ebony beautiful girl. Another girl had already punctured her with a huge hook, but not on her. The guy was wrestling with a steer that was trying to poke holes in him. They were fighting it out, the 2 tall, tall dark women were gonna fight it out. ??? She said she knocked that bitch out in 5 seconds. After it was over she was telling me reminiscent stories about her home town and fading (her head was falling, her voice dropping off). Her boyfriend was carrying 2 sets of works in full view. He said she needs a fix. I was afraid they were giving me a shot. The needles were used and sort of yellow. I started walking away and it took so much effort I walked with my body leaning at a 45 degree angle. My feet were weighted down and heavy. I was walking away, leaning into the frontward direction."
"256"	"(02/10/2000)"	"I went inside a very old Chinese temple. I thought it was ancient. Beautiful old scrolls were across the wall and plants--ivy--and art and an Oriental girl walked silently. Silence. Holy silence filled the air. I thought I would talk to her to find things out. She was standing in front of a book. I thought it was full of ancient, age-old Chinese knowledge, and she could translate for me and tell me about the art. But when I got closer I saw that it was a Catholic prayer book. It started with ""Hail Mary,"" and she said it would cost me $10 for her to explain it. I didn't care a flip about Catholics, but I didn't want to look cheap, so I told her I didn't have money with me, so I'd just look around. She went into the kitchen to talk with her mother, who was making soup. I started looking around at the Chinese art that was thousands of years older than any Catholic stuff. I knocked a mop over and it caught fire and the mop landed on a scroll and I picked up the mop to beat the fire out and hit it against the carpet which was a very, very old Oriental rug. It caught fire too. Finally I got them both put out, the mop fire and carpet. There were big mop-size burn marks on the scrolls above my head. I was trying to make them go away when the plants got in my way and started breaking off when I touched them. The front of the temple had been clean, sparse and holy. There was a little front room to the temple. It was a little closed-in front porch. Me and the Chinese boy went to have a picnic on the floor of the front room. A little dog was tied to the chair. The couches and chairs were covered with old cloth and rags. Very dirty. The floor was covered with old clothes, walked upon for many years. The place was very dirty. You walked back through the door and it was the holy temple. You walked out the other door and it was dangerous traffic flying by that would hit the screen door if you opened it too wide. I went to look for Paula in her church. She wasn't there so I laid down on the floor to take a nap. I went to peaceful sleep. I woke up and saw art on the walls. A guys work I didn't think was any good titled ""Christmas on Halloween."" It was paintings of motorcycles in the sun. Harvey's work is between 2, and his paintings on the left, 4 on the right. I said, ""I used to sleep in an empty room this size when nobody was here."" We were out in a park like a farm. An overweight army guy who liked to ride motorcycles was trying to find his future wife. He tried to dance with Christine but the chemistry was not there. She brought him to me and I thought, ""He wanted to marry her, now 5 minutes later he wants to marry me. He just wants to marry somebody. Anybody will do and I am not anybody."" I went down the hill and he followed me and asked me to go on a motorcycle trip to Texas with him. He said you had to dig holes in the ground to get drinking water. I said, ""Why don't you just go to peoples' houses and knock on the door and ask if you can use their hose pipe. He said, ""Camping is not like that."" I said, ""Well that's what I'd do if I was thirsty."" I went to take another nap, but Harvey came to wake me up with a question. There were more questions. A kind of question game had started up at the counter at the diner. They wanted me to play but I didn't. I had 6 notebooks of Dora's to sort through. Lots of papers and writing and psychology papers. Even the cloth belt stuck in the notebook was precious. I didn't want to throw anything away. I wanted to save every piece of paper from her studies. I unfolded everything. I opened a folded newspaper, thinking it was a psychology article, but it was a whole page, a drawing with thick strong lines of a little girl ballerina--drop out white on dark, dark gray."
"257"	"(02/11/2000)"	"There was a drawer full of old detective novels. They'd had thick paper book jackets with nice type designed in the 40's or 50's. Dramatic titles and war ravaged, truth seeking heroes--always misunderstood and usually in the military or at least the CIA. Me and Mary had stayed over at Marianna's. It was now very late Saturday morning and we were getting up. There was a fire escape in the center of the building--where the chimney used to be and girls from other apartments were just starting to get up with towels and sit on fire escapes. Marianna met me at the door with one dollar bills. An artist was doing an installation and signing his name with mashed potatoes. He also needed a big pile of mashed potatoes to write his name in the mashed potatoes the way you'd write your name in the sand. But not mashed potatoes spread flat and thin like sand--a mound of mashed potatoes, lumpy as a landscape, and there was one baked potato on the table. I was going to Key Food to get some mashed potato mix with the right texture (Marianna's words). On the way I stopped at a NBA basketball game. I was sitting on the floor beneath (behind) the backboard with my kitty and while I was watching the game she ate the baked potato. The basketball went out of bounds to kitty and she clawed the basketball open and started eating it too. I went back empty handed but Key Food was open 24 hours. This artist was also gonna carve his name into pears. Marianna asked me to go to the library and get some pears. The library was late opening and the staff was hung over. Sure enough, a chef was at a table cutting up pears and putting them in plastic bags. I told him I needed some whole pears--but they all had cut marks in them. Some were beautiful green pears with warm spots of red. A guy on the train was trying to get to Williams St. and another guy gave him wrong directions. I pointed to a stop in Wall Street we called ""Williams St."" I told him to take the F train. Blue or orange. There were empty plastic bags on the very top floor. The elevators went up and down. There was a girl I was talking to at a diner counter. She asked for steamed lettuce and chicken sandwich. I was wearing a black slip. She said she was a painter. I asked her about her art. She said Velcro in playgrounds. I thought of the little girl drawing but her art was Velcro escalators. A couple had a one week old baby in a white dress. The guy was wearing the baby's bonnet on his head. He handed the baby to his friend with one hand. The baby's head was wobbling. He didn't seem to care. His girlfriend had just had the baby I guessed. He left her, walked away down an escalator. I rubbed her stomach gently--it was sore. Her nipples were sewed--tied with black surgical thread and I wondered why--if it had something to do with childbirth. When I got home there was a secret message, with the new address rubbed out and the name rubbed out--the only legible parts were clown school reunion and the town which was foreign in Europe. I called right away--with the door wide open, sitting on the floor when I realized Zeb had been sitting--perched on the back of the couch with his chin in his hand--his elbows propped on his knees--all along."
"258"	"(02/12/2000)"	"I had a job working at a restaurant. There were 3 of us. It was getting to be summer time so we had to crank up the ice cream machine. It was a big machine with gears to make it run. You had to pull out the trays, fill them with dirt and plant little seeds inside. The growing plants would give the ice cream machine power to run. There was a box of chemicals I wasn't sure if it was fertilizer or poison. The guy told me to shovel it into the trash can and it would disintegrate the trash. The customers had finished dinner and ordered ice cream. They told me what they wanted. I couldn't remember. We didn't have that many flavors anyway. Then you had to fill a paper cup to put in the metal slot and it worked like a water wheel or windmill. When one was frozen you had to take it out and fill the spot to keep the balance. Then the shift was over we had to do prep work for the next day. Since it was ice cream season, the snakes were sleeping. Hibernating in a box. A bunch of them all in the box together. A lump of snakes. Still and breathing just barely. We had to pick out a mat to frame a picture of flowers. They were saying ""Match the art? Match the art and I believed in only matting in black or white but I didn't want to jump in because they were so frantic. I watched an old back and white TV show. We were on the way to dinner. W had been on a ship traveling. Rudy was on the upper deck. There were some dolphins swimming right next to the ship. Jumping in a circle--one after another, like a backwards water wheel. Then I called Rudy to look at the dolphins. He didn't hear me so the dolphins jumped onto the boat and turned into penguins. They tried to go up the ladder to see Rudy, but they couldn't maneuver the rungs with their flippers. They were trying. We were walking with the picture framed. A lady was taking apart the frame and mat and art and back all to be carried separately- ""What are you doing?"" I yelled and I put the frame back together. Jasmine was now disappointed in the green-beige mat and went to paint it white. I was learning to skateboard. While I was waiting I learned skateboard tricks. Doing OK too. The older man was trying to set himself up with me--pair off, but I just concentrated more on skateboard and playing Evelyn's guitar. Dora was going to get a haircut. To the place she always went. Since we were still on Mott St. I decided to go to Wendy's and get a salad. The college girls working there wore bathing suit tops. They had all been laying out topless and their breasts were very sunburned. They took off their tops at the counter. I asked for a salad and the girl was not paying attention and she put it in a paper soda cup. I asked for a glass of water and it tasted like toothpaste and I asked for another cup. A teeny baby toothbrush was attached to the lid of the cup."

Fancy food was there and people from my home town. 4 high school-age girls inside there said it all made her so nervous she had to go to the studio and do her carpentry project for 2 whole days. She drew/painted rows of little animals on long boards-they looked like paint blotches till she cut them out and pieced them together. They were beautiful. I went outside to have a cigarette and walked over slushy snow pile ups on the side of the road. We opened the door and there was snow/ice all in the car and around the driver. We asked him for a cigarette and he gave us one and he asked us to come on--he had to get the car started. He had been sleeping there. I held the back door opened and pushed. I was not going to ride in the car. He said he was going to Nice. (France) Dora had lived there, so I wanted to go see. Back at the house ??? Inverted bell-shaped glasses could fit inside each other. The answering machine tape had been pulled out and was tangled up and old. It was pointless to try. A guy had a boyfriend cat for little kitty. He was a huge. He wanted kitty in a sexual way. She got scared and ran away. I had been watching ??? There were 2 middle-Eastern boys sharing a hotel room. They lived there. I didn't want to because I knew they were after me I don't know why. I was suppose to take a cat to the airport. A girl and her dog and her friend who was a boy ???. Jasmine's sister, in her bedroom, was little medium size cage of drawers that was gold-ish yellow. I said it's so beautiful, you think you're seeing a cat. We all agreed. By now the Eastern guys had woke up and found me waiting. One of them had left a pair of pants, a shirt, and 2 jackets in a fold out satchel. I thought I'd take them to him. I talked to a lady who was very interested in the arts. She was a healthy, strappy woman, and wore a blouse unbuttoned enough to show the swell of her breasts. They were beautiful. She asked me what I had been doing. I told her I'd been posing naked for artists. She asked me which ones and we talked about Raymond Kushner. I found a little girls sandal. It was after a yoga class. Women were talking in the locker room of how they felt good about their bodies. I found the sandal on the square wooden porch with a roof. I picked up the sandal. I wished it would fit me. There were words written into the leather. The brown beads were wooden. I had to go work at the county fair, stacking trays of food. My mother was after us 'cause we were late. It was the ""famine-feast"" at the fair and there was a huge feast. There was a black boy who was looking very sexy. I had to keep putting more trains in the stack."
"260"	"(02/14/2000)"	"I was on the road to Clinton. I had to go to the health department there and pick out some paper work. I was not afraid of a drug test. They let me pick out 2 other peoples forms there, so I could be more people if I wanted to. One was ""Dan"" and I couldn't even read the writing. One was a stranger. It was a long road back to Laurens and I wondered, if I drank the coffee, where I could go to the bathroom on the way home. There was a very steep hill. Midway down was Veronica. She was wearing an elegant black cape with a beautiful curved deep neckline. From the edges of the shoulders and trimmed in beautiful soft fur like a fur boa almost. I wanted to take her picture. I had one shot left in the camera. I had a present for Veronica. A little yellow chair with an Eiffel tower in it. She liked it. I'd taken the last picture and a boy was gonna let me ride his bicycle down the hill and take pictures of me but there was no film left. My mother was doing room inspection and I was afraid the lady would come back and get me. I had left my camera with Veronica and forgotten about it."
"261"	"(02/15/2000)"	"Dora and I had pushed our bicycles up onto the roof of a house. Dora took her bicycle up via the tree and I went up the least slanted rooftops. We met at the top. We were in different places. I could not see Dora. I walked across one roof and looked while Linda and Marianna had been working. Linda's newest store was on Lafayette. The entrance on Crosby. Marianna had been cutting out wooden dolls with a chainsaw. Linda was getting a show ready. Lots of little dolls and stories and photos she'd cut up for the stories. About the people not having money for a place to stay--so one person checked into the mental hospital and everybody slept in/under the bed with him. There was a picture of the guy in bed with a blanket and so many other faces cut out and put in there with him. There was a break with a fashion show of Linda's dolls. Soho-ish ladies were there. One had on a lightly sequined pale green dress with buttons and labels across the back. 4 labels on back, one on front. ""Medicaid"" one said. She was a high-class society lady trying to look hip. Linda had a sister named Lee--who used to be a crack head and lived in the park. Now she was a skydiver and adventure enthusiast. There were dolls to paint. One person said, ""This should be relaxing,"" and I said, ""You have to concentrate like if your ears are real dirty and you're trying to clean them out and you just can't get them cleaned out."" ""A good analogy,"" Linda said. I was painting in the girl. ??? Dora. He said his Dad was killed by a drunk driver and I told him about ??? Marianna had found my old invites. They did not invite me. William was driving. He had a dark blue mustang. It was parked in the yard. There was a beautiful butterfly painted in the intersection of the road. A mysterious person had painted it."
"262"	"(02/16/2000)"	"There was a big area of grass to be cut. A big rectangle. Under the tree--near the center of the area was a big tree and the grass didn't grow very much in the big circle area under the tree. It was mostly leaves, twigs and weeds there. But you had to run the lawnmower across the entire yard. You had to cut the grass. There was no doubt about that. The deer under the tree froze--got scared by me and the loud noise of the lawnmower, but there was nothing I could do. The yard to cut got bigger. It was behind the Abrams house. I wasn't cutting in straight rows, but loops and curves and arcs. There was a hose pipe laid out--loops and circles too--and I kept trying not to run over it because the lawnmower would chop it up. A woman was sprinkling salt into a small container of rocks and water. The salt would stir up invisible but you could still taste it. It was for her husband. The salt would keep things from growing. Poison. There was an algebra test. I had all the answers for it written. ???. I couldn't help but laugh over Dora not being able to dance. When I took the test, I'd erased strategically, so it'd look like I had to work out the answer. On my desk I had a stack of albums and notebooks. One had a funny drawing of a blue monster on it. I held it up for a guy across the room to see and we laughed out loud. Next on the stack was an album by a band called ""Twig Boy."" I thought the name was so funny I held it up too. I went to the building next door and saw a man in a blue sweat suit, ringing the doorbell. I recognized him as being a runner I saw every morning in that sweat suit. I went to speak to him but he was not attentive. He was going on a ??? purposes. He was ringing Ben's doorbell. Ben came out and they left. I went by the store before going in. I got 2 cans of coke and 2 quarts of water. I went out on the back porch to look for something. It was night. A hand was reaching up and had cut through the screen. It was a man's hand. It was holding a rusted metal spike, razor knife. I knew he had climbed up on something to break in. And the evil way his hand was groping, I knew my hand had to smash his, but I was afraid he'd stab me with the rusted spike. More than afraid. I knew it would happen. So I picked up something, I had no time to find the best thing to use as a weapon--and I crashed down on his unsuspecting hand. (A he was reaching up from below, his head was below porch level, so he couldn't see me.) I came down with a bang and started screaming, ""Call the cops! Call the cops! Call the cops!"" I was stuttering. I'd been stuttering all through everything. I hoped my father could hear me screaming so he could call the cops."
"263"	"(02/17/2000)"	"Gail was driving a car. While driving she was reading a story she wrote. It said, ""Although 90 percent of Americans prefer white meat on a turkey, but on a turkey, only 30 percent of the meat is white. The problem is how to meet 90 percent of the people's desire with only 30 percent of the available product. The story went on to tell of Thanksgiving meal fiascos in a pretty way, and was mixed in with a newspaper article about drunk drivers. I had to memorize a part of a Shakespeare play for a dinner party. I didn't know if it was a performance or just entertainment for us. The guests at the dinner party. I was memorizing the part I was in. I was doing a part with a guy next to me. He was foreign. He said he could do 120 drawings of objects but he could not make a painting. I told him about a painter from high up in the mountains. He told me the name of the country. It started with a ""P"" or an ""E."" I couldn't remember it. For the performance or dinner party, there was a round cement table in the center. In the middle of the table was a porcelain bowl, set into the cement with designs inset. Then it gradually became cement. The leaves and grapes in cement--the design on half of the circle. I painted it all pale green. Then the paint could be wiped/peeled off the porcelain, but stuck to the cement--to the leaf designs--and you could peel it off a little and it looked like the leaves were in motion. It was my job to set the table--a fancy table--with glasses for red wine, white wine, bread dishes, butter dishes. I set the table but then realized I had forgotten to put the tablecloth down, so I put it over the dishes and glasses. The guy said he could pour the red wine if there were glasses on the table, but (that) I'd forgotten and there were no glasses. ""Sure there are,"" I said, ""they're under the tablecloth."" We were on a train. ME and Corinne--when Corinne went to sleep on the train she was a woman from another time who always wanted coffee. She wanted sticks of chewing gum too and I had some in my pocket. There was a little boy on the train. With his mother but all by himself. He knew everything--you could tell by his eyes. He never spoke--there was no need for him to--everything was in his eyes. His mother went to sleep. He strayed from her. He stood close to the doors--watching them open and shut--knowing something in his eyes--a slight calm mischievous smile on his face--but everything in his eyes. His hair was the color of mine. It was curly too. His mother knew he was suppose to get off by himself at one stop--and so he did--she was barely awake. He was alone now. His mother had fallen sound asleep again. He walked calmly down the platform and while the doors were open, he came back into the car ahead of us. I had to keep sight of him. Everything people knew of him or expected of him was wiped clean. The train was his world and he was everything. I knew this little boy was the key to light and life and everything anybody could ever want--because of his eyes and the energy they emitted from the little boy. Detached and immersed, at the same time. I was mesmerized by the little boy and at all costs could not lose sight of him. There was an artist whose art was to cut out pieces of the road with a jackhammer and/or chainsaw. The dean of the college was upset when he went in somebody's room and saw a piece of the road on the wall. The artist would cut his squares 4, 5, or 6 feet square from the sides of the road--where the white and yellow lines were painted. The artist, he/she liked the wear and tear on the paint on the pavement, where the paint wore off the top of the small pebbles in the road, and the energy of skid marks next to the slow-painted solid stripes--worn down by many years of cars driving on them. When I came up I saw the forklift and a square of the road cut out, but still in place--I knew the artist had been at work. A farmer in a pick-up truck stopped to talk to me. I was worried he'd call the patrolman about the road, but he was stuttering and stammering was all that came out. He was trying to pick me up. I didn't know how to operate a forklift. If I could get the slab of road onto the forklift, I knew I could figure out how to drive it, but the road was too heavy and I knew this. The farmer didn't even notice the road missing."
"264"	"(02/19/2000)"	"There were backwards earthquakes. Spots--way under the earth would lose their gravity for a moment and huge boulders flew up out of lakes and oceans. One flew up out of Greenwood Lake and landed right on top of Sotheby's. To try to prevent this in the future Sotheby's was getting a surveillance camera to photograph their places once every hour. I was in the army. There had been a huge flood. Disease was rampant because of the heat. We hiked, looking for damage of the flood and possible survivors. The flood happened because of the drought, the water couldn't seep into the ground. After the flood there was a fire. I went to a group of psychiatrists' offices. I had been there before. Behind the reception office was a door. Behind there was a long hallway and then it went in a big, big square, the hallway. I started walking around the hallway square counter-clockwise. I looked for a door that I had been to before. Some of the office doors were open. All the psychiatrists were men but not the psychiatrist I was looking for. There was a rack of round shirt collars, cut off from the shirts. They said, ""20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's. You could buy a t-shirt collar to state your age group. It hadn't gone over as good as they'd hoped. At sunrise I walked down a road where the water was. Fog was rising over the water. When I was walking Dora appeared and I wanted to hug her, but my arms were full but by the time I emptied them, she was gone. ""It's like this every morning,"" I said. As I was leaving the psychiatrists office, walking the last half of the inner square, the heavy cloth pillow case filled with onions broke and landed on a pile of harvest display nuts the secretaries were getting ready. They could keep them in the display with the various nuts and squash and gourds, but I wasn't sure if the pilgrims had onions . In a Volkswagen bug the engine and seats had been taken out. I was at a residence beach where there were private schools only. ??? ??? I went up to the top of a very steep mountain. At the very top was sand remains of an ancient village. The sand was beautiful colors and was moving slightly. There were volcanic geysers barely active there. I knew to walk on the edge because the sand could shift and give way and swallow you. Around the top I dug a trench in the sand wall to watch the sand slide down. I tunneled a little gap in the sand wall, but there was enough of a ledge to walk around barely. There was a shelf of damp sand around the edge that would not give way. A girl was looking for the laundry room of the mountain. Stairs were built into the mountain, a stairwell tunneled into the dirt. The natives inhabited the mountain. The holy chief of the natives was very, very dark. He had a headdress of white feathers around his head in a circle. He was very wise. His body was concise. The most valued possession of the natives was a pick-up truck, but the chief was the only one who knew how to drive it. It was old, black and smaller than the average pick-up truck. Me and a guy got in the pick-up truck with the chief. The sun was starting to go down. It got very cold on the mountain top when the sun set. The guy asked the chief if he could borrow a jacket, and the chief gave him a beat up umbrella. All bent up and ripped, but you could tell it was a generous gesture, and hard to part with. About half way down the mountain, I got out of the pick-up truck, because I wanted to see the stairs inside the mountain. They were circular stairs, and there was only about 2 feet space between the floor and the ceiling. Since the handrail was circular, I slid down it and ended up in a swimming pool. I wanted to cut my hair one inch long. I had been waiting for her. Waiting for Dora. People were either working overtime or going to lunch. I couldn't concentrate on anything else because I was waiting for Dora. She was getting a salad. I knew this. We were meeting my father at the city Park to play tennis. I got there and saw the bus. The courts were full so we went fishing. my father caught a big one and the kitty was walking right in the water, looking for fish. She did not mind getting wet at all."
"265"	"(02/20/2000)"	"We were having class. I had showed some of my dream drawings and sat back down. A girl in front of me, who would not turn around to face me when talking to me said, ""These schizophrenics get so obsessed about their projects."" A girl in class who was absent, recovering from her schizophrenia. I wanted to tell her it was big art, not schizophrenia, but I didn't say anything. Aram liked my project. We had a break from class and I went and put on some huge white socks with fuzzy green stripes. The socks were the size of snow boots. I had a pale green cotton warm-up jacket too, with a hood. I figured if it was too warm, I could fold up the jacket and use it for a pillow. I went to the bathroom and a girl was in another stall. I thought the seats were too high, but she said they were just how she liked them. I fell to sleep sitting on the toilet. I woke up and the girl was gone. I was late for class. I went to get a soda and rushed to class where they were all watching ""The Ten Commandments"" with Eileen on a black and white static-ky TV in a garage. My father was moving from the Franks house. I took a shower. The tub overflowed. The shower stall overflowed. The sink overflowed. There was lots to pack. Jessica and another girl kept hanging around, asking for candy. They said they knew it was there from last year's Valentines. I told them I didn't have time to look for it. They found it under the sink. It was all stuck together. Jelly and candy apples and red-hots They were happy. The were going to shave a dog under the house. They were euthanizing a dog who'd lived there a long time and I didn't want to leave. Dora was sitting with the dog. The dog's puppy was playing and didn't have any idea what was going on. Water had flowed over everything so it was hard to pack. Nick was cutting things out and working very hard on a little art project. my father packed up the 18-wheeler and Aunt Linda, Uncle Bob and family, My mother and me got in the truck. Going down a big hill, my father picked up speed to make it up the other side. Just when we started going up the hill on the other side, Aunt Linda said they had to get right out, because Uncle Bob had spilled his soda and because he was diabetic, he would lose all his energy. I thought this was selfish of them, as we would not be able to make it up the other side. My mother's lower eyelid was stuck in the steering wheel. It was pulled out 3 or 4 inches away from her face. The steering wheel was pinching her eyelid, stretching it out. I knew it must be very, very painful, but she sat without showing any expression. ""You know I don't have any lower eyelids."" She said when she finally got her eye pulled out of the steering wheel. It looked painful. Back at the house I was packing up the last stuff. Nick had worked all night on an art project to give to Raymond as a present. He had covered a piece of my paper with pale green paint and written a note to me asking me to give the project to Raymond. I told him (Nick) (that) I didn't want to give anything to Raymond. He said that Raymond had a bigger name than me, I told him that was not true and my name would be big, and I rubbed the note out. I told him I was an artist, and he said Raymond was the closest thing to an artist he knew and that made me mad. I was ranting and raving. He had worked all night. I said, ""He wasted a whole night on a no-good artist and you didn't even see my work spread out in front of him there."" I had gone home. When I got there I sat down to play the piano. The Halloween and Christmas music got mixed up with classical and the notes were mixed up. I was trying to play it anyway. Dora came in and wanted to play and I told her I'd just sat down, to let me finish first. But then Dora was gone and the lady from the library was trying to take my picture and I was crying so I asked her not to and she said, ""Why?"" And I said, ""Isn't it enough reason to stop because I don't wish to have my picture taken right now?"" People were donating parts of their bodies to bring Dora back. A black man showed me his certificate that he had donated his skin. I hugged him from the piano bench. When Dora came back she didn't look the same. Her skin was drawn too tight over her mouth, nose and eyes, so it looked like she was always screaming. The TV news did a special and made Dora look awful. They accused her of being on drugs because she had to wear 3 different pairs of glasses to see the world how it was--one pair of bifocals over her chin. She rolled her eyes and lifted her head and they showed that close-up and over and over in slow motion. It was a football game promotion and I was ready to kill that camera news lady Betty."
"266"	"(02/26/2000)"	"I was sitting on a hill trying to fix the lawnmower. I kept tracing the same shapes, over and over again, etching down into the metal. Instead of the lawnmower blade there was a turntable and you had to carefully put the stereo needle in the right groove of a spot with beautiful music. I saw Theo standing on another hill and I yelled as loud as I could, ""Hi Theo!"" A girl was trying to get the record to play. She couldn't quite get it. She knew it did. So hard to get the record to play. She said, ""I'd like to get a hot dog. Watch what I do."" I found a piano notebook. ??? I was working on the job. It was a job everybody hated but we all needed. Every once in a while 2 big mafia-like guys would come in the work space and grab somebody--lift him off the ground and carry him out the doors. The worker was always terrified. The rest of us were paralyzed with fear. We had to keep working. When one guy got carted away, I was the one to take over his job, making hot sandwiches on whole pita bread--uncut. There were stacks of square wax paper and round stacks of pita bread you were suppose to cut a slab of hot meat into 3 pieces while it was on top of the pita bread. First you had to put down wax paper. Next to that you had to put a couple of sprigs of broccoli and a dollop of sweet potato soufflé on top of the green. For color. While the guy was showing me, ashes from his cigarette dropped on the sandwich. At first we blew them off, but then the guy decided to toss it out and start over--because ashes were sprinkled over the food and he didn't want the big boss to cart him off too. Maria was sitting, hugging her knees, in the backyard under a bush. She was very happy. She was in her own world and not on earth. She asked me for a cigarette and when I gave her one she sucked in like heaven. I roller skated once again over next to the piers where the health food stores were. There was a class. It was a discussion about old paintings. Messages had been painted into the paintings hundreds of years ago. One painting had an important message for the unborn child of a pregnant woman in the class. A French painting. The painting had no words, the message was just a picture of a young tree. New trendy pizza places had opened up on this street. 3 fancy new restaurants. I had left a phone message for a guy named Perkins about him not being in class and the woman he was in love with was there. Jasmine told me he was very upset about the message I left. We were climbing a huge hill. I was on roller skates and just before I got to the top I had to skate down again. It was so steep and I couldn't decide what to do. I was driving. At the turn in from Hickory Tavern I missed the turn and went into the high school parking lot instead. I didn't see the stop sign. I thought I hit the driving instructor. He filed a report while I typed a poem on the computer that Chuck had left me. One line was, I thought: I want to know. But really it was: I want you to know. Chuck had left a toy skunk in a tree on the left and a monkey in a tree on the right. I traced their outlines through the car windshield. Grandpa was driving and stopped at the curb near the post office and opened the drivers' side door to look at all the stickers inside the hinges inside the door for the car maintenance and race car stickers."
"267"	"(02/28/2000)"	"There was an office building. Very tall--over 25 stories. Hannah high school played their home games there. On 46 St. was another office building. Irmo high played their home games. I was roller skating home and went to cash a check. The girl at the window needed quarters so I was giving her 8 for $2--but instead she gave me 10 tokens back. The tokens were the kind of coins like Underdog bit. They were soft and hard--soggy dried crumbs--like wet, dried cardboard that was dried in particles. Slightly damp. They would not go in any turnstile. I was at a McDonalds to get a soda. One girl in line there was very sunburned in the middle of winter. Another girl was there with one normal leg and one real skinny leg. She was wearing shorts. When I went out, a group was doing an escape from McDonalds. They had been working and living at McDonalds. A black woman, a white man, and his 2 little boys. The woman was sad to leave McDonalds but she knew it was what she had to do. The little boys came out carrying duffel bags. On each end was an insulated Dominoes delivery box--insulated. They were packed and ready to go--waiting outside in front of McDonalds for the right opportunity to escape. They had a plan. First they would act like they were getting in a car. Then they would get out and get in another van. The man would walk and run, and I would skate. Odds were, some of us would make it. We figured it out scientifically, with a chart on the temperature butter fat disintegrated. I stopped and got 3 cans of soda. I was eating a banana. All mushed up. The kitty licked some chewed up banana out of my mouth. At first I thought she liked it, but she didn't. I was practicing piano and when I got up to go to the bathroom an older lady took over and was playing dance hall music. I went to iron some clothes and I wasn't wearing any clothes. Water was leaking from a big tub and dripping down the ironing board to the floor. I had been ironing naked. When Jay Mills came in I said, ""I guess I should at least put on a towel."" He said, ""I guess."" In the back room, inside 2 cans of bright colored near fluorescent paint--one pink, one green, Jack had hidden 20 pills. They would calm you down. I didn't want them really. He thought I still needed them. A woman asked me if she could have 2 pills and a Rolling Rock. I told her I'd go somewhere and get it for her--I wasn't sure--since it was late and all the stores in Tribeca were closed. A young girl looked over her shoulder--waiting to see if the older man she thought she loved was coming down the street."
"268"	"(02/29/2000)"	"Me and Rudy were looking for 2 things. TV Guides to a dry cleaners. It was raining and we drove underground. I thought it was a newsstand but it was a dark basement dry cleaners. When I went in I couldn't remember why I came there. Rich was waiting in the car. There was a cat there. I was petting the cat. It was a big cat. Sheri had said she was going to adopt the cat, but she never did. She kept saying she was gonna take the kitty home, but she never did. We stopped at a church service. It was an old dark big Episcopal Church. Catholics were weaving in and out. People were hovering around the center aisle and there were refreshments out front. The priest was back in the middle of the aisle, like a crowded grocery store aisle. Mary Ganther was there. There was a TV movie. Sort of animated about a stupid clown and his side kick. The colors were lots of purples and greens. There were subtitles. Some silent. I flipped the channel and this same cartoon was on every channel. Some channels had Chinese subtitles. Some channels had other foreign languages. Always the same clown in glasses and his buddy. The real film was starting. It was a weird sort of drawing, sort of like old master drawings--sort of black and white photos of little boys legs under the table, not wearing any pants. The drawings showed their little penises and how they changed from infant to boys, about 10 or 12 years old. I was at Marianna's. Mary was there. I was trying to get some work together. I needed to go to sleep, but it felt too uncomfortable to go to sleep there. Marianna kept saying mean things, about that I had farted. I wanted to take a shower, but I was afraid to ask. I was going to Jasmine's talk. Marianna had said she was going to go with me, but she didn't go. She hurt my feelings. She kept saying things to hurt my feelings."
"269"	"(03/01/2000)"	"I was in another time. The land was rolling hills. Sort of like an 1800's ranch or pasturelands. The work day had ended and the cowboy came back to his one room wood shack with a little second story like a loft in a barn. A hay loft. He slept up there. This time a girl was with him. While they were digging she had on work pants, blue jeans, and when it was time for bed he told her either she could have the little shack barn next to his or she could sleep with him. The girl had never married. She looked up at the place that would be hers. ??? I would sleep out in the open by myself. I knew Rudy was going to come soon. I decided to try to cook something with what was at hand. A big hunk of pork, zucchini and milk in a brown-in-bag. There was no room for a lid on the pork and it was bubbling up everywhere. I found a smaller lid to put on the pot and turned it off. It would keep cooking. We had a town meeting concerning Dora's death. The man who killed Dora and his family were speaking. A postcard had come from Europe. A lady on the ??? wrote on the postcard she was trying to lose weight because she could only see 16 of her toes and not all 20 of them when she looked down. Near the cash register, I had snot on my hand and I slung it off on the man's back who killed Dora. Then I ran. And jumped into a bush till he went away. He went up to speak on stage. I came in. His wife was there with the slide projector and I couldn't help but make snide remarks in response to what he was saying. He said, ""We all loved Dora."" I said, ""YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER!"" I was mad. I got out my camera to shoot pictures of him while he was talking. I really wanted to shoot him with a gun. I knew the camera would make him nervous because he was lying already. His foot was tapping nervously. So I took a close-up of that. Then I got in tight on his face and he sweated. The film would not advance. I'd made him so nervous with the camera that he'd forget what he was saying. I announced to the crowd that I didn't have any film in my camera anyway. I said, ""Dora was a little girl too."" The lady removed the picture. She had been projecting slides of their children, and mumbling, mumbling. I climbed over to huge steep hill and slid down the moss. Deep in the caves were little leprechauns. The colors were green, purple and orange. Rudy had come over for supper. He had come on an underwater jet that swam like a dolphin playing. It was the newest of planes. There was a home-furnishings and art store I'd been in. I went in again and looked at the art painted on the walls with distance. A hooker followed me and on purpose hugged me, but I paid no attention. Maybe she thought I was cold. Aunt Linda had drove us onto the wrong road. The man who killed Dora asked me, ""Are you a leader?"" ""Are you a leader?"" because my house was up there. I did not answer him. U.S. Army reserve."
"270"	"(03/08/2000)"	"There was a hot pink limousine. These weren't the right ones--it was suppose to be a lavender limousine. I had gotten a scholarship to go back to the art school I went to in Florida. When I got there, only 2 years had passed since I left. But for me the regular amount of time had passed. I knew Dora had been killed. When a girl I'd known at school, but had forgotten her name, told me the armature on my desk was Laurie's my eyes were blind. I thought she said ""Dora"" and I couldn't move. I thought she'd said, ""How's Dora?"" Armature ??? and little art mannequin were not tall enough, but it was to make a sculpture of William. The head to make was a tea cup. I want to ??? Writing the 212 then but We weren't sure what ??? We were going to the art school. Me and William and Alicia were working on a Christmas installation. Jeffery had a young baby falcon on a leash with a little halter. It was a very young bird and had already tried to fly away. Alicia had a little puppy dog. We were all sitting on a ledge about to start the installation. An ice skater was working out choreography. A catchy in and out step that made you want to be a good ice skater. William was installing neon lights to make a shadow of the ice in colors. I was suppose to work on a mural design. The first was partly up there. We looked at it. It had snowmen on it. Then William asked me to do one and I did chaotic Christmas lights strung on nothing. Jeffery said the clocks with the snowmen were just inviting surrealism speculation and that was asking for trouble. But he wasn't crazy about the disheveled Christmas lights so we sat on the ledge thinking--knowing we would KNOW when it was right."
"271"	"(03/09/2000)"	"Dora was coming home. We were all very happy about this. It was 11 a.m. She was to get there by 1 p.m. Since bathing suits were on sale at Belks, My mother thought I should get one. We went to look at them. I wandered off by myself with weird contacts in my eyes. One was my father's college ring. I had the idea to get a necklace made with 3 stones--each stone exactly the color of my eyes, Rudy's eyes and Dora's eyes. 3 shades of blue. I looked at a rack of hair ribbons. I liked them. One was brown with wide frayed edges. I tied a blue boa-ish feather in my hair. The stem broke and stood at a crazy angle. Frothy blue billowing as I walked. When I got back my mother was looking at the swimsuits. One was an old blue/navy one like hers. Others by Catalina had little cotton daisies embroidered. The one-piece blue, navy/white suit like my mother's old one was $1.29--but it disintegrated when you touched it. We left without getting anything. When we got back I realized I had not taken a shower. And Dora was due back any minute. When she got there she looked beautiful. Her hair was very blonde like when she was little. Thick. Cut with short straight bangs and just even with near the bottom of her ears. We stood in front of the bathroom mirror, holding onto each other's shoulders and looking into each other's eyes. Alive sparkling with love our eyes but Dora could not stay. As soon as she got there she was gone again. The kitten was on the living room floor playing with some lettuce. It was alive, the lettuce, and it would jump, hop and move by itself. Then the kitten would jump the lettuce and the lettuce would try to hop away. The kitten spinned a lid into the clover and jumped--pounced after it--on top of it in the clover. WW III happened. I was riding with my father in a school bus, looking at a book of tornado statistics. For the months of this March/April the book predicted tornadoes--I looked on my birthday to see the likelihood of a tornado hitting on my birthday. We missed the school bus. In the bus lot school buses were blown in a ditch--the roofs pulled off. The tornado had hit and we didn't have any food. Time was running out and my father left the barnyard--he pulled the freight. A mother and her near-grown son were eating their lunch in the front door. We walked in and asked for something to eat. ""I'll cut up some more cabbage,"" the lady said and she left to go to the kitchen. ""Can I use your bathroom?"" I asked the near-grown boy. I had to pee very bad. Keith had been on a trip to Mexico but was apprehended and now was in a total darkness treatment center for 6 weeks."
"272"	"(03/10/2000)"	"We were diving off the rocks into the dark blue-brown sea water. Rolling waves smacked against the rocks. We couldn't be sure if more rocks lay hidden under the dark surface of the water. So we had to check first. The other girl lost me. I had a shell necklace my father had made for me. It was a choker-style necklace and very pretty. Dora had been giving Rudy help with Science and made notes in a calendar to ""hold Science News"" on some days. The calendar was on a hospital bed. A waitress was on the run from the law in a convertible--with her new husband. She was about to divorce him if necessary. She had a little daughter. She was going to leave with her mother and cross the country--working in diners by night. She knew that at night time she could hide easier--working out in the open at all-night diners and truck stops, where time stood still, and cops would sit for hours with coffee and pie, killing time while the shift clock ran down. Her husband was driving the convertible. She had spunky blond short hair and glasses. Next to them on the highway was another convertible. A sex kitten older woman with the biggest red hair-do I've ever seen pulled up and made a move on the husband. She was about to divorce him anyway, so she (the wife) didn't care really what was going on. She was on-the-run with more important things to think about than petty jealousy. Into the sand, you would stir with a stick and say the words ""mars"" and after you said, ""Mars the Red Planet"", the sand would get lots of finer sand in dark red powder--like black cherry jello mix swirled in. Mixed more and more. Then you'd pick up the sand on the beach, pack it down a little--wait and the little teeny baby space creature would come out. Taps to the head with a stick would bring him to life where all was fine until he grew and became a menace to society and it was a massive operation to try to kill him then."
"273"	"(03/12/2000)"	"There was a special meal catered by a Chinese staff in the Bobo Chapel. There was a choice of 2 things. I didn't know what they were. I wanted a soda. I asked for the whole can but she said no, so I went up to the refrigerator and got one myself. John Harrelson was at the table and he said he'd met a boy, 30 years old who was cross country skiing 12 miles to come see him. Across from me were 3 gay guys and 2 sharing one fold-up metal chair. Then I saw the boy in question riding down a huge steep hill on a dirt bike with dust flying behind him. We were on a train. There were 5 extra stops on the line to transfer from. On the 5th stop was a ladder of metal rungs going up a huge cave wall to transfer to another line. When I transferred there a time before, I hadn't seen the ladder and had climbed up a tree limb through a window. A park bench was in our front yard and 2 guys were sitting there drinking water. Ackerman and another guy. They were talking about tennis courts. The other guy said he would never make kids learn to play tennis because the sun would get in their eyes. I said you should learn to be able to play no matter where the sun is. They filled up their plastic water cups with the spray nozzle on the hose pipe I'd turned on the night before. My mother came and yelled at me about the wasted water. I got defensive and said Ackerman was drinking water too. She said she was gonna squirt water under the skin on the back of my arms and I'd have cancer if I didn't make an appointment like she said. I was trying on some blue jeans that had tiny, tiny patches of cloth the size of snake scales sewed on in a vertical pattern, ringing in very muted colors of greens, blues and purples. Like Joseph's coat of many colors. I didn't know if I loved the pants or just wanted plain Levi's. Aunt Linda said, ""If you keep running your butt will get smaller. You will look good and the town people will talk nice."" There was a huge, huge pencil drawing--too dark--on the table in the basement of the church. It was huge overall but each individual section was the size of a fish scale. The drawing was underneath, but smudged over and I had to carefully blot it with an eraser to reveal a big, huge delicate drawing of Dora's face. On a tiny coin was a cartoon face I'd drawn of Dora as a little girl in first grade. I had drawn her hair very black."
"274"	"(03/13/2000)"	"Kitty was running sideways on 3 legs. She was running along the curb on 42 St. She was scared and looked like she'd been hit by a car. Her hair was sticking up in different directions like she'd been side-swiped so close it buzzed her hair at sharp angles. In the women's locker room Eileen was showing us some books. Some were postage stamps of women from the Royal Family. Some were books of leaves in pictures in the beautifully designed squares of intricate, tender drawings of leaves. The pictures were still, but moving. The leaf would hesitate and then sway, as if to fall from the tree or open up majestically. In the locker room was the project on movement. One thing they showed was a baby hooked up to an I.V. of blood. The baby had unhooked itself, though it needed blood. The baby needed the blood from its mother, but the mother had AIDS, so getting the blood would be slow sure death. So the baby had unhooked its own arm from the I.V. and walked away. Disappeared. Eileen noted this and explained and passed around the leaf pictures. The big pictures were still. It was the tiny square insert of the leaf that moved and twirled on its own--even though frozen in still paper and not moving at all. ??? (ILLEGIBLE) It was almost time to start. Tom Brandon was there dancing. He had on a red plaid shirt. We ??? but it was almost ??? Me and Rudy were photographing strange shadows on the wall. Shadows of ladders that came from nowhere--went to nowhere. The major installation was waiting, and walls for this piece would show something else when we looked on. The art didn't look so good. I kept looking at the book, wondering how Eileen had made the still leaf turn. A band was loading up and playing roller blades."
"275"	"(03/14/2000)"	"There was a big storm coming. The house was a huge open circle. Not a house but an open living space. In a donut shape. The hall went around in a circle. My space had no walls and I arranged the furniture in a trapezoid layout. ??? for right next to my space but I ignored it because it was not quite in my space. Around the circle before the storm hit, I looked at the art on the inner walls. Cartoon animals, most poorly done. Mine I did a good job on, though, and I liked them--but even the poorly done animals had a very endearing quality. Stephen was waiting at one spot. Our eyes met and he screamed, ""What?"" and I went underwater and swam away. Undercover cops were walking on the FDR Drive with walkie talkies, trying to catch a hoodlum."
"276"	"(03/20/2000)"	"There was a snake. It was a constrictor but it had fangs too. It was striped like a coral snake and it lived in a tree mostly but it got brave and started venturing into the world. When I looked up to the tree limb where it lived and the snake wasn't there. ??? I couldn't see the snake. It could be anywhere. First id did not stray far--different levels of the tree house--but then it got into the swimming pool ???. Just when I got to the 3rd--little tiny child, child, the snake was stretching his fangs around the baby's wrist. I grabbed the baby just in time and lifted her out of the pool. The children had not even noticed the snake. We opened the doors. On the ??? I was cooking vegetable soup. First I had no pot. I was cooking in a big gallon zip-lock plastic bags. I started cutting an onion and William was scraping carrots."
"277"	"(03/23/2000)"	"There was a poetry bar. It was on a side street, a street full of places just like it, but they all had blank walls--except for the poetry center age-old times. It had one drawing--like illuminated monk's calligraphy drawings of a big ampersand. In the center of the left wall. The other walls were blank. Things happened there after midnight. In the daytime the place was empty. Alex came in. He had 2 dogs. Big dogs--medium and pretty and strong. They were male dogs and he said he would come back in 6 months when my dog was in heat so they could have puppies. I thought he should have checked to see if the girl dog was interested in the boy dog. There were different days of the week to have certain kinds of soup. But there were only 5 kinds of soup for 7 days. 2 days were repeats. I was in a glassed-in room. I had an e-mail. It was from Roseanne. I had sent her an email with a cartoon I made--but when I tried to pull it up--all I got was directions on how to make condensed soup. There was a big bowl of stiff meringue. 2 bowls with stiff peaks. So stiff you could sit things on top of them. Then in a 3rd bowlmy father showed me how my mother made flowers with individual petals from meringue so strong you could build a well with them. The meringue looked like Styrofoam. The petals were much stronger than they looked."
"278"	"(03/24/2000)"	"I had an i.d. card with a picture of me and kitty together on it. It was also a pack of 10 MTA cards. Orange. Expired on April first 2001. I had a pack of 10 of these. Laminated in plastic. They were orange. I went through the turnstile. Tom Brandon was visiting. He wanted to see Tommy Sublet too. He had a bottle of blue pills--some broken in half. There had been 30. Now there were 20. He was passed out. I was afraid he was gonna die. So I started counting to see how many pills he took. I picked up the phone to make a phone call. It was Tommy Sublet talking. I was in a grocery store. Lisa could not understand the difference between Coke and Diet Coke. It was on sale for 99 cents. Limit 6. My shopping cart was full. I was waiting for Eileen. Finally Gail said Eileen took off a day from working to have an affair yesterday and she was in the hospital over-tired today. Gail and Helen started making rules about the class--splitting it up into 2 groups. Smoking section and non-smoking section. Those who wanted to discuss art, certain pictures for each half. Gail rolled out a huge paper reproduction of a wall-sized mural of Mary and Jesus. Jesus was a little baby. It was on cheap paper like a kid's birthday decorations. Class was no fun without Eileen there, so I wandered off. I walked past a fancy doorman building. Sand covered the concrete sidewalk in front--under the awning. I noticed an army man in the sand. I picked it up. I kept finding more of them. Larger than usual. I found one with a guy shooting a bazooka. Just then a beautiful little 3-4 year old boy came out of the building. They were his army men. We played together in the sand. I used a moving toothbrush and a 12 inch high skeleton with hinges to be alien monsters to attack the army men. I touched the top of his head when we finished. Rudy had gotten a tattoo exactly the shape and size of a banana sticker in the center of his chest. It said, in tiny letters: ""LISA ADOXXXXXX IN CORPURITUS"" He didn't know how to spell Lisa's last name, so he just had tiny but fuzzy blurry spots put on."

I saw the red lights ??? ??? ??? that were about of the fire in the building. I had 6 pieces of music. The counter was full of ??? in a business ??? ??? ??? The mice in the envelope had gone to sleep. The would wake up soon enough. I had Chopin music ??? raise doors. The braids got longer and the girl tied the bathing suit top to the braids and pulled them up from the back between my legs and twirled the ends so it looked like I had a mustache between my legs of blond pubic hair."
"280"	"(03/27/2000)"	"I was visiting my father. He was living at a trailer at the lake. His dog had run away. The lake was beginning to overflow. It had started raining. It was not raining that hard but it had already flooded. my father's dog had run off. Another dog that looked like him was chained to a tree. I went to pet him--it was not my father's dog. There was one more night of flooding to come. Britta and 2 other women had come to talk about Dora. We were walking across the field. I realized I was not wearing clothes. ""I'm butt naked,"" I said. There was a very little boy with a very high IQ. They were studying him and comparing him to video tapes of a little girl with a high IQ. She was born in 1956. Her IQ was 202. His was 206. They had videotapes of her smoking a cigarette at the breakfast table as a little girl--4 or 5 years old. She was trying to smoke left handed and it felt clumsy to her. The little boy with 206 IQ. tried this and he smoked effortlessly with his left hand. When they questioned him about this, he said, ""I'm left handed."" They asked both of them how long they figured it would take them to read Beethoven's lifetime of compositions, read through as in play once, including each symphony part. The high IQ kids both agreed it would take about 6 months. They did a retina scan on each of them. A girl was taking photographs of Rudy swimming. On the front porch a drunk lady was holding onto the column. Another lady was trying to find her pink raincoat in a pile of clothes in the front yard. We were sitting at a diner table. 2 sisters--one lady wanted to get drunk. The other lady had left her 2 year old daughter when her sponsor had come onto her from AA. She was recovered now. It was the day she'd meet her daughter. The other no-good but trying sister was rubbing wood shavings from her forehead with a butter knife. Her head was wood inside. A guy across the table was doing tricks with quarters. The man brought the little girl. I watched the little girls hands. I watched the beautiful light and shadows in her hands as the sun caught them as she reached to grab her mother's arms. I kept the pictures in my head because I didn't have a camera."
"281"	"(03/28/2000)"	"The sound of the music notes was played so hot against the incandescent light bulbs that they burned. White hot and almost exploded. Sharp and unnerving the sound. Bright white the bulb. Interrogation torture. Yet soothing. It was a long path. The road to the jr. High school. I was running. All the way to the old Franks house. At the side door near the back I came upon Tim Madden from behind and we raced. We were running. I was at the back door of the room. I was at the room. A recessed drain area was filled with water. When I kicked some leaves off the drain it allowed air into the system and the water finally drained out. In a new housing development, houses were for sale. One had a blue swing set so I was sure this was just the house for us. The lady said the swing set was worth $25 and available for public use. Over the drain was a purple plate, broken in 2/3. Tim said, ""You could tell they didn't want anybody to go to the dark room in that drain."" At the front desk, a man would pull down typefaces for you, if you asked him and he was not too busy and if it was a typeface you both liked. The President of Brazil was a land man. He was speaking."
"282"	"(03/29/2000)"	"I was in a swimming pool. Swimming around. my father was in the pool at first. Far away I lost sight of him. I looked around and across to find him, assuming he'd gotten out of the water 'cause he didn't like swimming so much. Outside the water I went to the church playground. The camera was suspended on arms and rotating as they revolved. I was on a drive. A silver stand-on wagon. There were so many ???. Then a gyroscope type of camera. It was treacherous. Every time it came around it--it nearly chopped your head off. It was world windows II. A church game and learning test typed label with a typed 2 under a handwritten 1 and 3. I made a phone call. A famous film was nowhere ???. He was here--there--just a message from him. I was ice skating in a big lake near a shack on a pier. The owner had spray painted ""CAN LIVE IN,"" on it. I skated around in circles. I had moved to Florida. There were pictures in the paper of house boats for rent. One picture had a picture of the house that was painted with: ""CAN LIVE IN"" Another newspaper article said this apartment building was not gonna kick out ladies for questionable characters. I was lying in the bed. Sidney came in with some groceries. I was in a boat. A huge boat. There was a water test. From the deck high overhead I watched a guy do the test--gather all the inner tubes and tie them together after they tossed them out en mass from a speed boat. It looked easy, but then it was my turn and I learned just how hard it was. I was treading water in the ocean. First they tossed out a herd of pigs. Pigs were swimming. One pig's curly tail was just above the surface of the dark water. I thought, ""Oh, great, the sharks will love this. They probably never had pork before."" I waited to fell sharks at my feet. Finally they tossed about 30 inner tubes in the water. They were bigger and clumsier up close than they'd looked from the huge ship deck. I slowly commenced gathering them on a string together. Waves were lapping and rolling and cuts were leaking air out of the inner tubes. In the building the mayor was coming. There were lists--lots of lists. A list in 15 minute intervals with room numbers and allotted times. I could not find my room. I forgot my ticket. Inside the front door handle was a huge stack of bills--mostly ones but I saw a ten too. They were behind the handle. People's money to get back in."
"283"	"(03/30/2000)"	"I was with William. We were traveling across the night. There were huge high cliffs. Way above the water and William had to pivot from one cliff to another. I had to swing on a rope to a higher ledge of the swaying mountain. I heard a shot steps before we met. I was on the rope swing to the cliff where the guy who shot said, ""So,"" and he shot at me. They were the guys who were chasing me through the snow. I tried to hold on. I couldn't hold on. A shot rang out. I had a pistol and the ropes held my hair. ??? Half way across. I could not hold on any more. I let go because I had to. An academic type, later speaking. My hands could not hold on. I was shot. I dropped my belongings and held onto.........I started falling. I could see the ground and the empire state building and the statue of liberty. I had ended up destitute. I could see the world upside down in my travels. This is if I was alive. The ??? spilled over and was full ??? I had been shot at. I was hit. I missed a step and fell out of balance. Wills were not over yet. When I was falling I could slow film--I could see myself falling toward the points on the statue of liberty's head dress. I had been raped. I had been shot with a gun. They returned my skates and wallet, emptied of cash. my father was trying to catch up. Bobsledding down a mountain in a bubble ??? standard ice rules. I kept waiting to hit. The bob sleds were seconds off schedule, but enough to miss connections. When we finally got there I saw a ball of wax with monster things stuck to the register and asked if Rudy was a regular customer and stuck somewhere under the ice. Merri"
"284"	"(04/01/2000)"	"I was back in school. I was lost in the hallways. I found the art students but it was not my day to take art. They had newsprint pads and practiced figures in charcoal the first day of school. They were younger than me. It was my day to take writing. I couldn't find my class but I knew if I saw Jasmine or Eileen it was the right one. I was wearing a sarong with a white t-shirt. I taped my story to the white sarong tied into a skirt. I was staying at Corinne's family's. There was a plague. The sky filled with dark spots--locusts, angry--clumping up thick and mucus-y on the way down. They catapulted straight through canopies and made your eyes fill with mucus and swell shut so you couldn't see. School children were screaming. I got inside out of the raining locusts and asked a man what it was. He said a certain kind of pollen--the next county over had gotten out of control and when the spray truck sprayed insecticide it gummed up the pollen and this county didn't have the antidote and it was painful but harmless. I got a grocery cart and got groceries. Toys and appliances were mixed with the groceries--it was hard to tell front from back. I looked at Chinese vegetables but I got a strawberry popsicle. I was walking home eating my popsicle and I dropped it and Brittany came with a spoon to help me scrape it off the road and save some. She had a lot of it. I had the rest. Brittany's sister, Corinne, was underwater--playing with a boy who was already dead. They were doing back flips and somersaults in the water but when anybody else came around they played dead--him lying flat on his stomach lifeless. I liked to watch them play underwater in slow motion without gravity--their hair floating in front or behind them. The neighbors were from Cuba. They sat in the backyard. I kept getting lost and wandering into different Cuban's yards. The old man didn't mind. He showed me how to get back to the main road more than once. Rudy had written a play and they were acting it out when the locusts came. We tried to keep some kind of order--but with raining locusts, mucus eyes and everybody wanting a popsicle, rehearsals weren't going too good. I made a list of notes. The main character--a black lady who cooked--took the list with her and crinkled it up in her hand--and held onto it--as if she could feel the suggestions better than reading them."
"285"	"(04/03/2000)"	"I was sitting in a group. We were discussing crime writers. The teacher gave examples. Corinne was sitting there asleep. I wanted to tell someone about Corinne's writing and introduce them, but she was sleeping. I threw my blue pencil at her shoulder to wake her up. But the pencil missed her arm and almost shot her in the eye. She got out the blue pencil point and went back to sleep. She was a sleepy crime writer. The study session was almost over. I decided to leave just before the end. I left through the basement of the church. There was a maze of rooms. For the first few days I stopped at the beach ??? but I forgot my jacket. Home was in the church office. I kept looking. She had a pencil sharpener in her office. I saw her pencil, my pencil, she pencil, ??? office, with the blinds drawn. He was afraid to leave the church. A maze. Stones to write about the house. Down a hall way I was asking her, I had to get clothes ??? piled up old clothes. The preacher's son was Phil and he uttered an off-hand remark about me skipping church with my camera. Counter point. I got lost and tried. ??? or just as ??? I ran. There was a sauna for a few minutes on the way. I went in--it was a place to think. But I saw the urinals and realized I had accidentally gone in the men's sauna. I ran out. My project was a trampoline. I jumped in the shower, not haven taken a bath for a week. Christian applauded me. Keith sat behind the blinds there scared to talk. I nearly bumped right into Stephen. He screamed a notifying full of anger. I was terrified. I ran. I hoped to escape. I was in a movie theatre. Names and ratings of films flashed across the screen. I did not see any things I wanted to see. Me and Chuck were sitting in a car that wasn't moving. We were planning a trip. I was bringing up other people who might want to see Chuck, but he wanted just to go on the trip, me and him. A woman held up a doll to the window. I took a picture of the doll's face. Her face stayed the same. ??? When we were driving a guy tried to open the door from the outside. ""You can tell he's never experienced death,"" I said. He doesn't take it seriously. Me and Chuck were so comfortable in the front seat with each other. All stretched out and touching, right up against each other, not sexual. We drove past Miss Flora's house. It had been torn down. Trees had been uprooted. The swimming pool was still there. Chuck said, ""Betty, you're as relaxed as a boy with the whole day in front of him."" I was leaning against his chest. We pulled into a family campground. Cars with trailers pulled behind them were lined up at the exit. A patrol man was talking on a walkie talkie about the leads. One driver, he said, only had $20--taped to the inside of a tire to get home on. But the car was dependable, he said. A guy was sitting in the car with his girl friend and the patrolman went to ask him to roll down the window. It was major league baseball autograph week. It was Derrick Jeter, also called Black Jack Mulligan, in the car. The patrolman went to the window to ask for an autograph. ""You're Derrick Jeter, some call you Black Jack Mulligan,"" he said. They had to go to the bathroom. He was changing clothes inside the car with his girlfriend. I caught a ride back to the campground with a man and his wife, and wanted to go to the bath house to go to the bathroom. I pulled up young bamboo shoots and planted them so they'd grow into trees around the new lake. To make it look more natural. Derick and his girlfriend were trying to think of the right thing to say to each other. They were in the lobby. They were asking if I was gonna eat there at the diner. The girl and Derrick were trying to say the right thing to seduce each other. A waiter brought a dish--3 fried eggs and toast, called, ""3 eggs on the run."" The girl I didn't know, she said, ""I always try to join in on today."" I said, ""What day is it?"" and she said, ""It's Thanksgiving. Identical plates were helped and a table stood, full of them. From memory: Dora was sick. Very sick. She couldn't speak or move. I picked her up and carried her to the airplane. There was only one seat available on the airplane. I put Dora on the plane, because she had to go to the other place to get better. Then I tried to get on the next plane. Stewardesses were in the restaurant of the airport, because the next flights had been canceled. I waited. A stewardess was complaining about having to serve 7 kinds of salad dressings in first class. In coach she only had to serve 3 kinds. I finally got on one plane and transferred planes and got back to Dora. I carried her and laid her down gently on the ground. I sat next to her. Ackerman had been watching us from a parked car for 8 hours. I didn't know if he had been taking pictures, and I didn't care. I had collected 2 kinds of balloons for Rudy. Shiny mylar balloons and regular ones. Only one red shiny balloon was left. Nanny didn't want Rudy to have the balloons, but I went around on the merry-go-round and kept them there, tied to a tree."
"286"	"(04/04/2000)"	"I was walking down the hill with Sue. She was saying she was broke but she was buying a truck. A man as going to teach her to drive it. ""I've always wanted a truck,"" I said. There was a gym. I was late for class. Kitty was there with me. I had never seen a cat in a weight room before. She made herself at home. I did some weights. Kitty was walking around. The weight room turned into a thrift store, but all arranged by solids/stripes. I found an old cotton cut-up football jersey I loved. I was at a picnic. The Kennedy family had a tree house there. They had a tall ladder partly painted, partly just metal, not painted, that they took down when the press was around. They had a tall vertical sign, hand-painted that said, ""The Kennedy's"" There was a fountain. A very old concrete water fountain. I was trying to put a post in the ground for a volleyball net. The net was already attached. It kept leaning over and the net was not taught. I kept trying a few inches over to dig a hole. We tried to put the post into a metal drain. We took off the cover. Inside was a pool of water. A copper whale had been in the water, covered with the lid since we were little. It had a hinged mouth that moved. I said, ""Look, Rudy,"" and I held the whale out in my hand. A film had won for best documentary about whales. It cost $1800 to make. The film was about whales in captivity--the female whale had died and with her died any chance for baby whales. They put the male whale to sleep."
"287"	"(04/08/2000)"	"I was at a high school football game. It was night. Just before the game was over I got up and left. I did not know the score or even who was playing. I was suppose to go to my high school reunion, but when I walked down through the gate I decided to go play the piano instead. It was 11:00 p.m. I had played the first 2 pages of a Chopin Nocturne (in E flat) when Andrew came bustin' in that I woke him up and he was gonna write a complaint to the landlord. He said instead of me playing could we go look at my art upstairs. I said, ""Can I at least play the last page and then play the whole song once more?"" He said he would call the police. And could we go look at my art work or watch the TV. Then I said, ""NO. Because you're being a JERK. I thought you were a nice guy but I wouldn't even want your eyes looking at my art."" He said, ""Well can we watch TV?"" And I pulled all the electric cords out of the power strip at once--a fist full of electric cords. It was getting late. At 4 a.m. Evelyn came over and asked me to go to watch the Butterflies of Love video shoot. They were shooting at a bar on 13 St. Between 1st and A. I said, ""Are they about to start?"" and Evelyn said, ""About 6 or 6:30 a.m. they'll start shooting."" I said, ""Evelyn, that's so late (early?) and I'm so sleepy."" But I decided finally I would go meet Evelyn. I walked into the bar. There were many rooms and hallways. I went into one and it was a huge dark church--very dark, with velvet movie seats--dark, dark blue. Evelyn was wearing a dress like a little girl and had to go accept her certificate at the front. After Evelyn got her certificate I had to go home and boil some water before I met them. It was getting later. When I met them and it was a dark big room. Cameras were rolling out. Film cameras. I didn't see them, but I heard my name. They were at a table. William, Evelyn, Ackerman, a guy I didn't know and a girl there with Evelyn. Evelyn was entering a boxcar derby and talk at the table was getting serious. What could she build a car with? She didn't have much money. ""A shopping cart!"" I said. Evelyn wasn't sure she could win the box car derby in a shopping cart but then I started breaking off the legs and bending the parts to show how it could work. Everyone thought it had a good chance. Ackerman was happy that I broke and bent the legs of the shopping cart. He said he really admired the way I did that. I was filled with new confidence. I said, "" Evelyn, it's getting late,"" and Evelyn said, ""We need you for a party scene,"" and then it started. They were using a quarter horse in the shoot. He was buckskin colored and beautiful. They needed me to walk the horse down a long, long pier through woods with sand. The horse was tied with a long long strip of ripped canvas (like to paint on) about 9 inches wide and 100 feet long. I knotted it around my hand. I was talking to the horse. We got along just fine. I tried to tie the canvas around my waist--so not to lose him, but his lead was getting too long. We came to a swimming pool with steps. The horse wanted to go for a swim, so I led him in the water. William said, ""Merri--you and that horse are gonna be seeing a lot of each other!"" I was glad. I liked the horse. It was time for William to start singing. Their back ground dancers were warming up--gyrating madly. Girls of all races with proud belly buttons and long skirts. Hair pulled back from the face. I still had the horse. I walked back and forth on the long pier board walk to the shoot. I lost my balance and fell into a shallow-ish end of the lake. I could see the bottom covered with small dead fish--gold fish size. I didn't want to step on the dead fish. William said, ""Merri, don't be playing in the water with the dead fish. We're about to start shooting. Come on to the set."" I went, but I was all wet, having swum above the dead fish without stepping on them."
"288"	"(04/09/2000)"	"The darkroom had changed. It was an art and darkroom. New people and new projects were strewn all over the room. They were exposing chemically treated marbles to light. Burning and dodging them--but it was all one even color--neutral shades--but in color--fuzzy and blurred even marbles drying and stacks of paintings on large paper or strips of canvas. A tour group came in but I wanted to go dark and roll my film. I had to wait, so I left to come back. I sat a table with 2 ladies. They were talking about Rose O'Donnel and I got loud. ""I hate her, I can't stand Rosie O'Donnel. She's a fake and she's not funny--SHE'S THE MOST ANNOYING PERSON ON EARTH!"" The kids didn't know what to say. Corinne came to the door. We left to go to the darkroom. Corinne Christian was there and he was old friends with Colin (Coleen). A guy I knew--but didn't know who he is. Corinne knew. She had come to listen to me play the piano. I got my music. We still weren't dark in the darkroom. A lady was interviewing me for a scholarship. I asked her to repeat the 1st question My brain was wandering. The words were technical and meaningless. In a van I stared at Stephen--he would not look me in the eye. His energy was on the edge of the edge. Scary. Shifty. We rode past the mayor's house. Stephen yelled out the windows. In the darkroom were stacks of embroidery. Ladies had woven bedspreads of all kinds. They were neatly folded. One was white and knobby like lace. My mother had made it. A man in a suit held it--wanted to buy it--exclaiming how beautiful lit was. It was cotton with little fringe."
"289"	"(04/09/2000)"	"There were plans for a new building. I wasn't sure if it was new plans for the old building or new plans for a new building like the new building. There were elevators. I saw Theo. She was very happy. She was getting an electric keyboard. The building plan drawings had a drug treatment program located off to the side within the same building. ""Drug Treatment Unit"" was in lettering across the side. In the drawing a man leaned over petting a little dog. A notice was posted that doors would be fixed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, if anyone knew of a broken door, or if anyone just wanted one propped open--guards would move huge planters with plants (tree plants) to hold the doors open on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Andrea White had been cooking for 800 people. It was a big event for the building with dignitaries. Oprah Winfrey had on a guest who made a quilt out of dough. It was called ""Baby"" because she worked on it the whole time she was pregnant. It was ivory and navy, with patterns sort of like bandanas. Then it would turn to a natural (neutral) color. It was patterns. In the ink, on the dough, were the daily notes the man had written to his wife while she was pregnant with their baby. There was a meeting in the auditorium. She (Andrea) had cooked a native Mexican dish. Oprah tasted it and screamed. It was hot. She kept fanning her mouth and exclaiming. She had very long fake acrylic nails. I saw the quilt. I did not think it would be very warm and comfortable--old dough. I wanted to make my own quilt. I had seen bad art--terrible art and was determined to do something that mattered--took a year. Dora loved my quilt idea. The paintings I saw made me mad--terrible--a man dressed as both groom and bride, on the floor wrestling with himself. It was a bad painting of a good idea. The paintings were done by the people from the drug treatment unit. A man was feeling power over others. He had been intimidated too long. He was mean to a lady who didn't have any teeth. She cowered, but laughed contagiously. She had no money. Another guy was leaning--he tossed a drain into an empty grocery bag in a fire place--a quilted and non-working gold house. I had to do my taxes. I sensed calm. The man from Tibet's alps."
"290"	"(04/10/2000)"	"My father had been living at the Franks house. He'd been sick, he said. His feet were taped up. The Franks' side yard was covered with ivy through thin woods down to the road. Part of the area was for derelicts. When you passed a certain point to become useful to society a man gave you 5 dollars to proceed up the steps and think before continuing. Me and Tommy got $5 and went to think separately until we moved on. Dan visited my father and told him some crazy reason his feet were sick. my father told Dan it looked like the wind would blow him away. I was in a truck. A girl on a bicycle, not looking in the direction she was going (her head turned backwards) and rode right into the truck, but my father stopped in the nick of time. I was frantic. ""Look where you're going,"" I yelled. Another guy was riding a bike. I yelled, ""Hey John,"" but his name was some other name starting with J. I was at a grand opening and a big mansion. I was sitting on the floor. When I got up to leave I looked in the fridge for a soda. There were 2 cans, but I decided not to take one, because they belonged to somebody else. I didn't know who. When I got up I could see that there had been 2 people, sitting on a couch behind the column watching me. They were watching TV too. I had turned the TV off and turned it back on. A girl came to talk to me. I thought at first she was the younger sister. I told her this. She was happy she appeared younger. But by now her face was much older. She suddenly got tired. She showed me a big swollen scar on her left temple. Hair wouldn't grow over the scar, so she had an odd asymmetrical hairstyle. I was in class. I thought I recognized a guy from last semester, but it wasn't him. Because the girls were clustered on the left side of the room, and the boys on the right, they asked me to move my seat over to the boys side. So I did. When I left class I was roller skating down a wall. A guy was making me take my skates off, put high heel shoes on and jump down. I told him it would be much easier to jump down in my socks--a waste of time to put on shoes and take them off. We were in a hurry. We stopped at a rest area to go to the bathroom. The place was crawling with transvestite teen hookers of both sexes. I went to the ladies bathroom. The line was so long I went in the woods. Because of all the hookers, I told the European girl there was no need to use a rubber to just go to the bathroom--she screamed at me-- ""Don't tell me how to go to the bathroom--I'll decide that for myself."" I walked away. The teen hookers were strolling or sitting on the curb with hip bones showing over low-slung skirts. They sauntered languidly. One was sitting on the curb playing with his little puppy. It was weird to see that thin young boy--all elbows and knees, with a skirt and a bra and all that make-up playing so gently--just a young boy with a puppy."
"291"	"(04/11/2000)"	"I had asked my family to all draw pictures of the Simpsons. I drew 5 pages on typing paper. I'd shuffled back and forth and worked so long on them the paper was dog-eared and wouldn't stack even. Rudy did a few pages of the Simpsons too. Aunt Linda drew a bunch of cartoons of the state of Nevada on legs. There was a parade. I was wanting to go because they threw out free stuff--toys and snacks. But nobody could get it together to leave. I saw the floats pass through the window. Santa Claus had already left. This was a home for wayward teenage mothers. A woman photographer had intended to shoot photos for ads of the girls being loving, wonderful mothers--but the girl holding a baby awkwardly and despisingly at arms length--facing away from her. The photographer used this picture. I had left the window open and kitty climbed out on a tiled roof. I was afraid to call her for fear she'd lose balance and fall. I tapped the window lightly. She came back in effortlessly. A guy told me branches fall on the roof all the time and it was not good I let her out. There were a bunch of cameras. I needed to get the right one--my Minolta. When I came back it was gone. I asked the house mother and she said look around. It was the last day of the ??? Girls they'd given up on were being sent home for good. I went into the wrong room by mistake. On a dresser was my camera--with my film box stuck to it--I packed it up like I was gonna ??? but I had no intentions of doing that. I didn't feel like taking pictures. Women's group sculpture--bodies--on floor--bent knees/elbows. Sitting, lying--moving in reaction to the previous movements. Sometimes from across the room. Moving lettuce eagle on pulley swinging down from ceiling."
"292"	"(04/12/2000)"	"I was in Sarasota. I had gone back to art school. I found a place across the street in a Sr. Citizens apartment complex. At first my next door neighbors were 2 young gay men They had a Christmas tree that should have been taken out a long time ago. It was shedding needles all over the place. I took it out to the fire escape/balcony. ??? In a little closet, a hide-away ironing board was hanging in the closet. Now I had 2 ladders. The guys had a dog I walked sometimes. School was gonna start. My mother was there to fix the place up and make it look like a home. I did not like what she did. I'd rather have no furniture than the furniture she picked out. My hair had turned very light. I looked in the mirror. It was almost white. My mother had filled the bag with church shoes. I did not want them. A man came and said I took a pair of shoes out of a brown bag--I thought they were mine but they weren't. I looked back. First I had ignored him a long time. I said, ""They're mine."" I was in the water of the ocean with all the shoes beside me. Dora was sitting in the water with me. I was putting on and taking off the shoes when they were washed up. The tide came in very fast and deep. I felt around the bottom and found first one shoe, then the other--when I had found both shoes underwater--I looked up and the tide had come in deep--it was carrying Dora out to sea."
"293"	"(04/13/2000)"	"We were on a flat raft going down a river. On the banks were natives of the land--some in primitive dress--some in safari dress. It was in a hot tropical place--like a Tarzan set. At the same time it was happening it was also a TV show. I wasn't sure what was real. I hadn't seen the TV show. There were 3 of us and a nun on the raft. I said, ""I've never seen this before!"" and Dora said, ""You haven't seen this show? It's 'Nick Davis.' It's the best show ever. At that point the main character said, ""My name is Nick, Nick ______________________"" and I shouted something that rhymed with Davis, Dora shouted something that rhymed with Davis--the nun knew these weren't the right answer. So she shouted, ""DAVIS."" Right then a native on the bank shot her in the head. She was dead. She fell over stiff on the raft and ended up face down in the water. This was the plot of the show every week--the one who said his name right got shot. After she was shot, Nick Davis said, ""Whew, I thought I was gonna have to say my own name."" He knew what was going on. It didn't seem to bother him at all. I was working on a computer, knee-deep---waist-deep in water. The screen would reverse--the file disappear. I was frustrated. My coat was slung over the back of the chair in the water--soaking wet. A little girl, teenager in the water said she didn't like southern girls. They were all 5'7"". Dora was next to me. She was 5'7"" and her hair was wet. The girl said southern girls didn't have sex but used glass penises with babies inside. I said I'd never heard that. I told her I was from South Carolina. She said she lived in North Carolina growing up. I said, ""That must've been hard--they don't like Yankees,"" and she said, ""Yeah,"" A skunk was in front of the farm house. Rudy threw a white bucket high in the air, hoping it would land on the skunk, but it didn't. Then we were watching the skunk--he'd put on overalls, walking upright. We tried to figure out if he was mad enough to spray. Corinne's 30 X 40"" prints were spread out on the floor with quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies piled in the center to weigh them down. I took showers at the gallery. I had a beautiful green towel dress. 3 phones rang. Carlos came in."
"294"	"(04/14/2000)"	"I was at the high school. I wanted some coffee. I was behind the counter. I wasn't suppose to go there. It was partly like a diner too. It was the teacher's lounge. I snuck back there--there were 3 large coffee pots--all full of fresh brewed coffee. But just then a guy in charge came. I was sitting in the front with some girl friends. I didn't know them. I was trying on team softball shirts. They had slanted bold writing. I tried one on and I couldn't get it off back over my head. It was stuck and I couldn't see. The girls were now lounging provocatively. By the time I got the shirt off all the coffee was gone. I put on some more water and went to the bathroom. The teacher's aide stuck his hand through the window--giving me a tea bag, a pack of creamer and a pack of sweet 'n' low. ""I've already cleaned out the coffee filters and turned the machines off,"" he said. I slapped the tea bag flying out of the window sill and said, ""GODDAMNIT!"" The principal was how making an announcement over the intercom. He said, ""Please bring your old shoes, stools and coats to school tomorrow."" He was suppose to tell about the thrift store exchange project--but the way he said it, nobody knew what he was talking about."

Sometimes we worked in the type shop too. There were more than enough maids to do the work. In the hotel room were 10 guest beds. They were not all from the same family. These were the cheap rates. It was still daylight. My mother was in bed--waiting for sleep to come. Rudy was in another bed. He was cold. I tried to pull the window shut and close the many layers of blinds to block the wind, the cold air, and the light--so he could go to sleep. He said, ""That's better,"" and drifted off to sleep. I had made up a bed the chart said did not have to be made. I had lifted a glass shelf and brushed away crumbs and debris--the chart said this did not have to be done either, but I could see all the specs under the glass and it bothered me. ""What are those?"" I asked Ann, holding up stretched-out weighted foam sort of mittens without thumbs. ""Don't you like your toast hot?"" Ann said. ""Yes,"" I said. ""Then you should know--they're toast mittens. They keep your toast warm."" I had worked 2 hours and not done much. There were so many hotel maids this didn't matter. ??? maid. He was dead. Ann and I had been pilfering loose objects--we had a bunch of useless stuff. Corinne was cleaning a room for Captain Kirk. He was staying in room 1134, but I had trouble remembering it. I had put hospital scrubs in my bag and other stuff. It was too much to carry. I was weighted down clumsy. I was trying to find a freight elevator, but I could not remember the way. I couldn't find it. I had forgotten. I found the exclusive hotel sauna club. But I could not find the exit. I knew there was a freight elevator. Finally and share a beer together. By this time I had given Corinne the motel key. Corinne and Captain Kirk. They were going to be happy. But when I visited his room again across the hall there was too much to carry. Plexi-glass from ??? A guy with rape eyes offered to help me carry my stuff from 10th to 11th floor on the steps. We were on a fire escape. I shut the door. I told him I'd carry it myself.

"297"	"(04/17/2000)"	"I was going on an all-night bus trip to the beach as part of a group. We had a package deal. A whole hotel was rented to us and there was lots of waiting. The bus trip was long. Part of it I walked. Part I rode a bicycle. I had a mixed tape for us to listen to and a whole raw chicken to cook at a barbeque. I rode my bicycle carrying the raw chicken from the handlebars in a plastic bag. A man who cheated on his insurance was in a side car next to the cab of the 18-wheeler. He lied about everything. When we got to the hotel, the signs and carpet were green. First we sat in a huge auditorium, then went to our rooms. My room I shared with Elena Allen. She was sleeping. I went to wake her and point out the rainbow but I went to the next room and told the Asian girls I didn't know. They didn't understand English. When I went back to tell Elena I accidentally ran into her head. When I told her she didn't care about any rainbow--she went back to sleep. Day and night were all messed up. I left to check something at the desk and realized I did not know what room I was in. They gave me a chart to look at listing the girls' favorite make-up colors next to their names. I thought maybe I was on 7th floor or 11. I went to the asphalt playground. 4 butch girls with hockey sticks were playing hockey. Boys marched up a hill solemnly to play football. I walked over to tennis courts. They were just putting up the nets and hadn't spread clay onto the courts or put the lines down. They had learning rackets of Prince aluminum. The handles flew apart when you squeezed in. I told them I couldn't play with a racket like that, much less a beginner. They said they didn't know if the courts would be ready in a month's time. I went back to the room. An extra bed had been put there. A stranger's. They had put in a bed much bigger than the tiny ones for me and for Elena. I went to the beach. The day had disappeared. It was now 4 p.m. Young Asians, some with bleached blonde/yellow-ish hair were walking on the beach. An Asian girl and boy--both with bleached blonde hair were holding hands singling Olivia Newton-John songs. They could sing good--especially the girl."

A message was there from 19B Chestnut St. I knew this meant Nanny and Grandfather's house. They died long ago--but the message from them was in the future. Dora had no address to list her from, so I could not open the file. It was from a different place in time. A whole different dimension. When I tried to understand it--I could hear the circumference of individual letters rather than hear/see the words--the whirring of the vibrations from the shapes of the letters. Moonlight. Dora's message was there but had not happened yet. Eileen's message I wanted to open very bad. I could not open it because a map of the U.S.--the whirring of moving letters--spinning. The machine would not let me see, yet, a message from another time. It was locked away until the time had come. I was getting a list of important messages I could not see because they were not from places I could understand. It was another dimension."

They (the Asian guy in charge) ordered Chinese take-out. He ordered Thai for himself so that people couldn't track him down by his nationality and his favorite food. I ran with them. The girl was kind. The older boy-man was not. He was brutal. The little Asian boy stayed alone sitting high up in the pine tree crying and saying his name aloud. It started with an ""S."" We ran down the hill--hiding and looking for hiding places to hide during day time--in tree tops where they couldn't find us. The capture came to an unlikely end.

It was notched iron like a bed frame. The brothers came. 7 brothers. I was suppose to be with one of them. Marry one. But it kept changing which one. They loved music. I had wrecked their car. The little 2 room cabin they had was on the rock. A little bathroom where you had to climb through a window on the roof to get in was at a slant on the side. When I went in I pulled on the roof to climb into the window and the rock tower. The cabin was attached and came crashing down. First I thought it would fall on me. I stepped aside--it crashed to the street below--a winding mountain path. It took out most of the bathroom and their color printer that was in there. I went back and they were marching to the Barnum Bailey Circus music. I wanted to hear my father's swing music he had calm in his body. He leaned quiet against the fence. The brothers said they had not woke up enough. One brother who had been badly burned and had cancer and took to his bed. The other brothers marched around the perimeter of the field. ???

There was a moving braid of people--3 lines of people--moving and inter-woven like a braid of hair, and our thumbs hooked around a guide rope and slid like coat hangers. 3 girls were in front in long dresses. Bending their knees ever so slightly to dip to the music--without moving their heads or arms. The young girl forgot the 3rd dip and did it alone out of sequence with the others. The audience laughed.

Another boat was tied to it. We would drive back to the station in the boat. When I was driving I couldn't see. I was going fast. And suddenly lights appeared from the boat and I saw a traffic island with parked cars and trees in the middles of the lake. I went up in the air and ran into a tree house. There were kittens there. Little kittens. Just learning to walk. They lived on the second boat but when it filled with water they came to the main boat. We were taking pictures. A guy from the photo group, as we were going in a line around in circles, touched my neck gently and breathed on it. It sent shivers up my spine. He said, ""Should we go back to my room to sleep?"" and I said, ""My neck is just very ticklish."" Another guy went to make a drug buy. He was buying dope but called it another name. He and another guy went down an alley to make the buy. Cop cars appeared. I thought they'd been busted. An old lady had her pink glasses knocked off. They were shattered. She was sitting on the floor picking up the pieces of her glasses. She had a pink matching necklace that had been her mother's. It was intact. The cops put an old black man in handcuffs. They had not seen the drug deal. In the car the guys were driving and trying to do the dope. They didn't know how to open the bag efficiently. They passed it up to me and I was trying to do some but the dope came out in clumps. We were driving. I said, ""What you guys need is a plate and a razor blade to cut this stuff up with."" They did not understand. Cop lights came on following us. I picked the dope flakes off my sweater and ate them so when the cops came it would be gone. I doubted if I'd feel anything this way.

Tough black girls in various stages of undress waited in line and would beat you up whenever they got the chance. I skated away up a steep hill from the angry girls. They waited at a small intersection. I was looking to see which direction I went to. Left, right or straight. I was about 12 feet above them in my skates. I hovered down slowly, stopping with my skates. I was in mid-air. I could have killed them. They knew this and left me alone--stopped chasing me.

I found a pair of long silky black shorts. I had got a scholarship and I didn't know if I could schedule my classes. I had forgotten my chemistry book and I was looking for Mr. Brady. ???. It was very important. I saw Sarah Pratt in the school parking lot. She had gone away to have an abortion and the only school she could get into so late when she came back was Sarah Lawrence. She sat in a thick swamp with another girl and their school books--waiting for an over-the-hill past-his-prime country singer. On the way to his concert in a borrowed truck, we tried to remember as many of his songs as we could. When we got to the set, 2 homeless men and a homeless woman came in, showing him their feet--with only socks and asked for shoes. The girl crouched over to see and one of the homeless men picked her up. Then he picked up the other man. They were trying to show they deserved the money."
"308"	"(05/16/2000)"	"There were 2 little dogs. One was barely older than a puppy herself--about 1 to 1 1/2 years old. The other dog was 7 years old. 7 hours after conception the puppies would be born. The younger dog didn't want to rest. I coaxed her into a recessed square--about 5 square feet to lie across--not facing the other dog. Rudy went to give the older dog a break and kept the pillow case of puppies warm between his legs. Soon he said, ""I feel puppies,"" and little puppies ran out of the pillow case. Then puppies ran out of a pillow case the other dog had. Puppies were everywhere. my father kept calling and leaving messages that said he'd deposited $4,600 or $1,200 into bank accounts for me. A cop burst in demanding to know where my father was. my father had printed the money himself. Cops found me again at a trampoline in the rain. The cop was mean and rude. He did not believe me when I said I didn't know anything about it. I was at the beach with Paula. First there was a dance/stretch class. The man told us to stay in a back bend for 1/2 hour--but with our hands not quite touching the floor. Then we went to the beach. Paula and I had forgotten our bathing suits so we wore leotards. I cut the arms off one--only to find there was a tank-style leotard just like it (without the arms) already. I was looking for my sports bra to wear under it. Paula left to go play tennis and stayed till past noon. Our family was at the cheap place on the beach. Nice houses, but cheap because it was right in front of dangerous currents where you could not swim. Only this year--for the first time the currents were safe to swim in. We all played in the water and swam. My mother walked out of the water. There was sand in the bottom of her swim suit. Me and my father were still in the water, walking toward the beach."
"309"	"(05/18/2000)"	"There were little children wandering alone on trains. They were going skating. Or they hoped to. One little girl with blond thick wavy hair was obviously poor. She didn't know this so she'd talk to anybody. She was in her own world. She had on red pants. She talked to another little girl who was obviously very rich. This had no affect on the way they saw each other. Skating was more important. I was roller skating through moments. I had forgotten my ??? for days. I went to a grocery store. Apple Jacks were on sale--very cheap. I got a box and sprinkled Apple Jacks over a healthy mix of Asian vegetables. Ben was sitting on the floor looking at a drawing I'd done of a little Asian girl. She had on a red dress. She was a happy little girl. He asked me for the drawing. I said, ""I meant for the colors to be darker."" So he started to rip the page. But then he stopped and didn't rip it. He put it in a closed cigar box. We went. Then ran. I was on a train with Dora. She was standing. She had not combed her hair. I was curling her hair. I just curled the top layer. She was having her picture taken."
"310"	"(05/20/2000)"	"I was working with Geraldo. First we had some work to do under water. We were cooking in covered pots. We would cook the next meal. Then I was doing design work for both our writing. When I finished I was typing and designing what I thought was his resume. But it was in Portuguese. I would do it in Trade Gothic Bold Condensed. I realized it would take longer to type and proofread in a foreign language. There was a big event at night we'd been working on with Marianna. We got there early before the crowd to set up. It was cold. No one had eaten. They made an announcement about sandwiches, cheese and 2 other kinds. It was clumps of old American cheese on hamburger buns. Re-used cheese. Packed in little balls. A blind man was walking with a seeing eye dog toward the event. At the road I asked him if I should hold his arm to help him, but he said that would just confuse him. He'd rather cross with just the dog. Inside the submarine I was making raisin bran in the microwave. The bowl was too high but I filled it anyway. With the rocking of the boat, cereal and milk had spilled all inside the microwave."
"311"	"(05/21/2000)"	"We were in the parking lot of Laurens Plaza. It was very late at night. 3 or 4 in the morning. Kids were there, black children, as part of an after school program called ""Sign Out."" They had to stay till their parents signed them out. I was watching and playing with Will's group. She was an inquisitive little girl. We set up mathematical games on the ground of the parking lot. When William came to help she was mesmerized by him. He sat and played games with her--letting her figure out how to put things together. The Supervisor came to check on things. All she noticed was the state of the physical door. A door frame was sitting next to the doorway, not attached. She pointed at what part to saw off and fix it inside the frame. She did not notice William and Will. Me and Kevin were on our bicycles. One was a new mountain bike. One was an old clunky 10-speed with most of the pedals fallen off. First I took the mountain bike but then Kevin said he meant the other one, so I took the old 10-speed. We rode. An army surplus store was in the mall. We tried to spell its name. By now there were mean older tough black girls in the parking lot. One really mean girl got in the car with me. I told her she had to get out. I tried to lock the doors without appearing rude. We rode bikes up the hill. Steep. Mary Ganther asked me to call and send flowers to her brother on Mother's Day. I knew it was a busy florist day. She said, ""Tell them anything. Tell them he has rabies and needs flowers."" I skated toward a pay phone down hill on the 76 by-pass. A boy on the D train asked the conductor a question about a stop. He asked if there were 3 train changes ??? It was Christmas. We were at Aunt Jenny and Aunt Bill's house. Pictures had been moved on the wall. Chuck was there. He wanted to go to Atlanta but I wanted to stay with Aunt Jenny longer. I went later by myself on a train. When I got there it was night. On the train they had put an oxygen mask on me. When I slept at the house a doctor had put the oxygen mask on me too. I was feverish. The Brady's (Mr. And Mrs.) had a bedroom there. 2 walls were pink. 2 were white. There was an old, old cook stove from Grandma and Grandpa's--a wood cook stove with feet. Chuck said if you lived in NY too long you lost your touch. He said you had to get away to nowhere and find it again. Aram was growing roses on a trellis. He said they'd g row about 2 feet every day. The room was about 3 feet wider on all 4 sides than the bed. We wanted to cover the walls with climbing roses and let the leaves grow all over the floor--so the room was only one bed and a million climbing roses--so thick you couldn't see the walls. An elementary school had 10 principals. The children loved them. Dr. Seuss had drawn a character next to each principal's name. They were printed on plastic see-through bags."
"312"	"(05/22/2000)"	"I was working in the darkroom. Jasmine had brought a pack of her own paper because the budget guy was breathing down her neck. I had some kind of surgery. Jasmine was letting me recuperate in the darkroom. I was resting. People from class came to see me while I was sitting on the floor resting. It was time for the darkroom to close. A guy was trying to push in the windows while I was trying to lock them. He was trying to push his bicycle through the partly opened vertical window. He wanted to keep it there overnight. He didn't have a place anymore, he said. At the poolside Valerie Snyder was in a lounge chair. Next to her mother. The mother was brushing her hair. It was raining. I was running. I ran to the Empire State Building, because Saturdays between 10:00 and 12:00 they let people run up the steps. On the 32nd floor I met a woman with a baby stroller. And 2 children. They were looking for a bathroom. They knew they'd found it when the mother spotted a Burger King. There was a sign on the wall that said: COOKIES. This is where the bathroom was. (From memory, not on drawing) I was in a new class, a new semester. Jasmine was the teacher. She was making seating arrangements for the year. There were a few too many people for the class, so 3 of us, as our names came up in alphabetical order, were assigned seats across the street from the class. It was a construction site, with columns holding nothing up. And a big hole in the ground. Jasmine decided we couldn't see, so she was re-arranging the seating. While we waited, I had to run on a track, catch up and pass Stephanie Walters."
"313"	"(05/24/2000)"	"Me and Corinne were on a back street of Chinatown that doesn't exist. We were trying to roller skate. I had roller skates. Corinne had ice skates There was slush on the ground. Too icy to (roller) skate. Not enough ice for ice skating. Corinne had to carry her skates. A man in a car drove fast toward the puddle of slush. I wouldn't move. I yelled in his open car window, ""Where are we suppose to go?"""" Corinne said she bet Eileen cleaned her house like crazy before she went on a long trip. There was a gallery. A girl who looked like a dwarf--but almost tall enough to be a very short normal person was an attendant there. Her boss was a man dwarf. Her head was too big and flat on top and her arms and legs were too short for her body. She was saying she was going to cut off her hands and bury them in front of the back door. That she had already dug a grave and she was gonna bury herself a little at a time until she was dead. I started yelling at her. About Dora being killed against her will. And she (the dwarf) was alive and wanted to die and I was going off and angry. After that she was afraid to look at me and I thought I'd probably lose my job at the gallery. But I knew I had to say what I did. The kitty was licking between my legs, but when I looked down, I saw she had put almost a whole lacy full slip in there. I pulled it out. It was all mucus-y. Eileen had a word game for us. Envelopes of stories. The game was about the unconscious--revealing the mysteries of language connected with the unconscious. The game took years to p lay. We had to have very thick notebooks. Sometimes I got tired of writing and I drew pictures to get to the point faster. I could get the action of the movement instantly in a picture and the stories in sealed envelopes--and the games that went with them took a very long time. I went to Chinatown on a break from the language game. I was looking at vegetables. A Spanish lady asked me, in Spanish, the ingredients of a cookie. I didn't know much Spanish, but enough to tell her, ""Mantequilla, azucar, cinnamon."" She insisted there was basil in the cookies too. Veronica (Times Square) was dancing across the street in a pink long tu-tu dress with an orange striped tank top on top. She was dancing twinkle-toed and delicate. I watched her. There was elegance about her. I ran past Coach O'Rear's house. A painting of mine had been forwarded to an empty house. The house was empty because the man had been sent away to debtor's prison."
"314"	"(05/28/2000)"	"I was working in a factory that was a darkroom after everybody left at the end of their shift. It was on the edge of Brooklyn. After the people left I had to go around and turn off the lights and wait for them to fade out. The paper was way too high on top of a cabinet. I got one sheet at a time. I asked Ackerman a question. I was printing a picture of him. I turned the enlarger upside down and aimed it at the ceiling. Instead of using a negative, I put my head in the light and printed from the shadow of the light. The shape of the illuminated face. I had found something good and Marianna said she would stand by me till I made it. The prints were 24"" x 42."" A pile of laundry was on the table. The down jackets had just washed and dried. A man came and picked up the black one and the green one. He liked the multi-colored one but it was not his. He offered $10 for it but the man who owned it was not there."
"315"	"(05/29/2000)"	"There was a sale at the grocery store. A different kind of cereal every day of the week. I stopped at night in the rain at a Winn Dixie. A man was waiting for his little league baseball team to join him at the grocery store and got some of the cereal. There was a path off the room like the swampy Everglades, but more deciduous trees. Animals roamed wild. I walked with my mother down the dark path. She pointed out the silhouette of a deer far away. I stayed between my mother and the dangerous edge of the road. We ended back at a room in the hospital. I was in the room above. A man. It was after closing time. The doors were locked at a neighborhood store. In my bare room (a TV and a couch) the TV was on. An evil man busted in the door on the premise of watching the baseball game, but he started twisting my fingers as far as he could. He grabbed me and tried to choke me and the phone was dead. It was after closing. He applied more and more pressure. I was gasping for my last breaths and almost died. He was trying to kill me, and just in time my hands and mouth came open, and I got some more air. I noticed 3 people through the glass door. I tried to get them to see the message, ""HELP."" They broke the door."
