I don't want to go, and I tell Uncle Albert that someone is coming by to get me at 11:00 a.m., but it makes no difference.  Someone does finally come by for me, though:  Uncle Joe.  On the way home (or wherever we are going), we stop at an old school (2-storey) where summer school is going on.  I am to tell Pat Byers goodbye.  There are about 8 rooms on each floor.  I go to the door and look in each one.  Everyone is apparently having a lot of fun.  When I am spotted, I get in trouble for being out of class, but I explain that I don't go to school there and I have come to tell someone goodbye.  I am beginning to think that I won't find her when I see the back of her head, in the 16th room upstairs.  I tell her goodbye-I don't remember how..  By the time I go back outside, it is dusk, and almost dark.  I wait until dark for Uncle Joe, look around the building, etc., but can't find him.  I am growing worried."
"1-002"	"(1957-08-06)"	"#1-002 (1957-08-06) I go to a ball game with Uncle Ben and Aunt Aimee.  The ball park has lights, stands, very short but high wooden fences.  McAddo High is playing.  As I am standing by the bench, Coach Bowles tells me to play center field.  This means I may get to bat this inning.  The coach gives me detailed instructions on how to hit the pitcher-how to stand, what to look for, etc.  I look at the pitcher, and to my amazement he is just lobbing the ball.  And the fences-strangely wire now--are ridiculously close.  The batter just before me makes the last out.  Thinking the game is over, I walk out of the gate.  Then I find out that the game is not over.  I ask the lady selling tickets if I may go back in, since I just came out.  She says no, so I watch the rest of the game from outside the fence.  McAddo High loses.  Aunt Aimee says that some friends are coming by to take them home.  She doesn't want to ask them to take me home, so requests that I call Grandpa, Mother, or someone else to come and get me.  I am greatly dismayed.  It is 11:30 p.m.  Somehow I get home."

Grandpa finally has to do it.  I cry a while and then wake up, greatly relieved to know that it was just a dream.  After I go back to sleep, Grandma is showing me how to load a shotgun-wadding, powder, shot, etc.  She says to take ""3-inch balls"" out of a can and drop them in the barrel last.  By 3-inch, she means 3 steel shot about twice the size of a BB and one about the same size as a BB.  We then go into the woods to hunt.  The woods in Uncle Joe and Aunt Wilma's vacant lot in River City, I am pretty sure.  The first thing we see is a rabbit.  I lower my sights and track him.  Grandma keeps saying ""Shoot.  Shoot."", but he runs between us and a house.  I think the shot has rolled out of the gun barrel, but I am afraid to look down the barrel and see.  As we come to sort of a cliff, Grandma finally looks down it, and I was right.  We go back to the house and pick out more 3-inch shot."

I remember the last one well, because I saw a group of children in the road in the middle of the road-a pair of twins and another child, all about 4 years old.  Grandpa tried to straddle them with the wheels  When I looked back, amazingly he had done so with the twins, but the single boy had apparently raised his head while the car was going over him and was struck by something under the car.  When I looked back, the twins were standing over his body.  We ended up at Uncle Jack's, in a house similar to the one at 606 South Wilson."

It is so wide and thick with grass that with all my power I cannot strike a ball across it.  There are also numerous obstacles such as shooting around a corner when you come out of the first two wickets.  Once, when my turn comes, I see my ball lying within about one foot of another ball, but as I draw closer, I see that it is quite a bit farther.  I hit it, however, and upon taking mallet's length to take two shots, I must lie through a doorway or a wicket or the like.  This means I will have to swing almost parallel with this object in order to strike my ball cleanly and at the same time miss the corner of the object.  I shoot at another ball, about 25 yards away.  With the first shot, I miss the ball at which I am aiming by several inches."

She is real cute and has long, sandy hair.  When the monster comes on the screen, I hide my face so that I won't have bad dreams.  The next day, I believe, I meet this girl on the bus (in my hometown), and we get better acquainted.  She seems to like me, and lets me put my arm around her.  When we get off the bus, I hold her hand on the way to her house, which seems to be on Newton or Richmond or Sandusky.  At this point, she seems to be Phyllis Rogers.  She asks me if I want to kiss her.  I look up the street to see if anyone is around, and then I kiss her.  We go up to the house, and I remember I don't even know her name.  At this point she seems to be Emily Koch, although she looks nothing like her.  I take out my address book and sit down in front of the house.  She says her name is Emily Myron, and her phone number is (something like) J1-01J11.  Just as I am starting to write it down, her father comes to the door, a small, slightly rotund man.  I stand up.  He says, in a rather brusque way, ""Don't sit on my flower bed again.""  I say, ""Yes, sir, but I don't think I was.""  But I look around and sure enough there is an impression in the dirt, which I touch to make sure it is real."

There is a lady upstairs who doesn't seem to like me, and when we come downstairs I look up just in time to see two metal ornaments which she has dropped from the second floor landing rushing down at me.  I catch one, and the other crashes to the floor.  With this delay, I am the last one out of the museum.  When I get to the car, a station wagon with Mrs. Witherstone driving, kids are piled up in the back seat almost as high as the ceiling.  Mrs. Witherstone, however, is the only person in the front.  I figure there must be some reason for this, so I tell her I will ride on top of the car.  I sprawl out on my stomach on top of the car, but as she accelerates, I start sliding off, so I jump off before we get moving too fast and run alongside the car, keeping up quite easily.  Next, we are downtown shopping and we come upon two ""pee-pee stations"" side by side jutting out onto the sidewalk.  The front wall of these was made of almost clear plastic-sort of milky translucent but not completely transparent; nevertheless, you could see through.  Jimmy Creagar went into one, and Patty into the other.  Doug and Jimmy Duggan watched intently from outside.  I needed to go too but had no intention of making a show of myself."

She is very friendly and smiling.   Still in the post office, I think we are near a hydrogen bomb blast, or even several.  Every time there would be a terrific bright flash at the window, I close my eyes.

Whoever our catcher is (short and blond), he sure can fire a peg to second base.  I happened to notice that our third base coach looks remarkably like Grandpa, and I comment on this to the boy beside me.  I look at the coach's leg, and sure enough he has a wooden leg.  There are runners on first and third, and on the next pitch our catcher steps across the plate as if to throw to second.  We all think it is just a bluff.  But then, seeing the runner decide not to go to second, he makes a weak throw to first, which doesn't get there.  The runner coming in from third stops about 3 feet from home and watches the ball bounce a ways past the first baseman and doesn't continue until it is retrieved.  When it is, the first baseman's throw to the plate is high.  I make an instinctive lunge for it, but stop."

Patty asks him if he will put it down, and after a while he does.  We stop in the part of town where the girl mentioned in the previous dream lives and go around the corner to look for her.

While we are in one boxcar with the door closed, some anonymous person suggests the ""harmless"" trick of burning the place down completely, but I say we'd better not, because they might not let us come back.   Ronnie and I then go to the studios of WTIZ.  It is pretty early in the morning.  Ronnie works there or something.  Some disk jockey is gone, and Ronnie asks me if I would like to take his place.  I tell him I would love to, but that I am afraid I will do something wrong.  So he asks me if I want some breakfast, and I say yes, so he fixes me some.

I inquire around and find out that they have taken a rusty old piece of metal that they call a gun and the army is looking for them and will shoot them on sight.

"1-071"	"(1958-11-07)"	"#1-071 (1958-11-07) I am in church somewhere with long rows of pews-sort of like First Christian Church in my hometown.  Mother is sitting far to my right in the row in front of me.  While the preacher is talking, Mother starts talking to me out loud about something not pertaining to church; I can't make her be quiet, and Daddy won't do anything about it.  Pretty soon the preacher stops talking and begins just looking at us.  It is causing quite a disturbance.  Finally I can stand it no longer, so I get up and rush toward the door in humiliation.  When I get to the door, the floor there is on a terrific slant, sort of like in the Reflection Maze, down and to the left.  I grab the knob as I fall back.  The door comes open, my hand slips off the knob, and I start not sliding but flying backwards toward one corner.  I am horrified, because I am trying to make an inconspicuous exit.  I land almost on top of some lady I know (Mrs. Butler, I think).  Some people come around to the corner, and I hear one of them say something which indicates that they think my neck might be broken.  It isn't, though.  After I get up, I go around and apologize to almost everybody."

I have a great deal of trouble standing up for more than a very few steps.  It takes every ounce of my strength to rise to a standing position, and then I collapse after walking a few steps.  I finally make it, the last one in my group, to a little brown wooden building.  The instructor, a small, balding man with glasses, is telling how the school has a tradition to uphold.  The school is in England.  It seems that I get into trouble, but it is in Mrs. Loding's class."

The path down is very steep and covered with sand ; in some places there are roots poking through.  I have already been down it once and am with someone different this time.  I tell whoever it is to follow me.  It is necessary to run down the slope, and I have to be careful not to trip on the roots.  The sand beach at the bottom is very narrow, and part of it is part of the slant of the cliff.  It is at some body of water, perhaps an ocean.  It is night, and pretty dark, but there are quite a few people there, many of them lovers.  It feels very romantic."
"1-074"	"(1958-11-14)"	"#1-074 (1958-11-14) I always wanted a job, and somehow I am working on a project with someone I know but can't remember.  It's like this:  On a great platform about 5 or 6 feet high, there are many molds about 3 or 4 feet square, made of iron.  At one end of the platform is a pole about the size of a good-sized flagpole.  It is the end of a long machine serving as a conveyor belt or something.  It looks just like the rear of a 1958 Cadillac but stretched out to about 40 feet long, with scallops and dips in the whole length of it.  The molds have scalloped edges too-sort of like a cornbread stick mold or a knife sharpener.  From a pulley atop the pole, an iron block is quickly lowered by a rope which I hold.  Each one falls into a mold and assumes that shape.  Once, I get up onto the platform to try to do something to one of the molds, but the person I am working with says my hand will look like one of the molds.  So I use a stick instead, and retreat back over the molds.  The footing is very tricky.  There are also some large black oil drums.  I'm not sure what the ""Cadillac"" thing is, but every once in a while one end rises way up and comes back down.  On the opposite side of the machine is a large tree, and beyond that is a little store.  You can't see the ""Cadillac"" from the back door of the store because of the tree.  I take someone around the tree and show them the machine.  They are amazed.  I stop once and go in to see if Jim Wheeler has come yet.  He has just got there."

So I have to run past the others to catch up with my maid, Mary Lou Surrey.  Perry Rushton is the first duke.  He is tall and dressed in a long plaid shirt and green pants with frayed edges.  We come up the ramp at the back of the auditorium, and while waiting for instructions, we hear Mr. Firmentante announce ""Give me the crown,"" then ""And now your homecoming queen,"" and he crowns her right on stage, to our surprise.  I look at the audience, and there are only about 3 rows filled near the back, and Judson Schinn closer to the front.

It seems that it is only a matter of a few hours or a few days that we have in which to decide how to eliminate it, or else it will consume us.

However, the man was definitely my father, and the killing seems to have taken place four years earlier (as I found out later), when the boy was 14.  She told me to find him and kill him.  For this job I had a dagger with a 5- or 6-inch blade.  I watched for this boy mostly from the house, but ventured outside sometimes.  There was a sort of wooded area across from the house.  I felt sure that the killer was in the immediate vicinity, but I was still looking for a 14-year-old boy.  Pretty soon a fat gypsy came around the corner and told me he had seen a couple of boys running toward the woods.  I set out for the woods, wondering how I would go about such a task as killing a person.  I thought I would ask him first, ""Why did you kill my father?""  I felt the side of my leg to see if the dagger was still there, and it was.  When I got to the woods, I could see a few people at various distances, but realized that I didn't even know what this killer looked like.  Soon I came upon a clearing where the old woman and another woman stood.  They were just leaving, evidently from visiting a grave.  There was a garage nearby.  The old lady said to look through the crack in the door and I would look ""right at his nose; he's hanged himself.""  I reluctantly peered through the crack, and there, hanging by his feet, but definitely very much dead, was the purported killer, with his mouth slightly open in a sardonic grin, all his teeth showing.  He was about 18 years old."

I am getting really nervous as I watch the hands of the clock move.  The store is open, but the clerk is not there, and the place feels mysterious.  I look frantically everywhere but can't find the record.  Somehow I get Sharon.  We were supposed to see South Pacific, but it is already about 9:30.  Then, either at the shop or at Jimmy Creagar's house-the former, I think-I find a man and a woman dead and each slumped across a chair.

I start out in the car, but notice that my good blue trousers, my suit coat, and my white short-sleeved dress shirt are in the car.  So I decide to find a closer place to change.  I go to Longhorse St. and am going down it in the direction of our house when I see a streetcar on the tracks with nobody in it.  It has doors like a train coach on each end, and is almost covered in ivy.  I consider it as a place to change, but think someone might come along, and the ends are kind of open.  I think on the way home I will go through City Park and possibly find a place there.  Then it occurs to me that possibly I will see Linda Forestt there, since she is supposed to be camping at 10:00, and church started at 9:45, which reminds me that I am already late.  I go through the entrance to City Park and see a bunch of girls swimming in a pool.  I am surprised-the weather isn't exactly cold, but it isn't warm either.  I go on to Aunt Wilma's house to change clothes.  I don't have a tie, so decide just to wear the slacks and white shirt.  When I get there, all the girls (Girl Scouts) are there.

I talk to them a while and tell them not to leave.  Someone I know is in the car with them-not as a hostage, I don't believe.  The driver has a gun too, but I have the drop on him.

"1-104"	"(1959-11-01)"	"#1-104 (1959-11-01) I was in some garage, and there were two bears after me.  I tried swimming across something there, but one of them swam after me.  Even when I climbed up on a ledge, they could still just touch my feet.  I threw a small steel ball at one but missed.  I had a revolver in my hand, and there were some boxes of shells on a workbench, so I asked John Rayne to throw me a box.  He started rummaging through them but couldn't find the right ones.  Soon he and the bears went away, and I got down and advanced cautiously to the workbench, where I got some shells.  They were flat paper or cardboard with a hole through the middle and lined with cork on one side.  I then retreated to my former position but couldn't load the gun.  While I was there, a man came by in a car (a convertible) with the same kind of gun and demanded my money.  He said he knew I had $100, because he could see it sticking out of my pocket.  Actually it was only a $5.  I got down and went to the car and got about $30 out of my wallet.  But then I started asking him how he had fallen into this racket, etc., and kept him talking.  I asked him if he could show me how to load the gun, and he did.  Then I pointed the gun at him and told him to scram.  But he pointed his at me, and when I pulled my trigger the gun didn't fire.  He pointed out that I had the safety on.  Soon he seemed to be Martha Watson, and I still kept her talking.  After asking her what church she went to, I put my arms around her and kissed her.  Everything turned out OK.  I went in to Grandpa's house and told them the story."
"1-105"	"(1959-11-02)"	"#1-105 (1959-11-02) There was something like a basement full of water, the entrance to which was very narrow, and you could only squeeze through on your belly.  Randy Creagar and his dad were there, and so was Judson Schinn.  I saw some fish swimming around and decided to go above and try to get a knife so that I could spear one.  However, when I started back, someone would not let me take the knife; they thought someone would get hurt.  However, I found one just as good below, and while I was hunting, someone told me Judson had already gotten a fish.  I got out again and climbed the rise along the railroad tracks along Acorn Pl.  He had the fish, a pretty nice-sized one, cut open and was cleaning it.  (Another note about the ""basement"": from the outside it was like an aquarium with the water and the people in it like an underground canal with a cutaway view.) I went back down the rise and some kids were sitting on a blanket and some newspapers.  One of the newspapers was open to the movies listings.  It seems that maybe Jody or Peggy were there, and some girl who was ""Charley's"" (Wallers, I believe) girlfriend-a rather young girl.  I don't remember whether Charley himself was there.  I liked the girl very much.  I asked how long she had been going out with him, and she said one (or maybe four) months.    I wanted to ask her to kiss me, but I don't remember whether I did or not."
"1-106"	"(1959-11-02)"	"#1-106 (1959-11-02) There was a small frame house, the kitchen door just inside and to the left of the front door.  Jim Nudd was inside.  Somehow the house caught on fire, in the kitchen.  Jim came to the kitchen door and was nearly hysterical with amazement.  ""Good Lord."" he kept saying, ""what a terrible fire-it's awful, it's awful.""  The flames could only be seen once in a while, licking past the edge of the front door.  Soon, however, Jim had to come out, and he was still raving about it.  He was bare from the shoulders to the waist and was redder than a bad sunburn, all the way to his wrists.  I was red too, but not as much as he was.  We went to a tree some distance from the house.  I stood forlornly, and soon put my head against the tree and started crying.  ""Don't give a damn about it, Gilbert,"" he said.  ""But there goes my past, my memories,"" I kept saying.  Although the house did not look like it, it seemed to be 506 Woodburn Place in my hometown."
