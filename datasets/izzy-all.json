    "description": "This dream series consists of 4,352 dream reports, written down from ages 12 to 25, by a young woman out of her own interest in dreams, and with no interest in dream theories or psychotherapy. The series is unique for the early age at which it begins and the frequency of reports in the teen years (ages 13-19).\nIt may be interesting to compare the Izzy series with the dream series that was tape-recorded by \"Jasmine\" from her early teens to her mid-20s, and with the dream reports written down by \"Bea\" at ages 14 and 15.\n(For more information about Izzy and her dream series, including the \"cast of characters\" in her dreams, click here.)"
