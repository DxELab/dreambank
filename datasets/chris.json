    "description": "Chris was a Wall Street businessman in his 50s, and the happily married father of daughters 20 and 18, when he wrote down several hundred of his dreams out of his own curiosity between June and December, 1968. He later sent 100 of them to Calvin S. Hall. He served in the army in World War II and traveled widely thereafter. He was also a transvestite, which is what makes this series unique.
