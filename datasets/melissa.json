    "description": "This excellent and important series of dreams comes from a highly intellligent young girl at three different ages: from 7y5m to 8y5m for the first 67 dreams, 11y0m to 11y9m for the next 14 dreams (\"part 2\"), and 13y0m to 13y1m for the next 8 dreams (\"part 3\").  There is every reason to believe that these are authentic dreams, as explained in the further information below.  It is the first series we know of from a person of such a young age.  A quick comparison of the three subsets of the series shows the kinds of similaries and differences we might expect based on laboratory studies of children's dreams.  However, the series has never been studied in depth.   (For more about this series, including an interview with Melissa's mother, click here.)"
