    "description": "Madeline is a young woman in her 20s who gave us her dreams a year or two after she graduated from college. Her series is unique in that it stretches from childhood to early adulthood with only occasional interruptions. This series was studied by members of a college class, who then asked her to answer a series of questions, many of them concerning the class focus on religion and spirituality. Those questions and her answers can be found in Madeline's \"Further Info\" file."
