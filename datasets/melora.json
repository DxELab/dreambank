    "description": "\"Melora\" was a 23-year-old college student, the wife of a graduate student in psychology, and a new mother when she tape-recorded 144 of her dreams between June 19 and December 1, 1962. This is a remarkable number of dreams for 5+ months, making this series useful for  studying the consistency of dreams over a short time period.  Since she often remembered two or more dreams a night, this is also a very good series for anyone who wants to search for similarities in the dreams of a single night. Then, between January 11, 1963, and  September 24, 1965, she wrote down another 67 dreams.\n\nThis series is invaluable most of all because we also have 128 of her husband's dreams for the same time period (see \"Melvin\"). It is interesting to compare how often they dream of each other and of their little daughter, and to see how each portrays the other. Their dreams from the same night also can be compared, but it must be said that an earlier comparison of the two series by Calvin S. Hall did not turn up any patterns.\n\n(For further information about Melora, click here.)"
