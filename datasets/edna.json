    "description": "Edna is a congenitally blind first-year college student whose 19 dreams from October 1948 to January 1949 are of great value because she explains the various sensations -- primarily auditory and tactile -- that allow her to gauge the elegance of a restaurant or know how big a room is.  She also provided researchers with her explanations for some of the content in her dreams, describing tensions with her father and her attraction to her handsome 27-year-old dancing instructor.\n\n(For Edna's comments about her own dreams, click here.)\n\nFor the many people who ask us if blind people dream, and if so \"how,\" this dream series is the best answer we know of; but see also the series labeled \"Blind Dreamers.\""
