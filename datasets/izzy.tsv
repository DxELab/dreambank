"0024"	"(2003-03-15 (12)) I went to Farrah's new house. Someone said something about a Neopets march, so we went in the car to find it, but we got lost. I met Billy Boyd. The end of the line was really far and was in the street. We got Pocket Neopets."
"0025"	"(2003-04-22 (12)) I was friends with Eric Christian Olsen and a boy and a girl. I was going out with Eric, but the girl didn't know. We were on this small island with about 20 houses. We were standing in a driveway. The girl left and Eric said to the boy ""She doesn't know me and Izzy are going out"". Ezra was flying a plane and dropping bombs that were exploding about 2-3m away. He was trying to bomb us."
"0026"	"(2003-04-26 (12)) There was a prom. We were at West Whitehall and I was going out with Eric Christian Olsen. Sometimes everyone was called to my block and we had to stand in two lines with our prom partner and me and Eric had to say something. No-one knew we were going out and we stayed away from each other during school. I sat with Farrah and some of her friends near her block. There was a spooky thing happening in the block. We couldn't go in or we would die. I looked because I heard someone crying. I ran away and this thing came out. Charlene and I ran near our block. Charlene, Eric and I were in some water."
"0027"	"(2003-04-26 (12)) We were at a haunted house. I got separated from Eric Christian Olsen and I was really upset. This thing kept killing people and they melted into a white blob thing."
"0028"	"(2003-04-26 (12)) Dinosaurs were alive and were killing everyone. We were at Mom's house and this guy who made the dinosaurs told me and Eric Christian Olsen to call for pizza. We rang people to get rid of the dinosaurs. Then we were somewhere else, outside, throwing flares at the dinosaurs, and we ran out of them so we threw nuggets at a plateosaurus -- which was actually a good dinosaur and helped us get rid of the rest of the dinosaurs."
"0029"	"(2003-05-23 (12)) I was in the future and the world was really weird. I got out of some thing in the ground. I became friends with this popular girl. She liked boys with big lips. We were at a shop. She said ""when our lips met"" and I thought she was talking about Aron, but she was talking about Gavin. He said something and I was really angry."
"0030"	"(2003-07-16 (12)) I was at home out the back, around the side of the house. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) had to go somewhere and he went down a toilet. I was really upset. A little while later, I was in the big shed and I was doing a spell to get him back. He came back and looked pretty annoyed. But it wasn't because of me because we started making out near the wall across from the shed."
"0031"	"(2003-07-16 (12)) Dad had all the Children of the Corn movies on DVD and a Vault of Horror movie. Farrah, Ramona and I went to some old lady's house, I can't remember what we did, but we then pretended to be asleep. They believed that I was asleep but Ramona and Farrah said that we weren't asleep."
"0032"	"(2003-07-16 (12)) I was in some caravan and everyone was in groups which were parts of the body. Charlene and Farrah were staying there too. I didn't have any clothes on but they were wrapped around me. This lady came up to me and two boys and said that we should join the vagina group. You have to touch the part they say to join. We got in trouble for saying no. These little beds were in one corner and there were lots of blankets. Under my breath, I said ""Stupid cow"". As I was getting dressed (I covered myself) I heard someone say ""Look what that kid's wearing!"" and I looked up and saw Eli (Children of the Corn 3)."
"0033"	"(2003-07-17 (12)) We were at a hotel thing for school races. I was sharing a room with Tatu (the band) and Katherine Heigl. School races were on bikes or foot. It was really hot. Outside there were these rock things and a little tower. I won each time (3). Tatu, Katherine Heigl and I snuck into some guy's bedroom (I think it was Brendan Fehr's) to find something for Katherine. I got bored and left. Tatu hid under the bed. I left and saw Brendan coming so I knocked on the door. Katherine got caught. Tatu got out after he left. Tatu and I got an ice-cream and we were riding our bikes. The next races were at some lady's house. They were water ones. We had water masks on. I won again. She had a blowup pool and on the second race I got stuck with someone and so we could move I said something about pools and slid into the pool and everyone clapped."
"0034"	"(2003-07-17 (12)) I was near the beach with Dad. A guy came up and asked me to be in the next Charlie's Angels movie and then the three actresses came out of a caravan, so I said ok. I was in the car with the three angels, but then Lucy Liu left. I went to the shop with Drew Barrymore and I was looking for a pocket knife, but I couldn't find one. As the shop was about to close, some old man found them."
"0035"	"(2003-07-18 (12)) I was friends with some popular girls and Farrah. We were somewhere weird, which had tunnels and you had to go into rooms and find clues. Everyone hides at some point and then this ""monster"" thing comes in and picks a hiding place. Whoever was hiding there leaves. They left me behind at the last room, but I was the one with the clue so I won."
"0036"	"(2003-07-18 (12)) I was at a party-like premiere type thing. I went up to Daniel Cerny, who was sitting at a table, and put my hand out and we walked off hand in hand."
"0037"	"(2003-07-19 (12)) I was at home, except I didn't live there, and it was extremely different. Out the back there was a huge tower (where the big shed is supposed to be). The house was huge and really high. I was in the pool room and Eli (Children of the Corn 3) and I were trying to get the ceiling to fall to kill the people in there. It did, but the people playing pool lived without injuries. We jumped down into this big pool thing. We went up to the top of the tower, and were talking about how to kill everyone. Some girls were in the room next to us, so Eli sent the floor up and it killed one of them. Eli went to kill some more people and I went up to the tower. When I went back down I went to put my shoes on and someone was asking me why I wasn't with Eli. Eli then walked past with a bag and went to the tower. I went to go up but he had blocked the stairs with a small bomb. I ran out and he came out after me, throwing them everywhere, some people were dead, but everyone else was inside. We ran to the front of the house. The house was burning and Eli and I were holding hands. We then went to a big fancy house, that had this little room that was open with a small TV on inside. We watched it until we saw someone in the bushes, so we ran out the other door, but there were lots more people. Some lady shot us with these magnet things that slow down your heart rate and makes you pass out. Eli's heart wasn't slowing, and he was breathing normally. I couldn't breathe properly and the lady was saying, about Eli, that it wasn't normal/human. I grabbed Eli's hand which gave me a boost. They took us to this lab where we passed out for about 5 seconds. It gave us a boost. We were throwing sharp things at them. I killed 6 people. I got some pins and was sticking them into people's hearts. I said to someone ""I wanna be your friend, do you like this friendship badge?"" and then as I was shoving it into them I said ""How do you like this?!"" There were screw things in some people's heads. I saw Dad (and he was being all zombie like) and we didn't hurt him. We smashed some motherboard."
"0038"	"(2003-07-19 (12)) I was pregnant and I didn't want the baby, but no-one would let me get rid of it. I had a rare disease thing which would make me get pregnant. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) and I smashed down a house and everyone in there died. We ran off."
"0039"	"(2003-07-24 (12)) I was in the car, going home from school. Eli was a new kid in the class."
"0040"	"(2003-08-10 (12)) Mathias and I sat next to each other in class. Then we went to this camp thing. Mathias and two girls went into this house and this man said something about angry school teachers. He shouted ""Eli!"" like that bloke in Children of the Corn 3. He let me stay in the house, but I had to sleep in the same bed as Mathias. We covered ourselves with raw meat to keep away wolves or something."
"0041"	"(2003-08-19 (12)) Ramona had been hanging around Gavin and while he was on the computer and I was at the listening post [Year 7 class] , she was being a cow and said to Gavin ""and I've been ruining your life too""."
"0042"	"(2003-08-20 (12)) Gavin was staying at Mom's. We got to Mom's, but Mom had to drop me off at school (it was during school) to get something. Teacher-F-04 was there and then she wouldn't let me leave. I found Gavin and we got Mom to get us (I didn't have my phone with me). We went for a walk and something happened with these kids, but I can't remember."
"0043"	"(2003-08-21 (12)) Gavin and I ran off and there was a building on fire and we kept running off together to get away from these men, but I can't remember why."
"0044"	"(2003-08-22 (12)) I was at school, and I had weird lolly/chocolate things. I was sharing them with Cedric, who was sitting next to me. I went to walk out and Gavin was acting weird, and I thought he was going to ask me out. I went into these woods and Cedric and Mathias were there chanting something. The only way to get out was by going through these puzzle rooms. I finally got out."
"0045"	"(2003-08-27 (12)) Gavin, Terrence, Tiana and some other kids were at the beach with me which was next to my house and a big shop. I went to the shop and took a big whiff of this ugly green and white nighty (which I could smell, and it smelt like this disgusting green sauce that was on some octopus that I had). It was disgusting. We were all hanging around near a stage. There was a competition going on, on the stage and Gavin kept staring at me. This thing was trying to kill us. Ezra came and followed me out of the house, so the thing saw us and we went next door to call someone."
"0046"	"(2003-08-28 (12)) We were in the library at school. Terrence said ""You like Izzy?"" to Gavin. I was right next to them with Tiana. He looked at me and said it was true. He kept staring at me."
"0047"	"(2003-09-11 (12)) Ramona and I were trying to get Gavin and Terrence to hide because these people were trying to get them. Ramona went after Terrence, so I went after Gavin. I grabbed his arm and got him down the ladder (of this playground), but then he disappeared. So did Terrence. Then we went looking for them."
"0048"	"(2003-09-11 (12)) I met up with Tiana, at this shop, who was lying on a lounge with the green blanket (from Mom's house). I went to a clothes shop (which was across from Tiana) with Mom. Classmate-F-11 was there and we were laughing about Dodo Derrick."
"0049"	"(2003-09-11 (12)) Me and Ezra had books and had to get down a weird waterslide. I got stuck in a flat bit because Ezra was sticking a book up to do something."
"0050"	"(2003-09-12 (12)) I was in the back of the car and Gavin and some mates were walking but staying right behind the car. I looked at him and he saw me. We went to a video shop and he stayed at the car. I went out to the car because I was hot. He left a note in my book about drama and how Classmate-M-13 (guy at school) had tripped someone over and some other stuff."
"0051"	"(2003-09-16 (12)) I was at some school carnival. We had a race. Gavin was sitting with me and talking to me. I saved some little kids from the big waves."
"0052"	"(2003-09-17 (12)) Cedric, Ramona, Classmate-F-10 and I were standing outside our classroom. Cedric and Ramona were doing some crime scene acting. Cedric said ""I'm home, honey!"" and leaned over and pretended to kiss Ramona, but Teacher-F-06 walked passed and he kissed her on the cheek. Cedric and Teacher-F-06 were a bit shocked, but the rest of us found it hilarious."
"0053"	"(2003-10-03 (12)) I was in an episode of Taken [I had never seen it at this point] . I was at school but it was different and these bomb things kept going off."
"0054"	"(2003-10-03 (12)) I went to the dentist and I started screaming (I don't know why) and I think I passed out because I woke up and my mouth felt funny. I told Mom I knew what she did -- while I was passed out, she had got my tooth done."
"0055"	"(2003-10-04 (12)) We were in groups (our class, different school) and I sat next to Gavin. Cedric and Mathias were also at our group. He started singing one my songs ""but everyone thinks you're straight"" (it's called 'Gay' and no-one has heard it). I started joining in as well. He kept following me around."
"0056"	"(2003-10-04 (12)) I was walking with Ramona and Tiana at some place. I told them I had a dream about some fancy king and queen and I was in a dirty singlet and it was to help some group. Tiana's brothers -- she had an older and a younger brother [she doesn't have an older brother in real life] - started jumping around singing with their shirts off."
"0057"	"(2003-10-09 (12)) I was at some weird place and I won a children's Music Idol. I bought heaps of Goosebumps books. There were lots of library things. This scarecrow man out the back had a little kitten."
"0058"	"(2003-10-10 (12)) I got bitten by a vampire and I got Mom in the car and then I flew to the car. Her window was broken. I saved her from the others. We went to a hospital and got Tim (Final Destination 2) and we had met him before. We kept running away from vampires. We went to some place and a vampire threw a needle at me, so I said that I was a vampire and showed him the bite. I got Mom out of there. A chemist blew up. We got out of the state and stayed at someone's house. These vampires could be in the light."
"0059"	"(2003-10-17[?] (12)) [On holiday] I was somewhere with the people from Music Idol -- I was talking with Cosima DeVito, Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll. I was in a spa with Cosima and some girl called Rosa. We were then running and hiding from some killer."

"0062"	"(2003-11-03 (12)) Me, Ramona, Tiana and some other people were at a toy shop. I went to the back aisle and Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street) was there. I was teasing him and I did three times, then he tried to shoot me with lasers from his eyes. I ran out with Ramona and the rest following. I got out and Terrence got a hose ready and Freddy was still inside trying to shoot me. I got sick of dodging the lasers, so I screamed out in pain, and he stopped, thinking I was dead. Terrence got the hose on him and he melted, which I thought was strange since his weakness is fire."
"0063"	"(2003-11-03 (12)) I was in some weird jungle. I left a towel and water bottle there. I went back to get them. Something started chasing me."
"0064"	"(2003-11-04 (12)) I was at 'Ramona's house'. Her room had a little door that you had to slide into. I was staying over, as were Ezra, Charlene, Tiana, Gavin, Terrence and Cedric. When Charlene got there I told her that she was sharing a room with Ezra. I went to the toilet and Ariana opened the door and I started hitting her. Ramona was hiding from her father and I snuck into her room and we climbed out the window and jumped some fences and got to the gate. Her father saw us, and I couldn't get the gate open and I realized it was a dream. Ramona couldn't open the gate so we went back to her room. I was kissing someone earlier but I can't remember who."

"0076"	"(2004-01-26 (13)) Ezra and I were in the water. The only way to get out was to get over this platform, under which an octopus/squid lived under. We kept trying to get on the platform, but the squid thing kept coming out. It grabbed me and pulled me under and I couldn't breathe. I got up onto the platform and the squid thing bit me on the right side of my hip. I jumped up and got fully out of the water. [When I woke up, it hurt where it had bit me] ."

I went into this room with some others, which was a mirror maze, but you couldn't get back through the door. We all held hands as it kept getting darker. I got to the end and went through door into this waiting room. A friend of mine, called Suzanne stayed with this old man. I left that room. I went in a room with a chocolate cat person. It changed into a fluffy cat. I threw it into a light and it burnt up and hissed and died and went green. I went into another room and died. I was then a ghost. Ariana could see me, but said I was blurry. I helped Dad to find a friend of mine."

He came to our house. He and Ezra went into my room to find my diary. I shooed them out. I got my diary and went to the games room to put it in my safe. Ezra started talking to me and I put it down and Julius was behind me and I thought that he had read it. He took it but then put it down and I was bashing Ezra asking if he read it."
"0081"	"(2004-02-16 (13)) I was on this big hill thing during Phys Ed. A little pit bull chased me down it. While we were in the Phys Ed room, Julius was in there watching me.

I recognized him but couldn't remember who he was. He had his legs folded and his hands were clasped on top, and he had this big grin on his face.

Cedric was walking up the hill and I fell in love with him. Then we walked over to the side of something near the sea. A big wave knocked us into the water. I grabbed him and we swam back to shore."

This guy took me to the ""dead place"" and told me to go somewhere, but I realized they were going to kill me and so I ran back. I was staying in the dead place but I was still alive because the guy (even though he was old) liked me. I fell off a cliff and Ezra saved me."

"0103"	"(2004-06-14 (13)) I was at a market, and I went to dinner with this guy. But he was someone special's son, so I wasn't supposed to see him. I was then at dinner with Nana, but Granma reckoned that I was supposed to be going to dinner with her."
"0104"	"(2004-06-20 (13)) I was at some freaky place. I had two puppies called Chico and Widget and they were the same size. Some crazy stuff happened. I took Mom's car, but it was a manual, so I took the auto. I drove out to this place and got in and it was like a jail. I got Eli (Children of the Corn 3) and we went back, but the cops were chasing us."

I ended up at Kingsway shops (except it wasn't). There was a McDonald's inside. This Native girl and her friend were putting their face on this machine and stuff happened -- they turned French, blind etc. I was getting people and Widget into McDonald's. We shut these glass gate things just in time. Stuart (QAF) was there. There were about 8 or 10 people. I saw a tunnel and said that some people had to go through in suits and close the big shop glass doors and suck the air out. Some guy asked why I was the boss. Three people, including Stuart, said they would do it. We went through the tunnel and a big auditorium thing was there. We kept going and they went out and shut it. Then we were all inside the big shop again. The air started to clear up, so we went outside and saw some animals, and we let them in, but the air started coming back, so we shut the doors, but Stuart and someone were still outside. I ran through the tunnel and saw Stuart feeding this cat. I started banging on the window, and he looked up at me and he finished and ran to the door. I was going back and he caught me in the auditorium. We walked back. Later I saw an orange cat, the air was clearing and so we let the cat in. The air started coming back. Stuart was yelling at me to get back inside. I got back and had to lock the door. Stuart wasn't in sight. I found the keys and locked it. I went to find Stuart. He was in a bedroom."

The guy went into the back and the girl went to get in, but zombies (Dawn of the Dead remake like) got her. I drove off. I got out of the car, and the guy died. Some girl helped me into a big dark underground thing. She told us to stand, then didn't let others stand because zombies were watching. We all got up and went up this slide. She left and told us to stay there. The others wanted to go but I made them stay. She got back and we ran outside towards the sea. We swam and a zombie bloke came after us. We drowned him and got on a boat. [note: I referred to the zombies as 'DOTD ppl' LOL] ."

There was a little house nearby. I went there and there was a big, fancy girl room. I went into the closet where there were lots of dresses and Goosebumps books. Zombies were coming so I went back to the boat. A kettle was being evil. Zombies broke in but then they turned normal because they liked us."

A while later, Ezra and I were in the lounge room. These bad guys that had held up Captain Spaulding (House of 1000 Corpses) walked in and asked where Mom's pickup was. We said ""Out the back"" and he walked back out the front and said ""I'll be back in a sec"". So I closed and locked the doors. A few minutes later they left and we went into the office. They had taken my monitor, which was worth $2000. We ended up in Cash Converters at Northlands and they were there. They drove off and we went in and found out that they had hocked it for $500.

I was wearing my light blue ""MB"" shorts and the blue top with brown sleeves and had been for the last few days. We got to the next arena place and we had to defeat John Travolta. The other guy (call him Joe) started fighting him and they both had some cool moves. Joe won and I picked him up and kissed him, saying he was the man (all friendly stuff) for beating John Travolta. The next two ""Gods"" were a face of a lady in a square box (who Ezra talked to and that's what you had to do, because she was lonely and then she left) and the last one was the ""oracle"" (who was a face of a lady too). But when Ezra got there, we told him the whole thing was a joke. Then we were at some creepy China town place. They had little animals, and one tried to escape. I cuddled some cute animal. We had to get special cards from a lady to go places. We talked about getting costumes for the quest thing and John Travolta had said to get good escape gear and I wanted to go home to get my shoes.

The girl chased after him and when they stopped she jumped into his arms and it turned out they were cousins. He also did some bouncy stuff in a shop.

Ezra ran down the steps and the guy shot and Ezra and Dad said ""FBI! Freeze!"" and shot the guy. We all hurried into the car. Then this other person was having a party and all these famous people showed up. There was this girl (a celebrity) who got romantically involved with this stupid guy.

Then the dog took some clothes and we were told it was part of the show. But I hadn't brought any clothes. Jillian was there and some fat women. I borrowed clothes off Jillian to wear and some from a fat girl. Jillian said something about me stretching her clothes. Also this lady said to the girls something about wearing a bra and I said I wasn't because I forgot and don't want the responsibility. When I got the clothes off the girls I went into the toilet and so did the fat girl. I got changed and when I came out, Mickey was outside the cubicle covered in the fat girl's blood. Something also happened at Nana's but I don't remember."

We threw it next door because no-one lived there. Some people from Jackass were there. There were these invisible buildings which you could walk through that sent off signals to the bomb and stuff. There was this train and it almost hit someone but the signal stopped it. I was then at a toy grabbing machine. I wanted a toy they had of me and I had got a toy, some time before, of Dad. There was more to the story, but I don't remember."

So I backed away, but Ezra followed saying it would only affect people far away and then I argued that people over the other side of the world weren't getting affected. I didn't get a reply though."
"0242"	"(2005-01-24 (13)) I was at a shop and I had Mom and Porky with me. Everyone thought Porky was cute, except for one noob. We were driving around in these gold cart things.

We tracked down people to a castle thing. I don't know what happened, but we got passed (I think we shot some) guards and then this person caught us and people or something were shooting things at us. None hit us and we escaped with ""important information"". We picked up a call that was meant for other bad guys. They were saying stuff in code that I worked out and they had said something about a playground. Victor Garber's handwriting I mentioned earlier was seen because he had written a letter that I was reading at the castle place. It explained some information about the castle. He had weird t's that looked like the t shown in the diagram, but they were cool. We were at some desk place. There was one person per desk and people were inspecting them. I opened a door and some guy was there and I was apologizing but I actually had to go in to get some messages. Then we were at the playground. The bad guys were almost there which we knew because we could hear their car. We left two people there with a note saying ""Do not harm or we'll play Jay-Z and some woman singer [don't remember who] "" and they didn't hurt them."

I turned around to say something fusty and then I 'dreamt' what would happen, I can't remember what was said, but it turned out badly. When I finished the 'dream', I couldn't find him. I think I found him again and I 'dreamt' again and I saw Jennifer Garner and he was making out with her. Then I finished that dream, and I don't remember what happened properly, but we found out that we liked each other and then we supposedly had sex, which I don't remember and then we were lying in bed and he said something about some Banana in Pajama's banana's penis and I said something how he couldn't have sex because it was probably smushed when he was born."
"0248"	"(2005-02-02 (14)) Some crazy guy came over looking for Mom. Her car was here, but she wasn't. I told him this and he threatened me with a knife and I told him again. Then he drove off and Mom came back. Mom and I went to the shop, a deli, and they had Blade costumes. There was Blade and some fat lady one. Mom got Blade for me, size 69, which was really small, though it was a large/medium. Anyway, it was too small and I wanted to go back but she didn't. Then I was at school wearing it and then I scared some evil spider off. Jayson was writing something about his birthday and I said I forgot to do that this year and he thought I was just copying him so I got on the computer, but could only find prev [can't read, starts with a p, and is possibly 'previous'] . This happened at a cemetery? The crazy dude came back. Someone had a baby. Johnny Knoxville was there, but he was some ""Apple"" guy. Then the father of the baby got killed. Johnny put his clothes on and sat in his truck. It had a big playground area for an animal on the back. I saw him and he motioned for me not to tell anyone so I didn't. I got another costume, which was size 71, and it fit. Some people came and we said the baby was dead. They thought it was a joke and we made them run through the house to get out and then I found out that the baby was alive."
"0249"	"(2005-02-04 (14)) Kaitlyn, Jocelyn and I were friends. We were in class at some weird place and I said something about Fat Nicki and Kaitlyn having a fight and Kaitlyn got upset. Jocelyn wrote me a note or email saying I was cool, but I shouldn't have said it. Something happened at a video shop, but I don't remember."
"0250"	"(2005-02-05 (14)) Louis and Gage (both Pet Sematary) were at a park place with lots of trees. Louis was in a tree poking an octopus and trying to make something collapse. There was some toy that kept being advertised and Gage wanted one. In the park, I think someone was murdered. A holocaust of some sort was happening and Louis was either trying to kill or protect Gage, but I don't remember which."
"0251"	"(2005-02-06 (14)) There was this person I knew who could 'call' water and control it. Some 'friends' and I were at this creepy place and there was a flood thing. My friends and I were only a few of the people still alive and we were at this school looking after some noob kids. Some retard chicken hatched. We left and I ended up at a shop place with escalators. It started flooding, and we all started running up, but I realized I would get caught, so I jumped down and swam back to my friends. The water girl also caused a little wave while we were walking. And there were people holding a meeting."
"0252"	"(2005-02-07 (14)) I was friends with Yelena. There was a hotel with creepy monsters. Also, Yelena said she was my friend, but she wasn't my best friend but she was? Her ex, who was hot, came back and she asked me to write a list of the hotest guys out of a list. George Clooney and her ex were on the list. Also there was a creepy taxi guy."
"0253"	"(2005-02-07 (14)) Veronica lived at home and was fat and disabled. I threw her because I got angry and then she and Dad went to a hippy party. I spilled honey on my school shirt. Dad had a party book thing."
"0254"	"(2005-02-09 (14)) There was a holocaust happening on the 21/3/05 (the day before the Green Day concert) and it did. Bombs fell from the sky and the house was getting destroyed and then me and a heap of others were in space and then these aliens put us in this big spaceship. There were lots of people. Ezra and I were together, but we couldn't find Dad. The alien explained that 2000 years ago something happened and it would cause a holocaust on this day. They had being trying to stop it since. I was worried about not seeing the Green Day concert and my stuff and the pets. Then they said that little brothers could come and pick a dog for the family. I walked off for a second and Ezra came back with a big brown puppy. I said to call it Chico and Ezra said that it was a gay name. I also complained that it was a big dog and that he should've gotten a smaller one. Then I saw Mom and Darren and they had a black and white dog. I told them to call it Chico. Then Ezra said ""I thought ours was Chico"". I was upset because I hadn't known whether Mom and Dad were alive or not."
"0255"	"(2005-02-10 (14)) I was at a house which had a pool and my class was doing swimming. The house was spooky and in the walls were big scary rooms. I think there was a shop ""attached"" to the house. The room filled up with water and me and this lady had to run and close the door, but the door was going to open because of all the pressure. We ran into the store to a container of water and then the water came but was coming over in little waves. We ate M & M's and there were gnomes. We opened a door and the water was gone."
"0256"	"(2005-02-11 (14)) I knew 'Jesus' who looked exactly like Jim Caviezel. We were close. There was this place, a cemetery, where Jesus' grave was. It was hell hard to find. Anyway, these people kidnapped me and I knew them a little and they took me to the grave. They were going kill me because they didn't like Jesus or something. Anyway, the ground was shaking and no-one seemed to notice. Jesus was coming to get me."
"0257"	"(2005-02-11 (14)) There were two freaky frogs. I was in a sandpit playground with the class. I was looking for money?"
"0258"	"(2005-02-13 (14)) Something happened and my phone broke or something. I went to this shop and the guy working there told me to take a free phone cover thing but none were for my phone. I remember Michael Palin was there somewhere, but I don't remember why."
"0259"	"(2005-02-14 (14)) There was this girl called Cheyenne, who looked a little bit like the real one, but she was foreign. The real Cheyenne looked different and had a different name. She wanted to be my friend and kept following me, but she couldn't speak English. I was in a toilet and the door was munted because I went to the special toilets, there were two sections. One section had loose doors and was for noobs, and the other section had better doors and I changed to a good toilet. Mom, ""Cheyenne"", and I were in a car and Mom was taking us somewhere but I don't remember where."
"0260"	"(2005-02-19 (14)) I was at a fair thing. There was a little shop and it had Monty Python and the Holy Grail figurines and I was looking for one of Galahad and I complained because there wasn't one, but there was. The fair was scary, really dark and spooky. Mom and I were in some weird town place and we had met a famous person, I think it was Michael Palin, at a little coffee shop on a corner. Also, at this fair was a little supermarket. I lost Mom and there were these aisles with Green Day poster things everywhere and then it was outside and I went on a water ride slide thing and there was another girl and Terry Jones and Michael Palin were in a car in a show and it kept changing."
"0261"	"(2005-02-22 (14)) I was at school and swimming was on and I don't remember properly but some people were evil. Then something happened and I was on this little planet thing which had gotten a bit blown up and the aliens from it had come to Earth. This other noob was on it and nearly fell off, but Zim (Invader Zim) was there and saved him (he wanted to use him for something). Then we were on this train and it was spooky and there was a shower and when we went under it we got sucked up to this kooky place. The alien guy said it was a ride and we went again. I went under the shower but then it was third person view and it turned out the alien guy took me because he liked me."
"0262"	"(2005-02-23 (14)) I was at school and I was hanging around with Liliana and there were lots of fish and we kept looking at them. My science teacher was wandering around too. I was also at Nana's and this guy who was actually my math teacher Teacher-M-09, was trying to sell these cheap games, and Ezra and I kept running from door to door so he would go there, thinking someone was there and we also had a tunnel thing. He found out what we were doing and then tried to find us and he was evil."
"0263"	"(2005-02-24 (14)) I was in England. I was with Mom and we kept turning up at this material factory, which was in France or something and the guy there tried to shoot us. Also, at this shop they had all this Monty Python and Fawlty Towers stuff and Monty Python movies -- like Alien 3D. Then Granma and this person who had a really fat kid were around too. Fat kid went to lie down on a trampoline and Mom got Granma and fatty to go. I got lost from Mom and ended up in France. I asked this bloke, who looked like Teacher-M-05 and he spoke English, to help me, and he said he would. After a while I found Mom and I got rid of him but on our journey I had gone to Mom's car. When we got to the car he tried to take it but then I did these hell cool moves and he got hurt and we left. And this girl and I opened up a shop with these weird things and everyone was buying them."
"0264"	"(2005-02-25 (14)) I was at Mom's and I was in her room. I looked out the window and saw these people coming out of a car, two women. I knew they were bad and I went into my room to hide, but the daughter of the two, who looked like the one from that gay Mayhem movie, checked all the rooms and found me. I can't remember properly, but they took our stuff, including my phone, all our phones, but the young one gave me a phone, for some reason. She kept calling me and teasing me because she had my phone. Mom and I went to the car and they had pulled it apart taking stuff, although one part of her car they didn't check and it had one of Mom's phones, so they hadn't found it. The people came back and I was complaining because they took my phone and she ended up giving it back to me."
"0265"	"(2005-02-26 (14)) I was at Mom's and all the guys from Monty Python were there, except Gilliam and Idle (ie Chapman, Cleese, Jones and Palin). It turned out that John Cleese, Michael Palin and I had this sort of love triangle going on. I also went to school and my English teacher, who was called Teacher-M-02, but wasn't him, and I also had some fusty thing going on and I was doing well in English for that reason. I was also in a class and the people were singing the Lumberjack song and I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts except it said something about work. There was also a big stage. Something bad happened though. Then or before all this, we went on a school camp thing. Terry Jones and I were sharing a room, why he came on a school camp I do not know, but we had this little room. Anyway, someone knocked on the door and it was a guy with a creepy mask on. I kept screaming and laughing. Then he left and I said ""now a real evil person will come"". The door opened and an evil person thing was there. Then Terry ended up on a cross, upside down, but he was ok."
"0266"	"(2005-02-27 (14)) I was at Midvale High School except it was the start of Year 10 and it looked completely different. There were millions of kids there (just for Year 10). They had a shop at the school, like a Target, and an electronics store that was open all day. I got bored and crawled down this hill, through a hole in the fence and earlier on, I went to the shop and I wanted this jumper. There were two big change rooms, a girl and boy one. I didn't wanna change but I went to go back behind a cabinet and I don't know why but they took my shirt off so I could try it on. Whitehall High School people were there and they were being evil. Also, Dad and I were at this shop buying pencils and we got these Monty Python things too. Later, I wanted to go back to the shop, but I couldn't until lunch or recess because they would wonder why I was there. Later, we had a freaky camera thing and we could fly and stuff and we went to this building to take pictures. There were freaky people around."
"0267"	"(2005-03-02 (14)) I was at home in the office and we had heaps of computers and two offices. My computer was going crazy so I got up to see what the problem was. The light in Ezra's office was flickering and then it would go off and then it started giving electric shocks. No phones were working and we needed to get a hold of Mom. But then she turned up with a torch. We were at a cafe place. This guy kept talking to us about something and then his wife left him. Then these two scary old people wearing makeup made him and his wife some dinner with strange vegetables. Mom was saying how her painting was taken by Nana 20 years ago. Nana was like ""move"" and then took 'her' painting from a box. Some street name was Chollatel or something. At school we had to picture we were in a cemetery. Then, the teacher, Ms P asked me a question about using an 'ajouk' board. She meant Ouija board. We were playing a board game. We also talked about noses and I had a cold."
"0268"	"(2005-03-04 (14)) I was at school and I made my own computer. There was a little tube thing I used. Then we had to go into groups. Cheyenne and Jocelyn went to go in one group. Derrick got this guy to chase me because I embarrassed him or something. When school finished I went to this place where I had got a mouse from to ask if they were special. The girl was pale and fat and ugly. We also went through a drive thru and the girl serving us had braces and she was hard to understand. Then 'today' we didn't go to school."
"0269"	"(2005-03-05 (14)) Ezra, Jayson and I were at some place that had Chicken Kiev. But it had maggots and stuff in the building. We cut the Kiev open. Then we were all sitting/lying on this glass thing which was sort of resting on this other thing, so when we moved, it would tilt (in the air). There was another one near us, which two people were dancing on. We turned to look and then Ezra made it go spazzy and Jayson and I fell off except some glass part came too and Ezra was fine. We fell into the water. We got out and there was this futuristic place with all these buildings and there was a little boat thing that went underneath the place which was on top of the water. Now, one part of the story was that I was old and I was thinking back, and the other was that I had dreamed it before, but before we knew Jayson, and he was replaying it in first person, and then it was a movie we hadn't seen for ages."
"0270"	"(2005-03-05 (14)) I was with Mom and at first we were at a place with Porky. She was running around and then we had to leave and I told Mom that Porky was out, and she told me it wasn't her that she was in the boat or something. I ended up jumping out of this cart and running back to get her. Then Mom and I were at a fair place. We went on a freaky ride with lots of old people. I said to Mom that I was going to sit on the edge, but some old lady had taken my spot, so Mom sat down elsewhere. I thought I would have to sit next to someone else, but a seat was free next to her."
"0271"	"(2005-03-07 (14)) I was with people from school and we were in this creepy house place. Someone told us to go through it all with one light, which I had. We were walking through and I can't remember what but something scary popped up. The place was arena like. Also there was some game where you had to kill this werewolf snake, except it didn't turn into a werewolf. We found it and we were killing it down to its last health, but we needed wolf bane so I got whoever was with me, to go and get it. Then we killed it."
"0272"	"(2005-03-09 (14)) I was hungry and Mom and I went to a petrol station to get food and a car was crashed near it and then it blew up. For some reason, we couldn't go to the petrol station. We snuck back to the car and then Ezra and Jayson did too, because there were these ranger people who liked stopping people. We got in the car and one guy came up to Mom's window, but she drove off. They followed her and ended up crashing into us, we got out of the car before it blew up, then the ranger people died. I was starving and somehow I had managed to save some stuff, we kept trying to get a ride, but people thought we were bums and kept saying no."
"0273"	"(2005-03-09 (14)) I was at a video shop and we were looking for movies. I went to ask Mom how many Species there were and they were right in front of me. The highest was 19. Gattaca was there too. There was also this movie of us, which I can't remember what happened, but it was stupid."
"0274"	"(2005-03-09 (14)) I was at a place that had some books; I think it was a library. There was a group of people, all ladies, wearing a few different clothes, but about 3-4 people were wearing the same outfit. There was a man, but he was a crazy retard guy. There was a bookcase next to him and I was trying to look, but his arm kept flapping. Somewhere else, Dad mentioned how he liked it when Ken (A Fish Called Wanda) yawned or something."
"0275"	"(2005-03-14 (14)) I went to school and people were talking about a new Beatles song. I don't know what it was. They also kept saying 'Paperback Letter' instead of writer. Then I was in the library and Svetlana, Yelena and I were doing weird colouring-ins and playing Uno. Some people were also wearing Green Day shirts. I sat at a table in S+E, and then that gay Classmate-M-30 guy also sat at the table and a camera kept moving. There was a strange map. I had a shower at school and Mom was supposed to be taking me to get an x-ray but she sent me to school for a bit and I walked out of the school."
"0276"	"(2005-03-16 (14)) Mom kept calling Will Smith, and his 'servant' answered the phone and Mom said she was a friend of his. Mom rang back again and Will answered and then hung up saying ""Stop calling me!"". Anyway something happened and Will was over here and I knew him and we found all these different coloured tablets -- ones that would make you want to increase population, watch comedy, get stressed, calm down, get nervous etc. He chose the dark blue one -- to increase the population. He turned into a girl, who decided to be my best friend. We went to a cinema and I found that I could create more rows of seats with people from different times. I made one that would have Michael Palin in it and then I went down and sat next to him. I said hi and he seemed shy or nervous or something. I asked him what the date was and I don't know what he said and I asked the year, and he said 1963. I thought, 'Ok, he's 20'. I started chatting to him and he got up and then motioned for me to follow. He went to a place where they had DVD's. He found A Fish Called Wanda and he was going to get it for me, bit I didn't want to tell him that I had it, so I told him about a special one that I'd seen only at a video shop and it would be cheaper, and we went back to the cinema. We sat in the front row next to each other. He started kissing me, and I was giggling. He was kissing me like when parents kiss their babies, all over their face. My old pal, Will, was getting angry except it wasn't actually Will anymore, but I'm not sure what happened, but the Will thing got angry and we had to go somewhere. I got in this Ute thing and Eric Idle got in the other side to drive. Graham Chapman hopped on a motorbike as did Terry Jones or John Cleese. Not sure which one. Michael and Terry/Darren got in a car. I waved to Graham, maybe mistaking him for Michael. Ezra was in an ice-cream truck thing. We got to a place where they were building a building. I ended up really high, hanging from a rope. I was about to let myself go, when people came around the corner and tied rope to my foot and I went back and I was ok. I caught up with my friends and there was a game where you pick which presents to give to which animal thing."
"0277"	"(2005-03-17 (14)) I was at some place. I was in some group with Liliana, Classmate-F-18 and some other randoms. Liliana had driven to the place we were at. I was walking around some of it and I walked past Ms Hampson and I think that guy, I think his name is Classmate-M-25, was also with her. Then I past that other Darren guy playing tennis by himself, and he hit one backwards and almost hit me."
"0278"	"(2005-03-18 (14)) Mom had just picked me up from home and there were police cars everywhere. We started taking all these strange roads and for some reason we got out of the car. We were walking and this drunk guy came up and said to Mom ""cracking piece of crumpet"". He said something about me and guitars. I was like ""What?! I'm only f-f-thirteen!"". We ran away and I called Dad and then we hid in a ditch thing at a park. A policeman drove past and somehow Mom took his car and then got me. We stopped for fish and chips and then we were driving and in lots of places there were police depots? We went in and I remembered to get keys. The lady at the office thing let us in and we were messing around with videos of this lady whose car we had taken. Luckily, she looked a bit like Mom. They had a big DVD player. Some people thought that she was different. The lady gave Mom name tags and she had to put them all on the right person. Then we were allowed out. I went home and I left my bag up on the street. I remembered and ran back to get it. It had stuff missing, like my phone. These two guys were there and one of them had my phone and I snatched it off him and got my jumper and the other put my bag high up in this tree. Then Loren Dean and some other person came by, they were friends of Mom and they were cops?"
"0279"	"(2005-03-19 (14)) I was at school or something and there was going to be a Monty Python live show with Graham Chapman somewhere. The teacher told me I missed it on the telly."
"0280"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) I wanted to walk to Germany for some reason. I thought we were in London at one stage and Mom said ""No, we're still in our country"". I wanted a drink of water and we got a cup but I threw it away after having a few drinks and I said I dropped it. We were near a lake thing."
"0281"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) There was this creepy place on the edge of an island, it could have been the edge of a country or something and there was lots of scary water. I think Ezra got lost in the water, except he was younger, like 3? But he got out alright. There was a medical centre too, which was scary looking. I think we went in, but I don't remember."
"0282"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) I had to kill these 3 guys because they had a jewel thing which was needed to stop some evil thing. This building had exploded but it looked ok. Upstairs there were evil things, made from a good effects computer game. I killed two of the guys and one was Will Smith. The third guy was in a car with some person and they had locked the doors. I got them to come out and explained to them why I was doing it. The third guy came up to help me. It was all effects up there. It was all made of holograms but I still had to pass it. I was at a 'Timezone' place. It was pretty evil. Mom was there too and you got heaps of points, but it was really hard. There were strange people around."
"0283"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) I lived in this house with Graham Chapman, his sister [which he didn't have in real life] and his mother. Later, it turned out that Graham and I were engaged. Anyway, I went to a pub place which was joined to the aforementioned Timezone place [but it was a different dream] . I got home the same time Graham got home and so did his mother, we went to go in but his sister, I think, was on the phone and we listened to her conversation which didn't make sense. We went inside and I cleaned up the sister's room with a piece of paper which sucked things up. I went to my room and was cleaning things up properly, when I heard someone whistling. Graham had opened my door a little and was whistling some song. I turned back around, but he continued whistling and it was annoying. I asked him what he wanted and he said ""a kiss"". It was just a 'peck' [Sims wise] but then it turned into a 'smooch' or 'makeout' (it was extremely vivid, and I can remember how it felt and tasted). I think earlier on in the dream, Graham and his sister had tried out this new trend, which was walking around naked, but Graham didn't like it. Also when we were all walking home, I hugged a pillar near the house and there was 'ae' written on it and I said ""I love a's""."
"0284"	"(2005-03-21 (14)) Dad, Ezra, Jayson and I were sitting on this high scaffolding thing. We were all sitting on thin bits and kept almost falling off. We saw this hamster in a hamster ball and it fell off this cliff thing onto the road. Then it got run over. Dad and Ezra kept pretending to push me over, but I somehow stayed put. We then tried escaping but it was no use. I don't know how we got out but then we had to find some dead kid and get something out of him. We walked through this scary swamp and he was there. I had to light a match/lighter to go through him (he was a ghost though). We got the thing we were looking for. Dad had made me wear rubber boots. There was a flashback of something. Then we were in a puzzle room like Banjo Kazooie. The kid flew off and we had to jump into the picture to find him."
"0285"	"(2005-03-21 (14)) I was at Granma's. I ordered some free thing over the net to her house. It was Christmas but it was December 5. I kept asking why it was earlier but no-one knew. I went downstairs and there was a package at the door. In it was an old That's Life! I opened it and it was mine from 2002. I showed Granma and then Mom came and she took me to this place and said that the package and been picked up and the right one was dropped off. Wherever we were, there were two animals that were dead. I was standing close to one but I moved back because I thought it would get up, and it did. It hopped into the bushes. Some people from Monty Python were there. Mom pretended to drive off, but she accidentally did and I had to quickly jump into the car."
"0286"	"(2005-03-22 (14)) I saw this movie called Puke, which was a true story about a guy who got killed by a shark when he was on a pole and the shark jumped up and bit his head and then the shark died on the pole (it went through his middle). It was a hammerhead looking shark. I was telling Mom about it and I said that there was a real picture of it on the net of him, but I hadn't found it."
"0287"	"(2005-03-22 (14)) Mom and I were at a train station. She had to meet someone and lots of trains kept coming past. I almost got hit by one."
"0288"	"(2005-03-24 (14)) I was at Mom's and we heard gunshots nearby so we started hiding our stuff. The people got to Mom's and were messing around at the top of the stairs and I was trying to get Mom to hide my bag. She did, but I ended up getting them out of the house. They were both girls by the way. Mom complained about me having so many animals. I had had a pet sheep called Aaron and I had also had a pig. The moon was big at 12 and when I got Mom to see, she thought I was playing a joke on her."
"0289"	"(2005-03-24 (14)) I was at school and we had to do sports. Teacher-M-07 was our co-coordinator. No-one wanted to do sport though. There were SNSET people there and the teachers thought it wasn't fair for us, so when the SNSET people were gone we had to [I think SNSET's were speds] ."
"0290"	"(2005-03-24 (14)) I was at a shop. At first I was at an internet cafe with Ezra and Jayson, but I had no time left, so Mom and I went to the shop. There was an ice-cream shop and I was having a look and my tooth started hurting. I found Mom and I pulled my tooth out and it was a baby tooth. Farrah was on the floor being annoying. I didn't get an ice-cream. I was then at home in the bathroom and the doors were closed. Farrah and people from school were there too and we were hiding. Someone knocked on the door, so one girl was trying to get him away, and then I had to get rid of someone else. Later, a vet came; he was odd and was wearing weird clothes. I tried to tell him I didn't think any of our animals were sick but he decided to have a look anyway."
"0291"	"(2005-03-25 (14)) I was at Midvale shops except they now had a beach thing in the carpark. It had waves and stuff too. Ezra and I were getting into the car and I noticed all the water was gone. I didn't say anything and we got into the car. Valerie was there too, and she was with us and her and her kids wouldn't get in the car. I then realized all the water was built up in a huge wave. I screamed for Dad to get in the car but Ezra said ""We're gonna die aren't we?"" and I said ""Probably"" and then I decided I didn't wanna die so Dad got in the car and drove off before it was too late. We were safe. We went back though for some reason and it was all calm again, we went back home and everything was fine, but we realized it was happening again so we drove away. Then somehow I ended up in a car with Mom and we drove to this place that was causing the problem. They didn't do anything but they gave us a wireless computer mouse [my mouse stopped working last night] . We drove back again so that I could get my Monty Python DVD's and then it happened yet again and we drove downtown and I asked if we were going to stay at a hotel and we were. It was smelly though, and I was in the garden (it was night time) and there was a cubby house thing, and an old man, that looked like the 'It's' man, was or had told some boys to come up to prove their bravery. One boy did and the man told him to pretend he was getting hurt. So he started screaming and then his friends were laughing because they had set him up and then they had to jump off into this mud pit."
"0292"	"(2005-03-27 (14)) Ollie (Kingdom Hospital) was doing something. I can't remember properly but his last name was Skeckillson or something."
"0293"	"(2005-03-28 (14)) I was at the Royal Show. The first thing we saw was a ""Pat-the-Penguin"". It was a kangaroo in a penguin suit and we thought it was a penguin at first and then it was a person inside and we realized. I went to go into a separate part of the Royal Show. They said I had to be 15+ to go in by myself. But Mom came and I got in. It had all the waterslides and stuff. We left that bit and I went back and I was allowed in. I went into this toy shop and a lady from before said no people under 15 were allowed in. And she read out something about ""no smelly girls or boys under 15"". And I said I am 15. She said ""Oh. When's your birthday?"" and I said ""25 January 1990"". Then she asked me what term I was in. But I didn't get it at first. Then she asked when Baby Day was. I was like ""How should I know?"" Then I said today, because I had seen a poster with a mother and a baby. I was right. I was then backstage somewhere. I was there with some people from school. Also people were building a building over the water and Mom and I almost fell. Jocelyn and I were also walking around somewhere near the penguin thing. Also something someone had was ultra rare but I can't remember."
"0294"	"(2005-03-29 (14)) I was at some spooky place. People were coming back to life as zombies. I can't remember properly but Dad, Mom, Ezra and I and a few other people were the only live people left. We were wandering around looking for food and I ended up in a Thai restaurant. I went in and got some spaghetti in a bowl. I ate some but an evil person came and I hid under the table but he saw me. I 'paused' the game and he couldn't see me, but he stayed waiting and it wasn't actually a game. Anyway, somehow I got out and met up with Mom and company. We got to the gate and got out of the city. Then I said what if the gate was closed to keep them in. Then we heard them coming and we went to Nana's."
"0295"	"(2005-03-29 (14)) I was at school and some guy liked me. I can't remember much else, but I climbed up a hill and was at a house, and Nana lived there."
"0296"	"(2005-03-30 (14)) There was this house somewhere and I was there with some other people. There was Mom, Jayson and Ezra. It turned out that Jayson and I had had sex. Luckily, it was just implied. Anyway, I wasn't too worried about it and Mom was angry. Mom was trying to have a talk with me in this room. There was a poster on the bed, and Jayson was on one side of the bed, with a picture of Tinkerbell, and on the other side, a picture of Orlando Bloom. I hid next to the bed under the cover and Mom whacked me with a piece of wood to see if it was me, but it wasn't hard and I didn't move, so she decided I wasn't under there and then I popped out. I left the room and I walked past a room with a poster with 'Ugly Elephant Olyphant' on it. Timothy Olyphant was on it, and I thought it was hilarious for some reason. Then I heard a song playing on TV. It sounded like Red Dragon Tattoo, but then it sounded like Stacy's mother and it was Stacy's mother. The clip was before the small guy and Stacy had dated."
"0297"	"(2005-03-30 (14)) I was in a funeral car, and Mom was in another, and there were about 4-5 cars, I think. There was an accident, and my car got smashed. Then it was the past, and the survivors from the accident, and their child forms, came back to tell us and we avoided the accident."
"0298"	"(2005-03-30 (14)) I was wagging school and Dad, Ezra and Jayson came back from school. I dived under one blanket in a corner. Jayson was asking Dad some math question. Dad came into my room to explain it. He got on my computer and started trying to explain it to him. At one point, Dad dropped his phone right near me, but didn't notice me. I couldn't keep still though, and eventually Dad noticed I was under there."
"0299"	"(2005-04-01 (14)) Mom was getting married but I don't know who to. We had Tinkerbell, Tigger, Mittens, a dog and a bird in the car. Mittens was in the glove box. We had just come back to the car from somewhere. It was a hot day and Mittens needed water. Mom was telling me about when she got her wedding dress and how she didn't look very fat in it. Then we pulled up at some marriage motel thing. Mom told me the people liked playing jokes. We got there and there was a sign that said something like 'Don't park too close to the water'. A car was parked really close to the sign and then a lady ran out saying ""Oh, sorry!"" and she moved her car. It was a joke, but I didn't get it. We went inside and we were booking in or whatever and she said no cats were allowed, and then that no pets were allowed. Then she pulled out a fish, a cat and a dog. I said to Mom that it seemed weird that what she had pulled out were opposites of ours. I told the lady it was a joke and she was denying it and she left. Then her sister came in and let us up. The dog went behind the counter and she looked at us angrily and I thought she was going to say ""no dogs"", but she let us up. I was getting food for the dog when I noticed it was pooing and looked sick. I thought it was another joke so I went downstairs to ask them what their problem was, but I woke up."
"0300"	"(2005-04-02 (14)) Mom and I went on a train because Austin got two girls to go on it and she thought he was going to do something to them, so she gave the girls her keys to her car. Then she went to this car and jumpstarted it. I asked her why not use your car and she said she gave her keys to those girls. I got angry because my bag was in it. I walked around looking for the car but we didn't find it."
"0301"	"(2005-04-02 (14)) Mom picked me up from home to get food and I didn't wanna go to her house so she went to drop me off, but we walked through some scary park and some black guy was getting beaten up. I got home, which was very different. I was at Seabird and I ran down from the shops to the park. Nana was there and there were like 20 kittens which I had given birth to. They had names like 'Hungry'."
"0302"	"(2005-04-02 (14)) I was at work. Terry Jones was there and I know the other Monty Python guys were there, but I only remember Terry. He kept making faces. Anyway, work finished and I had to go to this 'buddy' place. I was buddies with this little girl with a strange voice. The buddy place was full of orphans, I think. Anyway, this little girl really liked me. She hadn't been there for a while, but she was there this time and she started climbing all over me. This other girl there, an older one, like me (she wasn't one of the orphans) had a video camera and she asked me to record some stuff. It only had 20 minutes of space on it. Later, I was looking up Monty Python stuff on the net and I found pictures of Michael Palin when he was younger."
"0303"	"(2005-04-03 (14)) It was like The 4400 and Ezra and I had both been taken. We were at some place with a big forest. Nana and Poppa were there. I think earlier on, but after we had come back, that I was at a place with Graham Chapman and we both had an ear infection. There was a little 8 year old girl, called Sara and she was dead but some strange thing was going on, and she was married to Graham and was also dating five others, including a Michael Palin gardener guy. But she was only 8 and I asked about this, but I didn't get a proper answer. She told me and Graham to put ear drops in our left ear, so we did. It made a strange noise, but it worked. This gardener bloke had been taken as well, I think. I was 'dating' the Michael Palin gardener and also a Michael Palin other person. Even though I had only been back a day or two. Earlier, we were (all the people that got taken) at this place and it had a big ball of light in the middle and it got smaller and smaller and then disappeared. Then we heard it would be back tonight at this little house thing. 1400 people were in the country by the way. I was walking up a hill with Dad, Ezra, Nana, Poppa and Mike Palin gardener. The other Mike Palin guy was there and said hi. Nana joked that I was dating them. I was, but she didn't know. When we walked back down, Nana said she was going to do something and then come to see the light. I was trying to work out what my power was. We got to the house. I got to the middle of the house and there was Ezra, Dad and I and some scary zombie-looking girl. The light appeared as a little squishy ball and it exploded. The 'camera' went bird's eye view and showed heaps of birds flying out of the forest."
"0304"	"(2005-04-04 (14)) I was 'watching' my dream with someone from school. I already knew what happened and I didn't want anyone else watching but they had to for some reason. Anyway, in this 'dream', Jayson and I were going out and we were making out or something. He got up and went somewhere. Later, I got up and chased Mittens down this hall and I discovered that he was in this room. That was the end of the 'dream'."
"0305"	"(2005-04-04 (14)) The girl next door was having a fit or something. I was out the front and there were police cars and an ambulance and they had those defibrillator things."
"0306"	"(2005-04-05 (14)) I was at school on the computers. It had Sims 2 on it. There was group of boys and they kept annoying Ramona, some girls and I. The teacher guy told us about this gay project we had to do, I only remember one part and we had to 'draw' ourselves, as babies. So I used Sims 2 bodyshop. I think later on in the dream we were running away from the boys and we got ice-creams, but I didn't get one."
"0307"	"(2005-04-06 (14)) I had a tank of pet fish in my room. It was quite a big tank and had many varieties of fish, including a seahorse and some little exciting ones. They kept jumping out of the tank and onto the floor, which was annoying. There was a big storm and it was scaring them. I told them something and they got into this big plastic thing, which was a safety defense shield thing. Then I had to guess the code."
"0308"	"(2005-04-06 (14)) Graham Chapman and I were good friends and I was on the net and I found pictures of him being alive after he died. I printed them out and left them so he would see them. These girls gave me a fake number plate. I knew it was a fake, but I put it on a car that I had. They said the speed goes up to 39kph. The number plate was 80, which meant I was speeding. They went off and I got in the car with Mom. We had to go in the Hyundai and I had to sit in the back, which I complained about. Ezra wanted to see Species 3. Later I was talking to Graham and 'confronted' him about the pictures, but he said he didn't know. Headlines from back then, said stuff like 'Dead doctor' and stuff."
"0309"	"(2005-04-07 (14)) I was at someone's house and I was out the back with some people and they found a leech. I was scared of it and they were throwing it around trying to get rid of it. It landed on my thumb and latched on. I was screaming and we tried everything to get it off, flinging, pulling, burning, but nothing worked. Nana came out of the house telling me to shut up and she got it off."
"0310"	"(2005-04-08 (14)) I was at some weird place that was near water. Food and stuff was really hard to get, but the place that I was at had a little shop/shed thing with trolleys full of stuff and we could take them. Jayson, Ezra, Mom, Dad and Jayson' made up sister were there. Her name was Marie and she looked like Mary from Kingdom Hospital. She liked me a lot. Anyway, we went down to the shed and we got a trolley, which was ours and we had to climb to get it. When we walked out there were some people nearby and they were going to kill us, or at least damage us, but we ran away, this happened twice, and the third time there was this nice black guy who gave us our stuff and a diary of a girl who had died and disappeared. Then strange things started happening. As we were walking to this place, coming back from the shed, I was seeing everything in black and white, but everything behind me was in colour. We walked onto this platform and Marie started talking to me as her mother, and she told me that I had turned into her mother. This strange thing went away and when I was still like that I said ""No, it's me Izzy"" and she said ""Oh, Jayson' girlfriend"" and I said ""Who's girlfriend? I'm not a girlfriend"". She said something like ""It seems like it"". Jayson was in some place and he was skinny. Later on, I was on this jetty thing, and these guys were going to kill me and there was a 'magical' thing that happened and it happened now -- a bit of water rained from nowhere and I quickly ran to get away and a wave got the bad people. It also happened later, but this time I barely got away and it was a train that went past."
"0311"	"(2005-04-08 (14)) The things from Predator had come to Earth, but they couldn't go invisible and they didn't have the heat vision. Anyway, they would search houses for people and kill them or take them with them. They were on our street and Dad told me to hide in his cupboard underneath all these clothes. I did, but then they got to our house and they took Dad and Ezra with them. One (I think only one came in) opened the cupboard, but he didn't see me, but he somehow sensed I was in there and I got up and was running away from him. He got sick of running, I suppose, and went back to the ship but I realized he was going to blow the house up, so I ran into the shed and then I heard an explosion. The house was still standing though. The predator bloke had a look and happy with the results, he left the house and told the rest not to search the house again. Then they flew away. I was going to jump the fence to leave, but there was an evil dog. I went next door and they were in a caravan thing and they were going to leave. I knocked on the door and I said it was us (Ezra was with me now). They didn't believe us, and this guy said ""What does Izzy like?"" So I said ""waffle, chicken"" and Ezra said ""guns"" and they said ok and let us in. The caravan was full of people and it was really squishy inside. Granma was in there. We got to a park and there were horse races and we tried to warn everyone about the aliens but no-one believed us."
"0312"	"(2005-04-09 (14)) I knew Johnny Knoxville and he, his other mates and I went to some shop and they were going to steal a bottle of water. They did and then ran off laughing. Then I was at school, and there was going to be a song or play thing. I was first in so I got to sit in the front row. We had to sit on the floor though. Mom, Dad and Ezra were sitting next to the stage. I also knew Graham Chapman, who was appearing in this play. I don't know what they did, but at the end they were singing 'Every Sperm is Sacred' and I was the only one in the audience who knew the words. After, I went to see Mom who was talking to a sports teacher. She said ""You're the only kid I've met who likes Monty Python"". I was chatting to her and Mom and then the sports teacher said she liked the way I talk. Then in sport, she said she thought it would be best for me if I taught myself. Later, Johnny Knoxville and I went to a shop and stole another bottle of water and also we had ordered a cows brain and had eaten a little bit of it as a joke."
"0313"	"(2005-04-11 (14)) I was at some place and I was watching a live Monty Python thing on the TV. Terry Jones kept stuffing up his lines. In the water there was this shark thing and Stan from South Park was underneath it; the shark was protecting him. The shark swam away and he came up for air, holding his hat and he was covered in mud."
"0314"	"(2005-04-13 (14)) Mom and I were at a friend of hers' place and he got bitten and turned into a zombie. So we got out of there, and I ended up at school. People were turning into zombies there too. I was running from different rooms with Farrah and a girl I made up. We were running around, ending up in places like the gym, running down a hall, back to the gym. We ended up in an apartment type room. There were three beds and knives and things in the drawers. We put the mattresses on the floor."
"0315"	"(2005-04-14 (14)) I was at a park or something. There was a competition on and there were 10 men and they all had a partner. For some reason, I ended up as some guys' partner. I was walking along and someone gave me a golf club. The competition was supposed to be hard, but I must have done well because the guy told me someone had said he was in the lead. Cuddles also had her kittens, nine were in trios and there were more. We were leaving the park place and we went up a carpark and at the top people were being all evil."
"0316"	"(2005-04-21 (14)) We went to 'Seabird'. There were two caravans. Mom was there and we were going to share the bigger caravan. Nana owned them or something. There was also a boy, who was a serious computer addict. He lived in this room, which was stacked high with games and other computer things. We went to the big caravan, which was messy. I went to the bedroom and turned around and screamed. A room on the left side had been one which I had dreamed the Zelda person (The lady from 217 in The Shining remake) was in and I was seeing things. It was really scary. We ended up in a small cabin looking outside because there was something evil out there."
"0317"	"(2005-04-27 (14)) The kids from The Sound of Music and the nanny came to stay with us. They were dressed in old fashion clothes. We were all mucking around, pulling pranks on people. There were strange sheep somewhere."
"0318"	"(2005-04-29 (14)) I cleaned up Mom's backyard, but how you would a desktop, by clicking and dragging. There was some strange movie with me and Jayson and we had kissed but I didn't remember it. I also looked at school photos. I left to tell Mom about the backyard, it was still very messy, but when we went out it was clean."
"0319"	"(2005-04-30 (14)) We were on a boat, I think, and we crashed, but I don't remember it. I was at some place, with the guys from Monty Python, and we were friends. We all had to climb this strange thing (like that game at the Royal Show, when you climb up a blown up thing, but it always tips over) and then press or grab something. If this bird cuckooed then we won heaps of money. We climbed up and after a certain time, it makes you fall. Terry Jones was running the whole show, but he was also climbing, so I think maybe he had a look-alike. He was falling and somehow I pressed mine and his button thing, not at the same time. I won $1.4 million. Then I was playing Neopets and it was money that I had on there. Then I had it in real life again."
"0320"	"(2005-04-30 (14)) I was at some place that looked like Nana's. Ron, Harry and Hermione (Harry Potter) were there, as was I. Ron, Harry and I were under the invisibility cloak. I don't know why and Harry and Ron both liked Hermione, I think maybe only Harry. Harry ended up going out with her."
"0321"	"(2005-05-01 (14)) The sequel to XXX had Vin Diesel in it. He went down a pipe, getting away from these bad guys. Then he ended up dressing as a girl and was staying in an all girls house thing. He had a lesbian relationship with some girl and then he had to run away."
"0322"	"(2005-05-01 (14)) I was walking to Brookland High School, which took ages. There was a big scary pool."
"0323"	"(2005-05-08 (14)) There were zombies (Dawn of the Dead orig.). I knew the blokes from Monty Python and Graham Chapman had been bitten and was in bed, sick. He was turning into a zombie and for some reason some things would make the people turning into a zombie, go crazy. A chicken wandered into the room and from its view, it was all bulgy and reddish. Graham went psycho, turning into a zombie and then eventually calming down. He ended up dying. I also remember that when people bit someone's finger, they would turn into a zombie. We were at someone's house, and it was scary. I wagged school and was hiding behind a tree and Dad saw me."
"0324"	"(2005-05-11 (14)) I was at the Royal Show. For some reason, in my dreams you need a parent to get in the 'water' only parts. Mom and Ezra were already in, but they wouldn't let me in, even when Mom came to get me. David Mathew was in the dream somewhere."
"0325"	"(2005-05-12 (14)) I was swapping 'my' room around. I was moving the bed, which was basically the only thing in there. In the rest of the house there was Dawn of the Dead orig. zombies everywhere. I was going about killing them. I think David Mathew was in this dream too. I think I was trapping some zombies in cages. I also think I had a boyfriend or some romantic relationship with someone."
"0326"	"(2005-05-15 (14)) I was walking home from school and I put my bag on the island across from the logs. I did this because Mom came and picked me up. I then realized it was gone. I was really upset because my phone was in it and so were a lot of other things. We went back and it wasn't there, then it ended up in the middle of the donut, in front of the house across from the logs. I then left it there. I ended up with my phone later and I wondered why I had it. I was jumping fences with someone and there were rabbits."
"0327"	"(2005-05-18 (14)) I was on a weird boat thing. I was married to David Mathew. There were some kids at a bridge, and they destroyed it. We got trapped on the boat. There was a party going on and they all chucked a spaz. There was also a pregnant woman. It went birds eye view at one point and it looked Sims 2 like."
"0328"	"(2005-05-18 (14)) I was at this school place, which was sort of barn looking. Jayson and I were in the same class, and we liked each other. The teacher was also gay (not homosexual). Jayson and I both said ""Burma!"" at the same time. We were both sitting at the back of the class."
"0329"	"(2005-05-21 (14)) The Royal Show was next to a big shop. Me, Ezra and Jayson went to the shop. My mobile was out of credit, Ezra's had no power and Jayson didn't have his. We also had no money. The bus guy said it would cost us $1.30 for all of us to go on the bus. Jayson ended up running away to go find Mom. Then Ezra caught a taxi and I wouldn't go because we had no money. I was saying ""We're looking for the Royal Show"", and all of a sudden it was in front of me and all of the show was on this railway and it was moving to get back to its proper spot. I jumped on. I met this lady who was married to Marlon Brando before he was in The Godfather. There was also this hot guy on board, who I think was Greg Mathew."
"0330"	"(2005-05-26 (14)) I was on a motorbike and someone else was driving. Then I was driving and it started raining. It was really heavy rain and I couldn't see. We crashed and both passed out. There was a steep drop near a two storey shopping centre. I landed on the top of the step, and the other person landed on the bottom one. It was then not wet, and it was all sunny and stuff. There were a few people around, but they were shady looking. This person and I jumped on a hovercraft thing, as did Ezra and Jayson and then the shady people started shooting at us. We got pretty far and then the hovercraft stopped. We ended up at a house thing with weird rooms. I had to share with some friend of Ezra's but I didn't want to."
"0331"	"(2005-05-28 (14)) I was at a freaky place with these weird boats and people could float around in them. Greg Mathew was there with me and we went around the back (to leave the boat, and it was all dark and spooky). There was a dance and some girl was being a bitch and complaining because someone was wearing the same clothes as her. Also there was a new law, and I can't remember what it was, but it was gay."
"0332"	"(2005-05-29 (14)) There was some species/game thing called Protpets. There was this thing called Zanuzez, and it liked me and I liked it. This lady had come to school with lots of these pet things. The Zanuzez thing kept growing and it ended up turning into this ferret thing. Anyway, we were all supposed to get one to catch more. There was some sport thing going on. Jake was there and something 'bad' happened. I think Jake and this other little noob got bashed. There was also this little sports cabin."
"0333"	"(2005-05-31 (14)) I won something at school, and I was allowed 'nomination' points. This kid in class got in trouble and the teacher was trying to get him to give her something like $10,000, so I let him off with the points. I was then at some evil park. There were these evil haunted ghost dudes and it was raining and Mom took me on this trolley thing around the park. The ghost dudes threw stuff at me. Moondyne Joe was the name of one of them. MJ was also the coach of the soccer team, which I then played a bit of. I stole $10,000. I wanted the money and this guy took something else. There was also something about a dog with a cockroach. Also, at home there were some people after us and I tried to get away but when we went back home they were there."
"0334"	"(2005-06-06 (14)) I only remember a bear chase and a weird, munted shed."
"0335"	"(2005-06-07 (14)) I was at school. There was this scary convict dude. There was a weird pottery class. The teacher was annoyed for some reason."
"0336"	"(2005-06-10 (14)) I went to school in my pajamas. I had a hotel room. Jayson was at school and we were talking to some people. Then Ezra, Jayson and I were hiding from Mom in this nest thing, but it didn't work and she found us. A horse asked for a horse. There were lots of plates. I had to kill some little kid."
"0337"	"(2005-06-11 (14)) I was at some place, which had a bin full of pies. There was a pie-eating contest."
"0338"	"(2005-06-11 (14)) I was in Bali, and only Bali people were allowed to food after 5pm. I was there with school. I was in the bath watching Mr and Ms Smith. There was a wasp like the one from Donkey Kong Country. I was also at these netball courts and I sat around. There was a big K-Mart and a McDonald's nearby. Mr Nixon was around."
"0339"	"(2005-06-13 (14)) I had three kids. Their father was Jack Nicholson. I was about 15, but somehow they aged and I was still 15, but I wasn't. The oldest was a girl, sometimes she looked like that ugly Tanita girl, other times she was pretty and sometimes she had this scary nose. The second oldest was also a girl, and the youngest was a boy. We were playing on some big oval. When my eldest met Mom, I was 'overjoyed' and she was nervous about meeting Mom."
"0340"	"(2005-06-21 (14)) Those ugly dudes Harlan and Elijah were being gay saying loudly that no-one liked me. I can't remember what happened but I annoyed them back at some point."
"0341"	"(2005-06-24 (14)) I was at school and Teresa, the others and I were getting along pretty well. Mr Nixon said that I needed to talk to others more and that after school I had to go to his house. He drove me there in silence. His house was in the middle of nowhere and it was huge. It was all Timezone like inside; there were games everywhere. Some person was shooting. There was some letter and someone read it and it was something about Mr Nixon and some park. I got McDonald's."
"0342"	"(2005-06-25 (14)) There were these trees, and this Green Traveller (Flesh and Blood) dude was trying to kill me and some people. They were chasing us around and turning into robots. We escaped and hid in this house and turned all the lights off, and closed all the curtains. One person left for school and the trees, as humans, followed her. These bullies tried to stop them."
"0343"	"(2005-06-27 (14)) I had a pet pig called Porky. It was very evil and only liked Mom. We kept it in a cage. Mom and I went to this place, which had a human path and an animal path, which was all cagey and had bridges and stuff. She let the pig loose and I ran way ahead, but then I didn't know where to go. I was on a bridge and the pig caught up and tried to get me. Mom gave it a pat. It worked out how to get on the bridge so I bolted for the door on the other side. It had no lock and the pig could open doors. The light switch was on the door handle. The door turned into a sheet and the pig bit my foot, it hurt and I screamed. These people with guns shot the hell out of the pig, but it was still alive and now it was upset. I ran upstairs into a little room. I was trapped and there were zombies outside of the room. There were lots of Cuddles looking cats, but they all had different coloured eyes, which were all bright."
"0344"	"(2005-06-27 (14)) I was in Big Brother, but I got evicted except I got put back in. The Friday Night Live theme was water."
"0345"	"(2005-06-27 (14)) I was in the bush and people with guns were chasing me. I climbed a tree and they couldn't find me. They shone a light and found me, so I ran away.

A grandpa of mine in the future (ie the present) was looking for generations of his family. Then we were somewhere else and they had this thing where you had to walk on this rope to get across the water. One of the guys looked like Jack Lemmon, and he and my other friend started singing.

I met this professor who was, but wasn't, Christopher Lloyd. I was talking to him and I said something about me coming from the future. He showed me his time machine. These people were killing other people. Someone died in this cave and other people went in to find them. I went in to find those people and they were all gone.

I saw Michael Palin and his wife (Helen Gibbins) talking (they were our age). There was a voiceover saying that no-one liked them.

The tide started coming in and we moved everything up and also put some stuff into a house like Nana's, but it had different furniture. Nana kept coming to the island in a little speedboat acting weird. There was something about shortcake sea water? Something broke and the water came to the house, then I was watching it as a movie and it was The Beatles, not us. They left the house and then the camera focused on Darren, and they were walking through a forest and they got shot at. Then it was the people from Lost. Jack and Kate were talking."

Ezra and I went in car and locked the doors. The window was now fixed. I said ""What if someone is in the boot?"" so I got out to find Mom. There was a creepy kid at the ATM. Two guys came towards me, so I got back in the car. Then I saw that the boot was open and a creepy robber, like the one in Little Britain, was walking off. Mr Ripley and Mr Nixon were security guards. Mr Gutenberg was hanging around too. They stayed with us. The cameras watched you when you looked at someone. There was an evil old lady.

He came to the school and we had to wear uniforms and he sat next to me, but a bit further away. Calvin came and sat next to me. We were talking and I pointed to Jayson and I told him who he was. Then he started to get angry for some reason and kept leaning on me. There was a concert on and Mom said that Green Day was going to be there, so we went. Green Day came on, and when they left, we left and we got food."
"0382"	"(2005-09-04 (14)) This nasty teacher made the class line up. I started singing 'Love Me Tender' under my breath and then Calvin joined in, and then the whole class. I was then at some place running around trying to get away from this black kid in a wheelchair. I went into this news agency earlier, and the kid was there. He followed me to the deli and by mistake, a strip club. He didn't need a wheelchair though [he was like Andy from Little Britain] . There was some magician guy on the stage.

"0384"	"(2005-09-07 (14)) There was a school ball or something. I just wore my normal casual clothes. Jake and some other boys were wearing this weird suit, which had a blue 'top' thing. Some of the girls had pink ones. Calvin came and he got changed into his school shirt. He sat near me and kept leaning on me. There was this pretty girl at some place who I was talking to and getting along with. Calvin started spending time with her so I left. Ms Doubtfire was sitting in 'class'. Calvin sat at the opposite end of the table and was talking to me. He moved next to me and he 'realized' that I was annoyed that he had been spending time with the girl. I had also seen them holding hands at one stage. Calvin started laughing and teasing me because I thought that 'they were going out'. I kept denying it, although it was true. I was mainly annoyed that the girl had stopped being friends with me."

This guy came and said everything that the person had told me earlier, again, and he then ripped his face (mask) off. He gave us two packs of sausages. We left as the people were coming. We snuck around this building which was a two storey, motel type building. A woman punched some woman when she opened the door. Some guy asked us what we saw. I said nothing and he let us go. We were hiding in cars and under benches in this cave place."

I got the wrong bit of paper. I ran back. Somehow inside, Harlan had sticky tape. He and his friends tied me up on this bed. I got out of it and I went back to the gym. The lady waiting started writing on my leg ""Dear Izzy, something (I don't remember) ice cool and red hot"". Greg was with her. Dave came over and they both signed the bit of paper."

I remembered that in Digital Media, Evelyn and been acting weird and had continued acting strange throughout the day. She was copying my voices etc."
"0395"	"(2005-09-18 (14)) I was playing Fate, except it was real life. Some people were in the dungeon. They didn't finish the tutorial. I jumped over this thing and people followed.

"0396"	"(2005-09-19 (14)) It was National Cleanup day. It was recess and it was Monday. Calvin left his bag in class and left. I sat on the floor and leaned back on a chair and fell.

I went off with someone and we went to the park thing at night time. Then I was running away from something. I went back to the house and they asked me where I had been (it had been 2 days, although for me it had only been a couple of minutes).

We did whatever we had done a second time, but our heads just went bigger. I went to school. There was a pool thing with waves. A beaver was following me. My head shrunk back to normal over time. I lost my pants. Mr Norris was at a library. The beaver turned into an annoying person. I snuck up and scared him. The beaver dude was dancing."
"0407"	"(2005-09-29 (14)) Mom was looking after us. I told her we usually leave for school at 8am. When it was morning, I asked her what time it was and it was 9.34am.

Some teacher told me to tie my hair back. I said no. Evelyn was doing some juice advertisement. There was two of her. There was an assembly for Year 9 and 10.

They had dug deep and found all this stuff underneath. The fat girl was angry because I had said something like ""You're cool and pretty"". You could climb down the hole as there was a ladder on the side. I had to drive up this road to find them, but then it was a dude was driving up some road. His father was in this big area flying a plane in circles, on the ground, because of some accident. The father told the guy to move. The father crashed with two dogs except they turned into babies. The guy took his fathers shirt off and then they were alive."
"0409"	"(2005-09-30 (14)) Some actress person kissed this ugly guy, I can't remember why. He started kissing her back and she couldn't back out. She got down to her undies and looked in the mirror and realized that she was pregnant and she went to her husbands work to tell him."
"0410"	"(2005-10-02 (14)) I was at school/shop. Calvin and Silas sat in front me and this girl I was friends with sat next to me. She got moved. I was saying how I watched Lost, Alias and something else. I ended up at some cops house that was in the middle of some water. He couldn't swim. Mischa Barton (as Marissa from The OC) was there. There was a fire in the house and she got out, then I forgot how to swim and I went underwater. The people thought that it'd take days for me to get back. But I got back in 10 minutes. The cop was angry. He got everyone to line up on this ledge. He threatened to throw a snowball. I was close to him and he threw it while looking at me and I ducked and fell into the water. He had aimed at another person on the ledge behind me, which was a bit higher. Calvin was next to me and I whispered for him to move. He got away, but the cop let everyone off. Later, I was in a spooky shop where there were lots of Goosebumps books. The cop kept picking on me. This scary dude got Calvin, Silas and Samantha. The cop took me to some strange place with monkeys. There was a pool thing and I didn't want to get in. He looked like Tim Brunero when we were there."
"0411"	"(2005-10-04 (14)) I was at this place with Calvin, Jayson and some girl. This guy came and Jayson found these astronaut-looking suits. The girl picked red tracksuit and black over the top. The boys and I picked all black. This guy came and he thought we were the proper 'astronaut' people. He believed us, until he asked me how my 'Dad' was, as he was sick. I said ""Uh... yeah, I dunno,"" and then he got his buddies and they put us in this car. We got transferred to another car, and Dad was driving it. Jayson didn't sit in the car though, he held onto the door from outside. When Dad stopped, he jumped off and ran, but Dad let us go too. Calvin and I left and we ran and hid behind these trees. But the people saw and took us again. Then we were at some place with water, which had evil fish. These people would call someone out and they had to stay in the water and get back to their spot to win, or if they got bit 5 times, or 20 times, they could get out. I got called and I got bitten. At the end, someone random would get thrown in to die. Some person pointed out some Beatles stuff, so I went to look at it. Dad got a job as a design person at school."

I barely saw them and didn't remember giving birth, being pregnant or having sex. I went over one day and all the kids were toddlers.

I was pregnant and I looked at a book thing which said I was having twins called Peter and Peggy, but they were black and then they were Sims and their father was Joe Carr. I was at a shop, one day before the kids were due. My water broke while I was in the carpark so I went to the hospital. Mom thought I was naming the kids Jayson and Kate. I had them 'cut' out and the scar bit was an ad on TV. There were pipes and people underwater on the ad too. I wanted to name the kids, first name and middle name, Jessica Madison and Adam Michael because their father was Michael Palin."
"0415"	"(2005-10-07 (14)) I was Seabird and the cabins were like huts and really stingy. There were chickens wandering around. I was at school and it was in a shop or something. I was in class and I had just finished drawing a picture of an ad with Calvin. I went to the desk and Isabel sat in front. She started drawing in one my Logic Problems books. I got angry and chucked a spaz and Jayson was there. Then I saw that my drawing was ruined. Isabel said ""Is it late?"" and I was like ""What?"" I was wearing a skirt and I had my period.

He was handing out Freddo's to people. I met some people going to a lolly shop. There was a cinema, which seemed to never end -- at the front of the room with the screen, there was a door which led to another room. This crazy killer dude did a crazy dance. I was at 'home', and this guy was pulling a tree up and it exploded. I ended up in Canada, and then I walked to Germany and then to Spain. I saw Dad in a place called 'Broken Cord' or something. There was a dog breeding ground."
"0417"	"(2005-10-13 (14)) I woke up with a bit of a headache. My hair went full curly. Dad's room was scary looking and orange and I thought he and Ezra were high. Dad kept saying to Ezra that he wanted my room. They were talking about TV shows including A Bit of Fry and Laurie and others. Dad complained about me going psycho the night before. I didn't remember. I had had a dream about soccer balls. I went to school and I met up with Calvin, Fang and Evelyn. Fang had a chocolate version of Operation. It got stolen. Jake and someone else thought that I was a guy. The teachers were acting weird. There were lots of soccer balls. I started walking around at home later, and I was screaming and hitting someone to try and wake myself up. What had happened the night before had happened again. This woman that Dad was going out with said that I'd died, while I slept. I tried to work out how to save myself again. I was in a taxi and the taxi driver was a guy. KA PLEEZ was written somewhere in the taxi."
"0418"	"(2005-10-15 (14)) I went shopping with Mom. We were in a little shop with lots of DVDS. People were shopping in the main shop so it was quiet where we were. They had The Shining remake, but it was different. In the movie, the house was little-ish and a guy went there. On floor 217 there was a creepy monster. In the house, there was cat food and lots of water. Two guys went to check this cat in the bath."
"0419"	"(2005-10-15 (14)) I somehow ended up in a new galaxy or planet. People looked slightly different. I ended up with a group of people. I remember Erik Stolhanske, Paul Soter and Sam (from Club Dread, who is played by Erik Stolhanske). Sam was the first one I'd met, and he was really nice. This killer dude was around. Some of the group got bitten by a werewolf. We had to leave them. There were then 6 of us. I got in the car with Sam. We drove away and then the car stalled. The killer came and killed him. I ran off back to the other car. I was in the back with Erik, who was also nice. Paul died at some house. Erik was saying how he ""wanted us to be together"" but we couldn't because I was going and he was on a different planet."
"0420"	"(2005-10-16 (14)) I was in a car with Calvin and some people. We were trying to get away from bad people. The car stopped working. The bad guys took one person. I was at a place, and I went into a little shop but I had no money. I sold newspapers and I was going to buy water but I stuffed up. Calvin went in there and asked for water. Water was hard to get. This lady in the shop wondered why we'd been hanging around. I was then in this water and this crocodile was trying to get me. I got over a fence and some dude said ""Aint it dead yet?"""
"0421"	"(2005-10-17 (14)) Children of the Corn 3 type of movie. Eli, his 'mother' and 'father' were the same people. The father started bashing Eli at the end of the movie. They had a boat and it was sinking. I think the father died. This guy called David came on. First it was Brad Pitt, then David from 40 Year Old Virgin. The narrator was saying that he was the town hero, and then he went crazy. He ended up in a mental hospital. There was a song playing called ""St Elmo's Fire"". There was something about Jesus. David had a split personality and his other half was called Robert Larry. There was apple crumble."
"0422"	"(2005-10-18 (14)) I was at school and there was a sports thing on. I was in a pool and Classmate-M-31 threw an egg and it got me and Mr Nixon. I needed to change so I went looking for a toilet. I found a cinema so I asked if I could use the toilet. They said I could. I went upstairs and there was a person doing work and I had to crawl over the table. I ended up in a house with no toilet. The house kept changing which had something to do with a time warp."
"0423"	"(2005-10-19 (14)) I was at school and I had a car. Calvin was around. I was then at home and the people from across the road and Classmate-M-23 were outside the front door, playing. I kept telling them to go away, but they didn't. I went out and kicked one of them in the balls. I did it again to another person too. I came out later, and the guys mother and father came in a Toyota. The mother was telling me off and I was yelling back. The father came inside looking for something. I asked who she was and I realized he was going to steal stuff, so I put him outside. The LAN cord wasn't connected."
"0424"	"(2005-10-20 (14)) I was at a place with Calvin and he had a little sister called Sunny. At first it wasn't me and Calvin, it was two people and they were in a Lord of the Flies situation and they had their own plates to sit on. I had a tree full of food and something else. I got Sunny to bury a bag before some man came. When she got up to us, she was older. We got caught by some dudes. They had powers. Some persons father could fly and do stuff with birds. Their mother could smash rocks and stuff. We were supposed to have powers too."
"0425"	"(2005-10-21 (14)) Ezra, Dad and I went to a McDonalds and we were tired. Ezra passed out and Dad said ""Great, I've got to take Ezra out"". Then he said the same thing about me. I said ""I haven't passed out yet"". He said ""Yes you have"" and then I passed out. Then we were in the carpark and we had two cars. I said to Dad, ""I think you're dreaming"". He was. Then some scary thing jumped up and screamed (as if I was watching a movie). It woke me up."
"0426"	"(2005-10-21 (14)) I was in the haunted woods and there was this crazy dude who killed some people on the 4-wheeler. I got on the 4-wheeler and drove away from him. He died. I was at school and in class with Jake, Chriss and Silas and we all had tapes. They put theirs on and they all had the same songs. I put mine and on and it played ""The Birds and the Bees"" and they were ok and first, until he started singing and they chucked a spaz because it was old. The voice was old sounding."
"0427"	"(2005-10-22 (14)) I was at a shop and Evelyn and Fang worked there. Simon Pegg was there and some woman got his autograph for me."

"0429"	"(2005-10-23 (14)) I was at a water place and these people were chasing me. I went under water. At a jail place, there was something about A Bit of Fry and Laurie. They were doing some play. I managed to escape. Water was going to 'appear' at some place. There had been a drought? The water made stuff green. Mr Nixon was or had a snake with no mouth or colour. I was in a prison and I kept saying schfifty five. This guy said he'd cut me up into 99 pieces if I said it again."
"0430"	"(2005-10-26 (14)) I was at some place with the school. We got school photos. They went through this machine which was shady looking. The bus driver was Erik Stolhanske, but not as hot. Some dude wanted me to change his timetable. There was a computer. There was a restaurant and it had beds and those baby things. This person had a dragon, as did I, but mine all had gay eyes. The bus driver was in a helicopter and he said no-one could come with him. But then he drove the bus. Some dude was shooting me because he thought that I was a thief."
"0431"	"(2005-11-01 (14)) I was at a park and there were lots of people from school there. There was a tube, which was extremely popular and I wanted to play in it, but it was always full. One time it wasn't but I was too big to go in it."
"0432"	"(2005-11-02 (14)) I was at home or somewhere. I was taking pictures and the camera had two pictures left, and I put them on the laptop, but then we didn't have it. I converted them.

"0433"	"(2005-11-03 (14)) Greg and David Mathew were making out with people. They were at a party of mine, Christie was talking to me and I took a photo of her. I was playing Super Mario and there was a hard level on an island. I was with my husband. There was something about Heaven's Lake? The husband destroyed the boat and chased me. I said three things ""if I didn't want to be here I'd take the boat or swim. But I do so I'm here"". Jayson stayed over."
"0434"	"(2005-11-04 (14)) I was at a shop with Mom and Dad. Dad was going to buy me something expensive. I saw an egg-chair and it was cool and blue or silver. It was $300 odd. It came with a big monitor and a cool game and stuff. Mom said that she'd buy it. There was some show thing and Dad almost fell. Some dude did fall. He was the producer of the game. James Matheson bought the rights to the game and some friends and I went to this place. It was pretty much empty. James said that he wasn't going to finish making the game because he wanted to be famous for music. I said just finish this. He said he wouldn't but on TV, he said he would."
"0435"	"(2005-11-06 (14)) I was at home except it was like a mansion. The main Saved by the Bell characters were there and paired up. The blonde one said something about having both guys. I was with Ryan Cartwright. We were in bed in this room. Mom kept coming in and telling us not to do anything naughty. We had wine and we tried to get the cork through the window, but it missed. We started drinking it, but then Ryan kissed me. While we were 'asleep', these ghosts were buying dresses and other girls clothes. I was at some place and I was trying to get out, but there were all these snakes in the way. I fell and a big snake licked my face. There were 'space' games at this place. Ezra went on a cart to get $100."
"0436"	"(2005-11-07 (14)) Dad got tickets to a show with a guy called Pat Hurt, who was a singer. But he cancelled and it was boxing instead. Ezra and I decided not to go. Nana was going to it. We were playing this game with these people and we had two thingies, which I think were Pokemon. They had Harry Potter and Runescape though. I got rid of one thing because of a card. I learnt spells and it turned into checkers because they gave up. Ezra and I ended up in a strange snowy place. There were bad people. I threw a snowball at them and then we ran off. We ended up in Midvale, across from the shops. We walked to the shops. The bad people followed and we ran into the liquor store and hid in the fridge. A guy came in and I bashed him."
"0437"	"(2005-11-08 (14)) I was at a hotel in the Gold Coast. Ezra and I were in an Unfabulous play. I was Zack and Ezra was someone I made up. I couldn't get the voice right and the people wouldn't swap, but Ezra and I swapped. Someone was killing the people who were originally in the play, then us as well. I went to the hotel to find Dad. The bathroom door was open. I went to tell the lady, but she had been killed. No-one could see the killer except for me, and two friends of mine -- Ryan Cartwright and someone. They couldn't see the killer unless someone had a towel wrapped around their head. There was an evil clown."
"0438"	"(2005-11-11 (14)) I was in the toilets at a school, and so were Harris (Seriously Weird) and someone else. I looked in the mirror and realized I was wearing a tie. I pointed this out and Harris jokingly said that I was copying him. I said maybe. I didn't remember putting it on."
"0439"	"(2005-11-11 (14)) I was at this place with rides. I think it was the Gold Coast. Dad and I went on this Giant Drop type of ride, but two lots of people go up on the same rail, on the same side. I pressed something to make it go down, but people were going up. I couldn't stop it, but the ride operator stopped it, just as we hit the top. I saw this other ride but we didn't go on it because of our experience with the last ride."
"0440"	"(2005-11-11 (14)) Ezra and I went looking for this puppy because it had been stolen and no-one had been able to find it. We went into this room in an apartment and we found it.

"0441"	"(2005-11-12 (14)) I was watching some TV show with Ryan Cartwright dressed up as a girl to work somewhere. I was at home and Mom had put my stuff in a different room.

I was friends with this girl whose little sister called Ashley, had died 8 years ago. She also had a brother. I went with her to a destruction derby with toy cars. Then she died.

I didn't go. I saw this girl who started talking about fish. There was a pond with a little thing in the middle with a monkey and a kangaroo. I fell in. We were then at a show and Jayson was with us. The show was cool. The Hitler guy from Dracula's was in it. I had a shower and then I found out that a taxi was going to pick us up to go to a restaurant. I didn't want to go because my hair was messy. I tried to straighten it, but it was wet."
"0443"	"(2005-11-15 (14)) I was at a show with Broken Lizard. My best friend was called Charlotte, who was the redhead from The Worst Witch. They gave us cookies and muffins.

There were movies like White Chicks etc. There was a big pool thing and a shark was jumping to get away. We had stingy McDonald's burgers and we complained.

Ezra, Dad and I were at a hotel and had dinner like we did at Dracula's. The claw killed this superhero/villain dude. I put on his clothes and he took control of me. Before he died, he had been at a lair that had bubbles. He was scared of bubbles and suction cups."
"0447"	"(2005-11-18 (14)) I was at this place, which had animals. These people had a video camera. I was recording some stuff for them. There were these people in this orb.

There was a room with a video camera and blood baths. Ryan had been in there earlier and had to get out. We went back in there and worked out that we had to burn the lounge.

Dad and I were at this space thing where you jump through this thing (like that thing that guy walks through when he is leaving Magneto's room in X2) to get into the room. It broke after I went through. Some guy came and fixed it. In the proper room, there were pictures of planets everywhere. I said I wanted to pay attention because we were learning about them at school. There was a room with chairs. There was a game where you pick a room number and you have to find the right chair.

Something was happening and I took Dad's car keys and ran down to car but he followed (not that I could drive anyway) and I couldn't leave. He was going psycho [like Jack Nicholson in The Shining] ."

I put my mobile phone in my bag, but it was actually some guy in the class called Dylan's bag. I went to get it but he took it out of his bag.

It was Halloween and some boys were dared to stay there until 12.15. I went and people I knew were there. I went to a video shop, and Being John Malkovich was there. The robot came back for a short visit. At this person's house they left a light on for a little girl. This guy kept turning it off. The little girl was watching telly.

I pretended to be a zombie and when I thought I was close enough to safety I started running. One said ""There she is!"" and they started chasing me, but I made it to shelter. A professor died trying to close the door. I ran down stairs and people from school there. The light was a pretty blue colour. There was some movie with mice and rats.

There was a big guy. The door opened and a girl ran out and we hid. Uncle Gabriel went to go in but I thought it was a trap and then the same girl ran out again, I realized that she was a hologram and I went to warn him but it too late and this woman took him. I ran back down the tunnels and remembered another tunnel. There was a game and there were gems throughout worth $9 each. The girl was in the captain's room. Something changed. There were Yoshi or Bone characters and at this hospital they turned invisible."
"0471"	"(2005-12-22 (14)) I got a video of 'The Murder of John Lennon'. It was different from what actually happened though. It was all real video and everything had been taped. There was a part of the movie about these people from the future. One of them was bad at math, but was good with decimals. They knew that he was getting killed on 8th December at 8.00pm though it changed to 10.00pm. They were out partying and they got reminded of saving him ten minutes before it was going to happen. John Lennon was taped talking to people after he had just got off a boat and it was daytime. Then shown was John signing Mark David Chapman's book to 'Peter Milk'. Then he came back later and one of the people there cried out ""Look out!"". He mumbled it as if questioning it and then turned around to see Chapman standing there with his hand in his jacket. It was cold and you could see their breath. He pulled out a gun and said ""I may be gay but you are great,"" and as John turned to run he shot him and he said ""I'm shot,"" and collapsed on the stairs [when he fell the camera was actually him falling, like in A Clockwork Orange when Alex jumps out the window] . The stairs he collapsed on came down upon each other and John got squished. By the time, Yoko Ono and the others got there he was long gone. His feet were sticking out and the last part showed Chapman going through files about him. I was watching it with Mom and our eyes were both teary. She went away and I watched it again. I was really upset and crying. Mom said ""I understand but get over it"". [I woke up from this dream crying, and was really depressed for the whole day.] Later I was somewhere else and this dude asked if anyone liked any celebrities that had died before we were born. Mom said ""She [me] does!"" and he asked me when. I said ""Ten years, four months after August 7 1970"" and he couldn't work it out. He was the decimal dude."

I can't remember the first time, but the next time was at the girl's house. We ran up to the top floor attic thing. And they had sex. The girl ran down as we were walking. She mouthed 'barbie' and her father said something about sausages. I called Mom to pick me up. The guy fell down in an elevator. I couldn't find the lid for the water bottle."
"0476"	"(2005-12-27 (14)) A war was happening. I got separated from Mom. I got away from these people who had captured me. Things were blown up. There was a building still intact, and I went in.

"0477"	"(2005-12-28 (14)) I was friends with Zim (Invader Zim). He was really small. His ship had been found and some people and I went in there. We got locked in one part of it, and other people got us out. Zim chucked a spaz and I was holding him. He grew to the size of a human."
"0478"	"(2005-12-28 (14)) We were on holiday and I was at this restaurant. I think I was with Zim (Invader Zim) and he was blind. They started closing except they let us stay and then The Beatles came, though George was there and I didn't know why. Paul was, but wasn't, a girl. They said they were going to be there and George had pyjamas, a marker etc. I talked to them for a while and then I ran to shops for some paper but none of the shops had any and these bridges were delayed, and I needed to use the bridges to get from place to place. I finally got to a hotel and it was the wrong one and there was an evil person. Dad was in the pool. I got keys. The Beatles had gone when I got back."
"0479"	"(2005-12-30 (14)) We went somewhere and there was a barbeque shop, which I remembered seeing in a dream. People from school were staying in a motel. I knocked on Daryl's door and I ran around the building. He ran too, but he didn't see me and I got back to my room, which I was sharing with other people. He checked in the room and I screamed and fell. I was recording stuff. We were watching Back to the Future 2 and I remember seeing Michael J. Fox. Then we had an assembly. Nana was there and we watched Mary Poppins."
"0480"	"(2006-01-01 (14)) I could watch dreams, so I was watching them and most of mine were all spoken in 'gobbledegook'. We used the red, white and yellow cords to watch them. The dream I watched was set in the Gold Coast and there was a bomb in the room where I worked, but it was fake. Some girl drove to her home and then I wanted to go home, but she was evil."
"0481"	"(2006-01-02 (14)) Mom 'had' King Kong as a pet. It was friendly to Mom, sometimes friendly to me, but he hated Ezra. It got angry and started chasing us."
"0482"	"(2006-01-03 (14)) I was at school and it was really weird and like Hogwarts. Someone said that it was a 'magic' school. There were big waves and me and two guys climbed this thing, but when we got to the top, the wave was gone. We went into this 'building'. We sat in chairs and this guy whistled and a wave came over. My ears felt funny. We had to move as other people were getting seated. The chairs were really comfy. There was a whistle, and then an earthquake. Some people were testing out weapons which were causing the waves and earthquakes. We had to keep moving. Orlando Bloom was there?"
"0483"	"(2006-01-06 (14)) It was the day before school and we still hadn't gotten our uniforms. Someone said that I was suicidal."
"0484"	"(2006-01-07 (14)) I was watching a movie? There were big waves and I held onto this thing but the rest got knocked down. Haley Joel Osment was there and there was a goof, as he was there twice. He had a brother? There were animals that I 'made' a tiger etc. They were like fluffy toys. People were scared of them. They bit me, but then realized who I was and I was petting them."
"0485"	"(2006-01-14 (14)) I was at Mom's and Austin came over and he was drunk or something. He started going all crazy and we ran to this house across the road and he was following us. There was a Runescape like prison."
"0486"	"(2006-01-14 (14)) I was at Brookland High School, except it was different. Ramona enrolled there too, and there was a ghost. People ate cat litter. I was supposed to do some speech, but I got out of it and I was allowed to go to West Whitehall Primary School. There were people there from Year 7. As I walked back, 50 odd other people from my school were there too. It was windy. I was watching KPAX which was completely different. Kevin Spacey was saving these people, two kids and a woman from a fire. He was crying."
"0487"	"(2006-01-16 (14)) Ezra and I ended up at this house. We had $20 on us and a bag of stuff. This guy there went psycho and I had a low battery on my phone and no credit. We had this 4-wheeler that was really slow. The guy chased us and we gave him a heap of coins. All of a sudden we were at this place in the Gold Coast. I was in pajamas? Ezra, psycho dude and a few others were there too. This lady let me use the phone and I called Mom and I asked her what year it was, and she replied 2270. We somehow got back. Mom came with the police and they had my diary."
"0488"	"(2006-01-17 (14)) I had a friend called Callum. He died. I could still see him though, and I could also see some other people. Erik Stolhanske was at dinner. I was near/in the shed, someone touched me and I screamed. I got told off for screaming."
"0489"	"(2006-01-20 (14)) I was at a video shop and Kevin Spacey was there, and he was high and sitting on a shelf. I was going to ask if I was allowed to get his autograph but then this guy asked him so I did too. He wrote on a bit of paper ""nerd, nerd, nerd"" and wrote something about a moose. He tore the sides off. He was asked to get a new cover for The Evil Dead by 9am and I told him about some computer place where he could do it. We had to work there. We came back later and hid in the cupboards. I was driving Kevin's car to get to this friend of mine and I got lost."
"0490"	"(2006-01-20 (14)) I was in the car with Dad and he crashed into a house. It was night. They let us in and they had no water. I think we crashed again. Callum Blue was sitting next to me and was slowly getting closer and putting his arm around me."
"0491"	"(2006-01-23 (14)) I was friends with this guy and he had a little sister. There was a big spider thing. The parents were evil. I was in a gym. There were Virgin Mary statues that we had to use to get out."
"0492"	"(2006-01-28 (15)) I was at some place and I fell into some tube tunnel thing. The Beatles were hanging around. John Lennon and Paul McCartney got trampled the most and I gave George a hug before he got trampled. John and Paul started walking back and I said ""Hello, don't worry I won't mug you!"" Then I was at a school and I'd been away for a while. I had to sit next to Cedric. There was lots of paper. We were laughing because of Ezra. There were trophies. The people there were giving this girl there chocolate. This girl and guy were psychic. They were in a car and someone had a dream about a bar."
"0493"	"(2006-01-29 (15)) There was a mud monster at a hotel. Then I was at Mom's, as was the mud thing. I was climbing up the poles, and it was following me. I got in the car and it grabbed onto the door. I drove to the dump to get rid of it."
"0494"	"(2006-01-30 (15)) Mom called me to go to some woman's house, which had a messy yard. I was talking in an Irish accent. Mom was somewhere writing letters. She signed it Evelyn? People were in shelters, but I don't know why. Mom came to Nana's one."
"0495"	"(2006-02-02 (15)) I was watching Kenny vs. Spenny. There was a movie and there was a shop with spells. Nobody really liked Kenny. Spenny was following a girl and her boyfriend stole food. Kenny was making spells."
"0496"	"(2006-02-03 (15)) I was friends with Ezra and we were at the library at school. He decided to stay at Brookland High School. We were going through a carpark and I dropped my shoes, so I went back and got them. Then we dropped Ezra's shoes and a lady took one, but I got it back. She kept trying to break my arm. These people were running from the bad guys, and some were getting killed. This guy hid in a strange place. Someone didn't believe something (that I don't remember) was down these holes. There was something to do with bread. Nana was waiting for a helicopter. I was angry at some person and some dude was laughing because I was angry."
"0497"	"(2006-02-04 (15)) I was at some place. I was in a group for school. Daryl was in my group. I left my diary somewhere. Someone brought it over. Daryl stitched something into the cover.

These guys were waiting. One of the guys came out and raped and killed my friend, but I managed to get away. I found this other rapist who, after bribing him to leave me alone, I started going out with. We were at a place for Grim Reapers. I was there, but I wasn't dead. Not everyone there was a Grim Reaper. These guys were making fun of me."
"0499"	"(2006-02-13 (15)) Someone was in the house and I thought it was Calvin and it was. He was being nice etc, but then ended up at some place with a portal thing. He was looking for some dead girl in ice."
"0500"	"(2006-02-15 (15)) I got a job at Red Rooster. I was there, and Mr Norris worked there. This guy hung up a rack and said ""Congratulations"". I was like ""What do I do now?"" and he said ""Nothing, wait for training""."

"0502"	"(2006-02-17 (15)) I found out that Payton liked me when I was younger. His mother said he ""loved me so much that he couldn't kiss me"" and that he always liked me. I was like 'What the hell?'."
"0503"	"(2006-02-18 (15)) I was at school. Dad was there and everyone was crowding around for something and Daryl stood right in front of me. He was in my class and form, along with Calvin, Silas and Samantha. I filtered these two bits of rubbish. There was a fluffy microscope and lots of little kids."
"0504"	"(2006-02-19 (15)) I wanted to get to Fiji, which was the shape of the island in The Truman Show. Some person and I were pretending to be from Fiji because we had someone's luggage."

Ezra was singing 'The Weight'."
"0506"	"(2006-02-19 (15)) I was watching The Devil's Rejects and I was in it, like I was watching the movie inside it. I kept touching Otis because he is hot. Then it was real and I don't know."
"0507"	"(2006-02-22 (15)) I won $620,000, $1,000 and $7 on three different scratchies. I brought them to a news agency to check if they were real. I had to get the money $2 a month. Evelyn won $200,000. I was in a car with Mom, and it was cold. There was something about an iPod. I dreamt everything again, but it was different."

Everyone was hugging me. It was Samantha's birthday. There was a bomb with chicken? Something was jumping over something to the end. There was a squishy table. [My notes were extremely messy] ."
"0509"	"(2006-02-27 (15)) This guy parachuted into our yard and he looked like Michael Palin as the It's man. Someone was watching an adult movie. The parachuting guy accidentally landed in water. Heaps of people died. I was there too, but I was ok."
"0510"	"(2006-03-01 (15)) I was at this place and most people were under 15. It was all playground like. There were a couple of older people. Everyone there was supposed to be gay. I wasn't and I saw this guy on an escalator, and he saw me. We both kept trying to meet each other. We found out why everyone was like this, but I can't remember why. I finally met the guy in this 'ball'."
"0511"	"(2006-03-01 (15)) I was at school and I went to the toilet and the cubicles had no walls. People were complaining about CS [I don't know what it is] ."

"0516"	"(2006-03-03 (15)) We were standing outside this house, which told Ezra to go to the top floor for presents. He thought it was a trap but he went anyway. I went up and fell down. I yelled at Ezra to come down. There was a bath in there letting out water."
"0517"	"(2006-03-06 (15)) Our school was actually this evil school like in The Outer Limits. The people that went to the school all had gone 'straight'. Daryl, some random nerdy dude, a girl, someone else and I hadn't been converted. We decided to escape. Daryl and I tried to get the other people. The nerdy dude caught us and brought himself along. Daryl was trying to get his brother. We got to a park."
"0518"	"(2006-03-06 (15)) Daryl, some person and I were at this house. The lights were out. Daryl turned into a dinosaur. We ran off. Later he wasn't a dinosaur and this other person was. Then lots of people were. I was at this restaurant and you had to get a ticket and then pass through this thing. Daryl turned into a butterfly. People from Year 1 were there. Daryl and I ran off to these woods and found this thing. He went inside a tent. I went to this toilet. Tanita and this guy came in. There were guards near my cubicle. She got raped or something."
"0519"	"(2006-03-09 (15)) Jayson came to Red Rooster, where I worked. Samantha and Silas were outside. Jayson was talking to me and he was saying that he wasn't going to be back again, and that's why he was here, to say goodbye to Ezra. He said he was going with this under-21 gay thing. I was like ""What the flip?"" He said ""Oh yeah, you don't know I'm gay. And I was like ""What the flip?"" again. He also told Mom and then Ezra. We were all shocked that he was gay."
"0520"	"(2006-03-10 (15)) I was in a classroom and I was sitting in a group with Evelyn, Calvin and someone, Daryl and someone else. I had a video camera and all our faces looked green. The camera wouldn't record. Max Schreck and Alfred Hitchcock were making a movie together."
"0521"	"(2006-03-10 (15)) Silas got moved to my health class, but not to my Phys Ed class. But in Phys Ed, he was there. He was asked to go get these two girl things (called Appley) and to see Max Schreck and Alfred Hitchcock (it was a different dream though). I told Evelyn that I wanted to go with him. He then asked if I could come with him. We went down, but he kept getting distracted. Calvin joined us, and then Calvin and I made it to this storage place. We found Silas and then Seamus came in. We didn't know what to get. Samantha and her 'clone' said they didn't know either."
"0522"	"(2006-03-12 (15)) Mom, Darren, Ezra, Jayson and I were at the 'zoo'. It was inside, I think. It was all water animals and you got a sheet to tick off which animals you touched. Some of the animals listed were electric eel and jellyfish. I didn't want to touch any of the scary ones (ie, jellyfish). Mom got angry at me."
"0523"	"(2006-03-12 (15)) There were fairies in the pool. Twice a year they would give out these wipes which would let you fly for a while. There were wipes with Dolly and Girlfriend in a bag.

"0525"	"(2006-03-16 (15)) Calvin was running this thing at school but he sucked, so the teacher was getting people to vote for a new person. Nothing happened though. I saw Eugene kissing Cassie, and then again at a car as well. I got a hotdog and I couldn't find any tomato sauce."
"0526"	"(2006-03-18 (15)) The school was at the Royal Show. I had to do a project on how fast this ride went. It was really gay. We had to wear gloves. I didn't have any money. All of our bags were together; one had Hrvatski written on it. Samantha held my gloves. Nana was running a deli there. Elijah got a chocolate. Nana said she would pay for me."
"0527"	"(2006-03-19 (15)) I was at a museum and me and someone had to sneak past these people to get in. Someone had to deliver a letter to me. I hid behind a door, and then ran out to the car. The car was actually a four-wheeler, except it was different. Dad and Ezra were already on it. I hated it. We went to an ice-cream shop. They made one for Ezra and he didn't like it because it wasn't 'tight enough'. Dad tried to give it to me and I kept saying ""I don't like chocolate ice-cream""."
"0528"	"(2006-03-21 (15)) There were lots of tornadoes. I was running away from them and ended up in a bunker place. There were these parents and a kid there.

Calvin, Silas, Samantha and I were at a shop?"
"0529"	"(2006-03-22 (15)) I was in the dining room and the pool table was in there, with letters on it. Daryl messed it up and I was setting it out and he was sitting with me and I was listening to music. I went to the toilet and something was peeing in the sink in the bathroom. When I went back, Daryl had changed the music because he thought it was gay. My phone had something about Donald Brown (an ugly townie Sim on Sims 2). Calvin and Silas were around somewhere too."
"0530"	"(2006-03-25 (15)) There was thing at school and we got paired up with people. I don't know who I got paired up with first, but this particular time I got paired with Eugene. He was on a computer playing Runescape and I said that I'd been playing for 3 years [in reality, almost 2 years, in the dream I was telling the truth though] . When he got off we were talking about it. He also played Sims 2. There was all this water around. We were in this canoe and it was broken. Someone threw bags out of a window (of a house that had cars in it) and onto another boat. Daryl was in Calvin's class. Ezra was in a line for the computers. The next time I got paired up with Samantha and I was angry about it. I was watching the episode of The Outer Limits with Colin Mochrie in it, but it wasn't him."
"0531"	"(2006-03-26 (15)) I was in a village. This crazy blue zombie guy started biting people and within five minutes, I was the only one left (the last guy that got bit, I killed). Calvin was around too and I found a normal guy lying around so we took him with us and ran off. Blue zombies chased us and they had lasers in their eyes. We ended up at this village, where all the buildings were completely empty. There was a big door and fencing all around the outside. We put the guy down in a room and tried to check if he was bitten. He turned blue, so I stabbed him with a fork I had in my pocket. Some people we knew knocked on the door and we let them in. I assigned jobs to people, as I 'founded' the place. Some people went to get food, but Calvin and I ended up going outside the village to get food and got caught by these evil monkey people. I managed to escape. There were puffer fish, crabs etc on the edge of this island. People were making beds. I ended up getting caught again. I escaped on a giant donut at the last minute (before they killed me). I found out that Daryl was at another village and I wanted to rescue the people from there."
"0532"	"(2006-03-26 (15)) I was in this spacecraft which was like a plane, but wasn't. It happened twice -- once was real life, and the other was a The Outer Limits episode. The first time the computer had taken over and it kept going higher and higher and we went past clouds and the danger zone. When we past the danger zone it started beeping. We smashed the computer and regained control. The second time, there were two groups of people. One group was good, the other was bad. The bad people got control of it, and they were smashing the computer up."
"0533"	"(2006-03-29 (15)) I think I turned into a boy. I went to the toilet. Silas, Calvin and I did something but I can't read what I wrote. There was also something about Elijah."
"0534"	"(2006-03-30 (15)) Calvin, Silas and I were walking to Mom's. We found a dying rat. I was upset and wanted to take it to a vet, but we didn't. We fell off these rock things.

"0536"	"(2006-03-31 (15)) We had a test in science except it wasn't. The teacher was going through my book and I was supposed to be giving a talk and everyone was annoyed. She realized that I was doing well and gave me a level 7 instead of a level 2. I got tomato sauce on my new shirt. I sat next to Calvin with the seating plan given for the test."
"0537"	"(2006-04-03 (15)) I went to the shop. Daryl and his family were there. I had had a feeling that they were going to be there so I had put on a bra (which I always do anyway). I went to the toilet and Gilbert was bragging about some girl. Daryl punched him. There was some 'bbb' thing in a hat. I was watching Whose Line is it Anyway and Colin Mochrie was on."
"0538"	"(2006-04-04 (15)) Ezra was abducted by aliens and was taken to the moon. Later, Mom and I ended up there. That was a big golf course and I was wondering about golf ball complaints. The people that had taken Ezra had a group and all the members had to have a middle name beginning with 'Y'. There were cat uniforms. I went to join and there was a Year 12 guy from school. Some people died 700km in the air and they were asleep? People were falling off the moon. I got abducted too. Calvin, Elijah and Silas were there too. We went on some bumper cars. We stuffed them up so we left. There was some game in the water called Squidder. My nose was burning and I smelled this soup thing. Nana was there. There was a game where you shoot a brick and then you put it into this thing. There was a German girl and her middle name began with an 'H'."
"0539"	"(2006-04-06 (15)) There was an airplane that was going to some place called Jollymont. There was this African place with lava. Jack Nicholson was there and his arm was all weird.

There was a restaurant and a girl was in this thing. Some guy's wife or mother found her."
"0540"	"(2006-04-07 (15)) I was on a bus with the school. I got off at a restaurant place and so did Dmitri. I went to see Nana and Dmitri went to a family reunion thing. It turned out that he was related to me, but we were cousins '50 million' times removed. Someone was wearing pajama shorts. His family's last name was Selfish (not his, but far up in his family tree)."
"0541"	"(2006-04-08 (15)) Daryl, Tanita, someone and I were in a plane thing because of a war. There was an underground carpark. They took us to an underground bunker type of thing. More people came. Some people were building a fence. Michael Palin was there. Evil people came so the people stopped building. These hitmen were trying to convince this person to stray from the group."
"0542"	"(2006-04-09 (15)) It was Monday, 10/4/06. Ezra went to school but I didn't. That night, Mom dropped me off at this house where Ezra was. The 'father' was crazy and kept threatening to kill us. We tried to escape over this lake thing, but he was there. We made brownies. I kept calling Mom to pick us up and she finally said ok. Valerie and her kids were there. There was something about Disney. There was something at a beach."
"0543"	"(2006-04-10 (15)) I was swinging on vines near the cars at school. People were watching and Daryl was there. He said ""How dare you say such a thing"" and laughed. Elijah and Calvin were there too. I was looking for my bag. I didn't know what time it was. I had math, but I had science in a different class. There was this after dinner thing. Everyone had been drinking, even Ezra, except for me. I was getting my desk at 'school' ready to sleep on. There were some Monty Python commentaries on and I taped them. I had dreams of people in cartoon form and they were in a tree and there was something about a foot. There was this creature with a pear for an eye."
"0544"	"(2006-04-12 (15)) I went for a really long drive to this place in the country. The people had a lot of teenage boys and cats. I discovered that they looked after virtual pets. One cat of mine was really skinny and not well because I didn't play the game that it was on. The rest of mine were cute and fluffy."
"0545"	"(2006-04-12 (15)) George Harrison's car was in our driveway. I don't know if he was dead or alive. The car caught fire and we had twenty people from school sleeping in Ezra's room. Dad told me to wake them all and get them calm and out the back. I got them to the back door but then I went out and was getting the cats out and the rest ran off. Tinkerbell was back and I was cuddling her. Dad hadn't called the fire people."
"0546"	"(2006-04-12 (15)) I was in the library at school. I put a book for someone in there. They turned it into a library book and I was angry and I went to the principal, but he refused to do anything and so I ripped it up."
"0547"	"(2006-04-14 (15)) There were aliens out the front of our house practicing stealing cars. They took Ezra, Mom and I and put us in this place with heaps of aliens. He let Mom and this alien go. We were in this place which looked like the back of a pub. But they didn't know that. We moved slightly and I said something like ""This is gonna be a good night!"". This guy came out and asked who said that. This girl said it was her. He didn't believe her and I walked away. He said something 'naughty' about my butt. I went to go to the toilet and he followed me. I ran out, but couldn't run fast enough. A girl had seen him before and got help. Gilbert was there."
"0548"	"(2006-04-14 (15)) Granma had this presentation. I think she was doing hers on The Beatles. Ryan Cartwright was around and I kept re-meeting him (Run Lola Run, Sliding Doors kind of thing). Ezra and I were somewhere and there were snakes and I think Ezra got stung by a bee. There were these jumpers lying around. Someone said to someone else that the presentation should be about ideas rather than singing a song. Some girl asked me what songs The Beatles were singing. There was some voting thing."
"0549"	"(2006-04-15 (15)) I went to the toilet at school. It had a little tourism shop and cafe and the toilets had a see through door and a shower. I was told that it was a Year 11 and 12 toilet. I accidentally went back later. I had to climb a ladder to S+E but it was gone.  There was an assembly and people were randomly called up to play music. Calvin and I were moving around."
"0550"	"(2006-04-15 (15)) I was somewhere, and then I was home. This police guy got killed. Me, and possibly others, were looking for people and everywhere was dark. I realized that it was a dream and then the lights were working, but there were still no people. I was then in the lounge room and I woke up [I was dreaming within the dream] and started watching TV. There was some show with Ryan Cartwright on. Ezra was there too. There was some other show about a bunny and the father got killed in a fire and the baby bunny recovered."
"0551"	"(2006-04-16 (15)) I was at home and I was out the back. Calvin and I were throwing poo at each other. Ezra and some friends were in the dining room. Someone was going to watch a video."
"0552"	"(2006-04-16 (15)) Mom gave me and Ezra these fluffy rings with layers. We could teleport to exact addresses as long as no-one was watching. There were seven sheets. I went to this house which I thought was from The Ring [but it was actually The Grudge] . There were cops next door and they had lots of doors. There were these puzzles and I kept losing."
"0553"	"(2006-04-17 (15)) I had a sleepover at Mom's. Evelyn was there. We were going to play a game. The lights were out and a streaker ran past. There was a girl there that I didn't like. We went to this place and she couldn't eat fruit or lettuce because of something that I did to her. We couldn't leave until we made her a drink. There was an axe through the thermos. She was trying to give Evelyn drugs. This game we played had different rules than she was used to."
"0554"	"(2006-04-18 (15)) I was watching Seriously Weird or something but I could touch stuff. I was touching Ryan Cartwright's hair and stuff (nothing nambla). I was thinking how cool this was. Then, we had known each other for ages and we were going out. He went to this school and I wanted to go and an interview was required. I was late and kept getting interrupted. There was a Chicken Treat nearby. The guy saw a photo of me, with Calvin and Silas, except the order was me, Calvin, Silas, and Calvin again. Silas and I were standing close and he asked who he was and I said ""Silas, a friend"" and he said ""I don't believe you"". Someone had an ear infection."
"0555"	"(2006-04-20 (15)) We had to do this race for school. Samantha, Silas, John Lennon, someone else and I were on a team. I got pictures of Ryan Cartwright and some were from movies. In one of the movies, he was gay. In another movie, Ben Mendelsohn was also in it. A guy lit his house on fire, then he changed to Ryan Cartwright and I was there."
"0556"	"(2006-04-20 (15)) I was at Nana's as were people from school. I was somewhere watching Nosferatu which had completely random added dialogue. Then it turned colour and I complained. We had sports photos taken and we had to line up depending on how good you are. Daryl was in a bus alone. I asked him if he wanted to come with us. We went down this sand and waited for Dad, but a bus came."
"0557"	"(2006-04-21 (15)) I was at Granny's old house. It was a bit dilapidated and very different. There was a door that had never been opened.

There was something about Christopher Walken."

"0559"	"(2006-04-23 (15)) I went to the movies with Dad, Calvin and Ryan Cartwright or Daryl. Dad ended up being replaced with someone. We couldn't find the movie we wanted to see (which was called Dynasty Digger). I was thinking back to a previous time when we went with Jayson and Ezra. Ryan or Daryl and I were making out and messing around. We went to KFC. Later, we went to a McDonald's and Dad was making out with some really ugly new girl. We were eating, and some girl didn't want meat. I was playing this annoying Mario game."
"0560"	"(2006-04-24 (15)) Dad was low on money, and Dad, Ezra and I broke into Acquaintance-F-11's house to steal some seeds because she had cool trees or something. I was in the study and Ezra and Dad were across the hall. I was putting stuff under the desk incase she came so that I could hide, but she came in and hit me. We explained what we were doing."
"0561"	"(2006-04-25 (15)) Slitherman was out of the tank. Everyone was playing with it but it kept chasing me up the stairs and through the doors. The same thing happened with a little crow later, but I liked the bird."

"0566"	"(2006-04-26 (15)) I was playing a pre-made Sims 2 family. One of them was a witch and was using the energizers. Her sister was in the family bin. They both thought that the other wasn't related to them. The evil one turned into a chocolate bunny and was labeled as ""The Wicked Witch of the East"". The other one was a normal chocolate thing. There were heaps of other eggs which I took since I didn't get many for Easter. This black girl had paper on her hair. Dad called. I was in a car with Mom and she came and there was a cute puppy."
"0567"	"(2006-04-27 (15)) I was at some place with Calvin, Fang, Evelyn and Silas. I was lining up to go on a boat, and we were petting chickens while we waited. Calvin went on the boat by himself and Evelyn was upset. She went in the back of one with me and Fang (who wanted to go with me). Silas was serving dip, cheese, gherkins and crackers. The gherkin was yucky. He got sick of doing it and gave the job to Duane. Silas had been working there since the place opened. I saw this grim reaper guy and I asked who he was here for and he told me. Later, the guy told us he knew he was going to die. Some girl was on this bouncy thing."

All of the animals chucked a spaz. We ran through a pipe and the lion ma chased us. Timmy was asking why we didn't say anything to him."
"0570"	"(2006-04-28 (15)) The Queen was sitting in a chair, in a room full of chairs occupied by other people. She was all spotty. Someone walked into her. She smelled. People from school and I were writing a bible and reading out loud."

"0575"	"(2006-05-04 (15)) Evelyn wrote down on a piece of paper who she liked, who I think was Darius. Somehow, the class got a hold of it, but no-one said anything. I was friends with Ryan Donowho and we were at the beach. Evelyn was there too and he was annoyed that she was there. I think later that either Darius or Ryan started hanging with Evelyn and ended up liking her. Then Mischa Barton was talking with someone in Mom's room."
"0576"	"(2006-05-05 (15)) The car broke. This guy took it to his house and said that he was going to fix it. I had to get some stuff. I had a feeling he was going to kill us and I saw that Samantha and Calvin had their bags down near the garage. I asked to go to the toilet so that I could get my bag. Later, as we were getting ready to leave, he had a premonition of us leaving. We ran and it ended up just me and Calvin. We ended up at these tents. One was a pub, one had babies and one was a dinner place. The pub was gay. We went to the dinner place and Elijah, Dmitri and Seamus were there. Darius walked in and sat with Elijah and Dmitri. I was worried that the army was going to come in and the guy would get us. People at the baby place were looking for the people from A Series of Unfortunate Events. One of the babies was called Klaus. This older girl's baby was found in the woods. We were trying to find somewhere to stay. There was a Diner Dash type of dinner -- people had stars for their mood etc."

His wife was looking at photos. I was at his friend's house and I caught him making out with this fat lady. Her father came home and we hid the fat lady. I was turning on the lights and none of them were working. I thought it was a dream and then they worked. Then there was this giant ice-lady and she grabbed me. I turned into ice. She was 'icing' everyone else. I managed to control her and then she melted."
"0579"	"(2006-05-07 (15)) Someone at school called Bob Wiley died. We had an assembly and we had to stand for God, and then there was holy music. There was a mini funeral. I was talking to this other guy called Bob and I forgot the name of the guy that died."
"0580"	"(2006-05-07 (15)) I was at Mom's and there were three guys who all had the last name ""Pritchard"". One of them was called Eugene, but wasn't the 'real' Eugene Pritchard.

"0585"	"(2006-05-15 (15)) There was a cat, who was Widget but wasn't, and it shot itself. It had two legs. Then I was in this place and there was no-one there, except for a few people. Everyone had been put into these categories. All of the categories were full. It was spooky, and I went to this shop and Jake Gyllenhaal was there. He was angry, but I wanted to get his autograph."
"0586"	"(2006-05-18 (15)) Mom and Ezra left me in her car while they went to get dinner from KFC. Her brake lights were on, which meant something about a bike. Daryl and someone came past on a bike and I had a bike so I followed them to this place. Elijah, Seamus and Dmitri were also there. I was hanging around for a while, when Ezra came with his burger. I hurried back to the car and Mom had eaten half of my burger."
"0587"	"(2006-05-18 (15)) I was at school and there was this 'boys' area. Calvin pushed me into it. Almost everyone had their shirts off and I was trying to get out and Elijah and Dmitri saw me.

"0588"	"(2006-05-19 (15)) I was at school and I got a heap of school clothes and my jumper. There were $2 coins. I put the clothes in a school bag and some in a plastic bag. I was then at a beach place. There was a tornado thing and it was going through the water and it was zig-zagging. I left the plastic bag behind but wouldn't take off my school bag which slowed me down considerably. We ran through a track. Where we were going had been destroyed. We ran back where we came from but it was collapsed in. Calvin, a girl, her brother (he looked and sounded like Chase from House) and I got trapped in this plastic tunnel thing. He liked me and kept making references to the fact. There was a tyre with a thing you blow into. It all melted later and we got out. I accidentally left my shoes. On the way back to get my shoes, Dmitri said that I sucked and kept being gay."
"0589"	"(2006-05-19 (15)) I accidentally opened my diary to a page that said ""I love Lumpy"". Calvin saw. He said he did and said ""I think you like Lumpy, but it's a guess""."
"0590"	"(2006-05-20 (15)) Dad, Ezra, Mom, Nana and I went for a drive somewhere. The road got cloudy so we decided to walk. We had burgers from McDonald's. We had two each, except there were eight. After struggling our way through the bush, we came to a clearing. This guy was in a car and he told us he'd kill us if we didn't hand over the burgers. Dad handed over four and I hid the rest. The guy ate two and got out of the car to do something. I ate my two burgers then gave Mom and Nana one each. The guy brought us to this place where he lived. There were caves and tents for houses. There were quite a few people there. They kept getting people and either eating or killing them or keeping them. The people I remember were Scott, who was the guy from the car, Dylan and David (who was in love with this girl that they had kept) and the girl that David liked. Scott ended up letting us go and Dylan, David and the girl as well. I wanted Scott to come (because he was hot) but I didn't say anything. We were then on a bus. David and the girl were cuddling and kissing. Dylan wanted to do the same thing with me and when I refused he talked to someone else. I was dressed in a costume. There was this doll in a dress and this little girl wanted to play with it. She said that she was ""five, not two"". There were older kids on the bus too. I saw The Graduate at a video shop. The end was actually people burning on a cross."
"0591"	"(2006-05-21 (15)) The gym at school was only for gay guys. Elijah needed to get changed. He was flicking the shutters on the side of the gym to see if they could see, then he was like ""Screw it"" and went to the toilet. I was watching Nickelodeon and there was something about five shows on one channel. Granny gave me chocolate. I was then at Nana's and Nana said that Big Brother was sexist."
"0592"	"(2006-05-23 (15)) The guys across the road were violent. They tried to get inside. I was yelling at them. They left. Later they jumped the fence and came in.

Mom said to find out what he something."
"0595"	"(2006-05-24 (15)) Ms Braun was shooting people. Seventeen of the bullets hit people who lived. It all kept restarting. I got hit, but it didn't hurt. Samantha got shot and Silas was crying. Then the next time, she shot everyone including a baby."

"0598"	"(2006-05-28 (15)) There was some show and people were in floats. Elijah, Dmitri and Seamus went past on a bus. The next day all these people were sick. This grass from this place had felt funny and tasted funny. We were then at school and this giant girl was walking around and she took funny steps. People were in costumes. There was this machine which did morphs of people. We were lining up and Calvin was in front of me. Daryl had his turn before mine. I still tried to go with him, but couldn't. Calvin got matched with Devin. We were hiding from some dude."
"0599"	"(2006-05-30 (15)) I got turned into an eye. I turned back into a person but I had a really good memory. Ezra and I had a fight. I was watching 'Big Brother' ad Kate was on it. There were comics at the house. Kate's ex boyfriend was on there."

"0601"	"(2006-05-31 (15)) Samantha, Calvin, Silas and I were somewhere. Dad and Ezra were there too. I think we were outside of town. I was at this place like a Roman place and I was having a bath. I dropped a jumper in it. This guy was playing music and he said that it would be the ""last piece of music you'll hear for a year"". There was a sign-in book at this place and it had been signed by me already and I signed again. Silas was on a little cart and was driving it. It had controls which went the opposite way they were supposed to. He almost ran over this hedgehog and got in trouble so I drove instead. I was in front of him before though (you drove from the back). Then I was at an airport and Dad was AWOL and we couldn't get the ticket. Somehow we were then at the airport (or so I thought) and I saw Daryl and his brother Dewey. Samantha and Calvin found stuff that I'd written that said ""I love"" and had Simon Pegg, Ryan Cartwright and a lot more people's initials. They thought something also said Zander, though it said MP (Michael Palin), which I was thinking said AL. Samantha said I was a 'little' obsessed. Daryl and Dewey were talking about me. Daryl had a piercing so I decided I didn't like him anymore."
"0602"	"(2006-06-01 (15)) There was a planet that was part of Earth, but was separate or something. I wondered why I hadn't seen it before, because you could see it clearly and could almost jump onto it. There was some disease on it and there was no cure or vaccine except for this thing that you had to inject within four minutes of being infected. I somehow ended up on there and so did a few others. There was a professional tattoo guy and he was the cause of the problem. There was an alien frog thing which they wanted to breed with someone but there was no water. This boy was found in the shower. His name was Dmitri or something that sounded like it. I had to look after him."

"0605"	"(2006-06-03 (15)) I was at school and it was Year 11. My timetable sucked. I had no S+E until next semester, but I had cooking first though it turned out that cooking meant Phys. Ed. This meant seven periods of Phys. Ed. a week. I refused to go and requested that it be changed. At some place someone was using a car or a bus as a plane."
"0606"	"(2006-06-03 (15)) I was at some place and Dmitri was going out with Brianna, but she cheated on him with Carson who she'd gone out with before. Almost everyone knew, but a teacher asked Dmitri about it and Dmitri got upset but soon recovered. I was standing around later with Dmitri and I saw Daryl over somewhere and I was thinking to myself whether I liked Dmitri or Daryl more.

"0609"	"(2006-06-04 (15)) I was reading a book and there was a part where this big lady changed her name to Izzy Conell. This torch was dim and then it wasn't. Dad picked me up from Mom's."

There were animals and everyone was swerving for monkeys. She said it was the Desert and I was saying it didn't look like a desert. Her oldest child was called Jennifer, her second was called Scott, and her youngest who was also a girl was called Cheddar. Some guy was in a purple thing. His name was James and God called him Michael. It was then a different time, and he was a philosopher. Someone 'popped' him and he said he would smash everything so we undid it."

Eugene and Seamus were fighting over a piece of paper which was something of Eugene's. It fell into the air and Eugene ran to Seamus so I grabbed it and it was photos of this actress called Mel something and reasons why he liked her. He started wrestling me for it. I had Media but I accidentally went to S+E. Dmitri said that he the best looking in his group at the time. His music video was for Only Sixteen, which was also what we were doing."

"0722"	"(2006-08-26 (15)) I was at this house. Calvin was there and two others. I was hiding from 'Brad Pitt'. There was a police and a teacher. I was in this room and I found a knife and a syringe. The guy threatened me so I stabbed him. Brad Pitt came at me and I was thinking about Fight Club."
"0723"	"(2006-08-26 (15)) Ezra was in Mom's shed. I was looking at the food in the kitchen and I found a jar of jam, off marshmallow and corn cream -- the corn went like that when it was off. Dmitri was somewhere."
"0724"	"(2006-08-29 (15)) I was watching an episode of The Outer Limits which was set at a bar with two girls and two guys. One girl was blue. The others were talking to the other guy and saying how she and this guy had had sex with the other girl and she had had a baby. They went off and after a while a fat lady came in and died. The guy got up and left. He couldn't breathe, but he knew it had something to do with gravity. I was in there for a second and I kept trying to breathe. He went in this house and then in his car and the guy drove them to place where they were experimenting. I had my diary. It showed the people leaving the bar and 'what would've happened if...?' It showed me watching it. Dad was in the way, as were some fishies. I was watching Dad. Ezra was nearby."
"0725"	"(2006-08-30 (15)) I was at school and there were songs playing -- 'Heaven', and 'I Got You Babe'. Calvin, Samantha and Evelyn were in my health class. Calvin was supposed to have Personal Finance. There was a computer. Dmitri was there and I was like 'What the hell is he doing here?'."
"0726"	"(2006-08-30 (15)) Nana said she had some people over who had a son my age. He was weird, but I liked him and I think he liked me. He managed to convince people to go near the bird cage. He had presents for everyone. I looked for mine and it looked like had a love heart crossed out. I wanted to get on a laptop. Poppa went to the toilet. I was talking to a girl about the guy and how he knew that I liked him. Then there were Pokemon wasp-looking things and Marill. Jayson was there."
"0727"	"(2006-09-01 (15)) There were gold pieces on the road and as you got further, they got larger. Me and this bad guy, who could read our minds, had been there first and taken the best ones.

"0731"	"(2006-09-05 (15)) Mom was trying to wake me up and it took ages for me to wake up. I went to McDonald's and there weren't many parking sports. There was a wheelchair. I found a Sims 2 book. Dmitri was driving a motorized thing up the escalator. There were jewelry stacks piled up and positioned so that it was easy to knock them over, so when people knocked them over they had to pay for them. I dreamt I was waking up. Mom went in my bed and was hugging and kissing me, so I woke up. Calvin was there? Ezra was being annoying."
"0732"	"(2006-09-06 (15)) These people were in this 'Eden' place. If you got stung by the bees there you would live forever. The grandparents killed themselves because of it. There was a girl and her sister and an adult guy. I think I knew the guy. People were looking for rocks. It was going to rain and there was shelter next door. The girl let herself get stung and the guy picked the stinger out."
"0733"	"(2006-09-06 (15)) Some guy made this really cool maze on his computer. I think he also made a girl."

A girl there was talking about someone called Eugene and she said to me ""Not Eugene Pritchard"" and I said ""I don't care"" They asked me if I would go on a team for my ""boyfriend"" etc."
"0739"	"(2006-09-07 (15)) I was at a house and there was a guy who looked like Judd Nelson. He took off in his car and we went to go into his house. Calvin and Ezra went in? I didn't. There were strange noises coming from Dad's room and Samantha was at home."
"0740"	"(2006-09-07 (15)) I was digging up TV shows in front yard. This guy wanted some movies and I said I'd just give him DVD's. There was this place for movies. This guy was asking questions.

"0741"	"(2006-09-08 (15)) I was at Granny's old house. Dmitri was there, but I don't know why. We were having a laugh. He was sitting on Granny's chair. I was on the one near the bookshelf. We were talking about school. Ezra said he reckoned he liked me. Dmitri was holding hands with Mackenzie somewhere."
"0742"	"(2006-09-08 (15)) Calvin grew into an 'adult', like how they do in Sims 2. He was really hot."

"0746"	"(2006-09-09 (15)) I was at school. We were given these rings that we had to keep with us at all times. We were making these boxes to keep them in to hang around our necks. We were in my English classroom. Mine went missing. Adele was there. Evelyn was sitting next to me. I went back to my desk as Dmitri was going to put something in his black file in this cupboard behind me. But because I was in the way, he gave the stuff to me to put away. I started reading through his file thing, and I was going to take some of his stuff, but Evelyn was watching me. There was a book where he had done those gay games with Calvin and there was something about ""Swamp Boy"". His interests (supposedly last 'searched' items) were piercings, eyebrows and I forgot the rest, there were lots though. I only remembered the bad things. I was terribly upset about this and decided I couldn't like him anymore. At lunchtime Ezra and his friends were annoying us. Calvin and I were throwing sticks at them. I think Elijah was there too."
"0747"	"(2006-09-10 (15)) I was in this cage thing. I forget what happened before, but anyway, Daryl and I were going out or something and we were both in this cage thing. Darth Vader sent us out and was fighting us. Darth was on the roof. He showed us a big building thing. I couldn't fight back, so he was teaching me how to use the force. At home, out the back, Anakin was chucking a spaz about Darth Vader [this doesn't make sense, but there you go] . He had a rocket."
"0748"	"(2006-09-10 (15)) I was out the back and this guy dug up this thing (except the guy was me). I was wearing a giant fleur de lis on my head. Dad took it off and my head felt weird."

"0760"	"(2006-09-15 (15)) I was at some weird place. These people decided they had to kill Calvin off and they shot him in the back of the head. But he didn't die and he ran away. There was no water around as it was rare. But, there were these (what I called) 'tribunals' to pump water from some place (which I thought I had taken from Kin-Dza-Dza). Ms Quintana gave me drops for my nose/eye. The liquid from the drops goes down your throat. I went to find Calvin. I was outside some shops and I ran away from people. There was this trail somewhere and I found Elijah, Seamus, Dmitri and Daryl. Someone had a fight."

"0768"	"(2006-09-21 (15)) I had S+E and Ms Corbett wanted us to stay in the library during lunch. I had to collect paper and I had to keep going through the library. Calvin came. The library was different. Pieces of paper from my dream book and stuff were falling out. Someone asked me something about going out with Payton. I was like 'What the hell?!'. I went over there. Payton and this girl had found a dream of me going out with Payton. I tried to explain. Ezra, Nicolas and some others took off with my bag. So I went to the Year 8 block. The playground was knocked over. I asked lady about the Year 8 block and then I saw black smoke, so I ran to Yr 8 block. I jumped on this thing and finally got to end (there were lots of jumps and stuff). Samantha was in this box thing at the end. She started eating this thing and others came and they were all eating and I realized eating meant death. So I survived."

I wanted to see the one at a place called Sealord, because it was the only one with Ted in it, but it was really far away. The movie ended with him and this girl having an argument."
"0772"	"(2006-09-24 (15)) We went out and when we came back home the door was unlocked. The TV was still there, so we figured we hadn't been broken into. I only remember Dad."

I then had art again but Calvin was in my class so I asked the teacher, who was different, if I could change classes. I had to go to the front office to see some Henry guy who was actually Hugh Grant (because, as I put it, it was an all-star cast). On the way there I was debating which class I should go to."
"0796"	"(2006-10-03 (15)) Mom was supposed to be taking me home. Ezra was in the car too. We were at some weird place and I asked ""Why are we near Nana's? We drove here once.""

If the dinosaurs got angry we had to hide in 'nooks' that were randomly placed. We were in a computer room. Samantha hid behind a curtain, which was behind some of the nooks. One of the dinosaurs came running in and I told it that a young dinosaur had gone past. It went out of the room to look, but Calvin said that it kept staring into this room. We went to the next room, which was full of computers too. We needed C4 for something and we also had to draw a picture of a guy that would be described by Mr Ripley. I decided to put my newly found drawing skills to work. I had to draw this guy within 15 minutes."
"0798"	"(2006-10-04 (15)) I was watching Cast Away except it was Gladiator, except it wasn't. Dad was in it, and I was sure that I was also in it, but everyone said that I wasn't. Then I was there. There was a king and he was sick of his fat wife and was looking for a new one. I encouraged this poor friend of mine to 'apply'. The king was getting her to read something, but she couldn't read. I was helping her and saying that reading was easy (I was from now, but they were from the past and most people couldn't read). The king ended up putting me down on his list and choosing me because I could read. There was an attack. I was hiding behind this gate and a dinosaur came up and took some guy in his mouth and I said ""George!"" and the dinosaur said in a creepy raspy voice ""George?"" and let him go. All the people in the village or whatever it was surrendered. All the important people were giving themselves up. I managed to sneak away. There were road signs in the village. Some guy said that the village was fake (like in The Village)."

I put my pages over there and Dmitri said ""When was the last time you were over here?"" We were discussing Pokemon from the book. I remember we were talking about Steelix and this other thing that Dmitri said looked like ""Aqua girl"". I said ""I've never heard of it, what's it from?"" He started laughing and said that he had made it up and I was like 'What the hell? That's not funny'."

I heard a girl saying ""If you weren't a knowledge Sim, what would you do?"" I remembered I had written that in my fat little notebook. She had read it. I looked in the book at that page and I had written stuff about Dmitri. Rebekah and Alyssa had a fight with me. They took my shoes. I went to sleep in Nana's room and they were going to cut my hair. They had big scissors. Nana woke me up and we both yelled at them. Ezra was there too."

Darren took me back later and I forgot my keys again. Dad was there this time though and he said to turn the lights off when the shop closed because he was going out. The customers were getting angry. People from school were there. Then it was closed, so I quickly got rid of all the customers."
"0808"	"(2006-10-08 (15)) I was reading about Robert Gant. He had died the 29/9/06 due to AIDS. I was thinking it was weird because that day was the first day that I started watching Queer as Folk (US). [It's not really, I actually first watched it on the 22/9/06.]"
"0809"	"(2006-10-08 (15)) I was at this weird place and Aunt Sally was living there, underground. Ezra was wearing a nappy and was chucking a spaz. People from Queer as Folk (US) were there. Scott Lowell and I ended up going out (only after a few minutes). Johnny Depp was there also. There was a premiere thing. He was flirting with me and there was this bouncy flower thing and there were pipes. Something turned into a mushroom. Scott and I left and we went to McDonald's. I wanted a chicken Caesar and because it was late and busy we had to wait. They let us wait in this special part of the drive thru, which actually was inside the store. Ezra and Dad pulled up behind us and I said hello. Then I was in the car with Dad and Ezra. Dad got a CD off a girl who was in some advertisement. We were going to watch it on the laptop."

"0813"	"(2006-10-12 (15)) I was with Scott Lowell somewhere and he was fat. It was only because he had an ice pack under his jumper and it was big and squishy. I was telling him how 'cute' he looked. Then I took the ice pack off him and put it under my shirt and I looked pregnant."
"0814"	"(2006-10-12 (15)) We drove past where the evil Brookland shops should be and it had been turned into an evil carnival place. I didn't even realize where it was until we drove past."

"0816"	"(2006-10-13 (15)) Dad bought this carnival (it was actually an old amusement park). It was all icky. There was a comic book store there. Michael (from Queer as Folk US) was working there. I met him and we got it all cleaned up and working."
"0817"	"(2006-10-13 (15)) I was at Mom's. The people next door were being shifty. I was listening to my iPod, outside sitting on the edge of the front yard, with my feet hanging over some bricks. I also had my Mp3 player, two bits of paper and two water bottles. Cuddles took my Mp3 player. A lady from next door came over and took all my stuff except for my iPod, which I refused to give up. I kept kicking her in the face. She said that she would take my iPod by Friday (it was Tuesday or something). I told Mom, but she didn't care. I was then at home, except it was Darren and Mom's place. I heard a noise and some singing and went into Dad's room and woke Darren. I told him that the people were here. I peeked out and Mom came out of the toilet. I asked if it was her that had been singing. She said no and then the bad guys appeared. I went back to my room and closed my door. They barged in. There were four guys and one girl (I think). One of the guys's decided that he didn't want to do this and he tried to push two of the guys out of the room. He couldn't and they set him on fire. I managed to run into Dad's room. While running, I tripped over this blonde guy who didn't try to stop me and I got a wine bottle and something else. I killed two of the guys. I was hitting the blonde guy a bit. An ambulance came for the burnt guy."

I was then naked and alone somewhere. I asked this teacher for clothes and she gave me a nighty. Some teacher was called Swanee, and had my season one of Queer as Folk (US)."
"0821"	"(2006-10-14 (15)) There was a video of me when I was little. I hit my neck on a swing on the floor. Dad helped me. There was a football game, then it wasn't and it was a museum. I wondered what was going on. I was then with the school at the museum and I was little."

There was this guy who looked like Gale Harold, I don't know his name, and there was this 'nerdy' guy who was a friend of mine called Eric, who looked like Andrew McCarthy (younger days). This Gale guy was a 'tough guy' and kept trying to go out with me. Eric was always around to distract him though. I liked Eric, and I knew that he liked me. Everything was covered in snow. I was walking near Gale's house and I was walking down these steps. Gale came down and started advancing towards me. Eric had this bomb thing, and it was counting down. It got down to 10 seconds and Gale decided that he was going to kiss me (he had me pressed up against a wall). So I grabbed Eric and started making out with him. He threw the bomb and it did something to Gale's legs. I had kissed Eric because I figured that the kiss from Gale was inevitable and so I wanted my first kiss to be with someone that I loved."

"0835"	"(2006-10-20 (15)) I went to Mom's. There were zombies. We decided to leave. I was putting my shoes on and told Mom to wait. She started going down the stairs and I asked if I could get my keys and she said yeah. I told her to wait again, but she opened the front door. When I went back to my room it was open to a balcony and there were two zombies. I bashed one of them, but the other wouldn't go down. Then I woke up."

There was a photo of Daryl in his house. Calvin asked me if Lumpy was one of my Top 2. I said no.

"0846"	"(2006-10-26 (15)) There was a movie set in the olden days. There was some Legionnaires type of disease. This guy was told to set off a bomb near these train tracks which was near a forest and some mountains. He died. This father guy said that it was a black guy so that the females didn't look.

There was a thing on the wall, covered in flowers. I walked out from behind the tree and I was then at Nana's. When I was walking back, Dmitri and someone were playing chess next to the pond, which was all different. I went back to the garden place and Darren had biscuits."

There were little plaques along the beach; one of them was 17 July 1909. There were lots of them from 2003. I was then at Nana's and she had a skipping rope of Mackenzie's. She had given it to me a while ago and asked me if I'd given it back to her yet and I said that I hadn't yet. But I didn't plan to because I didn't like and because she was always being flirty with Dmitri."

I called her and she said that she was in the school in a room somewhere, but it didn't have a number on the door. I found one and went in. Poppa and some guy from school were in there. We found Mom and then got caught. We got put in this room which had beds all around the outside, and all in the middle. One of the beds at the end had space for two more people so I went there.

I was trying to locate his last name, because I couldn't remember it (in real life, I rediscovered it in late 2007). I was then in the photo and I was looking at him close up and realized he had freckles; he was extremely 'vivid'. There were more photos and videos of me when I was young.

I was trying to find out about Classmate-M-24. I went into this room, which had a desk and 'waiting' chairs. I saw this kid who looked like him. I asked if his last name was Ellis and he said yes. Then I asked him if her father was called Classmate-M-24 and he said yes.

Elijah came to the door and the werewolf was behind him, but the werewolf only wanted me. I ran outside onto a balcony. I opened the door once I was outside so that it would open to a little girl. The wolf came and I closed it. Then I was naked. There was a place where people fix cars (and there were lots of cars). Samantha and I took a shirt from them. Then there was a clothes montage.

Calvin got a letter from Ms Cole to let him do accounting instead. I needed to ask her, but I thought she was going to say no, but she let me. I had three pairs of shoes. In accounting I had to sit next to Harlan. Samantha poked her tongue out at me. There were lots of people in the class. Later, we were watching something and I asked Samantha if she watched Heroes.

This friend of mine morphed into a guy, but she wasn't really a guy. Her father came in and she couldn't morph back. I was then outside near this fence and there were dead animals. I was asking the guy behind the fence to let us in. He said that he wasn't allowed to let anyone in. I said ""If someone was dying, would you let in a doctor?"". He said that was different. I said that there were rotting animals nearby. Someone asked a nun for help. Her name was Sister Mary and we were then allowed in."
"0999"	"(2007-01-06 (15)) I was in water. There were these different tornado things, which had personalities or something. The worst one would ""maul your face"" as someone said. The tornados were people, sort of. I was talking to the 'mauler'. Some guy managed to get past it. I was then somewhere else and tornados were coming. Dad, Ezra and I left the house and I think we were going to get Mom. We drove to this other city and stopped at a petrol station to get petrol."

He was on the other side of the fence and we were in the playground area. I was trying to convince Ezra to go on some Superman ride with me. Hugh and I actually knew other and we were going out or something. I was up at the fence and was gently blowing and he could feel it on his face. I put my feet on the fence and was moving it. He could work out what I was trying to say? He put his feet up to. I sent him a message saying ""Pirates of the Caribbean sucks balls, Izzy"". Then Silas sent heaps of stuff to him. I said ""You're dead too?"""

This music video came on and Charlene was saying how much she loved Evanescence. She also said that she remembered Calvin (she hasn't ever met him or heard about it).

"1020"	"(2007-01-20 (15)) Rottnest was having problems. It was actually a manmade island and kept sinking. I went to some Timezone place with some guys. I liked this guy called Shane, but then I liked this guy called Steve. Later, Ezra was on the island when it started sinking.  There were two Spaceman's. Ezra left on a boat and he thought that he'd thrown one off."

"1022"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) We were friendly with these aliens. One of them was called Jenny Broomer (which was just spelt with Greek symbol). She was actually Callie and was with George (both from Grey's Anatomy). She had to eat cockroaches before she'd be with him. She was in our spa. I didn't like her but was trying to be friendly and gave her lollies. I went out there at one point and she was gone."
"1023"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) Mom and I were in a car. This girl friend of mine came up and asked Mom for help but Mom said no, so she asked me. I accepted telling her that I'm no good for advice. She led me to this car and underneath was a 'vagina'. It was actually just a pile of intestines and there was blood everywhere. There was some red thing rammed into the middle of it and I took it out. I was thinking about Ted Bundy."
"1024"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) I was at school and I had to go do this thing with beds, like move them around and stuff. Anyway, afterwards I found the bench and Calvin was there with Evelyn."
"1025"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) Ted Bundy and I were hanging out. He had done something bad and we were running from the police. He had 'powers' and could stop time and rewind it, among other things. We were driving fast in this car and it went airborne over this gap and landed on this mountain sort of thing, with a road on it. There was a goat in the car. He drove on this wobbly road really fast and I was worried we would go over the edge. We ended up in Washington DC. The house thing was near a fair and a restaurant. This lady and her kids were at the fair and I said something to the kid and the mother chucked a spaz. Ted paused or did something weird to the time and I bashed her. She said that I'd said ""Sod off"". He rewound time and we left. Johnny Depp was in the restaurant and Ted said ""Now he's eating"" and then Johnny looked at us for a second and then left. I was sitting at a table and some girl asked if I wanted to go to some back room. I said no, but Ted went. I left the table and saw Johnny Knoxville coming out of a cinema. I asked him for a photo and he said ""It's not important"" and went to rest somewhere. He was going to the back room, so I went in there first. It was all seats, like a cinema. It was dark and I was trying to find Ted. Then all these people started to pretend that they were who I was looking for. Ted made them turn the lights back on and I found him and we left. As we were walking out through some door, I had my arm around him and I realized and quickly took it back."
"1026"	"(2007-01-22 (15)) Ezra was watching some movie with Gene Kelly, which was Hello Dolly, but it was actually called 'Dolly Wife'. I thought it was strange that he was watching it."

"1029"	"(2007-01-23 (15)) Ezra and I were going to go to the movies with Dad. We ended up at a zoo near a friend of Mom's. We were actually close to the cinema. Her friend looked like Mr Willingham. He was really rich and had a HUGE pool. I came back there some other time and Charlene was there on a swinging chair. I sat next to her and she said that she wanted his stuff (he was going to sell it and was probably going to give some money to me). He came along and pushed the chair away from the edge of the pool, which had no water in it, and was full of his stuff. Some guy at this new house wanted his books. Some of them were called Idiot, George and Stumpy. The Idiot one fell out but pushed Charlene into the pool."
"1030"	"(2007-01-23 (15)) I was at school. We had a gay seating plan. I was then in this shop and Dmitri was following me around in a wheelchair. I ended up at an aisle with PC games, and then he left."
"1031"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) This dude, girl and I were on a boat. We had to go fast somewhere and we all had to hold on tight to each other. We did this a second time and the girl was dying, but sometimes she was Spaceman. He kept trying to escape. We ended up at this hospital which looked more like a hotel. It was now a girl again, and her parents came. Her father brought wire to strangle her. I took it off of him. I was upset because she was dying and I was thinking about Vivian for some reason."
"1032"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) These two guys were joined at the hip. There was a knife stuck through the middle of one of them, I think. I had to pull it out, but if I did, it would probably kill one of them."
"1033"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) I was in a toilet. I heard Ezra's friends outside and I tried to hide but couldn't, so I walked out and screamed at them, but at the same time they screamed at me."
"1034"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) I was putting heaps of blankets on my bed. Tigger was there. I saw Tinkerbell. I told Mom and Ezra that Tigger was seeing Tinkerbell. She said ""Has anyone else seen Tinkerbell?"" and I said that I had."
"1035"	"(2007-01-26 (16)) There was some teacher woman called Melissa and she had been in my Year 1 class. She was fat. I think something happened to a boat."
"1036"	"(2007-01-26 (16)) Ted Bundy had disappeared for some years. I went to some jail because I had to go do something quickly and I went to this room with people doing a test. The teacher came in and was annoyed that I was there, but then kicked out this guy who looked like John Cazale, and told me to sit the test. I said ok, but that I needed to go to the toilet. I found Ted and we left. John Cazale and company were hanging around outside somewhere. Some girl started abusing me and Ted. I said I was sorry for what happened to John, though I actually wasn't. They left and Ted was like ""What the hell?"" We were both trying to avoid him. We were then at a hotel. Ezra was there. Ted and I were sharing a bottom bunk. The bed was actually in the wall, but Ezra was taking the one on top. Ted put his arm around me and we were making out. We ended up having sex. All these people were watching through the windows. I closed the blinds, but they weren't really helpful."
"1037"	"(2007-01-27 (16)) Mom was telling Ezra and I stories. She was telling Ezra something and I heard ""Grabbage"". I asked her to repeat it because it was a teacher I had before (I was thinking about Mr Grabski). I told her and she was embarrassed (she'd had sex with him). I went to Plainfield. I had been there before and there were heaps of people from Brookland in the hall. I remember seeing Daryl and Dmitri. I met with some people outside. We had to go in groups and do sport things. I didn't have some $1000 contract that would allow me to participate. I told the leader teacher, who was Mr Grabski. I text Calvin to see if he remembered him. Calvin ended up at my house looking for something later. We had to put our bags in these lockers. Calvin went off in some group. Tiana went with me. I was going through a yearbook from 2004. Parvati and Eliska were there. The music video for Od-na came on and I said ""I love this song!"". Tiana went for a drive, then she came back. I then ended up lost somewhere with Dmitri and 'Mr Simon Grabbage'. I was following them. Then it was Runescape like, and I died somehow. I asked some random to get my stuff and then I text Dmitri. I was in some snowy place with 'Jupiter rocks'."
"1038"	"(2007-01-27 (16)) There was this weird animal which was made of rubbish. It was weird. Mom knew what it was, but wouldn't tell anyone. I was with Silas somewhere and there were benches."

"1040"	"(2007-01-29 (16)) I was at Mom's, but it was different. Ezra, Mom, Darren and I were leaving and I saw someone run into the house. Mom went in and called the cops. The guy ran out and went near the old person's home, which was a shop and was hanging around there. He started shooting and I hid behind a tyre on the car. I lay down and pretended to be dead because he started running over. He put the gun on me and was looking for the bullet holes. It turned into a 'movie' and he realized I had none and I grabbed the gun and said (though not me) ""Blow on this!"" and shot him. Later, I was at home and Clayton was there. I asked if anyone else was alive. He said everyone was. I went down the hall and my room and Dad's room were dark. The lights wouldn't turn on. I saw shadows in my room moving. I said that I knew it was a dream. I closed my eyes wishing for Ted Bundy, but then I woke up (dream within a dream)."
"1041"	"(2007-01-29 (16)) I was watching Devil's Rejects. There were heaps of new characters. Otis and Baby were at this pub. Otis had a strong accent and I was thinking 'What? This sucks!'."
"1042"	"(2007-01-31 (16)) I was in a car with Mom and Ezra. I think Clayton was there. We were talking about movies and Ezra asked ""Which Scarface do you like better?"" and I was like ""What the hell?"". A movie was being made in this place. I was walking with some guy. People had tape all over the backs and stuff. I asked someone if that was where they were supposed to get shot. They ignored me. I was standing with these REALLY tall girls. There were two guys nearby and my friend said ""fat gay man""."
"1043"	"(2007-02-01 (16)) I was in a building and I was looking at my timetable for school and looking at the teachers that I had. The Wayans Brothers were listed. Tom Cruise and Kiefer Sutherland were the drama teachers. I think Eddie Murphy was there too. I was telling Mom about them all being actors. I was in some room and someone came running in trying to shut the door. Someone was after him trying to kill him. We all started running and we jumped through this 'screen'. We didn't know where to go. I ended up in this office area and Christopher Lloyd was there. Christopher was going to hide behind a desk and I squeezed in near him. He said something, but I all remember is ""shaved leg"". I pulled this curtain so that I couldn't be seen. Christopher ended up moving. I ended up at home and I was trying to find somewhere to hide. I couldn't fit anywhere and the person arrived. I rewound time. This whole thing had happened before, and it kept happening again and again and I couldn't stop it."
"1044"	"(2007-02-01 (16)) I was at this place near a lake. There was a bird in there. This girl was dying and she jumped in to save it. She said that we had to give it to her mother because she knew how to revive it. The bird kept 'biting' me."
"1045"	"(2007-02-01 (16)) Ezra was doing weird things in bed, and I thought he was 'touching himself'. I was at a shop with Mom.

"1046"	"(2007-02-02 (16)) I was in Dad's room and there were lots of cats. There was a ginger one, a black one and two big blue ones. They had blue rectangle patterns. They acted and looked like dogs. I was friends with Hayden Christensen. I was then at a shop with Nana. I was allowed to get one thing. I found a book about Peter Paige and Nana said she knew him and used to flirt with him and I was like ""He's gay!"". Then, we were fishing and there was this duck or parrot. I was then on a bus with Calvin. I had this Star Wars sticker book. It was all cartoon-like though. Hayden Christensen got on the bus and I called him ""the dude who played the guy in Star Wars"". He was crying and upset. I went to talk to him."
"1047"	"(2007-02-03 (16)) I was at 'school' and I was on the computers. There was a long line of computers. A teacher was talking to Eugene. He said that he liked computers and the teacher said ""so does Izzy"". His friends were like ""You don't want that!"". Later, we had something else in common and they said ""You REALLY don't want that!"". I saw Mr Nixon and I was thinking 'What the hell is he doing here?'. He was married. Jeremiah took my computer when I got up."

I was trying to pick the same colours as some friend of mine, hoping we'd get put in a group together. I was then sitting down somewhere with Calvin. Other people were sitting down too. Thuy kept following me and kept giving me some of her ""cookie cake"", as she called it. I couldn't find my water bottle and Thuy went looking for it. There were holograms. Harlan was being a retard like usual. There were lockers and mine was 22 or 23? Mine was above Jack Nicholson's. I was counting the lockers in weird ways, but kept stuffing up. Ms Rodrigues was there, except she was Bailey (Grey's Anatomy). Harlan found out that I had Myspace and was like ""Why the hell do you have one?""."

Mom and Darren were outside. Police came."
"1053"	"(2007-02-07 (16)) Dad and I watched a movie. There was a piece of paper on the back door to see if I had gone out the back. I had some medicine thing in the cupboard that was Michael Palin's or something. It was one year old and there was a ransom note. I was thinking 'Oh my God! I've killed him!'. There were photos of him being tortured. I was going to watch another movie with Dad which had Marlon Brando in it and was supposed to be really funny. I ended up watching the beginning of another movie."
"1054"	"(2007-02-07 (16)) Mom was trying to guess who I liked. She had Eugene, Daryl, Calvin and Orlando Bloom written down. She found out that I liked dark hair and so she crossed off Calvin. She had already crossed off Eugene. I noticed that Dmitri wasn't listed."

I found Mom and she went to my room and nothing was there, but the sheets were messed up. I peeked in later and she was there again. I looked there again later and there was another girl in there and she had burnt legs. Mom saw her. She woke up eventually. Then I turned into her and I was naked. I ran to Mom and Ezra holding and hiding my genitalia. I was skinny, but had a little tummy and I was like 'It's nice being skinny'. This girl had been gone for 25 years. She had been anorexic but then had gotten fatter. I was then at school and I sat at the bench. I was wearing a shirt of Dad's.

He had got me three puzzles. Then we were at Mom's house. I put on my Spongebob shirt instead of my school shirt by mistake. We went to McDonald's for breakfast and Ezra was like ""Not again!"".

I told him to get lost and that I couldn't stand ""looking at his ugly head"". He kept following me. He said he liked me and I was absolutely disgusted. He offered me a lift and I refused. I couldn't work out how to get out of the shop."

Mr Reilly was saying something about the end of the year and that he looked forward to $7200. There were rides at this place and Charlene was there. Then I was at this place. The staff were all robots and robots had taken over everything. I was watching this movie where this guy went into this rocket before it exploded and he was trying to push the bomb and himself out.

I was upset because I wasted most of my life at school and was annoyed that I was never going to do anything. I was then at Mom's. Some band was playing nearby. Margarita was outside and I slammed the door in her face. Later she tried to hurt me through the cat door. I was friends with some of the band. Then I was someone else.

But Calvin wanted to go to the '12 million' one. We used a tray to float down. When we were up there I said ""This is too high!"". There was this room and these apples were coming through the window and the door and they were getting bigger and filling up the room. It showed them coming through one at a time, so it was jerky looking."
"1119"	"(2007-03-12 (16)) I went out the back with Dad and Vivian. I was talking and then I realized that they were preoccupied so I looked over and noticed that they were reading my diary. One entry said 'Dmitri is very hot!'. At the start of the diary I had written stuff about Daryl. Dewey was there too, but his last name was spelt 'Kirchs' but had Kirsch next to it. I looked away and looked again to check if it was a dream but it didn't change. I got up and ran inside. That Japanese guy from Alias was there. Then we were outside again and he was chopping us up.

I was trying to get around and I thought I had my period."
"1126"	"(2007-03-15 (16)) I had English, but it turned into Accounting. I was in the library. We were sitting inside the area when you first enter.

He said that he'd be the first to admit that he ""fancied Jess"" (Jessica Stevenson). He went on to say how great she was. Everyone was like ""Whoa! Didn't see that one coming!"""
"1127"	"(2007-03-16 (16)) Ezra and I were wagging. Nicolas was hanging around. We had to run past Mr Norris etc. The next day, Dad found out we were wagging. Mom had been picking us up. The next day we went to this oval place which had a tennis court. Eugene came. He saw me and then left. We all had to run through these 'accordion' doors. There were these elevator things and moving blocks which we had to jump over. It was a big Phys Ed obstacle course. I ended up in this dark room which was mainly a big hole, but had platforms with beds on them. Mr Quinlan was watching over. Eugene fell down and Darius was trying to help him. I was reading his stuff and looking at baby pictures (though it was actually all about Rafe Spall) and it had his mothers name and stuff. Calvin text me to see if I was coming to school tomorrow."
"1128"	"(2007-03-16 (16)) I was talking to Daryl about Runescape. He was level 49 and I called him a noob and said ""Well you can't fish!"" and I said ""I'm level 64 fishing!""."

There was a relief teacher and they asked me if I liked Nathan Nelson (I was thinking it was a cross between Dmitri and Seamus). I asked ""who?"". On the roll, there were dots for people the teacher thought liked each other. Mr Reilly had put me and Daryl together. I had asked a teacher for a yearbook a while ago as we didn't get one for Year 10 or 11 (I was Year 12). Eugene was in the class. Calvin and Sabrina were together on the roll. I tripped over this wall. My leg was twitching and Jeremiah was looking at it. Daryl invited me to his house and I went there. He gave me this farm-y looking shirt [Clark Kent like] . They had a big house. There were ghosts there. They had all these Pokemon pictures around. There was going to be a party there. There were photos of Daryl and he had a piercing and I was like ""ew"". Daryl tried to get me to drink and I refused. His mother said that he just quit smoking. I told Ezra about the dots but he already knew. I was trying to tell Mom that I didn't like him."
"1133"	"(2007-03-22 (16)) I was somewhere that I've never seen before (though I knew where I was in the dream). Poppa was working on a building. I had an 'epiphany' of that popcorn cartoon. I found this pyramid. It had this thing out the front which was mine. I went in and it was all my stuff. There was a tape in the video player. I pressed play and it was this Simpson's cartoon. Then another cartoon came on and I recognized the bear from the popcorn cartoon so I rewound it and it was it. It was only half cartoon and there was no popcorn music. Autumn was the bear and she was climbing through that pipe. I was thinking 'No way!'. We were on an island."
"1134"	"(2007-03-24 (16)) Calvin and I were talking next to the sports shed thing on the oval near North Midvale. The bars were stretchy, like rubber. Calvin put his arm through and grabbed a ball and let it bounce off the bars and back in. Teacher-M-06 told us off, although he hadn't seen the ball. He took all of this stuff of mine including my pillow, bag, TV and DVD player and put it into the shed. Dad was driving us away and I realized my phone was in there. Teacher-M-06 and Mr Willingham wouldn't let me in to get it. Autumn was there and we were arguing about getting my stuff back. She left so she couldn't say that I'd done anything. I grabbed my bag and pillow and left. Eugene was near our car and I saw Daryl in his car. Something he'd done earlier confirmed that he was gay. Ezra and Farrah were in the car. I saw Barry Pepper outside the car and I told Dad that that was ""the guy who looks like Tigger!"". Dad was laughing and Barry was like ""what?"". Dad said ""You have to ask my daughter"". I kept laughing every time I looked at him and I couldn't tell him. His friends were laughing and waving about. Debra Messing was on the oval and her friend was trying to make her meet guys. All of these 'college' guys started pouring out of North Midvale. Then a bunch of kids came. There was a crazy lady there and she said ""I don't care which one; I just want one that's pretty"". She caught this boy and was going to make her sister care for him so that he turned out like her. She was picking out clothes and he ran into the shed and she was like ""Meh, that's where I'm going next""."
"1135"	"(2007-03-24 (16)) I was at school and there was a long row of chairs and Calvin and I were sitting next to each other.

"1142"	"(2007-03-27 (16)) I was at home. People kept breaking in all the time. Mom said that we (Ezra, Valerie and kids and I) should leave the back door open. This guy came and attacked us. Mom came and stopped him. He had stuff of ours in his car. Kevin Heffernan was there, but he hadn't taken anything and we let him go but then stopped him again. He had my toy box in his boot."
"1143"	"(2007-03-27 (16)) I was in a forest. There were cars that didn't work well. Autumn was there. I had the pickup but I couldn't drive it. I needed to get somewhere. There was a swimming competition on and Calvin was there and his cousin, Acquaintance-F-02, was in it. Ezra was there and he had a cool jacket and these guys were like ""Whoa, awesome"" but it had a teddy bear picture on the inside, so Mom put it on weird so it couldn't be seen."
"1144"	"(2007-03-28 (16)) There were these fork/butterfly things which you breathed into and it erased your memory for a while until you breathe into it again. You could also 'explore'. I went behind my wall and there were all these pictures of guys.  I went down this hallway. I found a door to Tiana's room. I went in and was talking to her boyfriend on the phone and invited him over. I was then at school and Calvin and Madelyn left for a minute. These retards were sitting near me. This lady came up and thought I was a sad loner. She was asking me these questions about being sad and lonely and I was like ""I'm fine, what the hell?"" Then Calvin and Madelyn came back."

He got this report card and gave me something that was mine. I gave something to him instead of his mother. He put the report somewhere and pulled out another which had A's and B's. He was in the same year as me. There was this 'town boogeyman'. He had vines in his yard that would swing down. People were lying on the floor and we had to wait for hours to be let out of this cage thing. Some people got trapped in a section of the yard which was surrounded with chicken wire. He got our laptops. They were outside his house. Ezra ran off and I was about to, but I went to the door and asked for him. He got a gun and I thanked him."
"1147"	"(2007-03-31 (16)) I was watching this dating show. People kept going to the Titanic. These bodies would always float up. I was complaining to Dad about it. This lady on the show decided on a date with a dog instead of this guy. That white thing from The Neverending Story was on this bridge that looked like the one in a level in Crash Bandicoot: Warped."
"1148"	"(2007-03-31 (16)) I was watching this movie that James Spader was in. It was like Secretary."
"1149"	"(2007-04-01 (16)) A nuclear bomb was going to go off. I found this trapdoor and some people and I went down. The place ended up full of people. It was mostly closed off, but one side faced this field and the other walls had spaces at the top. Some people were trying to get in from outside. This helicopter was spraying water in for us. There was an envelope on this desk which had photos of kids with their fathers. There was something with James Spader and Nathan Page."
"1150"	"(2007-04-01 (16)) I was at home and I put my That's Life! answers into an envelope but then I realized that I hadn't done the puzzles yet. Dad called me an idiot."
"1151"	"(2007-04-02 (16)) I was at school and we were getting ready for graduation photos. I was in this room that I'd never seen before and it had 'steps' with chairs on them. I saw Tiana there. Everyone was sitting in different groups and I was by myself. Tiana's group was called out first and I followed since I was nearby. I sat next to her and she wanted Eliska to sit there, but she didn't tell me to move. I thought Eliska was Alessandra at first. Daryl was in the same group. I saw Eugene and did a reality check but it didn't work."
"1152"	"(2007-04-02 (16)) Calvin wanted to go to Hawaii and I was like ""Hawaii's gay""."
"1153"	"(2007-04-03 (16)) I was in a room somewhere and I asked Ezra to pick the best looking guy out of a list of people. The list included Simon Pegg, Mark Heap, Nick Frost and Dylan Moran. I said I thought Dylan Moran was. There was a video playing with Mark Heap in it and Ezra said ""I hate that guy!"". The movie was old but James Spader was in it and I had downloaded it, but I didn't know that he was in it. I was at home and Dad was hanging out with Amanda Bynes."
"1154"	"(2007-04-03 (16)) We were at this weird place somewhere. I think we were outside. Mr Stevenson was showing us flowers. If we guess what it was, we got a prize. Almost everyone got a prize for the first one. I got the second one. Seamus was there and I said ""Shut up Shiggan!"" and he almost fell over."
"1155"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) We had an excursion and were at this amusement park. We were sleeping and Calvin put something of Eugene's on top of me. Elijah and Seamus got me to sign this branch thing. Adelynn found all these 'smelly' things. I could smell all of these things with my mouth open. One of the things was really stinky, but I was too excited that I could smell it and I didn't care. This dog had to find these two cookies (by smelling). He found them and ate them. Then I was at this place with a bunch of other people. Adelynn asked ""Who 'did' A Clockwork Orange?"". Elijah put his hand up, so I did. A bus came. I had stuff hanging off the edge of this 'ledge' (it had logs across it). This girl pushed my stuff off so I picked her up and threw her off, but she was ok. Eugene came to do whatever the activity was with the branch, but all the spots had been taken. I wasn't allowed to eat McDonald's. Dad talked to Tiana on MSN and they talked about Spongebob."
"1156"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) Mom was going to a wedding. I found out that it was Genevieve's wedding, except her last name was 'Ocean'. She was getting married to Classmate-M-26."
"1157"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) I was taking photos of Eugene and Darius. They got attacked by something. Then they were chasing me. When we finished, we ended up at this room with containers and jars. Then we were on grass and were friendly with each other. I was trying to get Eugene to eat the dirt and he did. Someone said something about ""bubbly two something"", but it sounded like they said another number first. Eugene asked ""How can you have bubbly two something?"" We were giggling about it. I can't read or remember what it was, but when I read it, I think it was either peas or pillows, or maybe neither."
"1158"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) I was watching the first episode of Sister Sister with Ezra. The 'new' twin was changing the house around. The 'Dad' (all the characters weren't the real ones) was a principal. The new twin told him to chuck a party at the house. The old twin was saying how big her mother's bed was. Then we were playing a game in this dark room. We had to catch the bad guy. Then it was real and someone said that the ""killer was already inside"". Later, Ezra and I were playing. He caught me, but he thought I was Nicolas."
"1159"	"(2007-04-05 (16)) There was some competition with fish. You got turned into a something. I solved the puzzle and there was a cut on a fish? Ezra solved it too. For some reason, he swapped our fish heads around and I was trying to get the right ones back. This guy was burying his head. We were like ""What the hell?""."
"1160"	"(2007-04-05 (16)) We were in the car and we parked in this 'extra' carpark at Science Museum. Nana was with us. Margarita told someone that I was fat and I said ""At least I'm not fat and ugly like you"". The Science Museum was across the road. Then I was there with Mom, Ezra and Darren. We had these cards which allowed us to buy stuff. It wasn't the Science Museum though; it was just this gigantic shop. They had some cool clothes and I found some gloves. Then I had no pants on. Mom signed under my name for the card. I wanted to do it though. There was this cool skeleton outfit. I was trying to decide what to buy. I was calling out across the shop. I found these school bags and one had lots of pockets. There were also these REALLY big bags. I was looking for a wallet. I found these people who did something and they were evil or something. I was in some section and this said that I wasn't allowed there. They were calling for me over the speaker, so I got out. Tim Brunero was there and he said that I was ""allowed anything"" from outside the shop. They were packing it away and then he turned into Mandy Patinkin. There was a cool jumper and a cool raincoat thing. Mandy put on the jumper and I was like ""Yeah, I want that one!"". It was blue and completely different from the one I wanted but I thought it was red. So I found a blue one in my size. My name had already been put down for it and I was like 'How did that happen?'. Then I was back in the shop. There were Easter eggs. Dad carried me through this tunnel. I told him to ask the manager at McDonald's for my Easter egg. The manager looked like Joseph Cotten."
"1161"	"(2007-04-06 (16)) I was at a rich person's house, at which there was a party. There was a gate out the front and I saw Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald and James Spader walking up to it; they all looked how they did in Pretty in Pink. James Spader was wearing that light blue suit thing. I wasn't even paying attention to the other two. I decided I was dreaming. James Spader smiled and I was thinking for the gate to be gone as I reached for him and then it was. I grabbed him and started making out with him. James had his arms around me, while we were still making out and then we ran into the house. He was looking around for something and said ""Where's that fuck-in?"" I said ""What's a fuck-in?"" and I thought 'Oh my God, I just swore! Oh, doesn't matter it's only a dream'. He said ""That thing that you fuck in,"" I said quietly ""That thing you fuck in"". Then I lost lucidity. Then we were some other guy and some other girl and the guy liked this other girl, but decided to have sex with that girl anyway. They ran off and were in this tent inside. This lady saw them and asked ""What are you doing?"" and he said ""Yoga""."
"1162"	"(2007-04-06 (16)) Ezra, Clayton and I left home to find Mom. It was really dark. We got up the street but then decided that we should go back. It was then pitch black, literally -- there was no light whatsoever. We were confused. We edged our way back and started running whenever a car drove past (for the headlights). Eventually, we made it back home. I thought 'Now Mom will come and it will be all Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. It was. Mom was going to go meet Leslie. I was having trouble locking the front door. The wood door wouldn't close or lock. I then thought that it must be a dream and I managed to lock it. The power went out a few times and there was a door at the top of the stairs (it looked like Mom's house on the inside). I was then somewhere typing my password for my email and it was showing. I was hitting the right keys, but it was all wrong. I asked Mom to read out what I typed and I figured that it was a dream again."
"1163"	"(2007-04-06 (16)) I was at some place with the school. They were talking about who would make a good couple. The teachers thought that Eugene and I would. There was something about werewolves. Later, there was a list of 'who likes who'. It had Rafe Spall with 'Lauren Sarah Broughan' or something. It had Jerry O'Connell with Mad Max II. There were Pokemon cages? This stone, which was a kind of light, was lit when you put a piece of paper underneath it and it would be used as a projector. I tried it and it didn't work. I found this water and I realized that it couldn't be seen through the water. Some guy asked for the list. I saw Eugene nearby and then I heard this guy who sounded like Dmitri. Calvin was there too."
"1164"	"(2007-04-07 (16)) I was at a licensing place. Daryl was there and he had failed his test. Someone asked him how some pregnancy tests went. Dewey was there too. Then it was lunch at school. We were talking and he started dealing out cards. The game was really confusing. I went to the toilet. Then we were at Nana's, except it was home. Ezra and Dad were there. Poppa said no smoking and no kids in the room (games room). We had to go outside and I was complaining. I said ""We can't change it"" and Dad told me to ""accept it"" and I was like ""What the hell?! I just said that!""."
"1165"	"(2007-04-07 (16)) I was dressed up as a guy (was pretending to a transvestite). I was in the back of the car, out the front. A bunch of real transvestites were walking down the street so I hid. One came up to the car, so I got out and said ""What you looking at fool?!"" in a deep voice and they ran off."
"1166"	"(2007-04-07 (16)) Mom kept driving through all these McDonald's. Sometimes she wouldn't get me a thick shake, other times I would forget to ask. [The night before, she wouldn't get me a thick shake] ."
"1167"	"(2007-04-08 (16)) I was with Mom somewhere and she randomly said ""I thought everyone thought that Eugene was hot"" and I almost spat out my drink. She had gone to a shop six hours away. Scarlett was there and she said that she ""can't look him in the face because he is so ugly"". Mom suggested that I call his mother and thank her. I said that everyone thought that Darius was hot and she said something about me being different and I said that both were yuck. Then I was at home and Mom was going through my laptop and stuff. Dad did as well. Mom said that I had said that I wanted to go the ball ""for an instant"". I said ""No, I didn't"". Dad and I were late to go to the Little Britain thing. Silas called me and read off some joke about a woman wanting her boobs to grow. Ezra was in the car. Then, Dad and I were going to Little Britain, which was actually a second show. Silas and Seamus were going, but sometimes it was both of them, sometimes it was only one of them. Silas had seat I9 and we had I11 and I12. He came and sat next to us. David Walliams was on the stage and was walking on a tightrope which was over a pool of water with a 'shark' in it. He was wearing board shorts with a shark on them. Silas was pretending to swim. They played a video on a cinema looking screen with Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall and they were cops. It started off gay and David was reading a really boring news report. Then he said ""Why isn't anyone laughing?"" then ""Well there is this shit!"" and it turned into Little Britain. David Walliams was walking past and Silas leaned over me to see. There was a blackout and Seamus, Silas, David Walliams and I lost our memories. This lady was pretending to be Seamus's girlfriend and she was from Delaware. I recognized the people I knew and I knew she was a fake. I was later talking to David behind the seats, but he kept turning into Michael Rosenbaum. Seamus and Silas later joined us. Someone called me a virgin and Dad said ""She better be!""."
"1168"	"(2007-04-08 (16)) I had a bunch of little dreams where I realized I was dreaming but I would promptly fall into another dream."
"1169"	"(2007-04-09 (16)) We got these Intro Calc tests back. I got 100%, but my overall mark was 92%. Eugene and Darius got about the same. Brianna got 18/20 and 98%. I had a chicken sandwich for lunch. Someone had this little wand thing. There was going to be a screening of one of two movies. Evelyn was worried that she would get scared."
"1170"	"(2007-04-09 (16)) Ezra was a bad guy, who was sometimes Ezra but sometimes not. I had to keep hiding Porky from him. I put her in this fridge and I had to take her out after a certain time. I went to the toilet. When I came out I went to put Porky in this room with beer. Ezra was there and he had big eyes and a firecracker had gone off. He said not to worry about hiding her."
"1171"	"(2007-04-09 (16)) I had an excursion and Dad was going to pick me up so I didn't have to go. But we were going to a shop and I figured I could hang out with Calvin and do whatever we wanted, so I went. Samantha was sitting near me on the bus which was on the top of a waterslide. This lady was driving and we went down the waterslide and back and down again. Then there were werewolves. This girl bit me because she liked me. Everyone disappeared. I said that maybe we can only see other werewolves. I was walking around a bus. I was then at a school and something happened and I did a reality check, which worked and it felt weird to breathe with my nose closed. I tried to keep my excitement down and I walked out of the room asking for my dream guide. I found some Indian guy and I asked if he was my dream guide and he said yes and walked into this classroom. I asked what his name was and he said ""Pazpah"". He wrote his first name and his last name on the board. His last name began with an 'M', but it was hard to pronounce, so I said ""I'll just call you Pazpah"". I said that I had read that it takes ages for most people to find their dream guide and that I've only been trying for a few days and this was kind of my first lucid dream. He asked if I ""trusted in it"" as much as the guy who wrote it [an article I read] . I said ""I don't think so"". He said that that was true. I said ""Well, it's a bit of a gay concept, isn't it?"". I lost lucidity for a minute. I was some girl in a different galaxy and I asked him take me home. When I was home, I was watching a weird movie and I did another reality check. Pazpah came and I was like ""So... I can ask you anything about me?"" and he said that I could. I asked if he could predict the future, for example, if how much I liked animals or people could determine what job I should take. He said that he could. I kept drifting into the dream but kept doing reality checks. One of the dreams I went to I was saying that I'd rather be a boy and I was someone else. Someone cut my hair and made it more boyish. I also kept asking about his life which I dreamt him answering, but I don't remember what he said. I couldn't think of what to ask him and I was thinking about a question about Eugene. I asked if he liked me and Pazpah said ""More than you know"" and I was thinking 'I highly doubt it'. I was going to ask something about Calvin, but I woke up."
"1172"	"(2007-04-10 (16)) Dad sold his work to me and Valerie. It had three floors. We lived on the third one and the bottle shop was on the second one. We had moved it to the first floor, but then back to the second. Farrah had her own room (hotel like) and was excited that she was living on her own. I was going out with James Spader, but he was 19 or something. One night we ran across this oval. I had some mark of a bottle shop. There was a group of girls and they saw it and were like ""Ooh! What shop do you come from?"". I said ""Northtown Tavern"" and they were excited. Then they followed us around. We were at this shop, which had a bottle shop in it called the Hoodoo Guru's and there was a song playing. I was playing this game somewhere, where you get three minutes and you have to run around a [pitch black] randomly generated maze and avoid getting caught by the 'tagger'. James and I went in and held hands so we didn't get separated. We won. Later, it was my birthday and James and his friend sent a card. James gave me $49 and his friend gave me $50. James was kind of poor. Anyway, I went to his work. Dad came there and he asked us what we did (as a couple). We were silent and he deciphered this as everything, but asked how many others do it and I said everyone does it. We played that game again. We got separated but both reached the end. The tagger, who was female, met us there. We were given characters at the start and we had to place this electronic thing on our characters symbol and we would be teleported away. One of us was a rat. James got out but she pulled mine out so I couldn't get away. I tried to play again but lost. I said ""But I won before, you have to let me out"". I got out later. Then two others and I were in a car and we looked upset [I was observing] . We got out and went to this grave on the side of the road. James was 'dead'. I was crying. He was there as a ghost and it was actually from his point of view -- he was seeing what would happen if he did die. He was saying stuff to me like ""Don't cry"" etc. I was thinking about killing myself."
"1173"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) I was at McDonald's. I was working and someone ordered 15 frozen Fanta's. I made two but then ran out of cups. I went to get some but I turned the corner and it was sparkling clean. I started talking to Co-Worker-F-01 and I forgot about the order. I then finished my shift and the people who ordered reminded me. I was then sitting at a table with some people from Queer as Folk (US). Hal Sparks and I were good friends. I wasn't really friendly with the rest of the cast. I was talking to Thea Gill and Michelle Clunie and I couldn't remember their real names, so was calling them by their characters names. Michelle kept saying that her character's name was Michelle."
"1174"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) I was somewhere. Some people came in and kidnapped us. They put us in these meditation beds and they were in rows, like lockers. Calvin was there. They said that every hour, they were going to kill two or three of us. They killed one row. I did something that gave me the impression that they liked me. Something happened and we got out. There were lots of cockroaches. We were following them to safety. Mom had also earlier predicted a storm coming. A storm was coming. The cockroaches were all running to cages."
"1175"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) Calvin text or called me and told me to get dressed because he was in Midvale. I was like ""What the hell?"". He came over and said that it was going to snow somewhere."
"1176"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) I was at a shop. There was this game where you run around this thing and win prizes. I ran six times but the guy wouldn't give me a prize. I took a balloon and this lady friend of ours took another one. We were running and mine was too hard to hold, so I let go. Then I was at this shop with Mom. It was called 'This Girl's Life'. Mom decided that we had to go in. They sold dresses and bags. I was running to get out. I saw these ads on the walls and they were of me and Tigger and I was little and modeling dresses. I was disgusted. I couldn't get out of the shop, but I finally did. I had these oranges. I went to the next shop and pretended that they were from there because they were cheaper to buy, but they looked totally different."
"1177"	"(2007-04-12 (16)) A spaceship landed outside Mom's. Ezra and I went in it. We accidentally started it up and we thought we'd just go along for the ride. Everything was automatic and it set the pressure and stuff for humans. We ended up at this little planet with people who looked like us. They spoke English but although they could make a spiffy ship, they couldn't read or write. They hadn't even heard of reading or writing and they were somewhat primitive -- they had no TV's or any of that kind of stuff. I told them that I would teach them how to write and stuff, for historical purposes. They wanted me to bring stuff from Earth for them to look at. There was this guy there who I liked. We had made a big list of stuff that they wanted. I was in this room and there were lots of people in there and this girl was going to have sex. I was like ""Don't you guys want to leave the room?"" and she was like ""Why?"". It skipped forward and the guy I liked came to Earth. He was driving a car and Darren tried to stop him. He, Darren and Mom got into a fight. Then he told them who he was and said he wanted permission to date me. Mom said no, but later I told her we'd been going out for a year."
"1178"	"(2007-04-12 (16)) I was at 'school' and I had an assembly. We were in this room which had steps with seats on them. I was sitting next to Silas at the very back edge. Colin Farrell was a special guest and I was like 'What the hell?!'. He asked for a volunteer and everyone stood up except for me. They sat down again and he picked me and I shook my head and said ""No!"". He then said ""Ok, Jenny Craig"" and Julianna went down. Colin asked me if I wanted to do the next one, which was going to be good. Then I was down the front and Calvin was next to me. Sounds Like a Melody came on and I said ""I love this song!"". The siren went before me and I was like ""Yay!"". He was giving autographs and I decided to get one. I said my name was Izzy and he was like ""Freya?"" and I said ""No, Izzy"". He wanted to put a picture of Santa on there. He also didn't have an accent and looked different."
"1179"	"(2007-04-12 (16)) I was at 'home'. This girl was there and she was being a cow. These people I was with were shouting back. She said something and I said ""That was mean"". This teacher told us off, especially me. I said that I didn't say anything. She said that my voice was the only one she could hear. I was like ""What the hell?!"". She said that I'd have to face that girl first period tomorrow. I thought that I had English first but she said ""Social studies""."
"1180"	"(2007-04-13 (16)) Mom kept buying new houses. One of them was just a square block. I was in the lounge. Samantha, some other girl and I always sat in certain chairs. On the back of the chairs there were 'shop' shelves. This footy game finished and all these people came in. Darius and Eugene were there. Mom found a house worth $70000."
"1181"	"(2007-04-13 (16)) I was at home and I went in the pool for a swim. I was in the shallow end and I got pulled to the deep end. I managed to get out and I went inside. It was different and I did a reality check and I worked. I saw someone so I wished for it to be Eugene. He stopped walking and turned around. I wanted him to kiss me and he put his hand on my face and we kissed."
"1182"	"(2007-04-14 (16)) I was at 'Mom's'. I couldn't sleep and it was 5:30am. I had school that day. The lights were on and I couldn't turn the hallway light off. There were lots of iPods."
"1183"	"(2007-04-14 (16)) I was at home. I did a reality check, which worked. I went to my room and tried to make it a different place, but it didn't change, so I went back down the hallway and wished for James Spader. I went back and he was there and my bed was coming from the window and we started kissing. I lost lucidity, and we ended up having sex. Later, I was talking to Vivian about lucid dreaming. There was a newspaper and I said now the writing will change. I turned around and it changed."
"1184"	"(2007-04-14 (16)) I had a few other lucid dreams but I kept feeling tired and falling out of them."
"1185"	"(2007-04-15 (16)) We had to hide out. Nana had this cottage thing in the woods. Ezra, Dad and Clayton came. It took ages to load up the car. We had to get in through this chimney to get in the house. There were cool science fiction movies. There was one with Tom Sizemore. Then I was at home out the front. I got the mail and there was something about Borat in there. Something said that Johnny Depp was ""my only"" and I was confused about it."
"1186"	"(2007-04-16 (16)) I was walking home from school, but I realized I forgot my keys so I followed someone to a house that Ezra was at. His leg was broken. I was then at school. I was late for class. I had a white book."
"1187"	"(2007-04-17 (16)) I was at Mom's. I went into her room and there was a black guy on her bed. I was talking to Mom and then said ""Who the hell is this?"". She said ""a friend"". I turned around while I was still talking and when I turned back around Mom and the guy were kissing or something. I went back to my room but I came out later and discovered that Mom's bedroom was on fire. Mom wasn't in there and I got Ezra and I said that she wouldn't have run out because she would've got us. We got the fire out and then ran downstairs. The black guy's car was in the middle of the road. We ran out and Ezra was asking him where Mom was. I checked the back seat and then the boot. There was a big chest in the boot and Mom was asleep in one. I gasped and then pulled her out. The black guy drove off. We put Mom in her car and drove off to go somewhere. I then went back in time and was thinking 'what the hell?'. I went out of my room and Mom wasn't in her room, but then she came upstairs looking funny. The black guy came into her room. I punched him and then realized that he had Superman-type strength and had green 'pus' coming out. I realized that my laptop was missing and I said ""You can take her but give my laptop back, it isn't worth much. I'll give you $500 for it"". He stared at me for ages and then gave it back."
"1188"	"(2007-04-17 (16)) I was at a video shop. There were kittens there. Someone had lost theirs. I was helping them gather them up, but there were so many of them. One lady wouldn't tell me the colour hers was. Then I was at 'school'. One of our teachers was Snape (Harry Potter movies). We were all sitting on the ground somewhere. I think we were choosing stuff."
"1189"	"(2007-04-17 (16)) I bought some Easter eggs. There were chocolate bunnies too. I remembered that I was on a diet, but didn't care. Mom and Ezra were there too and we went to a video shop."
"1190"	"(2007-04-19 (16)) We were on an excursion. Calvin and I were wandering around somewhere. He found this gown on the ground and put it on. This guy came and said it was his and I'm not sure what happened, but he started trying to rape me. Calvin hit him with something and we ran off. We started calling him 'Gay Boy'. Later, he was giving a talk to some people from school. He saw us and kept staring at us while he talked. Then we were somewhere else and it was 1:50pm. We needed to get back by 2pm. We thought the bus left without us. I saw people from Whitehall and we were throwing stuff at them. Later, there was this weird game and we could turn into things. I was a frog in a jar and Calvin was a chicken. We had to try and get out of the jar. I also turned into a llama. Later, I was having a bath somewhere and I finished and when I dressed, Darren came in and told me to pull the plug out. He looked in and said ""Try and get a redhead next time"" and left. I said ""Why are people so obsessed with redheads?"". The water looked funny as it drained. I picked up a CD I had in the bathroom and there was a dead lady in the bath. I couldn't scream or move, but eventually managed to run out. Darren went in but there was no lady. Later, Farrah was on a lounge and I thought I saw the lady in the hallway. Farrah was a clone of Farrah and was called something else. The lady came back but she had short blonde hair. Mom was there. I couldn't hurt the lady because she was a ghost. I was trying to 'believe' and then I could hit her. She disappeared. I went to the mailbox with Ezra and there was lots of mail. This poodle went up to Ezra. There was a grave next to the mailbox and I was scared that a hand would come up. We saw this court trial on TV and 'Gay Boy' was on there. Then we were there, and Calvin was staring at him because he loved him or something. We thought that Gay Boy was cool."

"1192"	"(2007-04-19 (16)) This girl, a guy and I were talking. She was asking our grades and I was Year 11 and he was Year 7. But he had skipped a grade so he was the equivalent of a Year 8 or something."
"1193"	"(2007-04-19 (16)) I don't remember properly, but Lex (Smallville) either locked me in a room or we both got locked in a room. Someone had powers. We were near a jetty thing."
"1194"	"(2007-04-20 (16)) I was walking down a hallway and all these ghosts were floating around and going through me. I was then Simon Pegg and I was observing. He was the best ghost killer of something. I was in this room and looking out. Someone started shooting the ghosts so now they could see Simon. He had to run through the hall. For some reason, I went with him. We got into this big, flash, red car and weird Indian music was playing. He said he preferred ""doing it risky"" and started driving on the sidewalks and then shot at a bunch of cops. We ended up on the top of this giant glacier rock thing. The car was jumping onto other ones. He somehow managed to get us on the ground. We ran into this little hut. A cop grabbed me, but Simon got me back and took the cop with us. We went into another hut and hid behind this curtain. This other cop came, but didn't find us. We went out the back and Simon made some noise and then ran. We were climbing this gate and I said that I wished I was strong enough and I was thinking that all this should count toward my exercise (for my diet). I ended up in this section. He found something and I said that it was Danish and then saw this pipe and I realized that the cops were there. We hid for a while but then he yelled out to them and they put pumpkins on our heads. I had '2' on mine. Somehow I knew they were going to squirt us with orange juice."
"1195"	"(2007-04-20 (16)) I was half awake. Ezra was saying that Melanie was coming over because he invited her, but he was saying ""Why did I do that?""."
"1196"	"(2007-04-21 (16)) We found out something was happening in England. We had this map but it was really old and New Zealand was right next to the UK. We were going to leave that night. We went to this shop for a bit and my McDonald's was there. Someone said something about Co-Worker-M-07 and I left because I still hadn't told them I'd quit. We bought gloves from somewhere and we were going to buy more 'cold weather' stuff in England. Dad had to go to some place when he was going to travel. It was called Amsterdam something."
"1197"	"(2007-04-22 (16)) I went to school and I was in my old English classroom. Ms Eckert was teaching us and Evelyn was there. I realized that it was impossible to have English, as it was Monday, so I said ""Screw this, this is a dream"" and proved it by doing a reality check. I was going to kiss Eugene as I was leaving, but I didn't. I then lost lucidity and Mom picked me and Ezra up. I went to the toilet and there were no toilet rolls. I had to get lunch for school, but we forgot. Mom went to this phone place. Santiago was there. I decided not to go back to school because it was 2pm. I said ""I had bio last"" but I was going to do it when I got home."
"1198"	"(2007-04-22 (16)) I was at a shop. There were baby rabbits and I tried to take one because it was an evil place, but the shop just kept continuing when I tried to leave. Then, I was older and I had a friend who was Lana (Smallville) and two male friends called Ashley and David. Lana and I were seeing both, but I think I liked Ashley more. We all had separate tasks to accomplish. I don't remember mine, but Ashley had to fight a series of monsters. David had to escape two guys and one was really fast and was a big monster dude. I was watching Ashley when Lana said they needed to take me. I had to be injected with Ashley's sperm and have a baby. I refused, but they kept asking. I asked if it was virtual and she said yes, so I did it. It felt like something was in there, but something went wrong and the baby melted. Lana had already had one and they kept it. I decided I wanted one too, but I was all weird from the last one. David passed his task and we walked out of the shop together. These kangaroo people were having sex."
"1199"	"(2007-04-22 (16)) I was at school. Calvin was enemies with this fat girl. She had water coming out of her shoes and I my leg felt wet, so I figured she sprayed me, but she'd actually hit me with her belt. My leg was cut and bruised and people thought that I needed to be operated on."
"1200"	"(2007-04-23 (16)) I was at school. Calvin and I played this game of sliding around a corner, but we kept getting in trouble. I was then at a shop and Ezra was there. Jeremiah walked past. Seamus and Silas were on an escalator. I was then back at school. I was at our bench. Ms Bigwood asked me if I ever liked anyone at school and I was thinking 'Yeah, Eugene, but I aint telling you!'. I said yeah and then she told us a story. There were big public toilets and people wouldn't leave?"
"1201"	"(2007-04-24 (16)) I was at 'Mom's'. There was a bull ant running around the house. I needed one for school and so instead of killing it, everyone was trying to catch it. They were really dangerous. Some boy wet his pants and the floor was really wet. I had told Mr Quinlan that Ezra said he'd seen him with Mom and he said it wasn't true. I said that I didn't think it was. I was in Mom's room and I saw the ant. She caught it with her fingers and I had to get a Milo tin with this spiffy lid. Someone pricked my finger and it hurt."
"1202"	"(2007-04-25 (16)) Eugene was sitting next to me. He was talking to someone and laughing. I think I was involved in the conversation too and I was looking at his hair and I wanted to touch it. I went to this lady's house with Mom and Ezra. She was rich and had this nice house. She gave us food. I was trying to work out what food I could eat because of my diet. We were hiding from someone.

"1206"	"(2007-04-27 (16)) Clark and Raya (both from Smallville) were somewhere with me. I ended up with powers at one stage. Raya said we had to do something to this box. We didn't get near it though and it exploded. We moved away from it and it exploded again. It responded to movement, so we made everything in the shop that moved, move. I was then in a container as I had been captured for something. Raya hosted some dating show and matched me and Clark. Later, Dad was on the show. Raya said that the next match wasn't ""spiritual"", but purely from watching me because I was funny. The match was a black woman and Dad and I were laughing."

There was a big shop/Timezone thing. We could play and take anything we wanted. There was a game where you throw spaghetti at the wall. Mom came and I managed to grab some chocolates. Autumn was asking us to tell her who liked her."
"1209"	"(2007-04-28 (16)) I was at some house and we had lived there forever. Ezra had a second room and it had two of my bookshelves in there. I found a heap of dreams I had written from 2001 and 2002 and some from 1996."

Then I woke up and in real life I had trouble breathing."

I thought they were talking about Dmitri, but then Mom said ""top of the class"" and I realized it was Eugene. She went to school and told them to put me into tennis. I was like ""What?! You can't put me in tennis, I'm doing six IB subjects!"". I had a plant and it moved. I was going to call it Harris, after Ryan Cartwright in Seriously Weird. Ezra and Clayton had some stinky thing. I couldn't smell it, but it hurt me and made my mouth taste yuck."
"1216"	"(2007-05-02 (16)) I was at Oliver Queen's (Smallville) house. I was looking out the window and he was fighting some people.

She said something that made me doubt it, so I asked what the last name was. She didn't remember but asked how many people would be called Darius. I asked if the last name was Ivanovich and she said it sounded right. She said that we had met before. I was thinking that I needed to text Calvin and that Evelyn would be happy about this. I was also thinking that I was glad it wasn't Eugene that I was related to. He was in a movie playing at this weird theatre. This guy gave people remotes and the guy next to me kept talking to me. I left. I was then somewhere with Nana. She had this video of Darius and a weird town which was mushed in a bowl.

Ms Solomon asked ""Who gave you that?"" and we said ""No-one"". I was in class and I realized that it was Sunday. I was then confused why I was at school. The class had a different seating plan and I found an empty spot at the back, so I sat there. I saw a note on the desk two seats away, saying Swamp Boy. Eugene got up and sat there. He was asking about Swamp Boy. I realized that Calvin wrote it. There was a spelling mistake and it said ""Swampa Boy"". I saw Ezra. There was a list about Eugene that someone had written and it said ""caring, sensitive, aggressive, energetic, quiet""."

"1263"	"(2007-05-21 (16)) I was at school. I was talking to Madelyn about me having a test. Autumn came past and I asked her ""what test?"". She said we had a Physics test. Her two front teeth were missing and I was like 'what the hell?'. Later, I was at the bench with Calvin and Evelyn. Then I was in a classroom. Eugene and Darius were playing this game. First they put pillows everywhere. Eugene came close to me so I put my foot near his to see what shoe size he was. I was trying to hide my sock from him. I wanted to text Mom to pick me up but I didn't have any credit."
"1264"	"(2007-05-21 (16)) I was at this house and there was a murderer guy. When the lights went out someone died. I was in this room with all these movies. I saw To Kill a Mockingbird. Then it disappeared. Joseph Cotten was in a wheelchair. It turned out that the killer had 'killed' him and then taken over his body. George (Grey's Anatomy) put this water helmet on Izzie (Grey's Anatomy). Alex (Grey's Anatomy) already had one on. Then they put blue liquid on them. They were slowly edging away from the killer. Some people and I hid in a room. The power went out and I looked out the window and realized it was actually a movie. I was then out there walking with some people. I found a card and it turned into a phone. It was Ms Bigwood's phone and some person was yelling that I was stealing phones. Then Ms Corbett was there and I sad ""now this'll be Ms Corbett's phone"" and it was. She came and I was saying that I was picking them up to give to the owner."
"1265"	"(2007-05-22 (16)) I was at school. Evelyn was next to me and Jeremiah and Alejandro were sitting in front of me. They were discussing Pokemon Diamond and Pearl and they had it. I asked how they got it and Jeremiah said ""off the net"". I said ""We ordered it off the net too, but they still haven't arrived. I want it now! Pokemon rocks!"" etc. Jeremiah was like ""calm down!"". He went over to the other side of the class for a while. I was looking down at the floor and someone sat down. I saw Eugene's shoe. I looked up and Evelyn was talking to him."
"1266"	"(2007-05-23 (16)) I was at school. Spaceman and Tigger were in my bag. Ezra had put them in there. I didn't want to take Tigger home because of Dad."
"1267"	"(2007-05-23 (16)) I was at school and I was at the bench alone. Someone was speaking over near C2. I fell off my chair and Mr Norris helped me up."

"1271"	"(2007-05-23 (16)) I was walking out to the car from school. Eugene and Darius were next to me at the road. Eugene's car was a couple cars from Mom's. I got in our car and then all the cars moved out of the way, drove up and missed the turn. I was thinking 'Yay! I can be behind Eugene!'."
"1272"	"(2007-05-23 (16)) There was something about Gregory Peck, but I don't remember anything else."
"1273"	"(2007-05-24 (16)) I was in Chemistry. Alyssa came in with a note from a host. Mr Reilly was there. I was thinking 'Yay! The games have come!'. I went to the office to sign out. Mom said she signed Ezra out. She said that the wrong games had come and instead we got 'Solission' and Super Mario 2. I said ""We have to buy them again!""."
"1274"	"(2007-05-24 (16)) We had an excursion. Calvin and Evelyn were with me. Eugene and Darius were behind us. There was white chocolate and a big line up a big escalator. I went into the line Eugene was in. We had to slide down a slide to get down. I was then somewhere else and I said something about Darius to Evelyn. She said ""Don't talk about that, not today"" and I asked what was so special about today and she said it was her birthday. I was like ""Oh my God! I can't believe I forgot your birthday!"". Then I thought that it was August 24th and I said ""You're birthday was last week. She went quiet and then I realized it was May 24th and told her. She was like 'huh?'."

"1277"	"(2007-05-25 (16)) Somehow, I got a hold of Eugene's calculator or iPod, it kept changing. I took his valence table because it was better. His music was stuff I'd never heard of and I was thinking that I loved him even more. I told Jeremiah about the valence table, and then he wanted it. He was in a basketball club which changed to a soccer club called Sleepwalkers. Calvin was there. Some people did this dance thing. Gregg and someone married. Classmate-M-28 had his arm around Mackenzie. I was thinking 'ew' but that I wouldn't mind if it was Eugene and I. Calvin went in front of this camera filming the match. He asked Eugene why his shirts were green. He said that green was a good colour. Alejandro said ""they're not full of colour, but they have lots of character"", but colour and character were supposed to be the other way around. Evelyn wanted to do a quiz thing I'd gotten. I was saying it was random. This bus drove into a book shop and I saw Goosebumps books and got excited. There was a big house and I was flying around and I fell. At some point, Ms Solomon gave me work back and I got a level 3."
"1278"	"(2007-05-26 (16)) I was at school. Calvin and I had to stay back along with Samantha and someone else to dig and bury graves. Samantha got hers done, but Calvin and I got our grave dug and then ran out of time. Dad picked me up at 7pm. The next day, we got in trouble for burying them where we did. I was told to write an essay. I was in some house. Nana and Poppa were being mean. I was at Mom's. Mom and Darren were moving the table. There was a movie shelf and Dog Soldiers was in there. I said ""So many movies I want to watch"". You had to pay for them. Amelie was in there and a movie called Hare. Ezra and this kid with corn were there. There was something with Christina Aguilera."
"1279"	"(2007-05-26 (16)) I was at a shop and we asked about Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. They said that there was a delay because there was a problem with the compatibility."
"1280"	"(2007-05-27 (16)) I was at school. Jeremiah and Bradley were talking about Pokemon Diamond and Pearl and how it was taking forever. I asked if they preordered it and they said no. I said that I did and it was taking forever."
"1281"	"(2007-05-27 (16)) I went to Mom's. It started raining and I ran to the door. There was a package and it was Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. The door wasn't fully closed and I pushed it open. I was like ""Uh... ma?"" She looked and there was a guy at the top of the stairs. We ran behind Mom's car and I was hugging my game. The guy took Mom's car and I was thinking 'Damn it, my CD!'. Then another guy came and we jumped in another car and locked the doors and were winding the windows up. I put the games in the back seat. Mom drove and he started chasing us. She lost control and we hit a woman and crashed through a fence. We were then at a hospital and Ezra had a bloody face. Dad had dropped him off at Mom's and he had gone to his room and the guy punched him in the face. I was at Mom's again and I remembered about my laptop. I said ""Oh my God, my laptop!"". I asked Ezra if they took our laptops and he said ""I don't have a laptop"" (meaning they'd been taken). I ran to my room and saw an empty desk. I started crying and fell to the floor. They took my external hard drive too. There was a phone had the peoples' number in it. I called him and was speaking in a Spanish accent. We both were talking silly and then I was threatening to kill him, but I didn't say it seriously. I went downstairs and Tiana, Gilbert and Classmate-F-19 were in a car. They talked to me and asked me about my laptop. [I woke up crying] ."
"1282"	"(2007-05-27 (16)) I was on MSN and Calvin's account was cal6@hotmail.com. His password was amsedro or something. Ezra was trying to look."
"1283"	"(2007-05-28 (16)) I was on an excursion. We missed the bus and had to drive there and were late. It was some wine testing thing. I was wondering why we were doing wine testing. We had to pick a name but the instructions didn't make sense so I picked a really long one. Someone said something about a ""sky of Milo"". There was a book which was full of Heroes pictures and there were lots of Milo Ventimiglia. Calvin was next to me and Samantha was sitting on my other side. We had a quiz later to remember the names that everyone picked. Calvin's name was Nubu. I tasted this wine whose name was the name I'd picked and it was really hot. It burnt my skin too and everyone was throwing up from it. There were no booklets left, to mark off each wine which also described each one, so I had to tell this woman. She was all fancy like and looked like the Petrelli mother (Heroes). She was a cow. She didn't come until it was over. We had to stay until 1.30am to buy wine. Evelyn said ""I can stay till four"". We were sitting near the bags and I went to sit down near Eugene's bag, thinking about taking stuff, but then he came and took it. Calvin was sitting with Genevieve."
"1284"	"(2007-05-28 (16)) I was at school and Ms Bigwood gave me this report thing. My best subject was accounting and my worst subject was 'battery' because I was only there for one lesson. Then, I was at a cinema and Dad was there. He was listening to old music on a Foxtel-like screen."

"1291"	"(2007-05-30 (16)) I was chasing someone. I saw Jeremiah, who I didn't recognize, and asked him if he'd seen anyone. He said no, but kept looking around. I saw the person and continued to run after them. I caught up with them behind this building and they gave my DS to Eugene, who I also didn't recognize. He said he had nothing until he got this DS. He gave it back to me and I put it in my pocket."
"1292"	"(2007-05-30 (16)) I was on this raft thing and it was put together well and had seats on one side. Jeremiah, Eugene, Autumn and I were on it. There was an explosion and then there was a big banner thing saying ""Happy Mynew Year!"". Then there were other people on the raft and someone decided to take a photo. We were sitting around. Eugene and I were at the back next to each other, kneeling. He put his hand on mine and squeezed it. We then both moved. The raft was sinking and we had to hang on to the 'tail'."
"1293"	"(2007-05-31 (16)) Dad went on a date with some creepy woman. I was at Nana's and they'd found an apartment on top of the one where the creepy lady lived so Dad didn't want it. Dad drove me to the place. He had said that Poppa was going to."
"1294"	"(2007-06-01 (16)) I was reading a book, but was seeing it. It was set in an office place and there was a killer. This guy was in the elevator and the door started opening. He pressed the close button but then the top was opening and then the side and he kept pressing all the close buttons. He got out and went to go outside. He heard a voice. A cop person told him not to go any further but he did and he got killed by some invisible thing. Earlier, the same thing had happened to a lady. It reminded me of Se7en and it also had '7' written on the bottom. I started writing a book. It started off about some woman snuggling in bed with her husband. Whatever I wrote was really well written though. I was thinking of calling the husband Eugene and basing it on Eugene. Mom and Darren were at the table (at Mom's house). It was in a different area and a house around the corner was on fire. I was watching something of these actors and stuff. There was a clip of Mika and ""how nice he is"". There were these goat/zebra things. He tried to hug it. Then he tried to hug these actors, but they didn't want him to hug them. Hugh Laurie was singing and he had piercings and I was like ""Yuck!""."
"1295"	"(2007-06-01 (16)) Calvin was in this big room full of quizzes and stuff I'd done. He was trying to find out who I liked (obviously, Eugene). I found this thing which had pictures of Johnny Depp, Devon Sawa, and Seann William Scott. I said it wasn't mine. Madelyn and Tucker were there. There was something about Sims 2 Seasons for the DS and it was weird."
"1296"	"(2007-06-03 (16)) I was at 'school'. Some others and I got caught by this evil Jack Nicholson dude. He made us lie down on our stomachs and he was going to infect us with some alien. When he wasn't looking, I ran. He started to chase after me, but this machine started up so he stayed with the other four. As I was running, I passed Ezra and some of his friends. I was running through the school and so many people were getting infected. There was a shop nearby and there were infected people there. The infected people were zombie-like but were Invasion of the Body Snatchers like and slowish at first. Then they were like the zombies in Dawn of the Dead original. Ezra and Clayton got infected. I ended up teaming up with some guy. Nana was at the shop and there was a photo of Dad on the wall. I was stabbing it because he was infected. I had tried stabbing a zombie but it didn't work. I told Nana not to talk to anyone and I left. I came back a while later and she was infected. This guy and I were at this shoe shop. We were hitting zombies with shoes and they were down with one hit. I was telling the guy to get shoes. We made a hide-out, in this little kitchen area with a curtain. I found his mother and she was infected. I told him and he was trying to talk to her. I saw Elijah and threw a shoe at his head and nothing happened. I said ""oh, you need two hits!"" and I threw another one and then realized he wasn't infected. Then, I was level 60 and I found this noob level 24 girl. She got some equipment from Red Rooster. We were going to this library to kill zombies. In the car park of this other shop there was a police car. Two policemen were in there, not infected and they were Scottish."
"1297"	"(2007-06-04 (16)) I went to some takeaway place. Mom ordered this thing with spinach and cheese. They gave her something else. I threw it inside and then went to talk to them and we were throwing it around. I left. This guy came after me. I ran into a shop and Nana was there. I called Mom. The guy was at the window. I managed to get to the car and Nana couldn't drive, so I got in the drivers seat and this evil woman was going to the passenger side so I took off. I almost crashed. I went home and there was no wood shed. Dad was there."

"1301"	"(2007-06-08 (16)) I was playing this game where you get puppies. You had to click and drag to feed it and give it water. Drew Barrymore was around? Some people were talking about ""Chris Baby"" who was actually Chris Martin or whoever. I was on a bus and I was playing the game on DS. Jeremiah was sitting behind me and Eugene was sitting near me. Calvin was in front of me. I had brought an animal of some sort onto the bus, as did Ezra. I was doing stuff on the game. Eugene and Darius were on a balcony pretending to spit. Eugene was talking to some girl and Darius said ""stop talking to your girlfriend""."

"1304"	"(2007-06-09 (16)) I had my Biology exam. I was like ""What the hell?"". I hadn't studied. Mathea didn't know about it either. We both went over our notes. Ms Solomon came in and we suggested that we do it tomorrow. Ezra and Nicolas walked past. Mom picked Ezra, Mathea and I up. We went through this tunnel and the lights went out. There was a burglar and Mathea disappeared. We stopped somewhere and Clayton was with us. Mom drove off without me and I was left at this creepy motel. Mom came back and it was 2.44pm."
"1305"	"(2007-06-10 (16)) I went to the sun. I got trapped there with some guy, who was sometimes George (Grey's Anatomy). Then it wasn't me and it had been a while and they'd had a kid. If you didn't press hard against the ground you floated. There were zombies around. They (the lady, George and the kid) needed to leave so they hid in the bathroom. Then it was me. The guy got bit, so he quickly went over his plan and his eyes were going white and then I shot him in the head. The kid and I hurried to this slide. We got in this scooter thing and went down. Then I ended up in a big city and people were making a movie with zombies. Then I was at home with Dad and Ezra. I looked out the back and saw Tinkerbell and I was like ""What the hell?"". Spaceman was somewhere and he looked dead, but then he moved and he was ok."
"1306"	"(2007-06-10 (16)) I was sitting in the back of the car. Ezra was in the front and Dad was driving us home. There was this thing blocking the way. Dad drove into it but it was stretchy, so when we went forward Dad and Ezra were like ""oops"" and it flung back. I looked behind and saw a tree. I was picturing a branch going right through me, so I was thinking ""I'm dead"". Then it was minutes later. Timothy Stack had gotten in the way so he had been pushed into the tree as well as me, but we were ok."
"1307"	"(2007-06-11 (16)) Calvin, Ezra and Dad were in Dad's bed. Dad was up and it was like 4am. He hadn't put the washing out. My jumper and pants from Mom's had left this blue powder and dead mice on the floor."

I was on a site and it showed my password which was 'johnnyd' (I figured it was meant to be Johnny Depp), then it was 'johnnyb' and then 'jonasb' (Jonas Biggs). I was confused about it. I was in a line to get water at this cinema place. There were a couple people in the front and then suddenly I was miles away, so I gave up. Aunt Sally was in the line. Then I realized that I had a water bottle anyway."

I was telling him off because you don't know what's around the corner; there could be people in the middle of the road. I was then at school. Calvin and Samantha had made a list of 'quotes'. They were random ones like 'school made' which was for Evelyn and Darius and 'Izzy's boyfriend' for Eugene. Samantha was pregnant."

One night the girl went out to a forest and started taking her clothes off because she was going to turn into a werewolf. At the house, some people were at the door and we were trying to decide whether to open it, then they started chipping at the window. We opened the door and there were two girls. Some guy wanted to talk to me and he told me that I had to be the ""bad guy"". They said they were going to take Eugene. I could run like Clark Kent, so I went to 'run' to him, which would actually teleport me to where he was, but it didn't work because of something they had done."

We were running down this road and the cops were behind us and this dog appeared in front of us, so we ran down the side street. Later, we were all at this cafe. We ran off and stole this car because we had to leave the cafe. There was a 4wd type of car and we had to hotwire it, which Jason could do. We got to the car as the cops pulled up. We kept our heads down and got in. This had happened before, but Joy had looked up and this guy had seen her and described her. So I told everyone to keep their heads down, especially Joy. All of a sudden, the cops were after us. Joy had looked at a guy because he had brown hair. The car we were in had a tracking thing, so when we were lots of traffic, we got out and ended up at this place with all these Soylent Green-y things. We were hiding under them. Jason got shot. There were other people there and I was letting them carry me along. I got carried to this place with squishy balls and I dyed my hair black. Poppa was there and he didn't recognize me. There were stripper girls near so I pretended to be with them. Somehow, we all got out, but by this time Hiro was dead and Joy was now Cate Blanchett, but looked like Claire Danes. There was a foggy road in the forest. Randy was going to kill us. I was like ""You're going to kill your own brother?"". He said it was his fault. I said it was all our faults. He ended up not killing anyone. The cars were going like 120km/h. We were dodging the traffic. Later, we realized this black guy who had once been with us, was going to kill us. So we left to go the airport. We were driving down this road and this bridge thing which was over the road, got wider as we got closer. In the airplane, I was holding Jason's hand."

Then Ezra and I were in the back and the car 'flipped' so that we were joined to their car by the front of the car. Rodney came into the car and was talking to Ezra. Then Eugene came and looked into the car from the front. He saw me and went a bit weird. He and Ezra were talking and I managed to join in the conversation and he was no longer uncomfortable. After school we were all walking home together. I did this flip and Eugene was like ""What the hell?!"" Mom told me to meet Janice off Nanovich Ave. Their mother was called Janice and their father was called Lionel. Eugene's house was number 74. The number was on the window. They were a couple of houses away from a video shop. There was a gambling place too and this black guy was guarding it. Ezra wanted to play."

"1332"	"(2007-06-20 (16)) I was doing homework for people. I watched Happy Feet and did an essay on it for someone. Ezra was talking to me."
"1333"	"(2007-06-21 (16)) Johnny Depp died. There was some clip of him with Paul Whitehouse. People thought that I was going kill them because I had some number. They realized that it was my number."
"1334"	"(2007-06-21 (16)) Mom was driving me from school and she drove down an alley. She had trouble getting through this gate. Then we were at this place and I realized that we were on Casserley Ave. so I had a quick look around the corner for Eugene's house, but there was this big empty tank thing with bugs in it. There was pretty water around it though."
"1335"	"(2007-06-22 (16)) We were doing a Battle Royale 'game'. Samantha, someone else and I were hiding out on some rocks. We ended up hiding at home and the wood door wasn't closed. I saw people on the street and I was worried that they saw me and I managed to get the door closed. Mr Willingham was trying to kill me for some reason. I jumped over the back fence. Later, there were three people left and Eugene had already died. I ended up winning, I think."
"1336"	"(2007-06-22 (16)) Mom said that she was going out with this computer developer guy and Ezra thought it was this guy called Apex. She was showing Dad what street he lived on. He lived on the same street as Apex but she said something that made it sound like it was someone else. I went to some other high school for a day. We had an excursion. Mr Reilly was there. We went to this place where Apex worked and he said something about him and ""Sasha have a fling at the moment"". There were all these collages of Johnny Depp. I decided I wanted to go home, so I got up and left. My tooth hurt. I called Mom and she was being gay and wouldn't pick me up. People were trying to make me come back. There was this 'grab bag' game thing. There were lots of hats and one looked like a Ted (The Fast Show) sort of hat. I got a heater and a TV out of the bag. There were Pokemon around. I remember Slugma and Farfetch'd, who I or someone else accidentally killed. I had some 'snowbar' thing."
"1337"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) I was watching some Ted and Ralph (The Fast Show) thing. I don't remember properly, but Ted had fallen in love with this guy who I think was a 'bad' guy. Ted was making out with the guy on a bed."
"1338"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) I was going through a DVD of The Fast Show. They had documentaries and Paul Whitehouse was dressed like the Brilliant Kid, which was his natural clothing. They were trying to use this 'skimmer' thing. Charlie Higson was there too. Bizarre Love Triangle was playing. I was looking through these pictures and Dad was in there and I was like ""Oh my God! Dad knew Paul Whitehouse!""."
"1339"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) There was a werewolf, and it was actually a person I didn't like. I didn't know it was them, but when they were normal, I saw their reflection in the mirror and they reflected as a werewolf."
"1340"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) Paul Whitehouse and I were friends and we swapped bodies. I had to go to the toilet at one stage and pulled down 'my' pants, but then didn't because I didn't want to touch his bits and didn't know what to do. I then complained to him about it. Then, Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson swapped bodies. I kept getting them confused. Paul (as Charlie) kept getting drunk. Charlie (as Paul) was annoyed that he was making him look stupid. We were on this bus thing and I lost my pen and was testing another one. I wrote 'Ted, Paul Whitehouse and Ralph'. I was then at home with some people and we were looking out the back door. Then we were in this forest and stuff from Deadbirds was happening, except I kept forgetting what happened. Ryan Merriman was there. There was this creature. These aliens were recruiting people. Some others came along."
"1341"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) Ezra and I were in a park. We were playing this game where we run back and forth with words. Mom was there."
"1342"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) I was watching Heroes. Micah was on a train. First he was a girl. Peter was there and Micah wouldn't jump until Peter did. The platform ended and Peter jumped. Micah was still on the train as it left. Sylar was around. Peter was crying and I was calming him."
"1343"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) Two others and I were hiding out in a deli thing, which was actually part of a school. Something was going to happen so we hid. These people came and they didn't see us because someone had died? We had a bucket for spit."
"1344"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) I was at Nana's and they had a Playstation 3 so I was having a look at it. There was some game that was like Age of Empires. Dad wanted to see the game. I started it and it was Battle Royale like. I realized and threw my bag off my bag looking for my weapon. It was a machine gun. Then it was real. I grabbed all my stuff and I was near a wood shed so I hid in there. This guy came along and hid there too. This other guy said this guy was coming to check out the shed so we all left. Shinji Mimura (Battle Royale) was there so I hung with him. This guy was around the corner with a gun and we managed to calm him and take his gun. Someone was threatening us and we shot them and the bullet was slow. Shinji ran to it and put in the other guys neck. Then these people were at this shop. This guy said ""I hope my wife isn't on that list"". People were discussing the best fashion of spring etc. Jason Lee was there. There was a basketball and he said that he could do lots of tricks."
"1345"	"(2007-06-26 (16)) I was at Mom's. I died, but I was hanging around. Sometimes I could interact with stuff and I was learning how to fly. I had to go to the balcony and jump off. I didn't like that bit though. There was a trampoline out the back, but it was wet. I had to get the hose and put it in a hook. The hooks were all marked with Spaced characters. Mark Heap was in the yard, and I put the hose between his hook and someone else's. Mom was seeing this black guy. I was scaring some blokes. It turned David Lynch like and I was observing and everything was different. Jack Nance was there and he had orange hair [like Colin Hunt in The Fast Show] . Someone had their hand and foot on the doorframe, curled up. This girl was in a room and she was all jerky like. Later, I was at home telling Dad about my dream. First I was lying in front of the heater. Ezra said I wasn't going to school today because I got the day off. Dad made a joke about trying to learn how to fly for three days. There was a house thing called Riff Raff, which only had two walls. I was then at Mom's again. She woke me up and I was writing down my dreams. I accidentally wrote in my fat little notebook. My dream was about Tinkerbell and Mittens."
"1346"	"(2007-06-26 (16)) I was saying ""Brilliant!"", whilst trying to copy Paul Whitehouse's voice. I was saying 'holes' and then said school but was then like ""Nah, that's horrible""."
"1347"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) I was at school. I was in a group with Jeremiah and Alejandro and probably the rest. Jeremiah told me not to go to school tomorrow because of an assembly first period (on Wednesday)."
"1348"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) I was at an airport/plane place. I was quoting The Fast Show and I saw Paul Whitehouse's name on the floor and a picture of him as Suit You on the wall. There were other celebrity people too. Martin Balsam was one of them. Some guy complained about a Colin Farrell impersonator. The creepy guy from Idiocracy was there. I was looking for Paul Whitehouse. This weird dude was annoying Dad."
"1349"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) Elijah was driving and I was asking him how he was. I was somewhere else and Ms Solomon was explaining how she plans her lessons. Darius wanted to do something. We were lining up somewhere and I was looking for Eugene."
"1350"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) I was at a house and there was a big lounge. This girl and her father were on the floor."
"1351"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) This guy had no legs and was getting pulled along behind a car. Evelyn said ""My father explained that to me""."
"1352"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) I was at the bench. I saw Mr Macklin walking down the corridor (and he had long hair). I went up to him and I told him who I was. He was like ""Uh... oh yeah, you did badly"". Calvin was at the bench."
"1353"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) Calvin and I were walking down a street. I realized it was a dream and I ran off trying to wish for Eugene, but I lost lucidity."
"1354"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) Dad and I, and sometimes Ezra, went to some weird place for a movie. It was called Freaksville or something. These two pale kids were hanging around. They kept annoying me. One was smoking and I was complaining about their parents and one started crying. I calmed them down. One of them was my age and the other was 17. One looked like a toddler but was 18. These people gave us these cakes and they had onion in them. All the food had onion in them. We were all in water. The guy my age choked on a toothpick and no-one knew and he sank underwater. He said that he saw an image. He managed to get above the surface. The 17 year old had only a few days to shoot his role in the movie as he started school soon. Mom and Ezra came somewhere near there later. They saw Roland's car in the bush. There was this party thing. This lady was doing a quiz. She or someone knew all the answers. The guy who was my age had become a playboy but regarded me as his best friend. I was hoping he wasn't Ethan Hawke because he's ugly."
"1355"	"(2007-06-28 (16)) We were participating in a Battle Royale thing. There were two groups; the sickles, who were bad, and swords, who were good and also my group. A sickle and I were having an argument. This girl came and helped. Charlene came and gave a sickle to each of us, then joined the other girl. I saw a girl bleeding and went over and checked for weapons and said ""I'm not going to hurt you, but she is"" and pointed to Charlene. We got away and met up with others. I went off by myself into this big place inside. Bradley was there and he had a sword. A sickle attacked me and Bradley tried to help. The sickle said something about hurting Eugene. We escaped. I saw Alejandro and he had a sickle and I said ""Not you!"" because I thought he was a sickle, but he was a sword. We saw Jeremiah later and Eugene was standing in the background. Calvin and Samantha joined up with me. We went to a playground and there was a fishing thing. Teachers were coming and I saw Mr Reilly. We had to hide, but couldn't in time. I went to hide, but I fast-forwarded it and a girl saw me, so I rewound. I realized that I was going to get caught so I paused it and told the people I was with to stay there because they would be safe and that I had to leave. Calvin was like ""why not take us?"". He was supposed to be paused too. Later, Mom and Ezra were watching Battle Royale II, which was what just happened and at the 'time' part, I said ""This part sucks, but it was a dream""."
"1356"	"(2007-06-28 (16)) I was at Nana's and there was some dating thing. I told her to turn the TV off and I bolted out the door and she was like ""huh?"". I said the dating thing was a joke and that I didn't realize it was her. Clayton was pulling a rope on this big machine so that the door would open."
"1357"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I was at school at the library, because I had Biology. Eugene was there on a computer. Calvin and Genevieve came later and sat next to Eugene. There was a new door for the library, which was saloon like, but in two sections. I was telling Ezra about it. Ms Solomon came in. During Accounting, we had to go get our photos for the yearbook taken. The Year 12's had to go to the library. Farrah was there, saying hello. Evelyn came. It was Lillian's turn and she was talking. The lady asked if she wanted a group hug and Eugene was like ""Yeah, come on!"". A lady said she'd videoed me at lunch. Later, someone was killing people. I was ok. Elana, Autumn, Madelyn and someone were in a car. They decided to separate. Autumn went into a hole. Elana and this girl went back to school and the killer was still there. They were on a horse and got shot. It was movie like."
"1358"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I was at home. It was creepy and I was going to call Mom. The light wasn't turning on. I was locking the back door."
"1359"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I got my laptop back and the files were deleted and they looked weird. The Star Trek movies were gone."
"1360"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I was at Nana's. I got my laptop back. Mom's friend was called Pale. Mom said that it wasn't the usual model he worked with, but I could sign in now. It was like Sims 2. Mom kept calling my laptop Andrew. We were then on the back of a Ute and holding onto the rails. The bridge had the word BRIDGE on it. Then we were in a normal car. I saw Rodney outside a newsagency on the street. I was looking for Eugene. I saw Elijah."
"1361"	"(2007-07-01 (16)) There were some stairs or desks in this place. Seamus was in there doing a test."
"1362"	"(2007-07-01 (16)) I was at home. Nana lived out the back in a little house with three kids (it wasn't Nana all the time). Dad was selling the house so I was wondering what was going to happen to it."
"1363"	"(2007-07-02 (16)) I was at school. Eugene and his group were nearby. They were making jokes about me and Eugene. Someone said that I should give a photo of who I like to Eugene. Someone else said ""Nah, she likes Eugene""."
"1364"	"(2007-07-02 (16)) Granny died. The wake was on the same night. Mom and I went to this house. I didn't go to the wake because I thought it was stupid. I was upset later. Then I was at school and we had an excursion to the shop. Silas and I were there and there were these videos of people and chairs (I don't remember what was happening). Someone was chasing a ferret and I was thinking about Porky. I was telling Dad why I wasn't at school."
"1365"	"(2007-07-03 (16)) I was on the net. I had emails and one was from Classmate-F-08 and I sent one to Gavin, but he was called Gavin Howd. I was going through my old emails and there were some from Valerie, which were all about Runescape. Gavin replied and he said that he got ""13, 3"", which was a good level, for something he'd written about himself for school, so he had sent me that. He liked Oldboy."
"1366"	"(2007-07-03 (16)) I was at a fair. Presents were floating around, like in Animal Crossing, and I also had a slingshot. People fell from the sky with lots of presents and sometimes holidays. I went over to this lady, who was near a Ferris wheel. As I was walking under it, it fell, but I was in between all the bits and pieces and so was ok. This lady who had fallen from the sky had stuff and I traded a lump of Quikeze for it. Adam Sandler's father's name was 'Boney Boney'."
"1367"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) I was at school. Calvin and I went up this hill and there were all these bugs and cockroaches. Ezra came up once too. We were sitting up there but it was making us too itchy."
"1368"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) We had a new house, but we weren't settled. I had a gay bed. My computer was being screwy. Mom was there."
"1369"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) I was watching some movie with John Cusack in it. He was wearing this green suit thing and he looked really hot in it. A scene in it reminded me of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Joy (My Name is Earl) was singing and she was covered in makeup. I was on my laptop and Ezra was there on his."
"1370"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) I saw that the music video for Black Man Ray was on the TV, but it was halfway through. It was different to the real one."
"1371"	"(2007-07-05 (16)) I was somewhere and Mom was there. I needed her to say something for me for some court-like thing. The Doctor (Doctor Who, as David Tennant) came somewhere and went to these men and he said to buy him ""three drinks, no, two"" because they thought he was crazy the last time. He then passed out."
"1372"	"(2007-07-05 (16)) Some guy had those gas masks, like in the episode of Doctor Who. Earlier, he killed the Doctor (David Tennant) and someone else. I got trapped somewhere underground. There were lots of people down there, including some soldiers and Ezra. The soldiers though, I think, worked for the bad guy. When the bad guy released the 'gas-mask disease', by opening a window and put this girl with a gasmask on through it, everyone ran. The soldiers got attacked too. Ezra and I escaped. Then we were at Mom's. The Doctor woke up. He came to us and someone went down the stairs and we followed. I had my arm around The Doctor's waist, to help him walk. We ran out and Mom, Ezra, The Doctor and I got into the car. Mom was driving and I was in the driver's seat. This guy's parrot kept falling in this hole. Mom said she had been infected. She tried to kill this other parrot. The road was wet, and we slid on it. Then we realized that she really had been infected. Then I was at home with Dad and Ezra. The hair straightener was around. The bookshelf was in the kitchen."
"1373"	"(2007-07-06 (16)) I was at a shop, but the 'shelves' were all metal and there wasn't much merchandise. There was a Dalek and a bunch of soldiers there. There were also civilians. The Dalek and I were killing the soldiers. Then we stopped because we couldn't win (which I questioned). Then I told the Dalek we should work together and they all died. We had to kill the people and animals too, but I couldn't kill the animals so I told the people to follow me. We ended up at this place and Jennifer Saunders was holding the door open. Dawn French was also with her. They had this auditorium thing, so we all went in. Mom and Ezra were sitting there in different seats, so I called them over."
"1374"	"(2007-07-06 (16)) I was in England. I was riding a weird buggy thing through this patch of forest. There were lots of snakes. I got out and there was a big oval thing, so I walked on that. I saw Calvin riding another buggy. I was then at some old mans house, then it was an old lady. She was asking me what I wanted to eat, and I had a choice of different biscuits, which had names in different languages. She pulled a banana out of the skin and basically told me to have sex with it. I was like ""Ew!"". The bananas were fluffy. She thought that I liked this David guy and crossed off his name. She had R.B. Greaves on the list too. Then I was at this place which looked like Mom's house. The lights were off and something was coming up the stairs. It was this evil guy and I was trying to scream."
"1375"	"(2007-07-07 (16)) I was at Mom's. Clayton and someone else were staying over. Ezra said they had to sleep in my room and I said no. Mom and Darren were in Ezra's room on mattresses on the floor and Clayton was sharing Ezra's bottom bunk."
"1376"	"(2007-07-07 (16)) I was at home and Dad had to get me breakfast and lunch, but he ended up at the beach. Valerie was there with Farrah and the rest of them, but I didn't see the others. They all had books about their life. They had shown me the book when they first started it."
"1377"	"(2007-07-07 (16)) Dad was watching a movie about Fergie. I was like ""Yuck!"" and watched a little bit of stuff about John Lennon, Michael Palin and Terry Jones and some fat guy, who was in everything. I was telling Ezra that my blue jumper was the fat guys."
"1378"	"(2007-07-08 (16)) I was at home. I made a ham and pickle sandwich and left in on a plate in the sink. I came back a while later and it had fallen into some water. Then, it was a chicken sandwich and there was a chicken on the breakfast bar. I started making two vegemite sandwiches and noticed there was this white, cream looking stuff in it. I was wondering what it was. I then found some light brown stuff too and I thought it was poo, and thought maybe it was like the Hide-the-Poo game. I told Dad and we were reading the ingredients and they were new. It was also supposed to have a red crab in it. I decided not to have a sandwich."
"1379"	"(2007-07-09 (16)) I did drama, as did Calvin, for semester two and we had it in the chemistry room. I didn't like it. I complained to Mom. I had to do some project on Cleopatra. Dad and Darren were there. Darren and Mom were both on the computer. This police woman came and she asked me I was Izzy Conell. Dad said no, but Mom gave it away. Later, Mom said my name and I said I wanted to go home, because I didn't want to have to talk to the police lady."
"1380"	"(2007-07-09 (16)) There was this film set. These bombs were exploding near this guy, which was a mistake. Peter Jackson was the director. The main lady said that Leo (DiCaprio) was complaining about their ""chemistry"". She couldn't fall over in sync with him, etc. This robot was flirting with this chair. This lady was playing this computer type game and this big guy was like ""Are you waiting for her?"". He was singing a song."
"1381"	"(2007-07-09 (16)) This girl and boy (who were brother and sister) could travel back in time. They were gone for a while at one stage and when they came back their mother was really excited. She had moved house since then and they wanted to bring her back in time. They chose the 1700's. Then we were there, sitting at a table outside somewhere. There was a poster with classical composers. I was saying that Beethoven and Mozart rock. The cups were really solid. They were hanging people there. I spoke with a British accent and was saying how one place I went to thought that the accent was rude."
"1382"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) I or someone had drawn a picture called 'The Kiss' of this guy and a girl. I was thinking about me and David Tennant. Then I was Clark Kent (Smallville) and he was giving it to this girl who liked him. Someone had done a painting too."
"1383"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) This house was empty. Ezra and Mom wanted to steal a car. We couldn't find it, so we left. Police were coming."
"1384"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) Heather Graham wasn't wearing any pants and her legs were really hairy. She was on a stage. Everyone was like ""ew"" and she was just like meh."
"1385"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) I was at school. Some people and I were doing a test. I had a headache. Elana was there. I realized later, they were trying to erase our memories and control us. I was in my room at Mom's and Clayton and a made-up friend of Ezra's called Jeffrey were there. They fell out of my bed. Jeffrey couldn't hear anymore and we all had to collect letters to answer some questions. An answer to one was Patchy. For some reason I needed an 'S', so I put 'sparkle'. I forgot to cross it off. Ezra was there. Later, I was at school and they were asking about it. I was writing and my spelling was all weird, along with other people. Something said ""love Izzy"" then ""more than Eugene"". I was like 'what the hell?'. They had this back needle thing."
"1386"	"(2007-07-11 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who stuff. There were outtakes with The Doctor (as David Tennant) and Rose."
"1387"	"(2007-07-11 (16)) I was at school and it was lunch. I had written something about Jayson on the bench. Silas had written 'your' Jayson Dillard. Silas found heaps of pictures in my diary of David Tennant."
"1388"	"(2007-07-11 (16)) I was at some school thing. I was looking for Eugene. Ms Newberry said my name. There was a room with cakes. A couple of girls came in and they picked a dress and they got the corresponding cake. There was some game thing where you find one coin alone in it's year. The bowl was almost empty, so I went through it. There was rabbit poo in there too. The window opened and this burglar came in, I was like 'what the hell?'. Someone made them go through the poo."
"1389"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who. Rose had come back and she wouldn't say how. Martha and The Doctor (David Tennant) were there too. They were at this place and there some evil blokes. They all got separated and could talk to each other over these speakers. Rose thought that she was going to die. There was some washing place with clothes. They tricked the bad guys, but then they caught on."
"1390"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) I was at deli with Mom. I wanted Fruit Pastilles. She got them and was embarrassed about something and wanted to leave. There was some nice chocolate. Later, you got points for certain creatures. There was some scorpion thing and I was reading the scorpion list. There was a slug that looked like a dinosaur with a slug instead of a horn on its back."
"1391"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) I was watching The Simpsons, and the family had disappeared. It showed Marge getting out of a cupboard and there were police downstairs. She had an old lady with her and she was like 'she's useless' so got rid of her and ran off."
"1392"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) Ezra had a moving van with a BIG box."
"1393"	"(2007-07-13 (16)) Dad picked me and Ezra up from school because Mom was sick. I complained about this. Eugene was nearby. When I got in the car, I looked back at him. Dad gave Ezra a ticket, which I realized was to see some movie, which I also wanted to see. When we got home, I asked about my ticket and Dad had figured that I wouldn't want to see it and hadn't gotten me a ticket. I was angry. I asked to be dropped off at Mom's. Seriously Weird was on TV and it was an episode I hadn't seen. I was thinking that Ryan Cartwright was hot."
"1394"	"(2007-07-13 (16)) I was at school. The day before, we'd been given a list of the Top 250 on IMDb. I had scribbled on mine and the next day we were told it was required, so I asked Ms Newberry for another one. I was watching 28 Days Later... and Cillian Murphy looked like a cross between Tom Welling and Ian Somerhalder."
"1395"	"(2007-07-14 (16)) I was in France or something. Granma and Uncle Gabriel had taken me to some place. People there were evil and trapped us. There was this weird water and we were training ourselves to breathe in it. David Tennant and I were in it, but then we looked like weird plesiosaur type creatures, and I was observing. Then we were human and we kissed. Later, I had befriended this guy who looked like Laurence Fishburne. We were all escaping. Laurence was helping us and we had to jump over some platforms. We had to go down these steps and there was a GIANT cockroach and this little flying bug kept falling. The bug had to be up for you to go down. This girl saw the cockroach was like ""Hell no!"". Then it was loose, and I ran up the steps. The girl and I ran to the exit and Laurence stayed to fix the cockroach. This gate was open. Earlier, some girl had electrocuted herself on it. We went to the car and there was a shelf in the back and it was a truck thing. I was trying to remember where to go. There were photos of Ezra and also Wallace, Tiana and Julius. I tried to ask for help, but everyone only spoke French."
"1396"	"(2007-07-15 (16)) I was in the UK on an oval. I was saying how awesome it was. I was sometimes in Year 12, but mostly it was this year. I went to this school for a day and I had to wear a skirt. I had sport there one day and Evelyn was there and this red-haired girl with freckles. Later, I was talking to Silas and he wrote some stuff down. One was that ""Dmitri had a crush on you from 1999-1966"" because he saw me making azaleas. He looked at what he wrote and was confused and then he crossed the reason out and changed the date to 2006-2007. I was thinking 'No way!'. I found a book of mine and it had lots of my stuff in it and I had done an assignment on Loren Dean and I got excited. Silas had done an assignment on Dylan Moran. Later, I was talking to Eugene. We were going out and he didn't want me to move to England. I was friends with the whole cast of some show. Paul Whitehouse was there, so I'm presuming it was The Fast Show. This car was 'on fire' for some effects thing."
"1397"	"(2007-07-17 (16)) I was somewhere and I started crying. Dad and Ezra were there too. All these randoms started hugging me. Later I went to school and my hair wasn't straightened. I was in the 'science room' and Silas and a bunch of people were laughing at my hair. I got this torch and left. I went up a hill and left. We had a new house. I forgot my keys. I called Mom and then noticed the back door was unlocked. I saw two Spaceman's. There were cracks in the middle of the walls. I told Mom and she said it was a burglar, but she didn't want to be bothered because Slater was going to die today from tuberculosis. Clayton was around."
"1398"	"(2007-07-17 (16)) Rose, Martha, The Doctor (David Tennant) and I were hanging around. Rose and Martha were annoyed at each other. Some big alien bloke thing came and pulled the TARDIS underground and replaced it with some toy thing. He knew it was a time machine. We all ran off and the Doctor and one of them ended up somewhere else. I went in this shop looking for them. I ended up in this arena and saw The Doctor, and I found him because I saw his coat. There was this virtual tennis, but not. The tennis ball would fly out at the crowd. A monster came and the lights went out. I was hiding with The Doctor. We were climbing up a pole and it had these spiky things. It fell, but I was ok."
"1399"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) The Doctor Who episode of The Weakest Link was on TV. There was a bit before the show where a few days earlier, Noel Clarke, Masi Oka and James Kyson Lee had gone into the studio to mess around. They had pegs to put their picture up. James pegged his head instead. David Tennant and Anne Robinson also appeared. Later, I was in the car and they were going to play it on the radio. Dad and Ezra were waiting for it and got out. Dad got rid of the station."
"1400"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) I was at Mom's. I had all these internet pages open on David Tennant. She was looking and I was trying to hide it."
"1401"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) There was some show with Ellen Burstyn when she was young. She looked like Anna Paquin. I started downloading season one."
"1402"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) Something happened and there was going to be a huge demand for food. Darren had chips in the car, so we ran out to get them (we were at school). The school had chocolate, including Picnics. There was something about Brad Pitt. People started running out to get food."
"1403"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) I saw a Daddy Long Legs near my bed, and then realized there were heaps. Mom looked and there were millions under the blanket on the top bunk. I was like ""Where am I going to sleep?"" and Mom went to sleep and forgot about me. There was some 'itchy test' and some squishy thing."
"1404"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who. The Doctor (David Tennant) landed right in front of some cops. Some girl's sister died and her other sister went loopy. The older one befriended The Doctor somehow. The cops were trying to map out the TARDIS, but they couldn't get in. Obviously, it was big. The Doctor and the girl were in a backyard and there were smokes on the windowsill, so The Doctor was having a smoke, and I was thinking he was hot. The mother of the girl turned up and he realized they were all bad and he shot the mother because she was going to shoot him. Darren woke me up to open his door. There were clothes that I was supposed to pick up. Quincy's phone was there."
"1405"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who with Ezra. Mom later said that Ezra hated it, but I didn't think he did. People were doing an assignment on Rose, on why she cried at the end. I was like ""They can't put that in there!"". The Doctor was at this poor place and this girl liked him and followed him. I realized later that he didn't have a companion. This doctor was before David Tennant, but after Christopher Eccleston."
"1406"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I was in the car with Mom at this shop with all these really expensive cars in the carpark. This one car was a 'Ferrari Excel'. This lady was trying to get Mom out of the car. Then I was writing my dream down and she wanted to know about me. I didn't know what to say and was thinking about Runescape and Doctor Who. She took my dream and I was like ""Hey! Give it back!""."
"1407"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I saw Porky and she was still alive. I was like ""I love you!""."
"1408"	"(2007-07-20 (16)) Mom, Ezra and I were in the car. Mom went to this house and this girl came out. She gave her smokes and the girl called out to her brother to pay for them. Her brother was Eugene. He saw me, but said his name was Bill. I was asking Mom why she was giving kids smokes. We went to this shop. Clayton and a made-up sister of his were there. I wanted a Yogo. We left and this guy on the road was using a trolley thing as transport. It went backwards and he was almost hit."
"1409"	"(2007-07-20 (16)) I was at 'home'. Ezra and some random guys were there. They were playing some trivia game that was a special feature for some movie. We were watching bloopers and stuff too."
"1410"	"(2007-07-21 (16)) I went to Midvale for some excursion type of thing. There was a teacher called Ms Clarke. I was with a group of girls and it was a sport activity and we were making up rules and throwing a pillow and getting points. Then we were talking. The teacher was complaining about me. She also said that I must be doing better without Derrick and I was like ""Who is that?"". I went home. The next day, I got home and I realized I'd forgotten my bag. I went back and searched everywhere. I found my DS, iPod and a Rayman game for the DS and another DS game. I realized my bag had been stolen. I somehow got into home and called Mom. We called my phone and this guy answered. He said that it was his girlfriend's phone. He asked me what the number was and I said ""040440440, sorry, 38"". He thought that I lied because I sounded nervous and I said ""Well, I just had... stolen"". I smashed Ms Clarke's car and burnt her house and got my stuff. I was at Mom's and the table was outside. I was on my laptop. There was this program thing where you can change a movie character to a person or something. I got Grimani from Casanova. I was like ""What the hell do I want him for?! I want David Tennant!""."
"1411"	"(2007-07-21 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who, but all I remember was David Tennant screaming."

"1414"	"(2007-07-23 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who, but then it was Firefly. There was a castle thing and it had these smoke clouds. I was telling someone that this was like another episode of their show. I don't remember it properly, but Wash and Book were caught. Zoe wasn't happy. I remember Mal, Kaylee, Simon and Jayne were around too. The creatures were gargoyle like."
"1415"	"(2007-07-23 (16)) Calvin and I were doing some puzzle and That's Life! I got distracted by something and when I came back, Calvin text me the answer and I realized I'd made a mistake, as did he."

I was watching The Fast Show and there was something about utopia. I was also looking at something about Young Bond. I was thinking of Paul Whitehouse. We had an excursion. I was on the same bus as Ezra. Clayton was in front of me. Ezra and Clayton had chips and I was eating them too. It was our first excursion together. Calvin wasn't on the bus. Some of the street names were Impressive and Screenplay. Mom and Darren went to the US for some wine thing. They didn't want to stay the night."
"1417"	"(2007-07-26 (16)) Some time traveling people were after me. There was an old lady. David Tennant was unlocking this door (I had run out at one stage and then had run back in) and I locked it again. I, or someone, killed the old lady and put her in this air thing. David Tennant came out. There were these things which flew into your mouth, 'rape' you and give you a funny feeling in your stomach and then you die. I think I was an alien. Whoever had them made a compromise with me and would take me instead of killing me or something. They had these strips to track people. There was also this cool TOM-TOM thing and I was looking for Eugene. It said that he was in 'Spaceman' which was a suburb or a street."
"1418"	"(2007-07-28 (16)) I was finding out stuff from when I was younger. Some teacher bloke pulled out this big sheet of paper. It had love hearts and Eugene written all over it and there was lots of sticky tape. I was like 'Oh my God, Eugene!'. I said that it wasn't mine, but a friend of mine's. I asked how he got it. I thought I'd done it in 2002, but it was made in 2001."
"1419"	"(2007-07-28 (16)) I was at some museum type of place. There was a cute baby owl. Ezra and Nana were there. The next room had shells and stuff."
"1420"	"(2007-07-28 (16)) It was the olden days (like before cars). This guy worked for this guy who was a powerful dude. His three year old daughter flirted with the guy. As time went on, she continued flirting with him and he kept rejecting her. The powerful guy ran away. People were coming to find him and mistook this worker guy."
"1421"	"(2007-07-28 (16)) I was having a bath and I washed my hair with just shampoo because Mom had said that dinner was almost ready. Mom and Dad said that my hair was stupid."

People kept going weird and trying to kill me (including Clayton and Samantha). I ran to a deli. Samantha was there and ordered a ""mint tableau"". I got some thing and I needed to get a drink to get water. They only had coffee and I had a look for Choc Milk, but they didn't have any. No-one wanted a drink. Eugene was there."
"1424"	"(2007-07-29 (16)) These aliens were from a planet with no emotion and looked like humans. I didn't believe them. At first, there was one, then there were a few. I did this thing to make a portal, but it didn't work. This guy and his friend tried to kill me with these big rocks. I threw them back. One hit the guy and bounced off him and hit the other guy. They were rapists too. Elijah was there. There were lots of houses and I was walking down the street. I was calling ""Eugene!"" because I thought that he'd been with me earlier. I went to this place which was where I worked, and it was creepy."
"1425"	"(2007-07-29 (16)) I found something about John Simm and I was like ""Oh my God!""."
"1426"	"(2007-07-30 (16)) I went to Mom's [old] house and it was empty and different. It was very white. Someone was saying how there was nothing to steal, but I was still worried about people being there. There was some scanner thing, which said there were more people than us in the house. We were checking the rooms. I checked the bathroom and the mirror cabinet. Mom was there."
"1427"	"(2007-07-31 (16)) I was at 'school'. I asked Mr Stevenson if I could go to the toilet. I got my hair straightener and Josephine went with me. The toilets were like ashtrays and there were no doors, so I went back. The lady said ""Are you finished in the 30's?"". She said that I had diabetes according to some blood test thing. My score was 26.12. She said ""three shots of insulin a day"". I said ""No"". Eugene was there. I was thinking that Ezra must definitely have diabetes."
"1428"	"(2007-08-01 (16)) Eugene and his brother were staying over. I was spying what they were eating, listening to, wearing etc. I went to get some food. I saw the blonde guy from McFly on TV. Rodney wanted to stay to watch but Mom kept going out."

Ms Pascal was around and she walked off. Mr Reilly was doing something about leaves. These black people had balls and were throwing them at us. We threw them back. We were joking about Evelyn and Darius. I threw a water bottle and it went over three of them. One was white with really brown eyes. Someone opened this door and there was a time 'vortex'. They closed it. The black people went to sleep. We went through the vortex and landed in a wrestling match."
"1431"	"(2007-08-02 (16)) I was watching The Waterboy [it keeps being on Foxtel] . Kevin Costner was in it. There was a big thing about racism because this black guy was the bad guy in it and he killed a French girl. Dad said they were ""glorifying blacks"". Mom was around."

As an adult she went over to his house and he was a doctor. She asked him if he ever kissed his patients and he said ""Sometimes"". Then she said ""And sex?"" and he said sometimes. She said something else and they went to kiss each other, but he pulled away and said he couldn't do that because she was married and it wasn't fair to her husband."
"1434"	"(2007-08-03 (16)) I was at school and I was watching Eugene's car. Mom parked far away and we left at a time where we'd be behind his car, but we were in front. Then another car was behind us and I was like 'damn!'."

"1438"	"(2007-08-04 (16)) I was watching the first episode of Sliders and it was totally different. Steve Guttenberg and Katherine Heigl were in it. It was set in a space ship and they would randomly travel in time or space. In real life, I got this package and it was makeup. Dad and I were like ""What the hell?"". There were clothes as well, including some blue pants and some weird string thing."
"1439"	"(2007-08-04 (16)) I asked Mom to get me a water bottle and to fill it up from the fridge. Dad was there."
"1440"	"(2007-08-05 (16)) Some kid was on the radio. He had wrapped a cylinder of textas in glad wrap and I was thinking that they would contact him again in ten years. Then, that had happened fifteen years ago or something and they brought him back. Mom and I went to the beach, then I decided I didn't want to. We had an exercise ball with us. She wanted to stay. She said something about Ezra. I saw Darius on the beach. We were walking near these buildings. Then I was someone else and my parents were dead. I saw Calvin. I said that I must've been adopted. These radio people met with me. There was a guy and a girl and a guy my age. The radio guy signed the guy's letter, and the girl signed mine. I was talking with them on the radio and we were sitting on opposite sides of this booth thing. There were lots of buttons. I was talking about Robbie Williams who I was friends with. I was saying how everyone says he's a ""sex God"". I was saying that we don't hang out much because I liked being alone, but we would watch movies together sometimes. There were lots of rows of CD's. There was a laptop."

"1443"	"(2007-08-06 (16)) This dream jumps around a lot, but I was in an alternate universe. I was given prescription medicine in pill form, which was opium, but they were smokes. Calvin was talking about Genevieve touching him and something about bandages. Mom straightened half of my hair. I was at school and realized about my hair. I saw Granma and she wouldn't call Mom. I started walking on the grassed area near senior school. Someone told me Dmitri liked me and wanted to go out with me. I said that I didn't and a bird pooped on my head. I saw Dmitri walking down the corridor. I was at home and then I called Mom. I went to this other universe. Then I was me and alternate me was with me. She would disappear in seven months. There was this big vacuum thing sucking everything. I couldn't get out of the way, but I managed to. These others and I were trapped in this box. We were getting out and there were these time capsules in there. We all got up except for Julian Sands, because if he went to get him we would fall in. He wrote his last dream down and gave it to me."
"1444"	"(2007-08-06 (16)) I was at home and I saw a burglar out the back so I banged on the window to scare him off. He saw me and I realized he was going to come in. Ezra went to the laundry and I went to my room and music was playing. Later, I went out armed with a fork. I stabbed Dad by mistake. Ezra was at the hospital and he had been stabbed in the arm. I called the ambulance and Ezra wanted to confirm it was me talking, by asking me about some story about a swing at Nana's. Dad's laptop was still there. There was something about Valerie and Precious and Tinkerbell."
"1445"	"(2007-08-07 (16)) Eugene was on the computer. He was on a site and we both had an account and I told him to add me as a friend. His name was Splatter. I went home and went on the site to find out information about him. My avatar was something to do with The Simpsons Movie. His brother Rodney had the same avatar."
"1446"	"(2007-08-07 (16)) I was at school. We had photos and I remember Jeremiah. Someone had undies with Billie Piper on them. We were going to be making a photo album video. Ms Pascal was around. Calvin wanted to do one of Dumbledore (Harry Potter). Samantha and someone were sitting near me. Calvin wanted Genevieve in our group."
"1447"	"(2007-08-08 (16)) Ezra, Mom and I went to this place for bowling. First it was Dad in the car and I forgot my shoes and he was complaining. There was a pool outside the place. I saw Darius and I was like ""Oh my God! Evelyn's man!"". I was thinking ""I have to tell Calvin this!"". I tripped over and was like ""Flip! Bollocks!"". Darius followed us. Inside, it was museum like and I recognized it. We'd been there before and I was thinking that I'd dreamt about it before. There was an art exhibition and then it was excursion. Eugene was there. We were getting put into groups. On this piece of paper it had Simba, me, Thuy, Elijah and Eugene in a group. Me and Eugene's details were mixed up -- his address was my address etc. We went off in our group. Eugene and Thuy were hanging together. Eugene had a lemon and he spat it out. I dropped a knife and Elijah laughed at me. Someone asked me if there was anyone in the room that I hadn't talked about. There wasn't. There was a book with lots of drawings."
"1448"	"(2007-08-09 (16)) I was at school and in the Intro Calc classroom. We had to run out of the class at random times. I changed seats and was next to Eugene, by accident. The seat was the desk behind Autumn's usual seat. We had a test of how we'd survive in certain situations. My scenario was a jumper which was 101.3°C. Later, I was walking behind Eugene and Bradley and I or someone said something and Bradley laughed. Darius was there. I or someone passed out."
"1449"	"(2007-08-09 (16)) Mom and I were on this rollercoaster. I think it was a game and she kept falling off at the end."

This guy checked it and then turned it over and the gravity changed and it floated down to Earth. This alien thing was around. Some guy who looked like Jason Patric was there too. I was at school and I sat with Elana, then I was wondering why I was sitting with her and went over to the bench. A bunch of boys were near by and they were throwing ice-cream. Someone called out ""Calvin"". The boys left. Mr Willingham told them off. We were hiding out and Eugene kept hiding out. We were hiding because it was the end of the world or something."
"1451"	"(2007-08-10 (16)) Some kids got to school to start filming for a movie, myself included. Only a few people did. Later, we found out that there was going to be an assembly. Ms Solomon said ""... couldn't do this next year!"". I was next to Daryl and his hand was on my leg and I didn't feel weird. We got called to the assembly and the class got attacked. We ran into this assembly place which had two entrances at the top and then these steps went all the way across and continued down (like a cinema, without chairs). Then it was somewhere else and there was this alien guy called Arthur. He went yellow and his face was big. This lady nurse/receptionist got scared by him. The doctor came and was trying to help it. There was a photo of what Arthur looked like normally and we were descendents of him."
"1452"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) I was in a shop and this bad guy (who was a girl) was trying to kill me and so I was trying to do the same to her, but she was really fast and always dodged the bullets. I was thinking that she had that thing which made you go a few seconds ahead of everyone else (like in Flesh and Blood). When you selected a gun it was like a game and there was a touch screen panel. I got this firecracker type of gun, but I was still missing her. The top of the gun fell off and it had tubes in it (like the lolly things at Seabird). The gun was red. I was running out and I realized that she was going to blow up the shop. I saw Elijah and Theodore standing out side and I told them to run and follow me. I got into this car, which was actually a spaceship. Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres were in there. I was friends with them. Dmitri couldn't drive well on the road. Elijah was like ""What's the ship called"" and they said ""Serenity"". There was an intro video of Dmitri and some girl he liked and they were painted green."
"1453"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) I went to Mom's and we were eating dinner. Ezra wanted to leave and Dad was there. I was watching a movie and it had one hour to go. Mom was getting dirty clothes, but she was just grabbing random stuff, so I told her I'd do it myself. She took my Dada shirt."
"1454"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) Some black kid and his father were really fast. It was a TV show. The kid was talking to the bad guy and said ""leave Dad alone"". The guy kidnapped the kid and he was talking to the Dad who he could see on this screen. He said the kid could see him and his mother was like ""he can't see anything"" -- the kid was blind. He was also really smart and did this hard equation in his head really quickly. This guy had to pretend that he died. He had a son who was about my age and was kind of hot. He knew that his father was alive. This girl who looked like Katherine Heigl and the son were hybrids and so they couldn't breed. The 'dead' guy's wife called the son and she didn't know the guy was alive."
"1455"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) I was at school. I had to go to the toilet and was trying to find it. The school was huge and completely different. I went to Ms Corbett's classroom, which was supposed to have stairs in it to go to the toilet."
"1456"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) Elijah was staying over or something. We were all in the car and we were in the backseat and Mom was driving. I said ""I made a gift for you today good Proctor"" and he said ""Why thank you, it is a fair poppet"". I was laughing and said ""That damn poppet""."
"1457"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) I was watching some play, which I think was A Streetcar Named Desire. Marlon Brando was in it. Dad called out ""Eugene!"" and I was like ""What the hell?"". Then it was this movie and some girl said that Ava Gardner and Cary Grant were in it. Then she said that was wrong and it was Marlon Brando, Janet Leigh and some made-up guy called Chuck Morris."
"1458"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) I was watching some video from 1338 and Einstein was in it. I was like 'eh?'. I concluded it was because some people had traveled in time."
"1459"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) I was looking at who lives in each house on Casserley Ave, like it was on a computer. David Tennant and Christopher Eccleston both lived on there. I was looking for Eugene. I was like ""You live on the same street as David Tennant and Christopher Eccleston?!"""
"1460"	"(2007-08-13 (16)) I was at school and I was going to form. To get to mine you had to walk through this glass. Eugene was in my form. He got to the other side of the glass. His group didn't know how to get through. I said ""just walk through to the magic land"" and Eugene said the same thing and laughed. Some game for the DS was shown on this computer screen. I was making an account. I made my username FancyFire. Elijah was waiting. There was a quiz to see how gay you were. There was a cave in the game and it would open at 5:30-6:30pm for contact. These animals on the walls of the cave would come to life."

I was thinking that I'd take the bottom soon. There was a fan and light right above the bunk. I was really hot. I went to the kitchen and opened the fridge and Mom and I were trying to get cool. She was cooking."
"1469"	"(2007-08-14 (16)) I went to some shop place. There was this trial thing outside where you can get a couple million points and then cash them in. We had to look for some picture to get points. I wanted to join, but you had to have a shower, and the girls shower was on display, but not the guys. I really wanted to join, but refused to shower. Eventually, the lady let me look inside. There was a clothes section and all the clothes were too small. Ezra was there. She said that I didn't have to shower. I also remembered that Dad's Medicare card was at home."
"1470"	"(2007-08-15 (16)) I was at 'school' in some toilets getting changed. Mr_McDowell was outside the window talking to the girls. I realized that the cubicle wasn't fully closed. Calvin was talking to me earlier. The teacher came in and I quickly covered myself and he asked me why I was getting changed in there. I was looking for somewhere else to get changed."
"1471"	"(2007-08-15 (16)) I was downloading a movie. I went to Mom's and was downloading it there and I was getting 100kb/s. At home, I was only getting 20kb/s. Darren was complaining."
"1472"	"(2007-08-15 (16)) We were leaving for school in ten minutes. Dad had to work. Mom and Ezra were there. I had to straighten my hair, so I said that I'd get Mom to take me late. I wanted to not go though, because of a Chemistry test and I was thinking I could get her to pick me up before Physics, but decided that it was pointless and I wanted to practice the English play with Elijah and Theodore."
"1473"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I was at Nana's. I was walking around to go through Poppers's door. I saw a goose, it hissed, so I ran and it chased me. I had to jump over the ramp to down and I got stuck at the fish pond and it got me. It was pecking me and then heaps of others started to. Poppa and others tried to get them off but they couldn't. They had to kill them and I closed my eyes. They were then sinking in the fish pond. They got the rest off me and my leg hurt and I tried to run to the door. Someone said I'd never be able to run again. I went out later and I saw goose walking around so I ran back in."
"1474"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I went out the back and a bloke next door asked me to read a book. He said to pick a colour -- red or orange. I saw that orange was Harry Potter and because I don't like orange I chose red. It was Noah's Ark. He told me to read it and give a speech ""next Friday"". I was thinking 'Meh, this is just a dream'."
"1475"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I got a haircut. Mom was getting me food and I'd only been up for one hour. She wanted to get me Hungry Jack's."
"1476"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I was watching a movie. Some people were looking for some other people. This girl escaped through a vent and was hiding in this secret room. There was a pram in there. She 'slid' down the wall."
"1477"	"(2007-08-17 (16)) Mom was pregnant; sometimes she was at the start of the pregnancy, but sometimes at the end. The hospital was at school. Dmitri walked passed the window in Mom's room and Mom was looking and then she reckoned that I liked him. Calvin said that this scary lady was his mother, and I was like ""No, it isn't!"" and then she was like ""Hey, Calvin!"". I had left a message to everyone to tell Ezra about Mom and Eugene had gotten it first. Theodore was playing some game called Jacks and Randall. He was dressed as Jacks. There were aliens."
"1478"	"(2007-08-17 (16)) We were driving home and Eugene was behind us. I turned to look at him. Then we were driving backwards, and his father Abraham looked good-looking. Rodney was in the front. I was looking at Eugene and he saw me and was looking at me. I couldn't stop looking and I Can't Stop Loving You came on the radio."
"1479"	"(2007-08-17 (16)) There were aliens at school. We all had guns and stuff, but we were shooting at each other. Some girl realized that I was good at killing people so she showed me where extra ammo was. Those honkey nut things were the ammo. They acted like a plunger and didn't work that well. Evelyn and this girl were together. Evelyn jumped out of this window then they both went under a car. I lifted the car to help them. Evelyn ran and she was fast but she fell over. We had to blow up some hotel and this room somewhere to kill all the aliens. These people in the hotel all had the same look and room and they had cats and hats."
"1480"	"(2007-08-18 (16)) Mom wanted me to do some trick. There was a swamp thing out the back with an elephant in it. Its back was sticking out. I had to slide off it and go over this fence. I had a suspicion that it wasn't an elephant but a huge tiger or deer. After saying no over and over, I did it, but it wasn't an elephant -- it was a dinosaur. I was on its back and it stood up and was really tall and had a cone on its head. Ezra and I were stuck up high and Mom was down below trying to help us with a cardboard box. I told her to get rope and a better box. I thought that I head Eugene's voice and I could see over the fence, but it was that Salim guy."
"1481"	"(2007-08-18 (16)) We had two kittens. One had really nice brown, black and white markings. I had called it Eugene. But I decided not to call it that, because it wasn't mine, but Mom's. I was talking about it and called it Cornetto. Uncle Wilbur had called it that."
"1482"	"(2007-08-19 (16)) Our house was creepy and we had maids and stuff. They turned evil. I wanted to get inside to get my stuff. We were running away and it was really dark. The lighting, though, looked strange like a dream, so I did a reality check and it worked. I was wishing for Eugene, but it wasn't working, so I yelled out ""Eugene!"", but nothing happened."
"1483"	"(2007-08-19 (16)) I was at school and we were making stuff with pipes. Theodore gave me some extra things and told me how good drugs were. Dad picked me up and we had to push the car and I was on a mattress. We got to a traffic light. I had to go back to school to pack away. There was an Asian gardener there and he didn't understand me. There was a shop at school and it had Pokedex's and Tamagotchi's. Mom said ""not as good as Anastasia's"" and I was like ""What?! She has a Pokedex?!"" I was washing these pipes and this yucky stuff came out of the top of them."
"1484"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) Calvin and I were at this crime scene. There was a fake skeleton there in the place of the body. There was some shoe that had something to do with Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street). Zombies of some sort were around. There was a table which had names of dead people on there. Mariah was there and I laughed. Then I saw Michael Palin's name and I was like ""Oh my God! No! My favourite person in the world!"". I looked for Eugene's name, but I didn't find him."
"1485"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) I was at school waiting for Mom, because I was wagging. I found out that Darren had adopted some guy called Matt Keeslar and I was thinking of Brennan and Matt Keeslar (the actor) but it wasn't either of them. They went somewhere and my phone was missing and we discovered that he had taken it. We got home and he jumped in the bin. Darren was going to bash him. Mom and I drove off and she was crying."
"1486"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) There was something about Jeff Goldblum and I was like ""Brundle Seth!""."
"1487"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) These people were coming to kill us. We were in this room. There was some guy, his mother and I. His mother hid and the guy ran out this back door and I followed him. There was this big staircase and I was like ""up or down?"" and we went up. There was a bed there and we turned off the lights and they didn't find us. I think someone had died and come back to life."
"1488"	"(2007-08-22 (16)) I was on the net reading something. Someone said they thought that Darius was gay. I was wondering whether it was Mariyam or Thuy."
"1489"	"(2007-08-22 (16)) Eugene was staying over, I think."
"1490"	"(2007-08-22 (16)) I was driving with Dad and Ezra. There was a poster with shoes on it and I thought I saw Eugene's shoes on there."
"1491"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) I was at school. I was sitting with some people and there was a toilet which was outside and was like a drain. Ms Pascal thought that I was friends with the people. Then she asked how many friends I had, ""eleven?"" and I said ""Two, Calvin and Evelyn"" and she was like ""How did you manage that?"". I was telling Calvin later. He thought that the person I liked had a 'J' in their name. I was thinking 'Daryl, Dmitri and Eugene don't have a J!'."
"1492"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) I was somewhere and I was perving on Eugene. I was worried that his friends would see me looking."
"1493"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) I had some dream with zombies, but I don't remember anything else."
"1494"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) Calvin, Ezra and I were walking to school. Then Ezra and I were in a car and we drove off this little cliff. It showed Calvin's face and it took a while for this red Ute to fall on the car. Ezra and I got out and hurried away. Then it was a movie with Drake Bell. These cars were coming after him. He was at a gym and there was a car at the door trying to get in. He threw a barbell to stop the door from opening. The gym was closed that day. Someone wanted to do pushups."
"1495"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) I don't know where I was, but Nana and Ezra were there. Someone said something a ""little bike"" and ""ice-cream"". I called Dad and he got something that was Nike. The lighting was bad."
"1496"	"(2007-08-24 (16)) I was at this place with the school. It had this thing where you sit and it feels like someone pulls you down and you fall off this ledge. You were also supposed to 'see' Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street). I didn't. Calvin and Samantha were there. There was another one where you jump onto this seesaw thing and you get to the other side with a skateboard. Brennan kept hitting his head. Autumn tried it. Someone said something about Hey Ya."
"1497"	"(2007-08-24 (16)) Autumn was playing Pokemon and it was lagging heaps because the internet was slow. I was at her house. Her father was supposed to pick up Dad. She disappeared and returned minutes or hours later. She was at a table and then she went to the toilet. Dad was watching Boston Legal and I watched a little bit because James Spader was in it."
"1498"	"(2007-08-24 (16)) We were in some building. This guy went into some woman's room and took a piece of paper. I saw him and I went to him. I had done the same thing earlier. We started up this group thing and this guy came to join. The guy I was with knew he was a scammer and told me not to let him in. There was a big group of people, including Elijah and Evelyn who wanted to join. It cost $18.95 a year. You had to give a word to join. Some of the words were ""jar park"" and ""singing happy"". I was looking at screen shots for some movie and Jerry O'Connell was in it."
"1499"	"(2007-08-25 (16)) I was at a shop. Mom gave me and Ezra these Bopo cards and he bought this stingy doodler thing. I told him not to. This song started playing and I started singing Eye in the Sky and I realized it was that song playing. This lady was selling cats, but she was about to leave. There was a black one except it was yellow, who was like Spaceman. I got that cat."
"1500"	"(2007-08-25 (16)) I was on Payton's MySpace. He had this thing which said that he loved some guy called ""Michael Paglin"". I was looking at photos and realized it was Michael Palin. He was fully obsessed with him and I was like ""What the hell?""."
"1501"	"(2007-08-26 (16)) Mom was living with Darren, but was going out with her brother. They didn't think anything of it, but knew that it was wrong. Ezra was there. She was worried about having photos that reminded them that they were related."
"1502"	"(2007-08-26 (16)) I was washing clothes and I was also putting these random blocks in. I was looking for my Biology books."
"1503"	"(2007-08-27 (16)) Mom and I were walking back to her car. It was nighttime. Some people were at her car with metal pipes. They were trying to break in and we scared them off. One of them stayed and I threatened him with a pipe and he left."
"1504"	"(2007-08-28 (16)) I was on a computer and Eugene was next to me. We were all signing up with this site. Bradley finished and I was looking at his profile. I had put my birthday as 1986 and I was thinking that Bradley was fifteen years older. Then I realized my mistake. I first thought that I was 12 and he was 17. Eugene was watching me. There was a quote section and Bradley's had ""Izzy!"" and there were lots about me. I was thinking 'Great, they have a stupid nickname to diss me with'."
"1505"	"(2007-08-28 (16)) Mom had washed some clothes and they were all covered in some egg-y 'pillow' stuff."
"1506"	"(2007-08-29 (16)) Calvin was trying to guess who I like. He told me to look at the person I like and I said no. I was thinking 'Eugene is somewhere else'. Dmitri walked passed at some stage."
"1507"	"(2007-08-30 (16)) I was at 'school'. We were in science and had matches. Jeremiah had almost lit a match when Mr Reilly had some gas out. Darius threw a match away and I copied him. Someone realized that the room was going to blow up. Later, I walked back down to the room. Evelyn, Darius, Eugene, Elana and I were trapped in this room and these people wouldn't let us out and we were locked in. I was telling Calvin later. There was a flashback of some room. These people came in and were going to spray paint a cupboard. Then it was back to us and the door blew and had killed two people and we were laughing. We got out and it looked like West Whitehall Primary School. There was a hot dog stand and the sausages were in water."
"1508"	"(2007-08-30 (16)) Ezra was after me. I jumped from all these places out the back and I was at the pool. Ezra was asking Clayton where I was and Ezra caught up to me."
"1509"	"(2007-08-30 (16)) I was watching a movie and the executive producer was ""Clayton Kirney"". I was like ""That's like Clayton!""."
"1510"	"(2007-08-31 (16)) I was at school and it was period 4. I realized that I had no shoes on. Calvin and I went to a car and Genevieve came and they hugged for ages. Then he drove me home. When I got 'home', it was another class and Eugene, Jeremiah and Darius were there. So we decided to wag. I was thinking that I only had Biology next. I had a video camera and was leaving it on the desk, filming, aimed at Eugene. He put a chip on his nose and it got hot so he took it off. I had won some movie competition in October (it was November now) and I didn't know that I had. Jeremiah said to someone ""too bad"". Eugene had won this month. Then we were somewhere else. Mr Stevenson asked where we were period 4. He knew we wagged and we had suspension. Jemma was there. I moved seats and was a few rows behind Eugene and I couldn't perve properly."
"1511"	"(2007-08-31 (16)) Some director guy was walking down a street. There was a Festen St, and I was like ""I love Festen!"". He liked it too. There was a little rack of movies and he wanted Ichi the Killer. I went looking for it. There was a new Nintendo 64 and it was faster and would play all the old games. Dad was there and there was a bus."
"1512"	"(2007-09-01 (16)) I was at some place where some people had died before. It was haunted or something. First, we were sitting at desks. Eugene sat at the one next to me. Later, some girl and guy went into this plant place and she got taken by the plants, but he didn't see it."
"1513"	"(2007-09-01 (16)) I was at home and something happened to my room. My bed was at my window. Dad said that nineteen things had disappeared so if I saw anything weird I should tell him. I saw a gnome and some other things and Dad came and got them. Then he saw a hand in the air conditioner and the vents were closing. I asked if he wanted a torch but he said no and I said that it was a gay torch anyway."
"1514"	"(2007-09-01 (16)) I was at the Midvale shops. I scared some little kid and his mother. I had to get something about of this car. It was Michael Palin's car and he gave me the key and I could guess what each key was for. He had six kids and one was called Treasure. There was a grabbing machine and a weird kid was there. I said ""I want that one, it's cool"" and he said ""That's why I'm going for it"". He got it and gave it to me. Then I was in the car and there were lots of seats. Ezra was friends with these two black rappers. We went to Nana's. I lost my diary and Mom and I were looking for it. Poppa and Uncle Wilbur were there too. I found my diary in my own bag."
"1515"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) I was discussing something with someone. I said that Dreamcatcher had three hot guys in it (Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant and Thomas Jane), two especially."
"1516"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) There were vampires or zombies or something. I was hiding under a blanket peeking out the window. Granma and Uncle Gabriel were coming up an escalator. Granma was a vampire and Uncle Gabriel was a werewolf. Uncle Gabriel turned into a werewolf and then I did. We both climbed up this pole and he scratched me. I realized it was a dream and tried to get away. Then I was somewhere else. I wished for Eugene, but nothing happened. I went to a shop and I knew it was a dream, but I couldn't control it."
"1517"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) Dad picked a couple of things off my floor and then it was clean. I was relieved that I didn't have to do it now. I was thinking if it was that easy then I would've done it myself."
"1518"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) I had done some math thing in Year 9 that I'd forgotten about and I'd done it on SIDE. I had Biology, and I got a booklet about plants. I got this book out called 'Stomata'. Mathea would have a certain book out and then we would swap. Ms Olmstead was there."
"1519"	"(2007-09-05 (16)) I told Dad that I was an alien and he was really angry. Ezra and Dad started building a cage to keep me in."
"1520"	"(2007-09-05 (16)) Some others and I had powers. People were trying to kill us and we were at Mom's old house. I changed the stairs so the others couldn't come up. Later, other people came. I had a Band-Aid on my second finger on my right hand. I was planning my escape and imagining different scenarios. I pretended to jump off the balcony. Alejandro walked near where I was hiding and I ran out and jumped onto this platform and tried to get out of the door. The door was locked. Eugene was there too. He was talking to me and decided that I had no powers. This Chinese girl was hiding from some bad guys. There was this joker guy with powers and looked like Jay Kay. This guy was saying something about Jamiriquai, and Jay Kay wasn't in it. Someone said that his name was Jason Cheetham, and then someone said that Jamiriquai was someone else."
"1521"	"(2007-09-05 (16)) I was at a shop. Payton and Selena went to the toilet. Samantha asked where they were. Before, Ezra and I were talking and I said something funny. I heard a lady telling her son that he should go out with me. He reminded me of Daryl and I sat across from him at this long table."
"1522"	"(2007-09-06 (16)) I was at this library place. I was trying to decide what movie to watch. When I got home some of the movies were different. Mulholland Dr. was one of them. Calvin was around. I had this Little Britain DVD and Andy was on the front. We were going to watch something. Ezra had three dogs. Mom bought them all last week. I had known about the first one and I said that I wanted a dog and she said we'd go to the shop tomorrow, which was a Thursday. People were performing plays at this theater and we could perform ours in front of all these people. Evelyn sat next to me on this lounge and I was telling her about the dogs. Calvin sat down and Genevieve was trying to get him to leave."

"1528"	"(2007-09-08 (16)) I was watching this Fear Factor type of show and I wanted to do it (at home), so I did the next thing which was to eat some pig foot.

"1529"	"(2007-09-08 (16)) We were going to space. There was a little red bit floating in space that looked like fire, but it was actually some liquid which imploded."

"1531"	"(2007-09-09 (16)) I couldn't control myself and I ended up miles away. At one point I was driving a car and I was going everywhere and really fast. There was a tree with evil lizards. I ended up on this long road with forests on the side. I was walking along and I was naked, with a towel around me. This guy gave me food and clothes and let me sleep in his car for the night. He lived at some orphan place. When I got home I looked it up and I found 'David McDonald' (David Tennant) on there. The guy sent me a card."

"1535"	"(2007-09-10 (16)) I wrote a story which was Naked Lunch 2. Mom took me to Dad and I asked him to type it up for me. It was only 133 words (but not really). I was talking to David Lynch later, and I was going to tell him about it, but then remembered that it was David Cronenberg that did Naked Lunch. I almost tripped downstairs. I was thinking that it was my NaNoWriMo novel, but then I remembered that I was doing Battle Royale and it wasn't November."
"1536"	"(2007-09-10 (16)) I was at home. My bed was going out to the door. I had some old school stuff of Ezra's under my mattress. This thing he'd written said ""sad to leave school"". I was mouthing Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy for some reason. Ezra came to my room."

He ran and hid in his bedroom and I hid in another. I thought that it was Eugene's, but a sign said ""Goren"" and I realized that that was Darius's brother. I left the room when the dog wasn't in sight and ran to the room next to Rodney's, which was Eugene's. Then Rodney was Ezra and the room was made of pillows. They were 'turning' into strawberries. Later I was at school and Evelyn was around. I wanted to go to a house, but she didn't."
"1539"	"(2007-09-11 (16)) I was at school and was watching heaps of movie previews. I wrote something on this piece of paper. Later, mine and Eugene's were next to each other.

I said that something was gay and Eugene laughed."
"1540"	"(2007-09-11 (16)) Mom was a sort of haemophiliac. Next month I was maybe going to get my period and I told Samantha so she could ""come prepared"". This sprinkler came on and I said that would've been cool if 'we were in this one and you were a hot guy'."
"1541"	"(2007-09-12 (16)) I went back in time to when I was in pre-primary. I went back and was actually myself at that age. I still had my memory though. I was doing extremely well in all the work, even more so than I did the first time. I asked where people were on September 11, then remembered that hadn't happened yet. This teacher was going to make us read this book out one at a time. I hesitated and some other girl got made to do it first. Then I remembered it had happened before and I realized that stuff would stay the same even if I didn't do them, ie, I was worried about having to redo all of Runescape, but it was going to happen even without me playing. Evelyn was there and she wanted to talk on my mobile. I said they were banned and she said they weren't. I pulled it out and it was this big brick thing and I was saying how my real one was much smaller. I didn't let her use it. Someone was handing out work and Raquel was there. Some guy was called Eugene, but it was spelt ""Micheal"". I was then thinking about Eugene. It was then Year 8 and I was at Brookland. I saw Eugene and he was in the senior school uniform. He was talking to Autumn and Alejandro. Autumn jumped on Alejandro. This teacher told me to smile, as did these two guys. She said that was why I had no friends. I was doing really well at school."
"1542"	"(2007-09-12 (16)) Calvin was playing with Autumn somewhere."

"1545"	"(2007-09-13 (16)) I was at school. Rebekah and her whole family were dentists. Genevieve, Jemma and Rebekah were sitting near the PAC and we were sitting around from the Accounting classroom. They asked me to sit with them (they were joking). Calvin was sitting with me. I called Genevieve a ""stupid prostitute ho"". I was doing Biology work. I complained to them that they didn't have to study because they were doing the easy subjects. Later, I had a sore tooth, which had been sore for ages. Some teacher, who I think was Ms Solomon, was painting people's faces. The only dentist was Rebekah (she had dentist skill). She was saying something about a ""mass of breast"". A teacher said that I had to trust her. Then I was in a science classroom and we had a seating plan. Eugene was in the row next to me. They passed around a didgeridoo and Eugene liked it."
"1546"	"(2007-09-14 (16)) I was lining up for Intro Calc. Eugene and Darius were there. Some kid got scared of Darius because his arms were really hairy. Eugene had a Doctor Who like coat on and he looked really hot, so I got my phone out to take a photo, but Mr Haynes came. This girl was attached to the hip of her sister. The hosts came to our class."
"1547"	"(2007-09-14 (16)) We were leaving the school. I got to the car, but then Mom lagged and we ended up behind Eugene's car, but then a car appeared in front of us."
"1548"	"(2007-09-15 (16)) I was at school. I was walking and Evelyn was with me. We were near a fence near where we get dropped off. Some kids were making fun of Evelyn and then me. I turned to them and one said something and he had an accent (like in The Green Mile) and I was mocking him. Elijah was there and he thought it was funny. I asked Elijah if he was writing a book and if he had a plan. My book had to have Yvonne (Jessica Stevenson) in it. At lunch, Eugene was nearby. There was a video of Alejandro and he said ""I'm Alejandro, Nigee, Nejee, Nijiee""."
"1549"	"(2007-09-15 (16)) We were hiding somewhere. This person got killed. This guy went out to war with them. They caught us with this tracking device."
"1550"	"(2007-09-16 (16)) I was at this shop. I was a prisoner and I had to go with this cop. We were near an exit and when he turned away, I walked out. There was a guy in a car trying to get me. He got out and I jumped out and he did as well. I was half hanging out. He kept spraying some sleeping gas. This other guy tried to stop us, but he fell asleep. The guy spraying the gas got tired and I pushed him out of the car. I drove out and I was at the back of Nana's. The gate leading to the backyard was just a wall, so I ran to the normal back door. Nana greeted me and I said ""This is a boring dream"". Nana was like ""huh?"" and I thought 'Oh, I must've woken up'. Something happened and I had to call these people. I had to rewrite their numbers and I asked for the piece of paper. Eugene's number was on the list and I was like 'yay'. Samantha was there. That Acquaintance-M-05 guy gave me a typewriter. I was at the front of Nana's. Calvin was there. The geese came and I jumped over the fence. Calvin did a flip over. This girl got hit by a truck. I was talking to her father about religion and he was religious."
"1551"	"(2007-09-16 (16)) I was at a place that looked like home. There was a lake thing. Poppa was there. I tried to escape. Later, we had trouble turning off these lights. Eugene was there and he sounded different. They'd gotten rid of some trees on Runescape and Eugene was trying to follow me."
"1552"	"(2007-09-16 (16)) I saw kittens in the pond and I got them out just in time. It had happened once before, except the other kittens had died."
"1553"	"(2007-09-17 (16)) I was 'testing' out a job. It was some teacher/office thing. Basically, I did nothing and checked on this pile every so often for new stuff and then leave. I found it boring. This kid was called Wiley Wave, but was sometimes called Wiley Wiggins. I was about to write his address on his work. I found work of Hermione's (Harry Potter) and she had gotten 8/9. Mom drove to this fancy neighbourhood to meet a friend called Fat Tony or something. The house she went to had no furniture and there were lots of windows."
"1554"	"(2007-09-17 (16)) I was discussing how the cats out the back had had lots of kittens. We talked about Tigger, Tinkerbell and Diabla. Ezra was there. We were talking about how I was the only one who could remember all their names."
"1555"	"(2007-09-17 (16)) I was giving Mittens a bath and brushing her. She was staying still and I was surprised."
"1556"	"(2007-09-18 (16)) I was in a car with Silas. We went to this shop. People from West Whitehall Primary School and stuff were there. Kaia and Tiana and some others from Whitehall High School were there. Kaia was saying about me ""Oh my God, you're so cute!"" and telling Tiana she shouldn't have ditched me. I screamed and was trying to close my door. I saw Daryl around and I hadn't seen him in a year. There was a photo of him with dreadlocks. I saw this guy and I thought he was Gavin, but he was Co-Worker-M-02 or Acquaintance-M-06. This other guy looked like Terrence. I went to the movies with Mom and Ezra. Ezra sat with Mom in this big comfy chair. I had to look around for ages to find somewhere to sit and I sat next to some woman. She put her bag on my seat. Some girl sat next to me."
"1557"	"(2007-09-18 (16)) I was watching Gilligan's Island. The professor and Gilligan were there (obviously). This old lady was making a car and making some water purification thing. They needed to water some flowers for some game. I downloaded all the episodes of the latest season of Lost, then got rid of them. I had heaps of torrents going."
"1558"	"(2007-09-18 (16)) I wanted to watch a movie and opted on Pet Sematary. Dad checked outside and then I did. I got locked out. He complained because he just went out there."
"1559"	"(2007-09-19 (16)) Mom dropped me off on Casserley Ave a few houses from Eugene's, on the other side of the road. I started walking and heard Eugene and Rodney leaving the house. I realized I'd forgotten my jumper and it was on the top of the car. I grabbed it. They got in their car and I was walking in front of them. I was worried about Eugene seeing my 'fat'. Then they passed me, but they were on bikes. Eugene turned around and looked at me. He turned back but then looked at me again and almost fell off his bike. I was then at school. I went to the toilets and then left and was walking home."
"1560"	"(2007-09-19 (16)) I was watching a movie. Madonna and Bill Pullman were in it. Calvin was there. I was reading a review and Bill was giving a speech. It reminded me of something and I was deeply upset. Samantha and Payton were then around. I was playing Sims 2. I had some mod and you put your finger in pink goo, but it wasn't working."
"1561"	"(2007-09-19 (16)) I was at a computer shop with Dad. He was like ""Why not get a new computer"". I said ""Yeah, but I like my stuff"". I also didn't want Vista."
"1562"	"(2007-09-20 (16)) I was at home. I was at the garage door and it wouldn't close and lock. Mom was trying to close it. I found some old school photos (it was next year) and I was saving them. Ezra and Evelyn were in the school photos. Granny and Uncle Wilbur were in the family room. There were photos of them and Uncle Wilbur couldn't move properly. Granny said something happened somewhere and so I went to the laundry. Then it was just Mom and I in the house. There were two black guys and they had broken the metal pipe in the door. I was trying to keep the door closed. I was trying to call Mom and the police. Then they were people from school. Alejandro and Jeremiah were there. I ended up with a weapon and was hitting them. Alejandro had his leg through a piece of wood which had FancyFire on it. Someone was chopping something. I said ""I'm surprised at you Alejandro! Why are you here?"" and he was like ""Huh? Why are you surprised at me?!"". Jeremiah asked why too. I said ""Both of you are so nice, I don't know why you're doing this!""."
"1563"	"(2007-09-20 (16)) I was at home. Ezra and I were there alone. People were trying to break in. I was going to watch Campfire Tales but I didn't."
"1564"	"(2007-09-20 (16)) I was at 'school'. I asked this girl for a muffin and she gave one to Calvin, but not to me. I offered $5 and then she gave me heaps. I was looking for this nice thing I'd tasted before and it tasted like Venetian ice-cream, but nicer and sweeter. There was a weird banana thing. Samantha was there, cooking. Ms Powell was there and I asked her for the recipe. She said ""What are you going to do with the recipe?"" and I was like ""Uh... make them?"". This girl said her name was Hermione Granger."
"1565"	"(2007-09-21 (16)) We were messing around with water. We made this whirlpool thing and also this big puddle and we took a photo of it. Ezra was there. Then we were somewhere else. We made a big pool size whirlpool thing and the whirlpool took longer to disappear. Every time someone swam in it, they were sucked to the middle. Mr Haynes let me have my phone. Ezra took it and I said ""Don't open it!"" because I had that morphed picture of Eugene on there. Samantha went for a swim. I left, but when I came back she didn't answer me and I was thinking 'she better not be dead'. She was. She was floating upside down. I got her out and she had this mask thing on and I couldn't get it off. I blew into this phone, which blew through a hole into her mouth and was doing CPR. She started breathing but didn't wake up. I was thinking of the '101...' books and that I'd now saved a life. I was telling Mom later in the car and she was laughing. There were Indians and they were doing some Christmas thing and Christmas was on December 20th. Days later, I was on MySpace and there were all these RIP things on Samantha's MySpace. There were photos of Selena. Then it was Tiana who had died. Kaia and Classmate-F-02 had commented and there was stuff about Audrey Tautou and Ms Solomon. Samantha had a post that said that Elijah liked to be Elizabeth for The Crucible play. She asked how many kids he gave himself."
"1566"	"(2007-09-22 (16)) I had Biology, except it was in a shop. Ms Olmstead showed me the yearbook so far and I was going to ask for the photos, but I didn't. I was trying to find Eugene, but the only person that I found that I knew was Classmate-M-29. I took a lollipop and Evelyn said ""You just took a lollipop"" and I said ""No, I didn't"". She said that I did and I said that I don't eat lollipops. I tried to get rid of her by running around this shop but she kept following me. It was hard for me to run. I was pulling stuff from the shelves and throwing it behind me to make it harder for her. There was a shop exhibit thing that gave you extra flowers and I asked for extra chocolates. I hid on it, but she found me and I jumped off. I found this little car which was pretty fast. Mika was bouncing around on this ball and was singing Love Today. We ditched the ball and were hiding in sports equipment. Mika kept singing and I was hiding underneath him. I was telling him to be quiet and that ""she'll hear you"" and told him to hide with me so she didn't see me."
"1567"	"(2007-09-22 (16)) I was at school. Calvin was around. Eugene and I were going to the homework centre. I called Mom and this girl nearby said ""Why do you have to call? That's so gay"". I thought I saw Dad's car. I went to the library but we didn't have our library cards. I was thinking 'that's why you should give us a new one every year'. They gave me a new one and I didn't need the permission form to stay."
"1568"	"(2007-09-23 (16)) Ezra and I were watching Evil Dead 2. Bruce Campbell wasn't in it. I was telling Ezra it wasn't the pencil one. He wanted to do an essay on it. I said to use an ""independent drama"". Then we were in this spooky house and there was a creepy thing at the door."
"1569"	"(2007-09-23 (16)) I was somewhere and the school was there too. There were two evil people, but one was actually good. Their master had gone crazy and there were two options: let him destroy the world or kill him. They lost their power. They were running through a forest and they had a force field around it, but then it was gone. It was dark and weird at the front of the place. The people across the street couldn't see us. I was in this room and I was climbing up these stairs, but these evil people were coming so I hid behind this shelf. They came and the not-evil one came too. The good one saw me and tried not to let the evil people see. My hand was visible to them. An evil one saw it and said ""Here kitty, kitty, kitty"" and I knocked them out and ran. We were then sitting on these steps. Silas was sitting close to me and I was like 'ew, get away'. This guy pulled on my bag and I let myself fall backwards and kicked him in the head. Harlan was being gay. This guy looked like James Spader. A friend of Ezra's was sitting nearby. Dad picked us up. Ezra went in the front. It was my turn in front and I had my iPod."
"1570"	"(2007-09-23 (16)) Mom was going to make me go on a date. She decided she would take me instead. I asked her where we were going and she said ""Actually, we'll get food at home"" and I asked what food and she said pizza. I told her to take me home. She did. Dad was there. There were tapes of top music. There were some dogs somewhere and one couldn't walk."
"1571"	"(2007-09-25 (16)) I was discussing movies with Ezra. He had seen Faust and he was telling me about a movie and I said it sounded like a Stanley Kubrick movie. I was saying how I liked David Lynch and David Cronenberg too."
"1572"	"(2007-09-26 (16)) Ezra, Mom and I were at this place which was a sort of train station platform. There was water in the place where tracks would have been and it was green. I fell in, but got out. Uncle Gabriel was there too at one stage. I had some sort of disease-y type thing like vertigo. I was telling someone that I got it after watching Vertigo. Clayton was then there and we ended up at 'school'. Then we were at the platform again and the water was gone. I accidentally left my bag down there and I went to get it. There were puddles of water still there which was this green stuff. It was like poison ivy. There was a place where you slide into water. Mom and I were there. Then it was a spa and a pool. You could change it to different water. Isabel was there. Calvin was in the spa. He said ""someone actually likes Jared Leto"". He said he was going to call him Corbin. My leg kept going 'behind' me. There was a strange video of this fat girl's friend's mother."
"1573"	"(2007-09-26 (16)) I was watching a movie. This detective was asking Mary Warren (The Crucible, book) where someone was. Then it was me. She told him she didn't know. But then she said it was an accident. He was dead upstairs. We were in a barn and we went upstairs. He got up and it was Steven Weber and he was naked. She asked if he was gay and he said no and she said ""yes you are"" and he said ok, whatever (he was actually bisexual). She asked me if I thought that was hot and I said yes."
"1574"	"(2007-09-26 (16)) I was watching a movie with Jake Gyllenhaal. Someone was saying that Heath Ledger's character in Brokeback Mountain loved hearing Jack Twist. There was a video of how he liked hearing his name and what he was doing, not just him talking. I was like 'I really want to read that book!'."
"1575"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) I was at school doing some work and Kirsten had to use some of mine."
"1576"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) I was at home with some friend. The pool was ok to swim in, but was green. I went in but my friend was hesitant. The sun came out and then the pool was clear. Ezra was in the spa. This dog was barking at me and someone suggested it was because I took its favourite song from the shed."
"1577"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) Mom picked up a friend and drove around this place to drop him off. Somehow we ended up walking and I went with the guy. Mom found me and complained. She had a police badge for me."
"1578"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) I was watching a show where this guy found his boyfriend cheating on him with a girl. At the end they were all standing together. The guys went off and had sex in an alley. I then felt like watching Brokeback Mountain."
"1579"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) Someone called me and at first it sounded like a robot, then like a transvestite and then like Autumn. It was Autumn, but I couldn't hear her properly. The next day she came up to me and she was having a party and she wanted me to come. Later, some girls asked me to be part of a robbery. At some point, Eugene and I were making out. Later, I was waiting to get picked up. I was standing with Darius and Eugene. Eugene and I were messing around, then Mom came. Roland and Clayton were in the back and Roland was in my seat. Ezra was in the front. Roland moved. I looked out the back window. Eugene looked at me and I waved and he waved back. Mom thought that I was acting weird."
"1580"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I went home and Mom and Ezra were with me. Mom had cleaned my room and I was angry about it. The vacuum had picked up chicken? I locked up to leave and Mom was saying that I should leave it unlocked because Dad was inside. I went back in and he had cheese and crackers. He said he had to explain about them at something he was going to."
"1581"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I was in my room and I had a photo of Eugene, on the bus, on my wall. Ezra came in and he was asking who it was and being annoying."
"1582"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I had a dream with Michael Cera, but I don't remember it now."
"1583"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) Samantha, Calvin, Evelyn and I were trying to get a photo for Attack of the Clouds. We were told to look worried. There was a picnic blanket and Fang was there, standing to the side. Evelyn said ""Ewan"", but she meant Obi Wan. These guys were teasing her. Melodie was there. There was a game with these houses and you had to get a fishing rod off some dude to pull the curtain up. There were other people you had to meet. Spaceman was around hanging with me. Mom was there too. Samantha went to a shop. There was a diary and Melodie and someone were crying because they thought that Samantha had done something. Samantha was setting up stuff for filming of Arrested Development. Some guy was upset."
"1584"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I was looking up stuff about Michael Cera. There were photos of him playing tennis and he had rings on his second finger and pinky. I grimaced and was like 'Damn it! The worst fingers!'. I was annoyed because he was choosing to wear it, not because he had to for a role or something."
"1585"	"(2007-09-29 (16)) I was at a beach. The waves were really big and the water was coming close. We were walking back to the car."
"1586"	"(2007-09-29 (16)) I was at a shop. Ezra got some Monopoly game. He wanted this other game originally, but he couldn't find it. I went to the games section and they had Super Mario. I then went to the chocolate section. I was on a high chair which you used to get to unreachable chocolates. I was lying in the clothes section watching a lady going through the clothes."
"1587"	"(2007-09-30 (16)) Ezra and a friend went to Dad's old work (except he still worked there) to try out some hacking skills. I wandered off and then someone caught them and we all left. Later, Dad was asking us what was going on. I said I didn't know what they were doing and Ezra came and said that I wasn't a part of it."
"1588"	"(2007-09-30 (16)) I was at some house. The lady made pumpkin soup. Gob (Arrested Development) was there and we were friends. He had said that no-one would say no him and also that no dogs (or females, I kept forgetting during the dream) would follow him or something. Later, a dog started following me. I went into this bedroom and closed the door, then closed this other door. Then later, Gob and I were in this bathroom. It was huge and basically the whole room was a shower. Some girl was going to have a bath or a shower. We were running the water and I lay down to make sure she wasn't going to drown and she came in and told us off. After getting in the water, she said she liked the bath. Later, Gob and I were having sex in someone's bedroom, and it was my first time. Then it was a guy and a girl and she screamed and the house shook. He had to jump out the window so he didn't get caught. Gob and Buster (Arrested Development) were outside. I was thinking 'magician'. I was pregnant and was thinking that Eugene was the father."
"1589"	"(2007-10-01 (16)) I took some drugs as an experiment. Everything went colourful and weird, which reminded me of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (even though I haven't read it or seen it). I had some weird dreams, but they were cool. I think the drug was 'Teamocil'."
"1590"	"(2007-10-01 (16)) Some kid ran off. He was wanted by people. They mixed him up with an African. Mom was there looking for him."
"1591"	"(2007-10-01 (16)) I created this hybrid person which went evil. Calvin and I were hiding in this weird mushroom-like house. The hybrid was at the door and some curtain was open, but if he went to close it, it would see us through the door. Its eyes were blind looking."
"1592"	"(2007-10-02 (16)) I was at school and I was on the oval playing golf. Some Asian kid gave me a snake. I had decided to be a magician. I was talking to Mom, saying how a character in Arrested Development was a magician, and was thinking about Gob with the pennies. She was on a computer. I was watching something and The Final Countdown started playing and I said that it plays when Gob does a trick."
"1593"	"(2007-10-02 (16)) I was making that Nesquik cereal. It was ready but the milk was out of date. I was asking Mom to check if they were ok and was calling out the dates. Ezra was there too."
"1594"	"(2007-10-03 (16)) George-Michael and Maeby (both Arrested Development) were flirting. George-Michael was playing a weird game and was up to the boss at the end. This guy was chained up with him and his head was 'inverted'. Someone called up some movie guy and invited him to a party. Earlier, someone had died. They were a dog, but not. Lucille (Arrested Development)/my Mom cried. I saw Eugene's head (like in the Year 8 photo) rolling and birds were eating it. Mom was in a kitchen? Lindsay (Arrested Development)/Samantha hid behind something. There were two Maeby's. Ms Solomon was somewhere. Ezra was eating the shirt he was wearing."
"1595"	"(2007-10-03 (16)) Dad and Ezra were going to watch Arrested Development. I was saying ""Michael"" in Gob's voice and when I walked off I was saying ""Come on!""."
"1596"	"(2007-10-03 (16)) I was with Dad, Ezra and Will Arnett. We were lost near a forest somewhere and we were walking. I think it was Will's fault we were there. My legs were really hairy and I said ""I look like a bear!"". We hadn't had a shower for a week or something. We finally found civilization. We went into this shop. Will went off to find us somewhere to stay. This person asked me to design a website for them and they had a cool look already. Then we were somewhere else near a toilet. I went to the toilet and there was a head on the door and I was thinking of High Tension. Will was back and I sat next to him. We were eating cereal. Then he was across from me. There was a skull symbol on the cereal box. I was humming The Final Countdown. Then Jason Bateman was there too. I was reading the cereal box and it had killed a bunch of babies."
"1597"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I was watching Room 401. This guy was at a castle and something was coming out of the TV and he was touching it."
"1598"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I was watching Queer as Folk US. It wasn't a real episode, but I had seen it before in the dream. I was watching it again and I said the ""one with the painter"". I remember seeing Scott Lowell and Hal Sparks. Scott Lowell and I were going to get married."
"1599"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) Venus was supposedly going to die tonight at about 9 or 10pm and fall into Earth. Dad and Ezra went to the movies. There were these fairy things underground and they had something to do with it. Two years earlier, I managed to save them all, last year I saved some of them. This year, I didn't bother doing anything. I was hiding underneath something in the games room. Dad and Ezra were hiding under a table in the family room. People came in and found and shot Dad and Ezra, then they found me and shot me and we all died. Somehow, I remembered this and so was locking the doors and windows and turned off the lights. I checked on the fairies but they wouldn't answer. I went out the front and Ezra and Dad were coming back. These two old dudes were with them. They were like ""What's it supposed to be?"". Dad said a meteorite and he figured that nothing was going to happen, saying something about how you tell people about meteorites and they freak out. Then I saw it racing across the sky and it sounded like something was burning. Someone asked what it was and then ""Oh, it's the planet"". Then it came towards us and it was getting bigger. I was thinking of Eugene and that I should have told Calvin that I liked Eugene. An image of Eugene, which was orange, was 'etched' as I died (and I also woke up)."
"1600"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I 'fell' into my dream and I did a reality check which worked. I got excited and did it again. The room came into view and I wished for Eugene. He appeared and I was like 'What do I do now?' and then I grabbed him and we started making out."
"1601"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I was at Midvale High School, which was completely different. Tiana was there and I started walking home and I thought I would call Mom to get me instead, but I didn't. I realized that I forgot my bag. Liza Minnelli was there and she went and got it for me. My bag looked a chicken. I was talking to her and she lived in my country. She was friends with Nana. I asked why she was working at Midvale. She had this teacher form and we had to pick what we thought the teacher was like. 'Giddy' was there and I said ""Well, I'll tick that since I was watching Arrested Development yesterday""."
"1602"	"(2007-10-05 (16)) I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. I was about to tell Dad a story about Gob (Arrested Development), when Will Arnett and Amy Poehler walked past. I was like 'what the hell?'. I had a newspaper and it had an Arrested Development crossword. I told Dad about Will and how I wanted to get a photo taken with him and he told me to ask him, but I couldn't. Then Jason Bateman walked past. Dad and Ezra went somewhere. I went into a little shop. Michael Cera came in and he said hello to me. He kept looking at me and talking to me and was acting nervous. I was trying not to walk off so I could talk to him. We ended up following each other. We were then sitting on lounges. Jason Bateman came past with some others and joked to each other that I was his girlfriend. His parents came and they were black and were also very strict. We were sitting on separate lounges, but his mother thought we were too close. Portia de Rossi came past and asked Michael something and left. Jason came past again and Michael said to ask (for a photo or whatever) and I said I can't. Then he got up and told David Cross that I wanted to get a photo, but his parents called him back. David was really funny and let me take a photo and stuff. I text Dad to ask if we could stay but I realized I had no credit and a low battery. Mom picked me up and Michael wanted to go with me, but she had the pickup."
"1603"	"(2007-10-05 (16)) I was at a house. The whole Arrested Development family was there. Gob was upset because he found out that he had a daughter. Someone had twin boys. There was a boat in a pool. I wanted to hang with George-Michael, so I went into the lounge (where he and Maeby were) and said that I couldn't sleep. It was only 6pm. The TV said it was midnight. My Name is Earl was on and Jason Lee was doing something. Maeby asked about some guitar show."
"1604"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) I was at a shop at a photo place near a pool table with the songs I'd done in 2003. These black guys were joking around and asked if I was one of ""those people who play Mp3's nearby people to look cool?"". There was a photo of our family at the photo place and I was in nappies, but Ezra wasn't. Later, Weird Al Yankovic and I were talking. David Cross was there and he lifted up his shirt. Weird Al asked if we liked 'green'. I wanted to change my background on the computer back to Arrested Development. There was a sleep lab and I told Mom I wanted to work with one. Samantha and Payton were in there. Later, she and Seamus were in the boot of a car having sex. Samantha became interested in Dad. I was at home and there was some chicken there and no-one had told me that food was ready."
"1605"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) Some lady gave Dad $40k to download Heroes and the rest of the shows we watch. When I came out I was annoyed at this. I had to crawl under these things in a garage that Poppa was in and I kept getting stuck. Fido was there."
"1606"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) I was watching Arrested Development, except it was set at home. Oscar Bluth, except he was called something else, came over. I couldn't remember which one was the 'real' one. He wanted to play some game on the computer. I then remembered George Bluth was the proper one and I said no. Then I was Lucille. George Bluth came back and saw that Lucille and Oscar Bluth had had sex and Lucille was saying to someone that Oscar Bluth was much nicer."
"1607"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) We had some map which detailed the path that the Easter was going to take. Jason Bateman jumped into this pool. Tony Hale was on some toy in the pool and Jason wanted to go on it. The guy 'playing' the Easter looked like Ben Whishaw."
"1608"	"(2007-10-07 (16)) Calvin and I went to some movie awards thing. First it was Dad and I, then Calvin, then a time traveling guy. He 'time traveled' with his clothes but couldn't bring anything else. When I first met him I wondered why he had no luggage. There was a guy and a girl behind the counter at the movie place and they were mean. They gave me a sheet to fill out stuff about the movies. Some teacher lady gave Samantha a tablet, so I asked for one."

I managed to get a blue one. Samantha kept trying to pop it. Later, she was asking herself when she had art and I said that she had it next. I was then on this oval place and Mr Reilly was there. There was a little electric fence and I walked over it. I went to class and Amazing started playing and I realized it was coming from my iPod. Someone said ""Who was that?"" and I said ""Oh it was my iPod"". Eugene was in the class."
"1610"	"(2007-10-07 (16)) I was rebuilding a set with Henry (The Time Traveler's Wife -- book). We were going out. We were doing something with this ledge that was falling apart.

"1611"	"(2007-10-08 (16)) We were at a shop. I got a little Twix and had ""thirteen bites, two to go"", when Ezra took it. They had some mix bag and there was a Yowie in there and a tube, which looked like toothpaste but it said it was Panadol and was empty (it was curled up). I was then at home watching TV. I went to AirActive, but it looked different. I was watching some movie thing. There were four black guys and they all had short hair. One was called Shorty and was Marlon Wayans. Shawn Wayans was there too. I said ""just call them all Shorty!"". There was a house on a raft-like thing and the people on that fell off the house and died. The others were hanging off."

The lady asked a question and I wasn't listening because I was getting the sheets so she told me to move away from Calvin. Today's task was the same as yesterday. The guy next to me was annoying me and he found out that I didn't like being a girl so continued to annoy me. Calvin started singing a song and I was laughing and everyone was looking at him. When the class finished Calvin hung around for a while. Somehow me and the annoying guy ended up at a motel and had sex. When we first arrived there, I was thinking that I'd lost my virginity already to Michael Cera. The next day, we were there again. Calvin was closing these blinds and some girls were complaining. The annoying guy was making out with some girl."
"1614"	"(2007-10-09 (16)) I was at Nana's. Someone had a baby. I went to bed. Ezra was in my bed there and I didn't remember him coming up. The beds were different. He woke up and said that Mom had dropped him off. The next morning we were packing our stuff away (we had a lot) and the bag was heavy. Ezra had a made-up friend called Brendan and he was dropped off to stay, but he was three years younger than he was last time we saw him. Dad was annoyed. There was this house which was on a car or something; it moved around."

All the shop went blue and the devil thing had a gigantic tongue."

Sometimes it was water, sometimes lava, sometimes there was nothing there. The lava was actually milk with some food on top. Earlier there had been a train ride and it would go over the walls and all. It was pretty scary. Mom went on too. I saw a poster for The Kingdom and it had Jason Bateman on it."
"1618"	"(2007-10-10 (16)) I was watching a movie with Jason Bateman. Michael Cera was his son. There was a flashback and Michael Cera's character was being played by a fat kid using a phone at this building. Then these people, on woman and the rest men, shot a lady in the face, killed some cops etc. They went to this cop place and there was a lady in there and cops in a car outside. The cops outside managed to survive and tried to tell the lady inside to get out. The people came into her room and she jumped out the window. They killed her. Buster (Arrested Development) came in with stuff for his mother (the woman they just killed). He didn't notice anything wrong, which they noticed. For some reason, they gave him a bag of this brown stuff which was actually cocaine. Then it was real life and I had the cocaine. I tasted it and my tongue felt funny. My heart started beating faster and I felt funny. Later, Ezra woke me up to ask something about my web site. Dad asked me ""Have you tried the brown stuff?"" and I said no."

Jason Lee was put in there too and he was really quiet. Some ten year old girl, who was the daughter of the camp runner, was put next to Alan Rickman, who was actually Josh Duhamel. He had to give her a kiss and said something about himself that was like ""Godfather or secretary"". There were cabins. Will Arnett was in one. In the one I was in, Farrah, Jamison and Ariana were in bunk beds. I was locking it up. Will got shot and I was talking to Ezra on MSN. The font kept going stretchy and unreadable."

The pig wasn't breathing and Mom gave it CPR."
"1629"	"(2007-10-13 (16)) Dad, Ezra, Payton and I went to this restaurant/stripper place. It was full of half-naked guys and I was like 'ew'.

Then Mom came in and wouldn't let me close the door. She put a baby in and then I was going to kill it. I punched some kid after he punched me. Later, people were climbing up the walls to get into my room. I was pulling them down. There were lots and I grabbed a girl and she fell and hit her head so I did that to the others. Then I gave up. Later I was at some school thing. Ramona gave me a card we needed. People had sheets that they'd printed from my site. Mathias was there and he had a picture and a cartoon.

Eventually I yelled at the people and told them to leave me alone and come back another day. They went. Then my room was a motel room. I looked outside and saw that the people had been cops. Someone else then tried to get in and they were bad guys. I screamed and tried to get the cops attention. I managed to open the door and ran past this little white guy (the rest were black). They started coming after me and I was jumping down these stairs. I met with this girl who I followed into her motel room. It was discovered that I could change other people's appearance. There was a cat outside and it hissed so we decided to run, but the people came. It was just a friend of hers, but it was actually a bad guy who had disguised herself. I was changing people. One girl ended up pink and slimy. I accidentally changed this guy to a big, muscly guy and then I changed him into a hunchback, which was permanent. The girl (who was called Renee) said that Ezra, Dad and I needed to leave because they would come. I was telling Mom. This guy was disguised as Ezra's friend. We poked him in the gut? Before we left Ezra and I were playing Pokemon."

I had to find a piece of paper. Snoopy was in there. The outside of the room was glass and had this thing you could lift and go in. Later a cat was sticking its head out. Mom and Ezra distracted Snoopy and I let the dogs and cats out of the room. The room was messy and my pen broke and I so did my torch. I fixed them. Mom and a friend were at a table later.

Her mother came and we moved again. Something happened to the movie and it skipped to the end. People in astronaut like suits came in and they shut the doors. We thought that they were going to gas us. They had to give us something so we could breathe. Then we had to line up in order of last name. Mariana was there. I saw Eugene.

We had met one of them before when we were little because the Dad had two brothers. One of them was called Eddie and he was really hot. The mother was a cow. They had had two more sons. One kid was gay and he and Ezra were playing. They had a parrot and it kept saying stuff about Darius and I was thinking of Evelyn. There was a DVD of Aeonflux on the floor and Charlize Theron was on the cover."
"1681"	"(2007-11-07 (16)) It was Wednesday and I got to school and I didn't have my school clothes on. I went to the toilet to change. These two ladies were standing outside the toilet.

Poppa was talking about a choice of a car or $200k and something else."

I tried to read a magnet on the fridge, which had different ones to call, but I could read it. It was suddenly black outside. The kitchen light wouldn't turn on. I did a reality check and 'woke up' but then went back to the dream. The cops came and then left. These girls came in to party and I made them get out. They tried to steal some sauces. The window started breaking and I had to keep checking the doors were locked. Mom 'stole' these cars, which were long oil-ish trucks. She went to a food shop. This lady came and she was a bad guy. She could see the future in one of her eyes. Someone threw little rocks at Ezra. One hit the window but it didn't break. We stole a truck and I moved the second one and parked it well.

Then this old lady came and walked fast and the lady said that the guy was first and she said ""you didn't say till when"". She let the old guy in and then he died. I don't remember what happened in the other book. Then I was in some class. Dmitri and others were reading comic books. I was doing something with batteries and magnets. Mr Stevenson dropped some Yu-Gi-Oh! comics on my desk and told me to read them."

Ezra picked up a black one. Nana and I went to this garage looking shop to look for the dog. We had to be quiet, but the guy saw us. Nana quickly said ""pound of eyes please"". He thought I was acting weird. He farted and walked out. Then he came and he was holding a pig (which was my 'dog') and he was going to kill it and I screamed ""No!"" and went after him, crying. Then it was somewhere in England. It was showing the Thames, except it was called 'Ems'. Granma was telling me how to pronounce it. This guy was driving next to it and the road was slippery and he fell into the water. There were shoes in the river and people were calling them out. This Scottish guy was hanging over a cliff and this cop let him fall and he cried out ""You ooter bastard!""."

"1697"	"(2007-11-11 (16)) I was at a place that looked like school. We were at the front of the school next to the carpark. I was being held captive along with a bunch of guys. One was really hot, but he got killed escaping. We were given dinner on this long table and there was lots of food. There was a skinny Asian and a skinny guy there. I suggested that they [our captives] were going to eat us because the rest of us were 'chunky'. The people holding us were actually aliens (they looked like a slimy version of the rhino in season three, episode one of Doctor Who). I said if the skinny one was called out, then they were eating us. They got called. One of the skinny ones escaped and was on a train, but the aliens came. Then it was a game and this guy was running along the side of the train and he had to jump on this ledge and get on the train. Mittens was somewhere and I said ""How am I going to eat you?"".

These robot things which held up the Earth had gotten angry and were messing things up. Michael Cera was in this shop. This girl went out with this guy and she took photos of all these people and put them in this book. A rocket was leaving Earth's atmosphere. I left my room and went to Dad's room. Ezra was there.

"1702"	"(2007-11-14 (16)) This person was doing an experiment in this building which was a school, I think. I can't remember what they wanted to do, but they accidentally used a student rather than a random.

I went to class and Eugene came. I had Biology, but it was Chemistry. Ms Quintana was the teacher and her hair was all frizzy and she was sick. She marked me absent because I wasn't there earlier. I tried to say that I was here. Mr Reilly was away because he was sick. I sat at the back. The door was at the back left and there were three rows of tables going back from the front (two lots). I sat at the back right table."

Dad said that ""one wants to have sex with you"" and I was like ""What the hell? Ew!"". The photos didn't show anything except ""two and a half"" showed my bum. In the morning I told Mom in the car on the way on to school. I was crying and I said they should have more respect. Mom was like ""Oh, now you're crying"" and stuck up for them.

Inside the house, this kid was carrying things with leaves because he was being controlled. In real life, Tigger was being controlled."

They were Return of the Living Dead zombies and I was hiding out in the science room, which was different, with Evelyn and Calvin. We got attacked a few times and killed the zombies. I went out to find weapons and I found pipes in some mud. I found Eugene and Darius and others and told them to go to the science room.

I was feeling proud of Eugene. I was near Ms Pascal's office and looking at the board, which had a bunch of photos on it. They had Eugene and I wanted them. I was in two of the photos, but one of them had a hole where my face would be and the other had a pin in it. I was about to take them when I saw Ms Pascal staring at me from the top of the stairs with a weird look on her face. She came down and I said that I love photos. She said ""obviously you like someone in them"". There was a picture of the country with black kids there too."

He was wearing sandals and I was checking the Morton's toe thing. He had normal feet and I was thinking 'Yay, Eugene's probably got normal feet'. Another day, his mother was teaching except her name was Ms Carniapolous or something. She was fat and mean. Mom was there and she didn't like her either. She also had normal feet."

I was saying how one guy (Eugene) got A's in all subjects, another (Darius) got almost all A's, another (Jeremiah) got A's, B's, C's and a D. And I had no clue about another (Bradley) because he never says anything."
"1749"	"(2007-12-01 (16)) These two guys were walking away and these two other guys walked the other way and said something to them. They realized they had had sex with them. One of them looked like Ryan Merriman. The two guys went to the shop and were getting stuff plus something to do with sex and they were embarrassed about it. They were looking at stuff and I mouthed to the store guy ""call out"" so he did. I was looking at the ice-cream and most of the tubs had lids off."

Then we also had a pig, which was sometimes a dog. She said it was pregnant with lots of males. Then it was a place to test for something like powers. This black girl had a necklace like the one in The Blob [I watched that part last night] and she was on a date with this guy when the blob attacked her. She was all stretched out and torn apart but she was alive and had lost the necklace."
"1752"	"(2007-12-02 (16)) I was at Nana's talking to her. I was thinking about her fainting the other day. Ezra was watching TV. I had my period and I went to the drawer in the laundry. I saw Poppers outside with his hat on the table. I got a pad and went to the bathroom to put it on. Later, Nana went into the bathroom and I followed her and was worried that I'd left the wrapper on the bench, but I think it was in my pocket."
"1753"	"(2007-12-02 (16)) Dad went to this old petrol station. It was really rundown but the trucks there were this new and bright red. As we left, we went past this place and I said ""Hey, I've been here before with Ezra and Jayson!"". It was from the dream I'd had on the 14/12/06."

Mom came that morning and straightened my hair. Dad was asleep and I woke him up and said that I had school. He took me to Midvale High School. Ezra was there and he told me Dad was checking to make sure I didn't wag. The toilets were at the top of this big building, which didn't have walls and had a lot of stairs. There were lots of people lining up for both, though the male's line was longer, and there were people lining up way down the bottom of the building. I saw Dad's car. I said to Ezra ""Why are we at this school?"". Ezra had gone here before Brookland too. Kaitlyn was there and she looked like Kristin Kreuk. These two Asian brothers were around and one had blue hair and the other had purple hair."

I was in a train along with some others and we were trying to kill someone outside the train. There was a place with water. They were going to hide in it but decided against it. Later I was at home out the back. Eugene had adopted this kitten and called it Clifford. Sometimes Eugene was Hal Sparks. I said ""Clifford? Like that big red thing?"" and then said it was a stupid name. I was looking at some papers from years ago. I found one that said I was going to adopt this girl called Cleffa as a school project thing. The back door was twisted later and I got Dad to fix it."
"1759"	"(2007-12-03 (16)) I was reading something about dreams. A question was something about a ""tanned Eugene"" and I was like ""What the hell?"". The answer said they needed ""a Eugene"" to answer properly."

People brought in these books and it said something about ""physics mark"" on the front. Eugene was there, as were Elijah and Autumn. I had the Intro Calc book without the cover. Autumn wanted to look so I sat next to her. I was also eating cereal and had my laptop. I was listening to Shake the Disease. Autumn said she loved Queen, and I said I didn't have much Queen stuff on my laptop and that I had all the albums on my computer but it died. This book had stuff about the sun and the core. There were pictures of the sun in the middle of the Earth at night and day."
"1762"	"(2007-12-04 (16)) I climbed up this tree and ended up on the roof of this guy's house. He had several little buildings that were his house.

He looked like Jack Nicholson."

We looked everywhere."
"1765"	"(2007-12-05 (16)) I was watching Mumford, but it was different. He was in a shop and went up to this black guy and said hello. There was a review that said they lagged for ""seven reasons"".

"1766"	"(2007-12-05 (16)) For some reason I was walking in the forest with Ezra, Scott Lowell and someone else. Scott and I were going out but no-one knew this. I was walking behind him and stepping in his foot prints, which were really big. We had had sex and I was thinking about me having sex with this 'bad guy' who I had had sex with. Scott didn't know though. Ezra asked the person he was with, who was an African guy, for some rings. I didn't want him getting Scott to put them on because they are gross."
"1767"	"(2007-12-05 (16)) I was at a shop with a friend of mine. We were mucking around and following these two guys. I was shopping and I went to the chocolate section. They were saying the names of songs, including Counting the Beat and Starting Over. I went to the checkout and the lady put some paper in the bag and I said it was my dream. She looked at me weird. We had a movie ticket to see A Good Heart, which was a movie, but the song was playing too. When I left, the lady was on the phone and I expected it was with the police, because she thought I was shifty. I went to this other shop. I had salty fingers and I wheeled Poppers in. Nana was saying that Poppa fought like a dog and that he had learned from Fido."
"1768"	"(2007-12-06 (16)) I was at school. Ezra asked me where SS10 was. I told him and went into my class. I checked what class I had and realized it was Accounting. I hadn't been in the classroom before. I saw Bradley and Eugene there. Scarlett sat next to me. Melodie was a little while up from me. The teacher came and I got up to get a pen out of my bag and she wouldn't let me. We had to press down on the paper with these coloured textas which made rays. I marked them all with a pen first and then I wanted free time. Everyone finished eventually. I forgot to write down my dream."
"1769"	"(2007-12-06 (16)) I was playing Super Mario Galaxy. I had to run around to get a mushroom of Mario, and Luigi had to get a mushroom of Luigi. Then they were 'real' and started falling. I was getting coins and grabbed the pull star. Yoshi helped them at one point and some of it was glitchy."

One was in the pickup and the other in the car. I got into the car and told her to go but she lagged so I went to the Mighty. I came back later but she still lagged. Then Dad and Ezra were there and he said he'd go [wherever I was going] but then Mom said she will. So Dad left and then Mom took off the street and pulled into a house. I got into the Mighty and drove up there (I didn't know what I was doing though) and finally managed it. I knocked on the door and a lady answered. I went in and saw Mom sitting down. The house was really nice and had a neat, modern style but was mostly white. Then Calvin and I were in this queue to get some sort of animal. He was ahead of me in the line. Some guy had a toad. He was going through his order ""cranberry, apples, cinnamon, pecan, nut, date nut"" then I said ""lemon poppy seed muffin!"" and called Calvin. He came and saw.

Micah (Heroes) got it and was running. He was on the good side. I ran after him to make sure no-one got it. I saw Theodore standing around and I asked him if he was good or bad. Micah was really fast. Ali Larter was there too. Micah through the baby to the main good people and they put it in this barn. I was thinking it wasn't real. Nana pointed out a plane in the sky which was going down and was surrounded with black smoke. Then she said that Ezra was upset and was having the day off school. Ezra was with us later and he explained why he wasn't going to school."
"1773"	"(2007-12-08 (16)) I had this fat octopus thing (except it was a jellyfish). I was at home. I had read that I should put it on a hot stove and then onto the fridge. I did and when it was on the fridge, some of its legs fell off and it shivered. I put it on the breakfast bar and then this orange ball of light appeared inside of it. Then this circular light (surrounding it, like a force field thing) came out of it. I dodged it and asked Dad what it was. He didn't know and told me not to touch it. Ezra came home and walked into it and it said ""Danger"" and that's all that happened. It was some self-defence thing."

It landed on the side of the road. This other car came past and got chopped in half. I realized what was going to happen and cried out. The people died and this other drove by and ignored us. Later, we were hanging around. Mom left but Darren stayed. I went to get a cord out of the car."

There were little and big water balloons but only the big ones counted. Seth Green came out and one point and I threw a water balloon at his foot. We went inside and she went to get our scores and I dried off in front of a fire. A teacher told me to apologize to Seth Green and I was wondering why. After we threw the last balloon (and I won) these two teachers thought we might have lied. I asked ""Aren't there cameras?"". There was a Runescape poster and Jillian said it sucks and I said it owns."

They fought and David fell off the edge of this cliff type of thing and the guy grabbed him and there was a shiny thing on his back. He turned robot like and saved the guy (he was a robot).

These guys came and they asked me if I wanted to be working here and I said not really. Chuck then was a Jason Bateman look-alike, but didn't really look like him and he said ""Why did I have to roll you!"", which I deciphered as he had to choose someone for something and had rolled a dice. I was arguing with him and we both stormed off together. We were then at this place with computers. He said something about us getting married and I said ""We don't have to get married"" (he figured because we were 'enemies' we would get together). I was trying to make a sandwich."

He kept saying how big everything was. He ended up taking a bus somewhere and we had to find him. He went to this big sandy place. Then I think he was an ant again, sometimes. He kept getting under the sand and I was following the hills he made. He killed this guy in a pool and later he killed another guy. I found him and he was small again (but now he was sand). I wet him and he turned into this creature that was mud coloured but was like a see-through cushion. I wet him again and he went darker and went back to being sand. He went to these stars (like in Super Mario Galaxy) and he said it was a portal to a place with awesome technology and stuff. The people he killed came back to life."

It got out. There was this little shed place. I went to hide but the dog got in and took up all the space (it had like mesh on the outside). I managed to get out, but it kept following me. I managed to run to the road and it got hit by a car. Someone said something about my smell. Later, there was another one. It sniffed me. Then Valerie and Farrah were there and they had orange juice.

There were two pages of information and something about Johnny Depp. Then I was in a desert. The kittens were revealed to be two Arabic men. They had a gun.

I realized that if you went out that way, there was a way to get back in. I went downstairs to this place with food. I got a roll with some money that Mom had given me. Ezra got this really nice choc mint ice-cream and I wanted it but didn't have enough money. If I didn't get the other half of the roll I could afford it. First, they were going to get me to help out by 'painting' eyes on a dinosaur figure. I noticed they were making my roll still and I said ""Why are you making me a roll when I asked for ice-cream?"". They then half made the ice-cream and then no-one wanted to finish it. I complained about it. I had supposedly been in an episode of Grey's Anatomy but I didn't remember.

The other girl and I were hiding in my room. I ran into David's bedroom and told him I saw that ""George Harrison was being gay"". He got up and yelled at him and got rid of him. Some time later, he said we had to decide our relationship with him. We were randomly given two choices and mine were marry or lover. I liked him and he confessed to liking me and said he would've given me those two choices even if I hadn't gotten them. I was out the back and there were all these boxes. He said not to open them, but I did anyway. There were body parts in them (chopped and wrapped like in Dexter). I didn't let the other girls see it. I went inside and he was like ""What are you going to choose now? You're not looking for a serial killer"" and I was thinking 'Yeah, but Ted Bundy's pretty hot'.

"1814"	"(2007-12-23 (16)) It was olden day western setting. People had southern accents. This guy next door to these people was related to this other guy and wanted to buy out his property. He found out he was selling it and they were arguing. The guy's wife and kid overheard the conversation so he killed them, but the wife was ok so she was sent to some place where she had to dance. I was then there but I needed to pee so I went to the toilet and before I could get my pants down this tall guy came and I said ""I'm just going to the toilet, I didn't kill a thing"". He said ""Didn't kill a thing"" and then shot 'me'. Then I was somewhere and they sent us photos of them killing our pets. I only remember seeing Tinkerbell and Spaceman though. I was really upset. Mom, Ezra and I were staying at some place. People from House of 1000 Corpses lived next door. Otis was playing Scrabble. We were going to sleep."
"1815"	"(2007-12-23 (16)) I was out the front and I saw Jack Osbourne walking next door and I remembered that they lived next door to us. Later, Sharon came out and I said ""you don't come out much anymore, not that I'm ever outside"". She said something about Ozzy being away. Later, I was at school. Calvin was acting weird. We went to this place outside and Margarita came and wanted to talk to him. I was wondering why and was yelling at her because she was a stupid loser. She was like ""I'm not doing anything to you, you're a loser"" etc. I said stuff about what her and her friends said and did to me etc. Then she and Calvin began talking and he started crying and said it had been hard for him since he came out. I was thinking 'huh?'. She comforted him and I was wondering why he told everyone else but not me. Then I was thinking that I was right about just picking the loser females to like and was thinking of Sabrina and Mariah."
"1816"	"(2007-12-24 (16)) I was watching a talk show and the host was Joshua Jackson, who was very gay and looked like he did in Cruel Intentions. Scott Lowell was his guest. Joshua wasn't funny at all and the audience was silent. I was thinking 'how the hell is this on?'. He said something about ""Jimmy Jackson"" and reached over to Scott and said ""Ooh! I said his name!"" and giggled. Then he said something about his wife and sobbed. I was reading a review and Scott comforted him and they were saying stuff about life and the director knew what they were doing and everyone seemed sad. I thought they were going to say that Scott had tried to kill himself."
"1817"	"(2007-12-27 (16)) There were zombies. I went into this deli thing with a bunch of people. I went to tell the manager that we should close the door. The manager was Samuel L. Jackson. He didn't want to close the door, but did anyway."
"1818"	"(2007-12-27 (16)) I was driving with a guy and a girl. I liked the guy. There were zombies, and he had picked up supplies from a shop earlier. We found this other town and there weren't any zombies around. We went into a shop and there were people inside. I asked if there were any zombies around. They said that there were a few. We got a trolley and got heaps of water. The girl stayed with the trolley. I looked for an esky to keep the water in. I told someone to get something 'fun'. I got rollerblades, notebooks, pens and the last issue of That's Life. Then Mom was there and she said she was buying pencils. There was a crash and I went to the trolley. It had been trapped in a little room with the girl on the other side. I was trying to ask what happened and then the zombies got her. I told people to shoot the zombies when they came through. I found the guy we were with and we ran."
"1819"	"(2007-12-27 (16)) Calvin, Mariah, Genevieve and others were doing a project for media. They had fully done up this place to be the setting. I asked if it was a big project and told them it was a waste of time if it was only a small one. Darren was there too. I was then at this house and Ramona was there. We went out the back and I was talking to her. Dad was there."
"1820"	"(2007-12-28 (16)) I was at this place with Calvin. We had to write down some thing for a future story. I couldn't think of anything. I started doing it and used a picture of Penn Badgley for a character. The photo looked more like Gale Harold. The teacher was annoyed at me. Sometimes Calvin was Charlene. I started writing a plot outline for the story, which again annoyed the teacher. I was then at Nana's and she said Easter eggs were in the study, which was in Poppers's room. They were little ones so I took two bigger, hollow eggs from the hall. I hid in this room and this guy saw me. I think Mom came to look for me later. I hid in a cupboard which had clothes in it."
"1821"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) I was in my room. Somehow I realized it was a dream and everything was vivid. I then wished my nails black for some reason, but they weren't complete so I did it myself. I then went out the back and instead of unlocking the door, I just made it unlocked. Ezra went behind the shed and so I pulled it back to get through. He found this lump of cookies and cream ice-cream and I grabbed a bit out and was eating it. Then Ezra turned the lump over and there was a cut out cube full of big maggots. I spat out my ice-cream. After, I 'woke' up and was talking to Dad and I had been talking in my sleep. The back door was also unlocked."
"1822"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) I was at school. These people asked me if ""Jonathan"" had asked me to this dance. I was like ""Who the hell is Jonathan?"". They said he liked me and pointed him out. He was small and ugly. I was talking to him later. Later still, I was at the car park and I saw Eugene. I went into the school again and I got lost. There were elevators."
"1823"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) I went to this place and we were supposed to have costumes. Dad was there. I was thinking about David Anders."
"1824"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) Something happened and Godzilla was real. He was different though. I went into this shop with a fortune teller lady to hide. He was after me. I was running through the shop aisles. He found me and I ran with others and hid under this log thing. He wanted this kid under there too. We were face to face with him and I was hoping he wouldn't kill us."
"1825"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) I was at this place that we went to regularly. There were a bunch of different obstacles. One was this turning platform and you had to jump to the next one and you get food. There was one which would either be this easy thing to get rid of or it would be Godzilla, or a 'snake' (with water and it 'slips'). They would chase you and you could die, but we survived."
"1826"	"(2007-12-30 (16)) I was out the back and the kittens were there. This other kitten came and I pet it and it stayed. Kiki came and let me pet her. Mom was watching from the kitchen window and I was like ""It's Kiki!""."
"1827"	"(2007-12-31 (16)) There were lots of little kittens outside and I gathered them and put them into this giant cage, which had little cages in it. I then saw two crocodiles on top of the shed and a nasty looking one on top of a door. One of the two on the shed, died. Later, it was alive and I was playing with it. I went in the pool and it jumped in after me. Later, Ezra and a friend were near the pool and were going to go for a swim. Then they saw the crocodile and moved away. I said they were friendly. One of the crocodiles reminded me of Kiefer Sutherland."
"1828"	"(2007-12-31 (16)) I was at a shop. I found a notebook and I flicked through it and found a note that I had written on the 6 January 2005. I tried to show Mom but she was busy."
"1829"	"(2008-01-01 (16)) I was watching this movie with Jason Lee in it. I had read that it was about a guy who wasn't interested in women, but was interested in his 10 year old daughter. But I don't think it was. He was driving a car and his daughter (played by Dakota Fanning) was in the back. She said ""Dexter?"" and Jason said ""Yes, that's my name. Dexter Morgan"" and I thought of Michael C. Hall and then that everything Jason Lee was in recently he was called Dexter. I was saying that I know him as Beaver from Dreamcatcher. Her grandma gave her ""shackles"" which were people who ""gave off good vibes""."
"1830"	"(2008-01-02 (16)) I was at school and it was Year 12. We got our timetable but it was confusing. Samantha, Calvin and I were in this room. My bag was small and had orange on it. My first class was in C3, but there were lots of C3's. People were following me to the class, but we finally found it. Eugene was there but he was in the class next door. Our class had to look after Mandy Moore. The teachers were really outgoing and treated us like kids and I knew that I was going to hate this class. Eventually, Mandy came in and the teacher was saying stuff and we had to repeat what he said. The teacher kept calling her Audrey. She went to her room and we were downstairs. This lady blew a party thing in my face and asked what was wrong. We were all standing in this line and Evelyn was in front of me. I moved a chair and left the line. Once everyone left, I got my bag and left. I realized it was a dream so I said ""No-one can see me"". I got to the front office and asked the lady how to read the timetable. She said something and then ""now you wanna get out of a draft"". I made her forget everything. This other lady had this alien thing. I gave her this ""love yourself"" card. She gave me a thank you one. Someone came in and I made him walk off. It was Carson and I was glad it wasn't Eugene."
"1831"	"(2008-01-03 (16)) I was at home. Mom and Darren were there. We thought someone was in the house and Darren saw some suspicious activity outside. These two guys came up to the house and then a car pulled up. There was a drug deal and they had heaps of drugs. This guy had weird hair that went out into a point. He went to the woodshed and was trying to get through the laundry door. He climbed in backwards and I kicked him in the bum. I told Dad and we laughed. The people threatened us and we had to all take drugs out to them. Then the main person, a lady, said she wanted 100, but would settle for 60. I told Mom then tried to go to 55. The police came and caught and arrested all of them. Someone came with a parrot and there was a message. It had blue bubbles. The guy with the hair came back another time. I heard someone in the woodshed. I was putting more stuff in the door so he couldn't open it, but it could still open enough."
"1832"	"(2008-01-03 (16)) I was doing something and then I was somewhere else. I was four or something. Nana was over and I had school books. I had ripped them and I put tape on them but Nana complained and took it off and put that cover stuff on. It had Pokemon on it. I discovered that just before I arrived, I had hit my head and had gone back in time. I was hoping that I didn't have to do school again."
"1833"	"(2008-01-04 (16)) This girl was underwater. Some guy got her (they lived underwater) and some adventure happened and she was like ""How am I going to get back?"" and he sent her back through time or something. Some baby was in an envelope under the water and there was a hole in the bottom and water poured into it."
"1834"	"(2008-01-04 (16)) I was at a friend of mine's house. It was her birthday. She had these ponds and there were walkways on top. There were lots of fish and I was telling her about how Nana had similar fish and told her about the big ones that suck on your finger. She had even bigger ones. She took a fish out and put it onto the walkway. I put it back in and said ""You're gonna kill it!"". She had a party and hadn't invited her best friend (ex) who was Leighton Meester and some stuff happened (the lights went out etc) and she suspected Leighton but it wasn't her."
"1835"	"(2008-01-05 (16)) I was with Mom somewhere. I was showing her TV shows. She liked Pushing Daisies and I was thinking that Lee Pace was hot. I was saying that season 1 concentrated more on character relationships and character. Chuck was barely in season 2. Then it was real and Mom didn't like Chuck and I think she liked Ned. I was somewhere else and it was the day before my birthday and I complained because of school and that I'd only watched two movies. I was then at Nana's with Aunt Sally and the others. We were playing cricket on an oval. Braden ran after the ball, but it was too far and she called him back. Ezra was telling Bryson about the first time he did something about South Park. The sink was full of dishes. There were some Kiefer Sutherland cards?"
"1836"	"(2008-01-05 (16)) I was in space and there was a war. Some spaceship thing was leaving and I thought it would take me to the ship that was fighting. Instead, it took me to this planet. Calvin was there and everyone started eating and I realized I had forgotten my bag with water and food. I went off and was crying. Ms Braun came and said something about Calvin kissing me and I was like ""ew, it's not about that. I want to go home"". There was this robot in a sleigh that went to France."
"1837"	"(2008-01-06 (16)) I went to this spooky place in a forest. I was with other people. There was a castle and we were told to sleep outside somewhere. This guy and girl (I was now not there and it was third person) went into this caravan. Later some people and some dogs went to check if people were asleep. They went in the caravan and saw them awake but left them. Then all these creatures came out from the castle. One of them was this sort of hot guy with big hair. Nana and I later found out by looking through a book that he was played by Angus Young. Later, the guy and girl went outside and this lady drove past and then people were coming that way so they went back inside and pretended to be having sex and the lady pretended to be hanging around."
"1838"	"(2008-01-06 (16)) I was at Nana's. There were kids there and they kept jumping on me and following me around. I was there with this guy called Adam (who I think was my boyfriend) and he was Kiefer Sutherland's son. He didn't look anything like him and had black hair. I was playing some game which was Mario like. I was swimming through water and there were lava and normal platforms. The water started falling and I had to jump from platform to platform."
"1839"	"(2008-01-06 (16)) Dad and Valerie met up. They talked for a bit and then started making out. Her eyes looked like Jennifer Carpenter's and I said ""She looks like Dexter's sister!"". I was thinking that I hadn't seen Farrah in a long time."
"1840"	"(2008-01-07 (16)) Ezra and I were at a beach. We were watching this movie while walking through this carpark and recognized that the movie was set here. We walked onto the sand and met with this actor guy. We were walking with him and he asked us to be in the movie with him. Ezra and I were like ""lucky we came to the beach"". The water came up and knocked us down. I was carried a while away (on the sand). He said he was doing a talk soon. I was then naked and looking for clothes. Some lady said ""Get it cut"". I found some clothes and ended up at this place and Jemma was there. She was abusing me and then touched me so I started hitting her and she fell to the ground and I walked off. I went up these stairs and realized that she was following me. She said something like that she was going to punch me over the edge. She grabbed my leg but I managed to push her over and she fell. But when I looked she had only fallen onto the steps and was still alive. Some old lady was like ""She's the victim here"" and I said ""Then so was Ted Bundy"". Lydia said the Jemma's name was Madelyn and I said that it wasn't and that I didn't mind Madelyn. Lydia was like 'what the hell?'. I was worried about getting in trouble for it, but was hoping that she had died."
"1841"	"(2008-01-07 (16)) I was at 'school'. I left my bag in some secret room. I couldn't remember how to get back. It was home time and people were everywhere."
"1842"	"(2008-01-07 (16)) We got our exam results back. I got 75% for English. I did well in the middle part and I told Mom. [I found out the next year that the top mark was 75%] ."
"1843"	"(2008-01-08 (16)) I don't remember the start, but a virus (like in 24) was released. I had a boyfriend who was Michael Cera (or at least looked like him). He thought that he was infected. I was at home which was completely different in a completely different place. There was a place in the desert where infected people went and they could kill themselves. I was with Mom at one stage and I was crying (about Michael being infected) and she was like ""maybe he's not infected"". Michael was going to go there but first Mom, Darren, Ezra, Michael and I were in the car going to the shop. Ezra had a guinea pig. Michael and I were messing around in the shop and making out. We were also singing Love Me Tender at one point. Some guy and I had a fight and I had this giant mascara thing and he had a hairdryer. Then we were in an aisle which had yoghurt topped muesli bars and we were throwing them at each other. Then I was in the music section with Mom. Some people were singing old songs and I was singing along to some parts. There was a Beatles ""number ones"" poster. There was also a Spinal Tap thing which had Christopher Guest on the front. Some lady asked Mom the best way to learn the piano. As we left the section I grabbed this big green and white candy cane, a wig and a mini-moose (Invader Zim) toy. I put on the wig and met up with Michael in the food hall. This guy was making food, which was a live animal. I realized it was an armadillo and there was one nearby. I took off the wig and jumped on the table. It went on a rampage and I was trying to kill it. I went near Michael and used a table to shield us and we managed to run out of the shop. This guy was just outside in his car. We got in and wound the windows up. It was trying to head butt through the windows. I took over driving and sat in the left side. The driver did the breaks and kept an eye on the speed, which was in miles. It was too confusing so I swapped and had to add 40 to the miles and that would be the equivalent of kilometers. We tried to get the armadillo off. It rolled the car and Michael and I got out and the car exploded. Then the driver appeared. It was dark and we were running home trying to avoid the armadillo. We got home and then I was Kim (24) and he was Chase (24) and she said to him not to come in and he said ""I thought I was past the kissing stage"". He left and then it was me again. The door wouldn't lock and the armadillo was outside. I called Mom (but it wasn't her) to help stop it from getting in. The house was shaking and we went back in time. The father was going to do something. We went outside and Sandra Bullock was in a tree with a baby. She had really long nails that were white and she was hippie like. Michael and I made out again."
"1844"	"(2008-01-09 (16)) I was out in some bush place and there was a little deli. Some guy, a girl and I were meeting there because some guy was going to give us $1.1 million for some reason. If we didn't see anyone else on the way there he was going to give us $2.2 million. The deli owner saw us though so we only got $1.1 million. The guy shot me but I didn't get shot. Then we all bought $400k houses. Then it was Sims 2 and I added the families to my play list. One said ""Eric Dane""."
"1845"	"(2008-01-10 (16)) I had gone to the UK and met The Beatles and they had to sign in a card. John Lennon was there. Then I was at 'school'. I had my Beatles shirt on and someone asked me about them. Ms Braun was doing S+E stuff. I had been away and she asked me something about antioxidant and I said ""I don't even know what antioxidant is"". She said I should've straightened my hair. She gave me DVD's of Superbad and one with Michael Cera in it and two others. I asked if I could take them home to watch (so I could burn them) and she said no. I was in a room. Some girl, Megahn Perry, David Fickas and I were there. The girl and Megahn were supposed to best friends but Megahn liked me and the other girl was annoyed. I liked the David Fickas guy and I think he liked me but he was hanging out with this other guy."
"1846"	"(2008-01-10 (16)) There was a sign on the road where all dogs were supposed to poo there so it was all in one place. People were looking for food and they were getting meat and this lady wanted more. Someone let the dogs go."
"1847"	"(2008-01-10 (16)) I was somewhere and there was a toilet which only had one side and no walls. Ezra was nearby. Then we were at the shop at Toys 'R' Us. They had this yellow Runescape boat. I was in the electronics section. They had this Beatles trivia thing and something about Audrey Tautou in Amelie. I thought it was a dream and did a reality check, but then I was out the back. Then I was at 'school'. Two girls were hugging each other. I went up some stairs and I heard ""Izzy"" and Max (Roswell) gave me an envelope and said ""It's important"". I opened it and it said that he loved me and knew my ""birthday secret"". I closed it and said I'd read it later, because it had said in there to meet him if I felt the same way. Later, I was in a car with him and a female teacher. We went to this boring lawn mower place. The teacher left. We went past my 'mother's' (not really her) work and she sold tea and it was a drive thru. She didn't give them to people my age but she let Max have one (he was a year older). The cup the tea was in was really hot but Max had no problems holding it. Godzilla and some thing went after Brendan Fehr and he said something to Max. He could make Godzilla things and clouds appear."
"1848"	"(2008-01-12 (16)) I was with the school at a shop. We were listening to a talk about aliens. Eugene, someone and I left to look for some alien artifact of mine that had been stolen. We were in an office and we found these tubes and took this thin tube thing. The lady came back and we hid behind the desk and crawled around. I ran out in time but she saw Eugene. I ran through the shop and got to a dead end so I ran the other way. I put the tube down the side of my pants and found my way back to the entrance. The lady and Eugene came. She thought we had nothing on us so she let us go. We were at some bouncy yellow and red stairs. Someone said ""it might be a dream"" and I said ""No, this is definitely not a dream"". The three of us were walking along a bridge and it was dark. Soon, I couldn't see ahead. Then I looked behind and saw this claw grab some people and I realized that the lady was taking people. I saw a claw in front of us and I tried to tell Eugene but couldn't. I fell and we were lying on the bridge holding on tight. My phone was falling out of my pocket. I was trying to think what to do and then I got this weird image of George Clooney talking. The claw grabbed me but I didn't let go. We escaped and we were later staying in a hotel. The lady found us and she inferred that some people were having sex. She made them hallucinate. Later, I was in a car with Dad and Ezra. There were lots of murderers around so we locked our doors. There were two guys near a park. Some guy was the ice truck killer (Dexter)."
"1849"	"(2008-01-13 (16)) There was a war. This youngish guy was put on a safe planet. He interrogated some females by threatening their kids. He was a good guy though. He was arranging for them all to go free. Some people were let out near this flat thing. People were shooting and these kids got shot."
"1850"	"(2008-01-13 (16)) I was at school. It was year 12 and the class numbers were weird and I didn't know where to go for physics. I saw Elijah and I was going to follow him but then remembered he didn't do physics anymore. I eventually found the class and sat down near the front. When Darius and company came they sat in front of me. Eugene came and he looked weird and his eyebrows were thick. Autumn sat next to me. There was a thing which had these profiles of ours on it. I was looking at Eugene's and reading his list of favourite movies, all of which I hadn't heard of."
"1851"	"(2008-01-14 (16)) Ezra was driving. First, we got in the car to get away from these people and he got in the drivers seat. He was going fast but controlled it. We got to this grassy place and were climbing up this very green hill. At the top there were obstacles and people were climbing them. This guy and a girl followed us up there."
"1852"	"(2008-01-14 (16)) We were going to go to some waterslides. We were out the front of home and Valerie and kids, Mom, Dad and Ezra were there too. We only had one car. Farrah got the mail and it was all for me. One was from this place to do with school. It had a bunch of names on it but the only name I recognized was Gregg. There was some mail from some Spongebob place. Ariana was in the back seat and wearing a Spongebob shirt. Farrah was in the driver's seat and Valerie was sitting on the boot. Mom and I went inside and she invited her brother so that Valerie wouldn't go. She knocked on the breakfast bar to pretend that she was knocking on the door. Then there was a real knock and Evelyn and a man (which was her father, but not really) and two dogs were there. She was talking to me and asked if I was going out and I said yes. Then there were heaps more people there. Ramona was there and I kept calling her Paul. I was yelling at the people to get out of the house and calling out for my keys. On the drive there I remembered I had my period so I decided to check how heavy I was when I got there."
"1853"	"(2008-01-14 (16)) This guy's daughter went to this dark alley place to gamble (playing poker). He went to his friends place. His friend was warning him about a killer. He locked himself in a room and the killer came and killed his friend. He thought it was a joke so reached out and touched and tasted the blood and he realized it was real. He then looked up in shock."
"1854"	"(2008-01-15 (16)) I left this place with some friends and I was driving this car. It was American though, and I kept getting confused. The brakes weren't working well. Then it was this weird Segway like emergency vehicle. The traffic was stopped. I managed to get onto the road I needed to. I was then with someone who was either Kiefer Sutherland or Will Arnett. We were walking down the side of the road and then it was closed at the end. We had to climb over this thing and there was a door and he went through and I asked ""Haven't we gone through this door before?"" and he said ""No"". Then we were in this garden and there were two little Chinese hut like things on each side of the garden and each side of the garden was exactly the same. There was a black couple and they wanted us to marry their children. First, they gave us food and we fell asleep. We then dreamt and he was trying to work out who he was in love with. There was a midget called Denis. This lady told him that she thought it was me (that he was in love with). So we had sex (in the dream) and he realized that he did. He owned this video shop and they had Flatliners and two other movies with Kiefer Sutherland (looked like him, but wasn't him). Then it was real and the cops were there. We had been killed and found together in a bed. I was then discovered to be alive and sat up. Then whoever I was with was alive too. I was watching something on TV -- Will Arnett was in love with a rat. He put it in his pants and it climbed out from the bottom."
"1855"	"(2008-01-15 (16)) I was at 'school' and it was the first day back. I was annoyed. It was Tuesday and I had English first. Ms Solomon said to start working. The class was weird. I was trying to find somewhere to sit. There were four rows. Elijah and Theodore were sitting on opposite ends of the third row. I sat at one end of the third row next to Theodore. I moved the desk away. I was hoping the teacher wouldn't tell me off. Eugene was talking to me at one point and when he walked away, I was thinking 'why the hell was he talking to me'. I was trying not to giggle."
"1856"	"(2008-01-15 (16)) I was out the back and jumped into the pool. I went inside and Dad was like ""What the hell happened?"" and I said that I fell in the pool. I remembered my phone was in my pocket and it was wet and squishy, but it was working."
"1857"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) I was at 'school'. We had this cooking class. I put my bag near the desk and when I went back it was gone. I was trying to ask the teacher if she knew where it went. Eventually she went looking for it. I had to cook all these different recipes. I picked this banana muffin. It had to go underwater. I had to one of those MATHS things as well. This lady was at her house and she knew all these kids Halloween costumes, so she pretended to be someone else. These two kids walked away from her house and one said ""she tries""."
"1858"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) This gay kid was friends with this guy. The gay guy was in love with him. The guy had had sex with him. They met up again and the gay guy was staying with him and his friends. He was sharing his bed. He was naked and the gay guy pushed the sheets off and was touching him. He turned the music up and the guy was just staring at the ceiling. A friend of his wanted to come in and worked out what was going on and was laughing with the other friends."
"1859"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) Darren asked me what I thought of the couples of Roswell. I said I liked the way they turned out and was thinking of Max with Liz and Eugene with Maria. I said that it was ""pretty pathetic"" but I liked it. Ezra asked me a question about how to record something."
"1860"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) I was watching some Alias thing and there was a picture of Jenny in a cheerleading outfit. Will was with his parents and he was trying to explain why his girlfriend (Jenny) wasn't there."
"1861"	"(2008-01-17 (16)) I was watching a movie called 'Sad School'. It started off with these people in an underground carpark place but it wasn't underground. They jumped into the street and then these people ran out of a shop with zombies after them. There were heaps of zombies around. This lady worked out that if you stood up straight it would attract them so she and this girl walked like hunchbacks and got past them. They got a deal with a zombie so that they and other survivors could live in this school as long as they made no noise or were seen. This guy got turned and told this lady that it wasn't pleasant. He was green and warty. This girl got kissed and her mouth went warty. The street was crowded with zombies and they all went after them. This lady went into the back seat of a police car. The front window was down and she was trying to push it up. They kept going down though, so she had to keep pushing them up. There was a male zombie outside. She managed to get out but he chased her. She ended up in this store which only had two walls and then she was a guy. Michael Cera was then there and a guy in a wheelchair was facing the other way. The girl who had turned into the guy said he was the only person who could look after the guy in the wheelchair. It was his son. So the zombies were like ""Well it's your son or Michael'. I was like ""Give them wheels!"". Dad asked if the main lady died. I said that I didn't know and that I thought she did. There was a catchy song in it. At the school where the survivors were, there was a guy in a cage. A helicopter flew over one day and the zombies got suspicious. The people decided to leave but first they had to delete their files. They went to this place but somehow the wall got knocked down and they were all standing. Later I was in the lounge room and the sequel was on. Dad was watching it and Ezra was there. There was a list of music and there was a song I liked on there. In the sequel there was a cop who was the brother of a cop in the first one (and he looked like he was related to Kevin Dillon). It was really random and boring. Jeremy Piven was driving a car and yelling into a phone."
"1862"	"(2008-01-17 (16)) I was at a place and we were sitting in cars. Poppa was there. Ezra, Mom and I went to the shop and got school bags. We had video cameras too. My tape was almost full. They had this bad guy and Poppa asked to record him while he made a phone call. I gave him Ezra's tape."
"1863"	"(2008-01-18 (16)) I was living by myself at home. But then it was some other house. We did something to the roof (changed the pattern and stuff). This new guy across the road copied, but it was a little bit different. Ezra got a new car and the guy got a similar one. The door to my house was this stingy thing with cloth which blew about. I had this little table outside. The guy took it and I took it back. He came over and wanted me to come to his place and I said no. He came back a little while later with these two really big chickens. I called Mom and told her to get me. The chickens came in and were like dogs. I was screaming and went outside. I then said ""Ok! I'll go to your place!"" and he took them off."
"1864"	"(2008-01-18 (16)) I went to this place with a guy friend I liked. He wanted to work in ""entertainment"" (all jobs had categories). I went down this slide which would measure my ""sweet"" and how much of something else I produced. My sweet and the other thing were almost the same which some guy said was ""excellent""."
"1865"	"(2008-01-18 (16)) I was at Max, Isobel and Eugene's (all from Roswell) house. I was helping with the gardening. There was this big container with plant pots in it. I didn't know much water to put in. Later there were plant pots near a shed. I thought I might water the grass. This frog had died in the container along with the plants. Their 'mother' gave us tea with superglue and sugar in it. Isobel was then at some place and had to distract this guy called Matt. She was hiding behind some bushes. I think they could change form too."
"1866"	"(2008-01-19 (16)) I was in a car with a young Kiefer Sutherland and some others. We found out that I may have been related to him. He went to this neighbourhood, which was creepy, to look for an old lady. The houses were all falling apart and some had skeletons (real) hanging on the front of their doors. We went into this house and a female friend got left behind (we had to run to the car). Kiefer was talking about 'breeding' with me. His house was huge. Chloe (24) was there. She met with this guy on a balcony. Someone got a mint chocolate chip mint ice-cream and I decided I wanted one. We all went to get one. It was dark and the place was closed. It had animals in cages. We opened the cage and then had to put the animals back. Mom, Dad and Ezra were there. Mom was behind us. I wanted to be friends with this girl but she was best friends with this other girl. There was a hot tub in the house. Someone followed someone and this policeman interrogated the bad guy."
"1867"	"(2008-01-19 (16)) I was at Nana's. We were getting the photos off the camera and onto her computer. They were photos that I had taken. Mom was deleting the movement before the photo. Then I was at some place where people from school were and I was taking photos. I had photos of Daryl, Dewey, Kirsten and others. We went on a bus and someone said something about wanting a boyfriend and then this guy walked past and she was like ""ooh, him!"" He stood at the front of the bus and I said ""I think he's going to kill us"". He did something and the bus started rolling backwards so I got to the door and got out. It rolled off this jetty into the water. The guy made me go with him. I called the police but didn't tell them where the guy was. The police saw him though and we started running. There was a fair place and he was running through all these 'rides' and we got separated, but met up later. Then we were Smurfs. I was little and had red hair. He said something about me being 7 and he being 30. We were jumping on this hat to go this place where the police couldn't see us. He said something about kissing and having sex with me and he was holding me. Then we were at a shop and there was another Smurf. There was nacho flavoured ice-cream. This guy made bad guys eat it. The police came because he was saying he was the killer."
"1868"	"(2008-01-20 (16)) I was watching 24. Chloe's ex-husband was Josh Weinstein (Entourage) and Jack didn't like him. Chloe kept talking to Edgar in her head and replaying certain things he'd said. She was like ""Stop it!"". The terrorists had planted fake information on the attack and suddenly all of CTU was gone except for Josh. He called the terrorists and said he had embedded the real information for them on Maeby Funke's (Arrested Development) site. He said that she was ""a little toughie"". She worked it out, though and did SOS signals from the fridge. Jason Bateman was sitting in a car outside the hotel Maeby was at. The terrorists realized that Maeby had found it, so sent off the missile early. I was then looking at pictures of Michael Cera. There were pictures of him young and his eyes were different."
"1869"	"(2008-01-20 (16)) I woke up and Dad was going to work late and he was talking to me but my voice was all sleepy and I didn't know what was going on."
"1870"	"(2008-01-21 (16)) I made this chip that could let us do anything. Some girl stole it and Mom, Ezra and I went after her. We were driving but then we lost her. Her sick old grandma was in a car with her. We went to this place and there were lots of old people around. Ms Bigwood was there. Then it was a movie and this old couple was talking. It turned out that the chip had made everyone stay at their current age (forever)."
"1871"	"(2008-01-22 (16)) I had gone on a dating show and had met this hot guy called Steven and he had chosen to go on the second date with me. We were in a car and Ezra was there too. We were talking but told Ezra to leave. Later, people kept playing this game out the front of the house across the road. People kept joining in and then leaving. A black girl was there. This car was coming past and people were drunk. I went back inside. Dad was there. I was then at this other house that I think was Mom's. I was getting rid of stuff on my bed by putting it under the blanket. Then I was Max (Roswell). He and his mother were getting stuff out of his drawers. There was a broken lightbulb and he held it and fixed it. Then I was me again and was wondering when Steven was coming. Simba was on my bed. I was watching some show and this guy and girl were in a shop and were going to have sex behind a curtain. Everyone was cheering. The girl took her shirt off and then the curtain opened. There was a photo of Braden somewhere and he looked like a cross between Charlton Heston and Peter Weller."
"1872"	"(2008-01-23 (16)) This couple had a son and a daughter and they were living in this cool house. Something happened and they were worried that something was going to happen to them. They had tunnels hidden in the house incase they needed to hide. They heard a noise and sent the kids down the tunnel. Two men came and one was Tom Lennox (24) and realized they had sent the kids down the tunnel. But he knew them before so he didn't say anything. They had nuclear bombs. A woman got shot. I was telling Mom, Darren and others about it later."
"1873"	"(2008-01-23 (16)) I had more texts from Dad about Heath Ledger being dead."
"1874"	"(2008-01-23 (16)) I drove to Dad's 'work'. This guy jumped into the passenger seat and asked if I had any 'E'. I was like ""Huh?"". He said ecstasy and I was like ""Why the hell would I have that?!"". He got out and was talking to his friends and they said I was cool. I went to this cheesecake shop and Evelyn worked there. I said it was nice in here because it was cool and had mud cakes. Evelyn was talking to me about the seating on the bus and that I always sat next to Calvin. Then we got on a plane and it was going around in circles. There were some Spanish guys. We then ran into an antiques shop and when we left it there was a swamp. I jumped over onto a ladder and there were retards hanging on to different obstacles. I had to swing onto this thing and get past a lady."
"1875"	"(2008-01-24 (16)) I was at 'school'. We were at this shop (that was at the school) and all these celebrities were there. Dad shook Jack Nicholson's hand, then I did. He had rings on, but I shook his hand anyway. Kevin Spacey was there too. Someone was found dead and we were all being wary of the killer. Most people left and it was just me, the teachers and some students. Whitaker from Roswell was there but she was called Topolsky. Then there was this guy called Ned and he looked like Miko Hughes. Topolsky told me to lock him in this room with all our school bags because she thought he was the killer. I locked it and then unlocked it, but she saw me and did it herself and guarded the door. I suspected her of being the killer and I went to the other side of the shop and left. She had followed me and was waiting outside. She started chasing me. I didn't know where to go and just kept running. I ended up at these tennis courts. I yelled out to everyone that ""Topolsky is the killer!"". They laughed and were confused. Then she came and she had a gun to this male teacher's head. I pointed at them and finally the people looked. We all started running and she was shooting at us. I kept hiding behind things. Then she got hold of a machine gun and she now looked like Mia Kirshner. I was hiding behind this little metal thing. I asked ""how many bullets does that hold?"" and someone said ""500"". Then it was a keyboard. She had modified it to act as a machine gun. I grabbed it and she disabled it. She grabbed another keyboard and we were having a fight with them. Then she planted this bomb which plugged into the power socket. I called out for someone to disable the power and the principal guy said no and I realized that he was a part of it. We ran and the bomb had only been set for 3 seconds or something, then the school exploded. I had managed to get to the front of the school and it was North Midvale Primary School. I started walking home. There was a black guy on the street too. I decided to go back to the school and help. I called Mom on my mobile and she was like ""Yeah, I'm coming to get you"". I said ""A bomb just went off at the school! I don't know who's dead or alive"" and I was crying. I got off the phone and was walking through the rubble. Brendan Fehr came out of the rubble and I said ""What's your name?"" and he said ""Ben"". I saw Ned and woke him up and he said that his mothers cover was now blown and he asked if I could take him to my 'father' who was a doctor. I grabbed him and said that he was small. I was reading something about Pushing Daisies and everyone was like ""Where's the real Ned?"". Someone said, about the Miko Hughes Ned, ""You rule. You're my favourite because of your smile""."
"1876"	"(2008-01-25 (17)) I was at a place. I don't remember it properly, but there was this game where you drag a barrel to this thing over the water and create points. It was then a Runescape skill and you could have different pets. I left there and we needed to pick something up. Someone called Ari (Entourage) to ask where he was (he was dropping something off) and he was driving. He said ""Yeah, I'm on the runway!"" (a joke). I was going somewhere and Mom was picking up the thing. I was almost home when I realized that I was driving alone. I had been going 120km/h as well. I called Mom but she was just like ""it doesn't matter"". When I turned onto our street I was walking. There was a really big truck on the street. This lady said it was nuclear. This fat guy was walking with me. I got home and these two guys were standing out the front. One of them was Christian Camargo. They had been there earlier that day too. I said ""you guys are still here!"" and unlocked the doors and went inside.  They came in too and the fat guy was following me around. Christian asked if he was supposed to still be around and I said no, so this guy there shouted ""Austin! Go away!"". Ezra was somewhere too. This guy had a board of who he was interested in lately. It said ""Fergie, blood period"" and Rihanna was there too, but she looked like Emilie de Ravin."
"1877"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was watching an early season of 24. Jack was looking for information. This money had been passed down for 200 odd years. Someone told him something about his son and it looked like he was going to steal it. People started shooting at Jack. Then Jack was driving a car down a road that was 'cliff-like'. This girl he worked with was driving behind him, guiding him. Then this guy, that girl and I were at this forest thing. They were bad guys. Jack was hiding somewhere. There was a thick bushy area a thin area. The girl downloaded a map and told us to take the thin area. I figured she was going to kill us and walked slowly. She was pointing a gun at us and I yelled out ""Kiefer!"" and she looked shocked. I managed to get out of sight and was making my way around this fence. She was like ""I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!"" and I was waiting for her to point the gun at me. Then she did and I woke up."
"1878"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was watching an episode of The Outer Limits. Frank Whaley was in it. He and this guy were friends and he always took this bus. He was worried about a white light. These people were after him and to go to him, I had to go through the aisles of a video shop. One of the times I grabbed some movies and one of them was Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland. This guy said something and I said ""Yeah, it's the remake"". One day we were riding the bus and it was weird. I tried to get over to Frank, but I fell into a seat nearby. This guy was talking to him across the bus. I went into the seat next to him and he held my hand. An impression of a monkey's face appeared in the seat in front of him. We looked at each other worried and then there was a bright light and then he was gone. It had happened to someone before. The other guy got off and was in a crowded area. His face turned monkey-like and people started screaming. Then I was watching this other episode and this girl and some other people were jumping off this bridge, but they didn't get hit by cars and landed in this gymnastic area. Her sister was naked and kept having hallucinations."
"1879"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was driving by myself. There was a red light. I didn't slow down in time and pushed the car in front of me. We both ended up having to go through the red light."
"1880"	"(2008-01-26 (17)) I was at a school. Tiana there and I think we were friends or I was friends with a loner. I went to a bench and sat at the edge because it was the only dry spot. I saw Evelyn there too. Jillian was there and got up and complained that I was sitting next to her. I called a retard and she was circling me and I complained. She was touching me lightly and then grabbed my shoulders so I kicked her in the face."
"1881"	"(2008-01-28 (17)) We went to Nana's. I was at the table doing a 1000 piece puzzle. I had almost finished it and then realized that it had pieces that weren't in the puzzle and I'd just had extremely good luck picking the right pieces. Calvin, Ezra, and Emery, I think were there. They were mucking around and Nana was a bit annoyed."
"1882"	"(2008-01-28 (17)) Someone jumped over a sand pile and they fell and hurt something. Liz (Roswell) was hiding out with someone and their fathers. There was a CD and a phone on the floor. She had to prove something and went to give them the CD but it was gone. She went into a bedroom with a bunk bed to have a shower (she thought the shower was under the top bunk, but it wasn't). She found something that said ""only Jason Lee!"". It was from some colourful video game. Then Liz was in a car at a shop. She was trying to put L plates on while she was parked in the car park. She saw these two girls and she thought they were going to steal the plates so she locked the doors and took them off. She had to go inside and took the car with her (it was small and she was holding it in her arms). This lady gave her car stuff. She went down these escalators that had been stopped and was in the main part of the shop, which was a clothes shop. Someone thought that she was with ""Tess, not Tuck"". Tuck was Tess' father. Isobel and Michael (Roswell) were there trying to get the car and kill her. She whacked Isobel with something and she passed out. Eugene went after her and he got hit too. Max (Roswell) appeared and Liz had short blonde hair. Max said ""Liz? You're behind 'Runaway'?"". They ran out and this black guard stopped Eugene from following them. Liz was saying that the keys were in the car and it was locked."
"1883"	"(2008-01-29 (17)) I was at home and it was the first day of school. I was getting ready and realized that my hair hadn't been straightened so I called Mom. She said that the hair straightener had been ""nicked"" but she was just about to come over. I was shaving my legs. I realized that I had no school bag or anything. I woke Dad up and Ezra was in his bed. Mom said Ezra had seen this dude who had said that Ezra's stress was due to being left home alone so this woman would randomly check to make sure someone was with him. I thought it was 6pm but I checked the time and it was 11am. I said we should go shopping for school stuff instead of going to school. Later I was at home and this creepy dude, who looked like the driver guy in Superbad, was outside so I got in the car and drove to Mom's. But I couldn't control the car and Ezra was making me drive erratically. We went to Midvale shops. Some people had been to a Britney Spears concert. Sean Astin (as Harrison Bergeron) had rebelled and was going to be killed. They trapped his head between two fridges and let this blue stuff out. He died. Then it was the future and there were other planets we lived on. There were some bugs and snakes somewhere and I screamed and ran."
"1884"	"(2008-01-29 (17)) I was playing a game, I think. This 'God' guy was making things hard for us. One of his obstacles were these tornados in a desert place. One was useful, the others were bad. The last person standing won and that was me. The God guy and I went to this water and had to swim over these waves. At the end there were two 'roll-y' waves on top of each other. The God guy told me to swim under but I was worried. Then I saw Dad through this window next to me. I had let him use my computer to play a Powerpuff Girls game. I told him that I was ok. Then I got the God guy to help me go over the sides. The first time I tried I almost drowned myself. I told him if I did a hand motion it meant I needed air. We got over it and then I was moving fast underwater. I hit the guy and he came up for air. He said he'd gone fast so we didn't have to swim. Then it was Runescape and the world had really pretty houses. He asked if I was going to ask Jagex to keep this and I said ""no, I want to do everything myself"". Ezra and Dad were then outside somewhere and we were getting hot dogs."
"1885"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was at a shop and getting food and snacks. They kept disappearing and I thought it must be because I kept forgetting them. I put them in a bag. I was in the electronics section and this guy was there and he was checking this girl's bag and they were giggling. As I was leaving, there was someone from school I didn't like and she was surrounded by her friends. She called me and I kept walking. Then she said ""fine"". She gave me this purple watch. I was then at this men's wear section and there were lots of girls there. Then I went to this food hall part. There was a guy nearby doing these family tree things. I had bought two books earlier and they were in a shopping bag."
"1886"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was watching something with Ezra. Xander Berkeley was in it and I said ""he looks young"" and Ezra said ""he looks old""."
"1887"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was at 'school'. We had to watch Juno. I said ""I just watched this!"". The teacher was saying that some phonics band was the last band in the movie and I said they suck."
"1888"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) I was at a shop. Ari (Entourage) was talking and I took his head 'off' and put it face down to shut him up and we were all laughing."
"1889"	"(2008-01-30 (17)) Liz, Max, Isobel and Michael (all from Roswell) and I had been chased by some people. Isobel was pregnant and this blue stuff fell out of her and I said something like ""an alien inside of you and the like"". She had had sex with two guys. One was the Miko Hughes character in Roswell and this random guy called Scott Speedman. The baby was born and it had Miko's nose. I said to Miko that he was a bad guy. Then it turned out it was his baby. We were watching it on Maury Povich."
"1890"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) I watched this movie and I found this snake lolly thing in the dining room. It was supposed to be 'dangerous' to put on but I did anyway. I was then in my bed. Tigger and Mittens were cuddling. I fed Tigger the snake lolly and then she was vomiting it under the table."
"1891"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) Clayton was riding a bike with me. Sometimes it was a car. He couldn't drive very well and I said ""you should let me drive"". We had to look for some stuff at this place. There was something about Roswell there."
"1892"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) Mom and I went to a shop and were looking at school bags, but I didn't like any of them. These people would go out and find an 'interesting' male and female to turn into a ghost along with their family. I ended up at this shop where the people and ghosts had been. They wanted the people working at the checkouts. The girl at the checkout and I had these red cards which meant that no-one could ask us questions or arrest us. Two cars crashed into the shop. William Sadler as the sheriff in Roswell came. The girl and I ran to the back of the shop to get out of the way. We went forward a bit and the sheriff told us to run and we all ran. He got shot and I was thinking 'What the hell? He doesn't die, he's in all the episodes!'. The bad guys were coming to kill us for insurance. The girl ran in the toilet to hide and I accidentally ran into the fridge next to it. I quickly ran into the toilet and tried to lock the first door but couldn't. I was thinking 'why do these doors never lock?'. I ran into the toilet cubicle. They were shooting at us from above but missed us. I ripped the toilet seat off and was hitting this guy over the head. They left and just one guy was left. The girl I was with was going to slice his throat but backed out. But then he left. A guy knocked on this glass door from outside and we went out and followed him, running. We got to this carpark and I saw this white car's door open. We ran up these stairs and I said ""isn't this wrong way?"". The bad guys threw a bomb. We got into the car and the girl got shot and died. We were driving off and I said the sheriff was dead."
"1893"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) I was about to leave home with Mom. I had just locked up and started walking towards the car, when these two black guys drove past then pulled up in the driveway. They were trying to get my keys off me. Mom came up and distracted them and I unlocked the door and went inside. I called Dad. When I got back to the front door, the police were there and the black guys were gone."
"1894"	"(2008-01-31 (17)) I was watching this show with Dad. There was a snake and it wriggled around in water really fast. These bigger creatures tried to get it, but it was too fast."
"1895"	"(2008-02-02 (17)) I was at school. I text the canteen to order my lunch. A teacher saw and asked what I was doing. I said ""Oh, ordering my lunch, I forgot to do it earlier"". She called me a liar. I showed them the message and then they went away a while later. I was then with a friend somewhere and they were buying mini M&M's and I wanted some but realized I had no money. I couldn't get to my phone either. Nana called though, and she gave money to me but it was for Ezra. Outside was really foggy. Something was attacking me."
"1896"	"(2008-02-02 (17)) I was in a building underground. The entrance had glass windows around it and had glass doors. Ezra was there too. I was trying to leave. There were two doors that would take us to the entrance. I went to one, but I saw this freaky lobster/scorpion thing so I left there. I thought I saw a crocodile. A couple and a young girl came in and the baby was near the crocodile, so I called out to the parents and a light turned on. It was just a cat. It looked evil and talked to me. I said that I wanted to get through and it was like ""Ok, go ahead"". I asked it about the lobster thing and it said it didn't know what it was, but ""maybe it is lethal"". Ezra and I went to these stairs to leave and a girl went through some doors and a lobster thing got through. The doors to get out wouldn't open. There were these rope things hanging from the ceiling and I grabbed one and swung away from the stairs. Jude Law (as Jerome Morrow in Gattaca) was there, his name was spelt wrong somewhere. He offered to get bitten by the lobster thing to see what happened. He could then walk, so everyone was like ""Let's go"", but I said that it might still be deadly. Lots of people ended up dying. Some army guys came. Some lady had a card that would allow two people to leave. Someone and I left. We went to this place and they had this machine where you could ask about any one and see who their ""soul mate"" was. When I put in 'Mom', it said Nana and Poppa and they realized that I'd 'stolen' the card. I ended up back underground. Eventually a lady came through the doors and we were allowed out. I hugged a car when we got outside. They blew up the place and it turned out it was our school. I said ""We start school in a few days and now they blew up the school"". Dad said ""only the nice part"". Behind the school there were some big white buildings and I saw Mr Willingham walking on there. Ezra asked who the math teacher was and I said ""Mr Gutenberg""."
"1897"	"(2008-02-03 (17)) I was at home. I was watching something that had Michael Cera in it, and Bryson and another person were watching it too. I went out to see Mom. Ezra went with her and she took off before I could talk. I got prickles in my foot. Bryson closed the front door and I couldn't get back in. I didn't have my phone on me and so I borrowed off someone. The phone was actually a piece of paper so I typed out what I said, but I had actually called Mom and said we needed to go to Dad's work. Mom was there later and saw Kiki and a kitten on the roof of the shed."
"1898"	"(2008-02-03 (17)) I was watching Roswell and Tess said something indicating that she was bad (she said it away from the others). She was telling Max, Liz and the others (but it wasn't them) that she was meant for Max, and they had all been matched up according to their hair colours. They were like transformers and they were going to use their powers to save the world."
"1899"	"(2008-02-04 (17)) I had stayed at Mom's. I got ready for school and drove there. Then I was on a bike and it was raining, but I was still 'driving'. Mom was walking behind me. Lots of people were around upstairs. Ezra was there too. The door names were weird. One of them said 'Smudgy' and I thought the other one said 'Smudgy Pudge', but it said 'McLovin'. My hair was normal and I hadn't had breakfast yet so I said that I wasn't staying here. I ended up at home and Dad was still asleep. It was 8am. Mom said I still had an hour to get ready. Dad asked if we wanted McDonald's for breakfast. I said I was going to eat breakfast at Mom's."
"1900"	"(2008-02-05 (17)) There was this road which I went down on a game -- some of it had no railings. There was a part where you had to jump across this gap. Then it was real and it was my birthday soon. I had made these party invitations to see what they looked like. A friend of mine (Asian from Juno) said she was ""sorta my friend"" and should be invited. I was like ""I'm not having a party!"". I asked some lady to get something."
"1901"	"(2008-02-06 (17)) I was watching some talk show with Heath Ledger on it. His daughter had died and her name was Ella. The host asked him about some wings he was wearing and he said ""Oh, I'll put wings on for Ella"" then he said ""You go Ella!""."
"1902"	"(2008-02-06 (17)) I was watching some movie with Kiefer Sutherland and Tom Cruise. Some woman was in it too. Kiefer and Tom had had a romantic relationship. Tom and the girl had had sex then she pretended to forget about it to embarrass him. Someone planted a bomb somewhere."
"1903"	"(2008-02-07 (17)) It was really cloudy and dark. Calvin was staying at our house on a bed in my room. Soon though, he didn't. Anyway, we went to this place and we realized a tornado was coming. I was freaking and asking this girl if she had a basement or something. Everyone ran out and we were running too. The tornado kept 'following' us. We got to the car and then it was right behind us. Other people were driving away too. Some guy went on a boat because he thought that he could escape if he went on the water. The tornado was coming to him. It went away and Dad and I went home."
"1904"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) Some guy was really old, but no-one had seen what he looked like old."
"1905"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) I was at school. Eugene, Jeremiah and the others were in class."
"1906"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) I was at school. I was with Calvin somewhere. It was home time and the office had a line for Greeks and Macedonians to sign out. We went there one day and you also had to be born in January. We were standing behind Eugene. I read his sheet and it mentioned his father (Abraham) and his mother's last name was Cuthbert, which reminded me of Elisha Cuthbert. His home was called something weird like Bertz. His street was Schub and I asked Mom where it was later and she was like ""why?"". The lady at the desk (where you had to sign out) told Calvin that she would refer us if our birthdays were in January. We told a teacher and they said she had lied. I went to the toilets and some were open. I went into a cubicle and this girl stood outside, asking if I was female. They gave me a dildo. I like ""what the hell are you giving me this for?!"". Then I was watching Entourage and Turtle had a dildo of 'himself' on the bed. It was like rounded at the bottom and went into a point and had a smiley face on it."
"1907"	"(2008-02-08 (17)) Ari (Entourage) was at his office. There were two offices next to each other and one was his wife's. He had some woman in his office and his wife came. He said ""Don't go in there"" and she looked upset. The woman came out and his wife went in. Then the wife left. He wasn't cheating."
"1908"	"(2008-02-09 (17)) We were at Nana's. We had this little room there or something. The backyard was different. Ezra, Dad and Roland were there too. It went a bit funny and sometimes I was me, and sometimes it was these two groups of people (2 boys and 2 girls) and they were coupled up, but were trying to hide it from their family. One had sex with her boyfriend and also had her period another time. Roland was less yuck and we ended up going out. Time passed and we had had sex and stuff. No-one knew. Dad and Ezra were out the back and there was hedgehog slice. Fido had a swollen lip. Then we were at a video shop. I think some bad people came so I decided to take some movies, but I hadn't heard of any. I was looking for Firefly and Entourage. I saw a Goosebumps book and put one in my bag. Then we were doing something there. Someone had attacked these little kids. Devil Fish was there and he went off somewhere. This kid pointed out this alarm device which was a phone. They ordered fish and chips. Kylie Minogue was then there and she ran to Devil Fish through this mirror maze. He shot her boyfriend. Then we were there. Eugene was there and I was wondering why I wasn't going out with him. Devil Fish was going against us. Then we were at this school. These kids were following me and I couldn't eat, so I told this teacher to take care of them or I was going to kill them. Rodney and Daryl were there."
"1909"	"(2008-02-09 (17)) I was driving with Mom. I saw Classmate-F-17 and someone else from my class in 2002, in red dresses. I told Mom I knew them and she wanted to give them a ride and I said no. We were at a shop and Ezra was there. Paulina was there and she came near me."
"1910"	"(2008-02-09 (17)) I was watching Entourage. Drama was calling Ari 'Lala' because it was his ""proper name"" and Ari was like ""Don't call me that!""."
"1911"	"(2008-02-10 (17)) I was at Nana's. She had this swampy fish pond with frogs and she was trying to get them to kill them. She pulled one out and it was covered in seaweed. She was giving it food and water to tempt it over. It jumped on me and was snuggling and then it was a cat. Later, I was driving this thing and was looking out for animals and crashed into this thing and hurt myself. Then it was later and Aunt Sally and Dad were watching this thing where they were acting like mimes. There were three cousins and one was old, and one was a boy, and one was a girl. Dad, Ezra and I drove to this fair and saw a friend or a relative and said ""good luck Eugene"" -- he was going to have photos taken with a retard. Then Ezra and this girl had stuff in common and this guy and I were looking at ""nerdy"" stuff. The girl was making Ezra buy her stuff and asked him to the prom."
"1912"	"(2008-02-11 (17)) I was at school. Calvin was there. I saw some dude with a dark blue, dirty uniform on. Evelyn and Calvin were like ""What's that smell?"" and I was like ""Oh, you think everything smells"". They said it was the guy, but he was pretty far away and I said ""Oh, can you smell him from that far away?"". The guy was kind of hot and he walked past us and went into this cave. An old, ugly guy came out. Calvin and I were talking to him and he said they had an elephant in there. I figured they were zookeepers. We chatted for a while but then we had to go to class. During class, he came in and said ""Don't forget to deliver that note!"" and I was like ""what note?"". I checked my bag and found it. A while later, I told the teacher I needed to deliver it. She gave me a card to sign. I left and was talking to the guy but realized I forgot the card and went back to get it. Calvin was there talking to him when I got back. He said ""Do you want a dog? Do you want a wildfire?"". I said ""Well, I don't want the wildfire!"". He said it was dangerous and said, about fire, ""Oh, well I like them!"". I was going to say 'not over in [where Nana lives] ' because of Nana, but I was eating. I thought he was going to let us work with the elephant. Then Calvin and I were on a platform. There were all these cars and people. A bus left, full of people from a different school. Two girls were talking to us. One said something about wearing the school shirt normally, which she said meant that it was tied up behind you. I said ""No, that's called the bust way"". She said I should fold my shirt up to ""let your hair show"". I was completely confused and asked ""what?"" and she took her pants off. Then she said ""Maybe it's too soon"". Then she was naked and her friend was almost naked. When I complained she attacked us, but then left. Then this guy and I were going out. Sometimes, I wasn't me. We were going to be having sex later. He thought I liked the zookeeper guy (the young one). I said ""Oh, Parker? No!"". These bad guys went after some guy. This woman was pretended to be hanging off a cliff. They were helping her and she had glue on her hands. This guy jumped onto this little bit sticking out of the cliff. Then this guy who looked like Xander Berkeley said he wouldn't do something until they ""put a ring on my finger"". They gave him a silver ring and then he asked for a door handle thing. He put it on and he walked away and didn't do what he said he was going to do."
"1913"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I was watching Entourage. Turtle's girlfriend (Lauren London) was coming over. Ari wanted to see her, so he hid in the apartment and his wife was behind the door. Turtle and his girlfriend were lying in bed. Later, Turtle was saying how all he did was complain about his father. Then this girl was married."
"1914"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I was somewhere in the car with Dad. There were all these llama signs everywhere. There was a costume house. Calvin told me about these green shorts. The shop was gay and people 'jumped' on the car. Ezra was there. We went to a friend for something. We were young and with this girl. I was then not there, and was replaced by Elisha Cuthbert. The friend, who was a guy, did something and told Mom to leave and he said he wasn't going to do anything to me. Later, she met with this girl and got something off her."
"1915"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) The Drifters were on TV. They were singing this weird song, and they sounded weird and they kept repeating ""You know I'll always love you"". I was looking for Ben E. King but I didn't know what he looked like."
"1916"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I was walking down some street with a girl and others. It got dark and we saw someone and it was Jason Lee, so we brought him along for protection. People kept attacking us, but Jason scared them all off. Then I decided we should run down this alley. There were lots of people in the alley. I couldn't punch properly and thought it was a dream, so that I could punch and I hurt my hand. Then it was Max and Liz (both from Roswell) and they were in her father's water bed. This bad guy was sucking them into it. Liz was swimming up and just as her head came out, he pulled her back down and I was annoyed.  Then her father and someone were looking for her. It showed the bed and there was movement under the sheets and they were naked in bed. The father saw them and Liz was like ""Dad! Pops!"" and it was awkward."
"1917"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) I saw Mr Gutenberg and he had long hair and it was black."
"1918"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) Calvin was in an accident because of some drunk people. Later, Mom, Ezra and I were driving. Mom was going fast and I said ""slow down"" and she did and then she suddenly went fast again."
"1919"	"(2008-02-12 (17)) Mom said that she thought Spaceman was a girl. Ezra and I were looking but we noticed that he had a bum and a penis, and was definitely a male."
"1920"	"(2008-02-13 (17)) Ezra kept hanging outside a guy up the road's house. He was an old guy and kept getting annoyed at Ezra. Ezra and Mom thought he might also be killing or raping (and killing) kids and burying them in his backyard. Ezra was digging there one night, but he found nothing. Dad told Ezra that the guy was moving soon."
"1921"	"(2008-02-14 (17)) Mom and I went to this house and she waited for a while and called them, but no-one came out so she figured that no-one was home and left. We kept going around this roundabout. Then she remembered that he would sometimes move to this other apartment so the next door neighbours wouldn't get suspicious. We went to the other apartment and Kevin Connolly was there. We were really nervous around each other and I liked him. Then I was watching Entourage and he, Drama and Turtle lived together. I had to 'make' Drama's breakfast, which was this food in a tube. Turtle was asleep in a bath. I had to feed a cat. Later, they were playing poker with an old lady and they won heaps of money. The next door neighbour was listening to them. Then there was a party and I was taking photos. Some people got a photo with Marilyn Manson. I was driving and I was at a roundabout. There was another guy driving and we almost crashed because he didn't indicate properly."
"1922"	"(2008-02-15 (17)) I was at some house and they had something that was like a serial killer (don't remember what it was). Then I was wandering around and I ended up killing someone and their brain was hanging out. I also killed some other person. I grabbed some disc of some science thing and got out of the house through this window. I was walking along the street and this girl followed me for a while. I went into this house and called Mom and told her what I did. She was making swallowing vomit-y sounds. I got a message from Dad saying he was on the way and I was crying because if he had been sooner he could've stopped me. He picked me up and then we went to this meeting that he went to regularly. He had an e-mail from Malcolm McDowell (they were friends). He was also friends with some director guy. People from school were there. Daryl asked me how my job was going and I said ""it isn't"". We were walking together and Mom was walking in front of us. I said that I was quiet so I could ""play more games"" and he laughed. Mom looked around and asked if he was Lumpy and he said his name was Daryl Kemp and I said ""I call him Lumpy"". Then Calvin and I were talking and he said that he heard something about Mr Fantastic (Fantastic Four). I said I already knew he died and he was like ""how?"" and I said that I was there (I had killed him) but I told him not to tell anyone because we were pretending that I wasn't there. I went to some shop with Evelyn, which was where she worked. There were some weird dancing things. Some L plates broke and we got some yellow card to replace them. I was walking with Calvin through the back of the shop. I was singing along to the song on the radio. I heard Dmitri saying that new music was ""rubbish"". Then I was at school and we were in the common room which was bigger and really different. Eugene and someone came in. After heaps of people were in there someone locked the door. Eventually they unlocked it. This teacher gave out ice-creams. They gave a blue one to Eugene, a pink one to Bradley and mixed ones to Darius and Jeremiah. I went into some room and this lady teacher was telling me how she would design it if it were her home. Earlier Mom was in a carpark and she parked smoothly into a spot and this other car drove past the area. Then it reverse parked into the spot behind her car. Lloyd (Entourage) was driving it and Ari (Entourage) was yelling at him."
"1923"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) I was at home. Ezra, Bradley and Dad were in the lounge. We were playing some game on the Wii. Bradley finished and I tried it but I kept moving too fast."
"1924"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) I was watching Alias. Ezra had been watching it all. I didn't recognize what was happening. There was a black guy on the screen and I asked if it was Carl Lumbly. Then someone said something about a virgin and I remembered that I'd seen it."
"1925"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) Mr Reilly was at his house and this guy was harassing him."
"1926"	"(2008-02-16 (17)) I was looking on top of a bookshelf at home. I found some old Christmas presents. One was for Granny. I opened them. I was going to ask Dad what was going on with my car."
"1927"	"(2008-02-18 (17)) I was at 'home'. It was around 9pm and it was creepy and I was worried that someone was going to come in. I was sitting on a lounge watching TV and I called Mom. I told her I was feeling nervous and she asked if I wanted to go back to her place and I said that Dad was going to be home soon. Then the front door opened and was banging."
"1928"	"(2008-02-18 (17)) The world had been separated into cities. They were surrounded by 'bubbles'. A protector would walk around the outside, guarding them. Some guy wandered into this party. It was day time and was outside. Marlon Brando (like in The Godfather) was there and I was like ""Ooh! Marlon Brando's gonna kick your butt!"". I was thinking that I should watch On The Waterfront today. This tiger jumped to get something and then Marlon was petting it. This guy gave this girl an engagement ring and she was like ""What does it mean, anyway?"". Outside the bubble, it looked like Super Mario Galaxy. Someone said ""you sleep at night, and hope you don't get killed""."
"1929"	"(2008-02-19 (17)) I came home and the kettle was on. Mom was there. I watched an episode of The Young Ones. Then I had some notebooks with me and they all had stuff about Eugene in them. People from school were there and we were in the games room. Calvin was there and he kept trying to get my notebooks and then an assembly was called. He asked what letter the person I like's name started with. He said ""Mellena?"" which meant Eugene. I had this ribbon thing and Calvin and I were playing with it. He gave Lucia another end of it and they were pulling on it. I saw some orange scissors so I got them and cut her side and we were then 'fighting', but not really and she said that she doesn't want to come between Calvin and his ""ex-best friend"". I said ""I didn't even know we were best friends, let along ex-best friends!"". Genevieve was also there and she had Breakaway in her pocket. Then Mom, Ezra, Dad and I were at some place. We stopped the car and got out. I tried to ask what was going on, but they just looked at me funny. I realized they were going to the shop. Then I was at some place with the school and there were rabbits. People had had sex with them. I was playing with a black one. Samantha had one and they were selling them but first they were having an auction. Payton was next to Samantha and she let hers go and it went down the side of some stairs. It looked at her and I said ""You gaylord"". Then I was at this other place and Calvin and I decided to wag. We were walking together through these tunnels but we didn't know our way around. Eventually, we didn't recognize the people we were passing. Then we saw Ms Corbett, and then Mr Stevenson. We got past them and then we were walking across this oval full of little kids. They yelled out ""Hagrid August Underground"" (which was a movie made in 1918 and this guy knew where to go if they called it out). The guy came after us and he caught Calvin first. I grabbed this fridge, and it opened and smelled really bad. I hit him and he fainted. I walked back across the oval and Edward Norton was walking up and I kicked him in the head and knocked him out. Then I was at home. I looked out the window and saw 3 cars. I thought this little white one was Darren's. I didn't know who the others were."
"1930"	"(2008-02-20 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom and Ezra went off and I found this Entourage shop. I was thinking of getting an Ari thing. I went back to Mom and told her. Ezra went to get food. He found this place and the guy gave him a free sample and gave me some too. It was really nice, but it was fattening. We got food from somewhere else and I tasted Ezra's chips and they were really nice. There was something about a Top 100 guys list. George Clooney had won from 1986-1996 or something. There was a car with Colin Farrell and some other guy in it. A friend of Mom's said ""thought you weren't eating, that you were on a diet"" and I said ""I am, but these chips are so nice""."
"1931"	"(2008-02-20 (17)) I was at 'school'. Eugene said something to me and I was going to ask him to repeat it but I felt uncomfortable talking to him and I didn't."
"1932"	"(2008-02-21 (17)) I was at school and in a gym. Autumn was there and she was a bit loopy. We got put into groups and Autumn pulled out a gun. She said she'd shoot my group or the other group. I think mine was bigger so she was lining up the other group to shoot them. Daryl was in the other group. I was then thinking ""She'll probably let them go now"" and she did. Someone noticed a scar on the back of her head -- she had a 'lobotomy'. There was food in the gym. I grabbed two of these chocolate things and left. I went to the common room which was bigger and different. Eugene and Darius were sitting in a chair behind ours. Calvin and I were on ours. Eugene was singing Love is All Around and I starting singing a little of it, quietly. Calvin said ""Look around, it's your boyfriend"". I was recording Eugene singing. Then I remembered that Mom was picking me and Ezra up so I left. I had some clothes on a clothes line and took mine off. Ms Pascal came and I asked if I needed help. I went to the car and Ezra was in the backseat, and I was wondering why he wasn't in the front. Then he moved to the front. Later we were in a car accident. The tip of my nose was bleeding. I think someone died and then I was at Mom's and Darren was making jokes and Mom told him who died and Darren decided to kill himself. Later I was playing a game and Darius was watching me and I was like ""Go away""."
"1933"	"(2008-02-21 (17)) I found out that Eugene actually lived at 44 Casserley Ave. I went driving down there with Mom and it was a fancy house. I got out of the car and was going to take photos of it, but I heard someone talking to Eugene, so I stayed back. Somehow I ended up in the house. There was something that said his middle name was Trenton or something. His father was called Eugene as well. His mother said something that implied I'd been noting down all this information on Eugene and she gave me hers, Eugene's and Abraham's (his father's) birth certificate."
"1934"	"(2008-02-22 (17)) I was at school and in Accounting. Autumn was there too and I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was lunch time and Eugene was outside (and he had been there before). I went to the bench but it was in a different spot and we had another bench that we were using. Evelyn was on the old bench. I had to give Darius something of mine and it had my middle name on it. I was thinking that I wanted Eugene's. In English, Ms Madsen said we had an assignment due."
"1935"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I went to Midvale shops. It was dark and raining. We had a 4wd type of car. Mom went into the shop and Ezra and I waited outside. It flooded and there was a deep 'hole' next to the car. It all filled up and it went past my door at the back of the car. It wasn't past the door on Ezra's side (the left side). Mom called Darren to tell him to get something to get us out. Mom came out later to check on us and Darren still hadn't come -- he had seen a friend instead. Then we were somewhere else and this Cloverfield thing happened. The monster was throwing stuff around. It went over a bridge holding 'balls' of people (they were wrapped up in a ball). I was looking up at it. These people had also bought a new home. After the flood and the monster, I was wondering if they would get a new house (the house they had had survived, though). We were hanging around and Thuy and Raquel were there."
"1936"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) I had a school photo and Forrest was in it, but he was young and odd looking. He was called Forrest Pock. My eyes were big in the photos."
"1937"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) I was at home. Ezra and I were looking at the pool. I complained that I ""just filled it up yesterday, now it's going to overflow"". I thought Dad must've cleaned it up because he knew I swept the backyard."
"1938"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) I was in chemistry. Elijah pat me on the back. I wanted to sit next to Elijah and Autumn but Autumn had moved."
"1939"	"(2008-02-23 (17)) We were on a bus. We got called on by our last names. We were young and Calvin was there. The guy said the left side had to be filled first."
"1940"	"(2008-02-24 (17)) Some people and I went back in time to the 80's. Most of it was the same (hair, clothes and DOS), but there was a train which went pretty fast and we had to use it because we couldn't go outside. This lady was on a computer and it was kind of spiffy. We had to sit in the seats. There was a guy outside and the train place's gate. This monster came and ate him. There was an interview with Colin Farrell on the TV and I was thinking that he looked like Tony (24). Then we were sitting at desks. I sat next to Jeremiah. Darius and Eugene were there too.  Something hit me and I squeaked and they thought it was funny."
"1941"	"(2008-02-24 (17)) I was out the back. Clark Kent and Chloe (both Smallville) were in the pool. I asked Mom for some water. She gave me some and I went in the pool. I accidentally swallowed some pool water. I got out and was almost vomiting (it tasted gross). I took a drink and spat some out. There were maggots and these big worms in it. The worms had this metal looking armour on them. I complained to Mom ""There are maggots in the water! That's disgusting!""."
"1942"	"(2008-02-24 (17)) There were these houses. One had bright green on it. Some guy told a cop that he and some others (including some guy called Cooper Anderson) were part of a group. I told him to pretend. I went to the other guy's house and was begging him to let me in and he kept refusing. I gave him $10 and then he let me in. I explained to him that they were in a 'group'."
"1943"	"(2008-02-25 (17)) Ezra and I were at home watching a zombie movie. Some girl in it thought she looked like some snowman thing. We heard a loud thumping noise and we were hiding under the recliners. I went outside and there were people on the roof. I saw a glimpse of some big red thing. They motioned for me not to say anything to Ezra. Eventually they beat the red thing. Dad got home. The door wouldn't lock with a key anymore. Then it had been a game and I had defeated the red thing and I was now level 2."
"1944"	"(2008-02-25 (17)) I was somewhere and I was dying of thirst. I was trying to get in the McDonald's drive thru, but cars kept coming. A lady helped me pull myself behind her. I was then in a car with Mom and we asked for water. The girl was going to give me two cones. One was with chocolate and ice-cream and the other one wasn't. I was like 'what the hell?'. They had this big fancy chocolate thing which was $900. Mom said that there was a gas leak or something. I asked how she knew and she just stared at me. This brother and sister, who liked each other, had died on this evil Ferris wheel thing. I had warned them before they went on it. This lady had kids that looked exactly the same."
"1945"	"(2008-02-25 (17)) I was reading a magazine and it had lots of stuff about Frank Whaley."
"1946"	"(2008-02-26 (17)) I was playing a game and showed Mom, but she just wanted to do some statistics thing and I said ""I'm the one who's suppose to love that!"". The game was a zombie game and you were part of a group and you had to walk around and try to survive. Then there were dogs and some were infected. There were doors which we were told could get knocked down and those that couldn't. But the dogs kept getting through the strong doors. Then it was real and I was with Dad, Ezra and some others. We were hiding out in this home in an apartment building. The room was surrounded by windows and we didn't close the curtains. Outside, there were hands all over the windows and the top half of the windows was all brown and cloudy. The dogs came through and were attacking me and someone shot them. Then they went and Dad was like ""I don't know how they got through"". I was planning to wake up ready to get the gun and shoot. I asked Dad how to get the safety off and then he decided to show me all the features of the gun. He and Ezra were going out for dinner tomorrow night (for Ezra's birthday and my birthday) and I said I might go. He said that celebrities were going to be there, including Kevin Spacey so I thought ok. Eugene was then there with some other people. They shot two zombies and one got hit. I went to go to bed and then the dogs came but only one got in. Then I was at home. Dad woke us up and he went in the pool or something. I had a cold. Ezra and Mom were there too. Mom kept humming Do You Really Want to Hurt Me and she kept calling it Karma Chameleon. I said ""It's only... 28 years ago!"". Ezra threw some food and Dad was like ""you'll attract the dogs"". Kiki was next to a shed having some babies. They all had orange on them. One was kind of nasty and then they turned into cute toddlers. I think one of them was allowed to get a cat called Scotty and people laughed. We were going to watch a zombie movie and I said ""Nah, I dreamt about zombies last night"". Then we were at Nana's. Someone was talking about Victoria Beckham and I said she was ugly. Mom was there and so was Alyssa. I said that you'd have to be desperate to marry David Beckham."
"1947"	"(2008-02-26 (17)) I went to Mom's and I asked her how she was locking up (to prevent the dogs) and she said she wasn't. I was like ok. She kept talking about Spaceman."
"1948"	"(2008-02-27 (17)) I was at home. Dad wanted me to print and scan stuff for him. Then he was going out. It was like 11pm or something and it was creepy so I called Mom and she said she'd be 10 minutes and I asked her to be quick. She also said she looked for season one of 24 and I said ""We've got it"" and I found it and put it aside to give to her. A car pulled up and I looked out the door. It was blue and not Mom's. I got my phone and went to call her but then she pulled up behind them. Some skinny guys got out and I said ""Go away you stupid fat blobs!"" and they laughed. Mom was asking them what they were doing here. They said they had been here last night. One had an accent like in The Green Mile. I made fun of him. I opened the door and found this metal pole thing and hit them over the back and they all fell. One of them was then Ezra and one was Evelyn. Then we had an excursion and we were at a shop. Calvin and I wandered around. We ate lunch and I had a ham sandwich. Eugene and Bradley sat near us. Then the four of us went away from the others. Eugene went over somewhere to pee and Calvin was like ""Look at your boyfriend Eugene"" and I looked over and his bum was showing. I laughed and I took a photo and he was like ""hey!"" and swearing. So I was filming him, but then he was laughing and was ok about it. Then it was dark and I was filming with Calvin's phone because it was better. Mom was then at the shop and she was looking at some fluffy jackets. Tucker walked past and she was like ""What the hell is that?"" and I said he was the one with a dead Mom. Daryl was there too. Then we were at a house. Elijah was there. We were gathering stuff and it was a game. I was getting something past Dad and he asked if I was playing this game called 'Whatever'. Calvin, Elijah, Samantha, others and I put this video camera in water. It exploded."
"1949"	"(2008-02-28 (17)) I was at school, I think. I had this room there. I went in and Darius followed me, so I closed the door and pushed him out. He kept trying to come in. Later, Eugene and others and also Clayton, were coming out of class. All these people came to my room. Silas and Calvin were there. Darius came again and I was thinking of Evelyn. There was music on TV. Electric Avenue was on but I thought it was It's My Life at first. There was also a song by Kevin Connolly but he was called Eric. Everyone loved his song. I was then in class and we were reading out some essay with a spelling mistake. I called the person sitting next to me a retard. It was my essay and I showed the teacher that it wasn't a spelling mistake but a typing error. Dad wasn't allowed to watch 24 because of the error. I was then somehow with these two people who had been handcuffed together. One of them was Jack (24), and he was rogue. They were both good guys though. This plane flew over and I thought they were going to crash into the building. We ran from this car and I stopped thinking that I would get in trouble. The 'police' and Aaron (24) came. Then they went to Christopher Walken's place and asked something and he had changed his name because of Jack (not sure why). Christopher thought that the police were there because of something he had done and refused to talk. Jack was hiding over the fence. I had a puppy. It was really cute and it had big feet. It was black."
"1950"	"(2008-02-29 (17)) We went to some old friend of ours' place. They had dark skin and a son my age. We had been friends when we were younger and he had liked me (at first he was white, and he was really hot). Suddenly we were somewhere and he was touching me. Then Ezra, Mom and I woke up in a field somewhere and this bloke was running to be King (it was the olden days). I was speaking English and he was like ""You shouldn't be speaking English!"" and I said ""I don't know any other languages!"". There was a map of the country there and it was wrong so I drew over it. Then I was at a place with some people and they had TV shows there (including Roswell) and also had Goosebumps books. They also had some other show I used to watch. I commented that I liked Goosebumps books. Then Ezra, Mom and I were doing some exercise thing in a forest place. We had to do it non-stop but we weren't. I had missed calls. Three of them were from some L-plate thing. One was from a guy saying I was scary on the road. Someone else said that my driving sucked."
"1951"	"(2008-03-01 (17)) I was at school. We had an excursion but Autumn and I had finished the work so we got sent next door to this church place which was a big class. I sat next to Autumn who sat in a row with Darius and Jeremiah. Bradley was in the row behind and Eugene was on the side of the class doing private study. The class was all to do with puzzles and stuff. Then it got confusing and Theodore was in a movie called Elijah. The teacher was talking about something and they paired me and Eugene together for a question and everyone thought it was funny. Then it was in a movie and Eugene was going to kiss this other girl so that people would stop saying stuff about us but then he was Theodore again and he kissed some girl. Then Darius was annoying me. I complained and said to someone that they ""should advise them that I'll kill them"". We were then in a little class and we had to sign our names and the teacher said it looked like something. The class was sport but Darius never did it and I didn't either. Then I was at some place with Indians and they were doing a dance or something. I took photos. Then it was lunch and I was late to the common room because my leg was hurting. I asked Evelyn if it looked odd."
"1952"	"(2008-03-02 (17)) I discovered that Leslie had been murdered (stabbed). The night before I dreamt that she died -- her car had flipped over neat the roundabout on Princess Rd and I told Mom later but she already knew (that Leslie was dead). Then I was at some place with a bunch of school people. Some were people I knew and some weren't. There was a killer and we didn't know who he was. Sometimes it went third person and it was my Sim, Alex Goth. Some people saw him and then later, he shaved and looked completely different and escaped with everyone else. Then it was back to my point of view and we discovered that the killer looked like Marcus Alvers (24), but hoter. He had these blood slides and was throwing them at people. I managed to take them off him but he kept getting more. I'm not sure what happened but I think we liked each other and I let him go."
"1953"	"(2008-03-03 (17)) I was at Nana's in a garden. I went behind this shed and there was stuff growing so I went to run but Poppa and Fido came and Poppa was then some shifty person and I called out something. I was then at a table in a room with Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere. They were sitting close together doing some Heroes thing. I was thinking about stuff and Milo and I were having an affair. Dad and I went to go to this place to watch House but we missed it. There was a killer at this place and it was Tony (24). He killed someone then the alarm sounded and he left. Then I was the killer and some psychologist was talking to me in this house about when I killed the person and why."
"1954"	"(2008-03-05 (17)) It was about a year before Mom's birthday. I was planning it and I got all these people from school to do a presentation thing. Everyone had a fish and I had tanks. Calvin, Samantha and others were playing a 'hide-and-seek' computer game. Calvin reminded me that I had 15 seconds left (the game). But it said I had 50 minutes. Mom came and said she wanted to take us shopping for her birthday rather than shop for herself. I was thinking 'Sims 2!'. Clayton did a presentation too. Ezra and Clayton were staying over. Then Dad took them back to Mom's and got dinner. We went to some weird bank building and we left and then we went to this old school of Mom's. It was then her birthday and we brought her to her old house (but it wasn't) and people started coming in and she was like ""Oh this is great, but I have to go"". I was at home and putting the rest of the presentation together. Some evil guy was around and Dad told me to stop all these singing things. The air-con suddenly became stronger and we realized he was here. There were some letters and one had something do with an elephant. There was some Greek thing. The guy came and stole someone's sister. We went to a sewer where he went. He was a Macedonian God. Someone shouted ""I am the werewolf!""."
"1955"	"(2008-03-06 (17)) We had camp and I went to school. We were told to meet somewhere. I saw Evelyn and asked her where to go and she said her house. I went there and was looking for Eugene. I saw Calvin walk past a window and he saw me and was laughing. I reminded Mom that I probably wouldn't like camp and she'd have to pick me up."
"1956"	"(2008-03-06 (17)) I was at school. We were in the common room, which was different. Someone liked this new kid. Scarlett and some others were talking about him and they said he liked someone else. They she asked who and they said ""He likes Izzy Conell"" and I asked who. They said the weird new kid, who likes ""dead things"". He came in later, but I didn't know if it was him or not. Calvin was showing people something and he tried to show Darius but he ignored him."
"1957"	"(2008-03-06 (17)) I was playing a game and I was at a hard bit with ""61mp/h"". I don't remember what you did though. The guy who created some challenge for it came and he was talking to me about it."
"1958"	"(2008-03-07 (17)) Ezra went into this guy's backyard to say a joke to this dog. It got angry and bit my thumb. The owner came out and was like ""What are you doing in my yard!"". The dog kept chasing us and the guy said he couldn't get it and we had to get out ourselves. I was looking for somewhere to hide. I found a big hole in the fence. I continued running from it. Then I was in a building and I swung from this rope and the dog did too. It started watching ballet. It was then a girl and she had to learn ballet. Then it was Sims 2 and the Sim's hobby was music but she liked ballet. I was trying to explain it to Dad."
"1959"	"(2008-03-08 (17)) Ezra and I had an assignment to do. There were two lots of people and we used to have a train to get to work and stuff but in the US, they now had to walk instead. Here, though, we still had the trains. I was watching 24. David Palmer was in a room and he was hiding behind a shelf. Aaron was behind another. They were calling out to each other and they had guns. Then Aaron caught David and it was actually a simulation. David was laughing because it was the only night they did something different or something. Tony had short hair and was now the bad guy. I asked Michelle to do something for Curtis and she got annoyed and lowered his rank thing. He went to go ask someone. Someone was saying that when Michelle was a baby she 'stung' her."
"1960"	"(2008-03-08 (17)) I was going out with Silas for some reason. We were all staying at this big hotel type of place (but it was one storey). I was somewhere near a forest and I saw this purple box. A guy came out of it. He left and I saw someone leaving in a purple box and it reappeared. It turned out he was from another planet. He came back later with some others. One of them and I became friends and liked each other. They looked like humans, except that some had pointy ears. At first, they wanted to take some stuff for their planet, but some came back to stay. We had separate rooms at the hotel place. Mine was across from Dad's and Ezra's was down the hall. Dad had the light off in his room and was watching 24. Ezra, the guy and I went down to this water place and there was a statue of a guy from his planet surrounded by Charmander statues. Then Pokemon were real. One was having a fight with a Dragonair. It was big and scary. I had my phone and the guy and I were trying to move quietly over the water and I trying not to get my phone wet. We went back to the hotel and Ezra was trying to make marshmallows. I had this stick in a cup which I burnt at night for water. He used that one and another one and they had marshmallows on them."
"1961"	"(2008-03-09 (17)) There was some Bonnie and Clyde thing. It wasn't actually them, but they were on the run. They stole a car and some people told the cops the plates on the car so they dumped it and looked for another. They took a van and ended up on a long road and they ended up at this place which was a school. This teacher lady was giving them trouble but eventually realized that they were ok and she let them take her car. The school was spooky and really rundown."
"1962"	"(2008-03-09 (17)) Hal Sparks was at a counter in a lobby. These two girls came up to him. One had short brown hair and she said that she was willing to ""sleep her way to the top. I want a room on the top floor"". Hal yelled at her and this big muscly dude said something about Hal being a man. I was laughing. Later, some guy took a girl and said they could have her back for $400. Then I was with Calvin and I said that Samantha wasn't coming because I traded her for someone. He said ""Who? Eugene?"" Then Lana Lang (Smallville) was there."
"1963"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) I had trouble sleeping because I kept feeling stuff on me. I had fallen asleep between 5-6am and then I woke up, so Mom was going to give me the day off. Ezra was there too. I was trying to think of what to say to Dad about having the day off."
"1964"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) I was at school. I was on a lounge in a room. I had this iPod thing which could take photos and video, so I was recording Eugene sitting next to me."
"1965"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) People had done some stories. One of them had my name in it."
"1966"	"(2008-03-10 (17)) I was watching Skins. I remember Sid and Cassie but nothing else."
"1967"	"(2008-03-11 (17)) I went out the back and there were two frogs in the pool. Dad came out too and there were some lizards. One was this long thing and Dad was like ""You mind if I don't hurt it?"". I said ""That's what I always say!"". I went back inside and there was a little gecko in the games room chasing me around. There was a yellowy lizard in the sink, which had appeared before I went out the back. I was rinsing out a bowl with hot water but changed to cold because I didn't want to hurt the lizard."
"1968"	"(2008-03-13 (17)) For some reason, Ezra and I were staying at Eugene's. Jeremiah, Eugene and I had been hanging out earlier and had been watching music on TV. They had realized that I liked 'different' music and they suddenly liked me. So, we were staying at Eugene's and his brother Rodney and his father Abraham were there. It was time for bed and I was looking around the house at the photos. I was looking at one of Eugene and I turned around and he was behind me. I said ""You're a ninja!"" and he laughed. Someone was getting some paint thing. The people doing it accidentally gave them a pool. They were like ""What do you think all these colours were for?""."
"1969"	"(2008-03-13 (17)) I was at school. I wasn't in uniform, but I don't remember why I was there. I went to leave and called Mom to pick me up. Ms Newberry saw me and told me off for having my phone. I said that I wasn't here today. I came back later and called Mom to pick me up again and she refused so I started walking. Elijah was walking in front of me and I caught up with him. There were these bags of fertilizer or something and we throwing them at each other. This blue stuff got on him. We were laughing and he fell and I got ahead of him. I got home and I called Mom."
"1970"	"(2008-03-15 (17)) Darren and Mom were at some weird guy's house. We ended up at their old house. We were out the back and it was really small. The fence was really low and we could see the neighbour (who was an old lady). I was looking at our old stuff, including a TV and a suitcase. We went inside and our old stuff was still there (no-one had moved in). I said we should go upstairs and check out our old stuff. Then this person dressed in black came down the stairs and Ezra ran out the front door, but I went back to get my stuff and the guy caught me and was hitting me with a baseball bat. This happened a second time, but we had powers. I could put up a force field and could 'shoot' sparks from my hands. Ezra had telekinesis. The guy turned into Chuck (Chuck). Then I wasn't me and he was asking people to sell something for $200 and they were like ""Take it for free"". Then I was sitting on top of a tall bunk bed. Theodore 'fell' out of the wall. He was climbing down and Elijah was coming up and he was like ""Theodore, where did you come from?"" and I said ""Out of the wall"" and Elijah was like ""Oh, he must've been somewhere"". I don't remember where he said he must've been. Then Bradley, Eugene, Ezra and someone else came up. I was waiting for Darius to join but he never showed up. I kept looking at Eugene and he kept looking at me and I felt uncomfortable. Ezra was taking photos and I wanted a photo of Eugene but he didn't take a photo of him. Then we were playing some game. You were given an 'event' and a random date. We were in this hotel looking lobby. This couple went to their room. Someone was saying they were going to have sex. This lady was talking and was on stairs, she sounded like Bette Davis. I worked out that she was a bad guy and went up behind her, but I don't know what happened then. Then we were in a building and there was a security desk. There was a key in it, which meant there were intruders. I was looking in the drawers for a gun, but there wasn't one. I grabbed some scissors and put them in my pocket. Some guy and I went back to the stairs. He went first and he suddenly stumbled back -- he had been shot. I ran. We had a list of all the people in the game and if they were dead, their name went bold. Then I think Eugene died or I couldn't find him so I reset the game. The new date was in some dinosaur time. The terrorists were really crazy in this one. Some people died and then this person and I came across them. This other person died and they were shooting at them. The guy was called Alex Rae. It was in slow motion, so I ran forward and across and they missed, but then there were like 30 bullets and some just scraped past. They set off a nuclear bomb and everyone in the area was dead. I was like ""Oh my God, Eugene!"". Then I was at 'home'. I went in Dad's room and was talking to him. I locked the door because this bad guy was there. Dad told me to open it. It opened a little and the guy was getting his gun out so I shut the door. I called Mom and she was all giggly and weird. I don't know what I said but I decided it was a dream and I woke up. Mom was still giggly and she just got back from seeing some guy. I was talking to her about my dream, omitting the parts with Eugene."
"1971"	"(2008-03-17 (17)) We were at some place. This guy and I were in a cubby house out the back of the place. We decided to bash up this cat to get at the owners. We pretended that it fell off the roof of the cubby, but I had actually kicked it a bunch of times. I was worried that they would notice the marks weren't caused by a fall. They couldn't work out what was wrong with it but suspected that it was us that hurt it. It got better and she made it follow me, by using smell. I could smell too. We were then going to the road (from Nana's) and were trying to hitchhike. A big van stopped and there were two people in the front, but the back of the car wasn't very big. They realized it wouldn't fit people and left. The police kept coming. We started walking down the street towards home. Elijah was then there and he reminded me that Mom had to straighten my hair. There was something about mini golf."
"1972"	"(2008-03-17 (17)) Ezra was watching Entourage. Mom gave a map of their house to Darren. Ezra and I were then on the street and I saw a cockroach and said ""That's the second biggest cockroach I've ever seen!"" (thinking the first was the one on my back the other week). Ezra picked it up and threw it at me and I could feel it crawling on me."
"1973"	"(2008-03-18 (17)) I was at school and I was in physics. The class was different. It was almost home time and Mr Reilly gave me and someone else some extra work to do. I had my iPod on, but it was in my bag. It wasn't loud, but I could hear it properly. I wanted to take a photo of Eugene. He leant over Josephine. Someone came in who had been missing most of the lesson. She said she'd seen an owl and it kept copying what she said and she freaked out and ran a mile and her friend had to go after her. I was then somewhere else in the school. Calvin was there and he pretended there was an emergency (a strike) so we could get our leavers jackets early. In 15 minutes they were all there in wheelbarrows. Ms Olmstead was there and I asked if I could hand them out."
"1974"	"(2008-03-18 (17)) I was at a house. There was a monkey and a crocodile outside. The monkey was big and black. Tigger was outside, so I went out to get her and put her inside. Later, I had trouble with the monkey which kept trying to get inside and I was having trouble keeping it out. Mittens was outside too, but I only got Tigger."
"1975"	"(2008-03-19 (17)) It was going to be cold so I was going to wear pants but I decided to wear a jumper instead. I went to school and I had an English assignment due in. That period, we had to film a music video and we had lunch 1 and 2 to edit it. I storyboarded it and tried to get Calvin, Samantha and the rest of my group to do it, but they wanted to talk instead. I was thinking we should do Maxwell's Silver Hammer again, but with big smiles on their faces. I was asking Ms Solomon about something. Then I was watching something and Betty and Daniel (both from Ugly Betty) kissed because some lady asked them to do something. There was a video camera on a computer."
"1976"	"(2008-03-20 (17)) Mom and Darren were at home. There was a movie competition on the radio. All the prizes had been won. I was reading something about it, and one of the questions was 'how many statues are in the world?', the answer being 350 and 325 were in the US. One was called ""The Water Kicker (?)""."
"1977"	"(2008-03-20 (17)) There were some kittens. Two were white, two were black and I don't know about any others. I saw a light one on a bed and I thought it had died a few minutes ago. I asked where Dad was."
"1978"	"(2008-03-21 (17)) I went on a bus. Calvin went and sat next to Lucia and motioned for me to sit next to him (it was a 3-seater) and I shook my head and sat down a few rows in front. He kept trying to talk to me and then came and sat next to me."
"1979"	"(2008-03-21 (17)) Calvin was staying over. We were sharing a mattress in the lounge room. There were lots of pillows on it. Dad and other people were saying that we got along really well. We were playing Animal Crossing and I was playing some old weird Pokemon game. There were Diglett's and Bullet-o-Bill's (Super Mario). Animal Crossing looked like Pokemon and you could go into mushrooms and then the mushrooms would be bigger than you. The Breakfast Club was on TV and I was making a soup. I was going to watch it, but then decided that I watched some yesterday and couldn't be bothered. Calvin threw pillows at me and then chairs and they were all on top of me. I was then putting the pillows back. This girl came and got him and they went somewhere. I went later and some girl and guy were getting implants. The guy was James Spader's brother -- they had the same chin. Nana came and was like ""I hope you're not going to take your clothes off! There are kids here"". Everyone was like ""What the hell?"". I was watching some movie and aliens accidentally shot a missile at their own planet, it made a noise and I was like ""What the flip? You wouldn't hear that!"". Ezra asked why and I said there isn't any noise in space."
"1980"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I was in this hotel lobby. Calvin, Samantha and others were there too. We were talking about something and Calvin said whenever we do certain things, Eugene is near us. Samantha was like ""Well, at least we know she (me) likes Eugene"". Eventually, I said ""Ok, well he (the person I like) doesn't have an 'I' in is name"". I was thinking of Dmitri and Daryl who were nearby. We were then at school, I think. At first we were in a little room and we had to play this game. This double agent lady unlocked a door and let us through. Each person had to use a different key. The first time I barely made it through because the bad guy came and was shooting. The second time, I got through quickly. Elijah got through as well. We had to run and go through some water and get onto this little raft, then go onto land and run up these stairs. The stairs led up to this weird broken building. The bad guy got in with a hostage. Eric Mabius was there. I said ""What's your name in this, Eric?"" and he said ""What? My middle name?"" and I said no and then he said ""Oh! My name in this is Cockwell"". I explained that the bad guy had infected the hostage guy with a virus. If we had it, he was contagious and we would die. I went looking for medicine. I found a book called ""Stop on Lily"" and I had a random flashback (I'd done it before). You weren't allowed to shoot your enemy once they were on your turf. Someone got autographs and photos with Greg and David from Big Brother 2005."
"1981"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I had a big playground. Mom cleaned some of it and the parts she didn't clean had fossil things everywhere. We were in a shop. It was Easter and I was having one egg a day, which was ""15g of fat in 3 days""."
"1982"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) It was the end of Saw 5 and the guy they played it on got blown up in a car. It zoomed in on the licence plate which was 8ZE-963. This detective dude was in his office and then Frank Whaley (who was the guy that got blown up) came in. Then we were somewhere. I realized they were going to blow up Mom's car. Mom, Ezra and I got all our important stuff out and went inside this house. Ezra was really slow and this guy was putting his hand in his jacket so I was telling Ezra to hurry. There were these cats inside and they kept going outside. One of the cats was that ugly one from Ugly Betty. One of the cats went out and I said ""Not Christopher Gorham!"". The doors were confusing. The car blew up. Someone had orange socks. This girl and I went to a house. It was Eugene's. His father (Abraham) was called Richard but liked being called Dick. I went to Eugene's room, taking note of the house layout. He was in his bed. He motioned for me to go next to him. He was watching TV. I was thinking 'Oh my God, I'm in Eugene's room'. I lay down next to him and he put his arm around me, then we were hugging and kissing. Later, I got up to draw a map of the house. Rodney wasn't in his room and there were school bags in there. His parents were in bed. I heard a noise like someone was trying to get into the house. I told Eugene. We got up and there was a guy in his parent's bedroom (they had a back door in there). They said something and we realized they were bad and we ran out the door. We were running on this roof and swinging from trees. Eugene saved me from the guys at one point, then I ran away when he was in trouble. This lady and another lady (who was a mole) were walking down a dark street. They told me to this old person's house and I had to use a weird hand held console (it was a game, but wasn't). I told Nana that people were coming to kill her, but she didn't believe me."
"1983"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I was watching the TV from the family room. Dad was in the dining room. They had something about Knocked Up and they were talking to Katherine Heigl, then they had Michael Cera on there. They had something about Juno and Ellen Page and Michael Cera. They didn't know who the father of the baby was. There was an interview with Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson and Christopher Ryan but it wasn't him."
"1984"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I went to watch episode 200 of Ugly Betty. It started and then I saw Lee Pace and realized it was Pushing Daisies."
"1985"	"(2008-03-22 (17)) I was at a place with Dad and Ezra. We were looking for a toilet. One was outside a caravan and I said ""I wish we were at Seabird"". There was a lady outside her house and her daughter (who was really young) was bruised and dirty and she was holding her by her hair and being really violent. We were going to go and do something, but the lady kept looking at us evilly."
"1986"	"(2008-03-23 (17)) I was in bed and I heard a weird scratching noise, then this grill next to my bed opened and Mittens came on to my bed. I was wondering where the grill came from and I told Dad. He did this spiffy thing to my roller shutters and checked out the front to see if anyone was out there. I went out to the family room and Mom was there. She was going to go outside to clear a table for something she was going to do. I saw a guy in the dining room and he pointed a gun at me, then at Mom. I said ""Why is Aragorn [something I don't remember] ?"". Then Dad came out too. The guy made us put these shirts on, then he was Ezra and it was the future or an alternate universe. He was a bad guy. We were on a space ship. Ezra was watching 24 and I realized that I'd missed two episodes of season four. There were faces of characters on a computer screen. I saw Tony and Barry Landes and was thinking about The Hitcher and ""I can't believe that's creepy dude!"". Dad and I were saying ""Yeah"" like Tony. Then it was third person, and there was this big room. Betty and Daniel (both Ugly Betty) were there and he got shot and all these flower petals were falling from the roof."
"1987"	"(2008-03-23 (17)) I had to do an oral presentation and I quoted from some paper thing and threw fake money in the air. Elijah was there. Then I was at a university and I had a piece of paper which was supposed to be my timetable but it made no sense. There was a room with lots of computers."
"1988"	"(2008-03-24 (17)) I was at 'school'. There was this clothes shop and I was in there. This girl there used to be a guy. Her coat came off and I gave her my coat (which was black and big). I was trying to pick another coat for her. I complained about all the clothes. Darius had met this girl and was looking for her. He was bisexual. He thought he had found her, but it was a guy. Later I had messages from Darius and he wanted to know what his name was. His name was Allan Green. I had a message from Eugene but I don't remember what it said, but it was really funny. A lady saw me using my phone when I was texting Darius and she sent me to the office. At 2.55pm, Ezra got sent there too. I messaged Mom to get her to put $500 towards my car. She was getting a new roof in a few weeks."
"1989"	"(2008-03-25 (17)) On the way to school, I was tired and I fell asleep. When I woke up it was 11am and we were still in the car. Dad explained that Doom 4 had come out and so he bought it. When he got home he was setting up the Xbox 360. Later he said that on Wednesday night, I had to go to school to do my English essay. Then they said it was at 12pm. Then Dad and I were at school and they said it was on Saturday. Then Ms Solomon changed it to the 16 March. Mr Stevenson said I was doing badly at school and had to talk to some teachers. Then I was at Nana's. Ezra was there too. There was a weird insect there; it was like a spider with a shell. It was extremely dangerous (its bite was). Ezra and I were running from it. We went to go inside and it followed us and we climbed up the door. I went up to Granny's and I was doing my essay there. I was sitting at this table outside, but it was too high. Fido had puppies."
"1990"	"(2008-03-25 (17)) I was at 'home'. This guy had been annoying me for a while and it went Ugly Betty like and it showed him going to use me for something. I didn't like him though. Then he had a party and I was wondering what he was doing. Henry (Ugly Betty) came and he was my boyfriend and when I saw him I was like ""Henry!"" and ran to him and hugged him."
"1991"	"(2008-03-26 (17)) The school was having a prom. This rich kid's birthday was on the same day, so his father did the birthday party, which doubled as the prom. The kid was Classmate-M-22. The song Sadie Pritchard Dance was playing. This guy who looked like Christopher Gorham was there and he had an engagement ring on and said some other guy did too. I had been downloading a video of the party before it happened. My hard drive was screwy though and I had to press down on it a bit because it was bent. Darren, Ezra and Mom were at a house because Ezra had to get something. I had this photo from school and Isabel was in it. Gossip Girl got cancelled and it was showing the way the new season would've started and all the characters morphed into the next one and it looked really cool. The only person I recognized was Leighton Meester."
"1992"	"(2008-03-27 (17)) I was at school. I went into the library for form but it was different. Eugene was in my form and he sat in the seat next to me (we were sitting at computers). Calvin saw and pointed. Autumn was there. There was an announcement for physics students to go to the office and get something. Eugene and someone went to get one for everyone. Silas was handing out road map books. He asked me to describe A Clockwork Orange. I was saying that the future was 'bleak' and technology was really good. Then I was thinking about the movie (but it was totally different with different people in it) and the main guy's house had all these moving things in it. I did media. Mr Billings told us to make a movie and I was trying to plan it, but no-one in my group was interested."
"1993"	"(2008-03-27 (17)) Dad was complaining to me about maggots."
"1994"	"(2008-03-28 (17)) I was at school. I was in a classroom and the siren was about to go. The teacher was talking and the class was full but I started walking out. I had to walk past Eugene. I was then at this house with Ezra. It was creepy. The reception was really bad and I kept getting texts from 'Poo'. They were like ""na est lie pa"", which really creeped me out. I showed Ezra. I said they were from Calvin's other phone. We watched this video of this person walking past a hallway and it scared us. They tried to get in the house. I was friends with Eugene's group and I needed Darius for something."
"1995"	"(2008-03-29 (17)) I found all these old video games. Some of them were ones I used to play when I was little. One was a dinosaur game and I was like ""Oh and you can change things into dinosaurs"". They were sorted by console and some were 'paper'. It had that fortune teller paper thing. This other dinosaur game was the ""saddest"" game. It was made in 1972. This other game was this one where you race along a road and pick stuff up and dodge obstacles. I said ""I used to play this with Uncle Vic""."
"1996"	"(2008-03-29 (17)) I don't remember properly, but Eugene was sitting with his friends a while away from me and we were watching something."
"1997"	"(2008-03-29 (17)) Mom and I were at some place getting tickets for something. I don't remember anything else."
"1998"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I was at home. Dad was working late, till midnight or something. I called his work, but he wasn't there. I felt uncomfortable so I called Mom and asked her to pick me up because I felt nervous. She said 'ok, be there in ten'. I was playing music and I heard a baby crying loudly from in the house. I didn't want to get up, so I didn't. I heard people talking and about ten minutes later, some people went into Dad's room. I went in and there was a guy and two girls at his laptop. I was like ""What the hell are you doing?"" and I got the baseball bat and I was hitting them, but it didn't seem to do much. They went back to the games room and there were heaps of other people there. There were some twins who looked like Hilda (Ugly Betty) and they called me ugly and I said ""Look at yourself!"". There was a hole somewhere and a blue block had been put there, but they had pushed it aside and came through. They all went out but I was worried they were going to come back."
"1999"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I had dressed up (but not really) for some thing and Bryson liked the outfit. We were in a car and Nana was saying that Bryson was amazed that I was ""pretty"". Darius was around and was annoyed at something."
"2000"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) We were at a hotel. I went into this guys room to use a ruler to cut out something I had printed (an obituary). Ezra was in this creepy guy's room and he was coming back so I warned Ezra. He managed to get out in time. There was this guy there called Kit who was really hot and we became good friends. He was then Eugene, and I think we got drunk one night and we started making out."
"2001"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) We were outside somewhere and I was driving to get out. Then there were all these dead ends in this carpark, so I drove over some curbs, but I went up this road and it went between these two waterslides (it wasn't actually a road). Then we were walking and the only way to get out was by going down this part of the waterslide. We had to lie down strangely so that it wouldn't hurt. Then this girl and I went into this section of the place to find the president, so we could get home. This guy saw us and started coming after us. Someone said something about David Palmer (24) and one of us were like ""David Palmer is gone"". Then someone said something and realized it was the president. He was black and bald and he turned around and I said ""Oh, Wayne!"". It was Wayne Palmer (24). We were talking to him and the girl said a gigantic thing had eaten her money. He was talking to me about wine and I said ""I only drink water man"". Wayne's assistant said there was ""a bloody bone"" in the boot of this car. Then it was Easter and we were at Nana's. For some reason, Eugene, Darius, Jeremiah and the others were there too. They were sitting at the big table and I was on the computer. They wanted to play Pub Krawl. Eventually Dad, Ezra and I were at the table too. Dad picked the Pub Krawl box up and I said ""We haven't played that in years!"" and I was thinking that we used to play it with Classmate-M-19 (from Coldspring)."
"2002"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I was watching Ugly Betty. Betty got bigger glasses and she smiled. She looked odd."
"2003"	"(2008-03-30 (17)) I was watching American Idol. They showed Michael Johns and then they had these African kids dancing. Randy Jackson said ""What is this, So You Think You Can Dance?"". One of the dancers, a little girl, had weird arms and they were wrapped up around her head. She had said something 'sad' to Simon Cowell and it had changed him somehow. She tried to do the same thing to Randy."
"2004"	"(2008-03-31 (17)) I was at school and I went to this place which would bring people back to life or fix them up (like an emergency room). I had brought in Will Arnett ages ago and I hadn't heard anything from them. As I walked to it, I was reminded of Ugly Betty and how Hilda was when Santos died and I was talking like Hilda and saying ""Oh my gawd!"". The place was full of people and I waited patiently, and finally I asked the girl there. She said ""Oh, it was Tom Arnett's body wasn't it?"" and I just said ""yeah"". She scrunched her face and said ""How do I put this..."" and I said ""Just say if he is dead or not"" and she said ""Ok, he's dead"". Then she was talking to Stephen Tobolowsky who was hanging around in the background. I was trying not to cry and walked back to school. Some boy was throwing this ball and talking to himself. I walked into the senior school block and said ""Geez, you're noisy"" to the kid."
"2005"	"(2008-04-01 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I were driving, but we were in Dad's car. I was with Dad at first, but it changed to Mom. There were deodorant cans or something on the road. This creepy, dirty guy was standing in the middle of the road and he put this yellow bin in the middle of our lane. The car was high enough to miss it, but we were like 'what the hell was he doing?'. We had to leave the car and we were walking through this swampy looking place. Mom and Ezra had been hurt and were looking for a hospital. There was some brown/green water, which was also bubbly. We had to cross it to get any further. There were some signs and one had stuff spelt wrong. Mom and Ezra went in it and started swimming, so I followed them. The next obstacle was below us (it was dug-out, like a pool, but with sand on the side and no water). We had to jump into it, but so that we would slide across this little slid-y bit on the bottom of it. Mom did that but she didn't slide and Ezra went and slid into her. I just climbed down the side of the 'hole'. The last thing was this trampoline and you had to get into this ""air swing"", which Mom said people had sex in. Ezra got into that and we had to get somewhere else. We finished it and Mom was like ""Why don't you want to have sex with the guy?"" and I was like ""Huh?!"". The guy came out and he was blonde and odd looking but he was pretty hot. Seamus was there playing a DS and I said ""Shiggan! You're still alive! We thought you'd been raped and killed"". He laughed. The guy was gay. Then Ezra was Seth Green and we weren't there. There was a fat girl there too. The guy said he wanted to keep Seth, but the girl was ""manlier"". She was crying and I was like ""What the flip? You're girly!"". Then it was us again. I was telling the guy that the guy with the bin reminded me of the Winkie's scene in Mulholland Dr. I went home and Ezra was going to stay with the guy. Then Dad got a text that Ezra was coming home."
"2006"	"(2008-04-01 (17)) I was in a room. This guy's phone had exploded before. Then his friend's phone was going to explode and he threw the bomb thing and I was like ""Now your phone's going to explode"" and he was like ""Damn it!""."
"2007"	"(2008-04-02 (17)) I was at school in math. Mr Gutenberg was there. We were doing some weird results thing and it was like a 3D bar graph. There was ""one drawn right and one with the right answer"" -- one was mine and the other was Eugene's. It happened with another thing too. Selena was talking to Alejandro about family trees and he thought she said cheese."
"2008"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) This guy had a little apartment. His friend caught up with him and then he left. The friend and I went back in. The guy was coming back and I hid in the shower. His friend tried to distract him and I had to move under this thing (that was like a bed). His daughter and her friend heard me and took a box that I was hiding behind away. Eventually the guy got distracted and I ran out. Then the guy came out and the daughter had told him I was in there. It had happened once before. I think the first time, Christopher Ryan was in the shower."
"2009"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) We were at a shop. This lady and I were poisoning apples. I was driving and I took off from the lights but then I had to stop quickly and I didn't stop in time and I hit the car in front of me. It then hit the car in front and that kept happening down this very long, busy street (domino effect). At the next set of lights, there was a huge accident. I asked Mom what I should do and she said ""die"". She brought me to this road that I had trouble with and I said ""Are you trying to kill me?"". She said it was so we didn't have to go to jail. Ezra was also in the car."
"2010"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) I was at Nana's. She was going to bring me to the hospital for some reason."
"2011"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) I was watching TV. This dating show thing was on and this guy, who wasn't bad looking, had three girls to date. One was blonde. The girls were sitting together and she said she was going to the toilet, but she called the guy instead. It showed the guy talking to the camera, saying about one girl, ""I got this virgin vibe"". He said about the other girls: ""They go off to the club and shower together"". It also showed the girls in a pool and he was looking at their boobs."
"2012"	"(2008-04-03 (17)) We had an excursion. There was a height and weight scale in this big clothes shop. It was really big and it went around in a circle and had spaces for six or so people at a time. When it was done you got this cool piece of paper with all this information on it. Elijah and Noelle were there. Everyone participated except for me. We saw Salim walking across this oval to get there. I wanted to ask if I could go on by myself."
"2013"	"(2008-04-04 (17)) I was at school. I don't remember properly, but Eugene and I were friends and I think he liked me."
"2014"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) This guy was making a movie. He cast Kevin Connolly in a role, but was originally going to cast Theodore. I was painting a room. Everyone there had a certain colour to paint with. Tucker was there. I had red. On the wall, already painted, was red, yellow, pink and something else (they were in stripes). There was a certain order but if we liked a spot more, we could paint there instead. The pink was called the ""mystery colour"". I don't remember what happened but Dad, Ezra and I were in a car. Sometimes Dad was Mom. These people in this other car were doing weird things. Mom had an argument with this lady, who looked like Liza Minnelli. Ezra wanted to read some diary extracts and I said no. We were at a house later and they had school photos there. They were from this thing that some students went to. I wondered if Eugene was there so I looked through them, but he wasn't. We were then in a room somewhere and I looked out the window and there was no ground; all there was outside was clouds and darkness. We were then driving. Elijah was with us. There were fireworks and people from school were like 'I haven't seen them in ages'. I was thinking about the stuff we learnt about fireworks in chemistry. This lady was driving and she went back up this road and trees were in the way and she stopped on a jetty. I said ""now someone's going to come and push off"". This car then started coming. I jumped out and ran. I ended up in front of this house and Dmitri opened the front fate and let me in. He told me to look for something and he was doing something with this weird thing and I was like ""Are you the Anti-Christ?"" (something about the Anti-Christ had come up earlier) and he told me to look at this thing, which then turned into this bright white light. I was then somewhere else. People didn't like us because of all these accidents that had happened to some people and they had died. We went to the Liza Minnelli woman later to apologize. Dad said he didn't want to have her ""on his butt"". Will Arnett was somewhere. Dad was watching a movie earlier. I was with Calvin somewhere."
"2015"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) I was outside at this place, which looked a little bit like a hedge maze. I was walking along a path and I saw Eugene and Darius coming down the other way. I was looking at Eugene. I was then in a house. Each house (or room) could only have a certain amount of people in it. It was raining. We had to go inside if it was raining or if it was hot (or we would die). The rain was dangerous for some reason. We had to lock each door to make sure no-one else snuck in. I had trouble locking a door. Then it was hot. Someone was trying to come in because someone inside owed them money. Then Dad and Ezra were outside and knocked on the front door and they said ""It's ok now"". We lived in a desert, because everywhere was now a desert."
"2016"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) I was in English and we were sitting in our groups. We thought we were going to be practicing our speech, but Ms Madsen had already started recording us."
"2017"	"(2008-04-05 (17)) I was walking outside with Mom. She was looking for Spaceman and I was calling out for him and I saw Cuddles. There was a big black cat on this video and its face was blurred. I was at home, which was really different. I was on my laptop and the internet wasn't working properly. Mom wanted me to go on some site. I was watching a bit of 24 and Tony was lying on a lounge and Michelle was on the TV."
"2018"	"(2008-04-06 (17)) I was at school. Fatima and Colleen were there. Fatima was asking me questions about our speech. I think she or someone else, were having sex with this random guy. Some people were making fun of me. Fatima had text me and I hadn't replied. I had a text from Colleen too."
"2019"	"(2008-04-06 (17)) I was at home and it was before school. I was playing a game on the computer. I lost track of time and Dad was like ""We're leaving now"". I had to get dressed and straighten my hair still. I said ""Look, just get Mom to drop me off"". It was already 9.30am. Ezra was there. They were like ""Oh, you'll just wag"". But, I wasn't going to."
"2020"	"(2008-04-08 (17)) Some band had done a song with Buddy Holly and the Crickets. I discovered that Ryan Cartwright was dead and looked him up on IMDb. They didn't have a death date on there, but I worked out that it was on March 2. I was reading posts on the message board and he had been murdered. People suspected his mother. I was doing heaps of washing. Acquaintance-M-01 called. Dad asked me what job would suit him and I said ""Computer... analyst?"", but that was what Acquaintance-M-01 was, and Dad was only saying it so he would stop asking him questions, so we had to think of something else."
"2021"	"(2008-04-09 (17)) Eugene was telling me about some speech he was doing. I was at Nana's. Then I was at 'school' and Mr Reilly was early and it had something to do with his wife. Then we were at this place and something had fallen into this water in front of this restaurant (it was like a long, square shaped pool, but it had a bridge over it and you didn't swim in it). Then Mr Reilly or I jumped in to get it. Some people helped us. It had something to do with his wife again."
"2022"	"(2008-04-09 (17)) I was at Fatima's. Some others and I were staying there. We went out for a walk. Her parents were really strict and annoying."
"2023"	"(2008-04-10 (17)) Mom and I went to a petrol station or deli. Ezra was on TV talking about Runescape and summoning. I was thinking that I wanted to do my summoning. Someone was questioning Mom about us, so she made us record a bunch of stuff so she could say she was with us. Some lady was in a building with another lady who she was protecting. The bad guys came and she said ""we gotta get out of here"". Then it was a game and on the screen there were lots of dots and it showed which dots were bad guys. I had to find a path where I'd be ok. Then I was at school and we were watching something which was really weird and I said ""It's like David Lynch!""."
"2024"	"(2008-04-11 (17)) Mom and I were at some weird place in the forest. It was dark. There were these hamster like animals with long snouts. They were doing some weird things, so Mom left a note on the cage saying that they had fallen and hit their head. We got a lighter, some gas and a lantern and it made a little explosion when we put them together. We then had light. We were walking down a path and if we leant forward and walked a bit faster, we would suddenly just go really fast, so we did that. Then we were at a village with a place to sleep. Then it was Eugene and I. We were in a room. He was in bed and there was another me and I was watching her. She was like ""Oh, I need my cappuccino"" and Eugene and I were like 'what the flip?'. He couldn't see me. I realized I'd been 'separated' and had changed the part of me that didn't like coffee. It was sometimes a game and I was little and jumped onto the bed and collected coins. Then I went in the kitchen and collected the coins in there. Then Ezra, Mom, Dmitri, Eugene and I were in a car. Mom went to a petrol station and Dmitri was in the driver's seat. This guy went to Ezra's side and asked him to write a note about the car and started going to the driver's side to take it. I locked the doors and then I was in the driver's seat and I took off. I was going really fast, but the guy went into a car and was following me. We ended up in a shop, still driving, and the cops were chasing me. I saw a cop car, so I stopped the car and threw my hands up. I told them a crazy guy was following me, but he was gone."
"2025"	"(2008-04-11 (17)) I was at home. Eugene, Darius, Alejandro and Jeremiah were staying over. Ezra was there too. My room was really messy. My diary was on the floor. I was going through a box of stuff and Alejandro was watching me. I found some Goosebumps books and I said ""I love Goosebumps!"". I didn't want them in my room in case they got hold of my diaries, but they didn't go in there. I was going to play Pokemon Diamond."
"2026"	"(2008-04-11 (17)) I was in the car with Mom. Ezra called to ask if I wanted Clayton's sub from Subway for dinner (he didn't want it, and Dad had forgotten to get me one). I said no, and he told Dad I said no and Dad said to get Mom to get something for me. We were trying to find a Subway. We went to some shop in Innaloo which had a Subway. Mom got me roast chicken, but when I looked at it, it had only one 6-inch and bits of chicken and tomato and stuff on the plate. I complained to Mom and this lady went to put salt on it. I grabbed it away and complained that salt would make it worse. It had some sauce on it, which was actually pretty nice. The chicken was in strips. I went to this toilet. There was a big room and three doors -- one was the men's, one was the women's and one had a silhouette in the shape of the head of Frankenstein's monster. I tried to go into that one, but the door wouldn't budge. I was then at home, I think, watching something. Some guy had been the only one to survive this ride (it kept getting rigged by this dude so people would die). It was all filmed and I was watching it. He had been going down the slide and to his doom, but the dude who rigged it, had set up a box which told you how to survive it. He managed to survive, but then the guy went after his family and they all died. At the end of the slide, one of them was blindfolded and had to light all these sticks and once they were all lighted he could let go and live, but they started going out and he let go and died. Then Dad said the next one was ""Eugene Pritchard"" and I was like 'what?!'. I took it off him and it had all this information about him and baby photos. It said his birthday was January 11. I was reading some stuff about him doing well in science and I was crying. Ezra was asking me something and I was trying not to look at him."
"2027"	"(2008-04-12 (17)) I was in the car with Eugene, Rodney, Ezra and Dad. Sometimes Dad wasn't there. We went to Mom's and then Bradley was in the car. We were sitting so that it went Bradley, Eugene, then me. Bradley asked me if I could see if there was a coffee chill. The house was different. Mom had cleaned out some of my room (Ezra had stuff in there). I went to the fridge and there was hardly anything in there. There were some green bottles in there. Mom was playing on the computer outside. Darren was around. I told Bradley that there was nothing. Ezra was playing Counterstrike. I had a water bottle and Eugene kept drinking out of it. My hair was normal, but looked straight. Eugene and I kept being rather close."
"2028"	"(2008-04-13 (17)) I was in a shop I think. This girl kept calling me fat. At another time she was annoying me about not having friends and I said ""Who wants them?"". I grabbed this weird waffle thing and left. I was then driving and was having trouble. These cops behind me put their lights on and I was like ""What do I do?!"" and Mom said to just pull over and that they seemed like they were nice. The cop asked me if I'd been drinking and I said no and he made me breathe into the breathalyzer. The cop started picking on me and I was wondering what was going on but didn't say anything. I walked past Eugene's house, but it was different and in a different place. I could see through the window and Eugene was on an orange lounge that was falling apart and he was watching TV and putting this mould of an old guy on his head. Later, he was trying to get people to bet on some horse dressed as the old guy. I told Dad not to and said ""it's a guy in my class"". Later I was walking with some girl from school. There were these weird lights in the sky and they were falling to Earth. Soon, there were a bunch of them and we realized they were aliens. I was hiding in a car. The aliens took over Earth."
"2029"	"(2008-04-14 (17)) I went to school. I got given a slip by Mr Stevenson to see him and some girls at the ""hotel looking hall"". I was in the office and went to the hotel like room. Mom was there. These ladies were talking to me. I had a sniffly nose. Mom said she was taking me home after and I was thinking 'Ezra's not going to be happy'. Mr Haynes was there too."
"2030"	"(2008-04-15 (17)) We had an excursion. We were put into groups and we drove up there in a car. Eugene, Calvin and others were there. It was like a camp. I went in a pool which was really deep. I jumped in and went to push off the bottom but there was no bottom and I couldn't swim back up. I waved my hand and some people pulled me out. I said that I forgot how to swim. Ezra was there too. I had to evict people from our group after tasks. We had to 'win' minutes to sleep. I got 70 minutes. I was thinking that Eugene had 8 hours. I was playing Runescape, except it was real. I teleported somewhere and this spider thing attacked me and I almost died. Then back at the camp place, we got down to the final two in our group, but I don't know what happened then. Mom was driving me to 'school'. There were a group of Asian men outside. I said they were filming ""House of the Dead II"" [note: Ezra had it on his desk when I was using his computer yesterday] and that David Lynch was directing. We had a new camp. Girls had to get this suction thing off of Ms Corbett. Eugene wasn't there this time. Evelyn, Fatima and Calvin were there. Calvin got a suction thing and I said it was only for girls. Some people had colourful suction things. Fatima, Calvin and I were in a group and we ended up in a car with some others. Fatima and two others were in the front with the air-conditioner on. David Lynch had done some movie with Rebekah in it. But it was 'real'. It was at Mom's old house, but it was different. We needed money so we wanted to rent a room. Rebekah was the only person in the state who wanted to rent. I didn't want to let her, but we did anyway. She never paid and kept running off at night etc. I was going to kick her out. I was telling Dad about something."
"2031"	"(2008-04-16 (17)) I was near the lounge room. Eugene was in there with some others. Dad was talking to me. Tigger was just at the entrance to the lounge room and I was playing with her and calling ""Linxy!"". I went driving with Mom. There were clouds in the sky and they were weird looking. Mom asked me if I knew what they were and she said they were hurricanes. I freaked out. We went to a petrol station and Andrew McCarthy worked there. He said my limit (for petrol) was full for today and I was like 'damn, we can't do the logbook quickly'."
"2032"	"(2008-04-17 (17)) It was the morning before school. My hair hadn't been straightened. We had jackets with hoods but I didn't think it was going to be cold enough so I planned to wag. I was near the kitchen and Dad reminded me to make breakfast. Then Ezra was there. We got to school which was really different and I told Ezra to go upstairs (so I could tell him I was walking). We were in this big room. Ezra said ""Hey Aunt Sally' and I saw her sitting in there. I didn't know any of the teachers there. It was for form so I was trying to find mine. There was a guy and a girl and I asked each of them if they were from B2 but neither answered. A movie about some wagging boy had come out recently. There was something about A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm McDowell was hitting some guy in the balls. This lady teacher was annoying me so I yelled at her and started walking out. Ms Pascal was coming and everyone ran out of the room, so I went with them to sneak out. There was a pink bike near some trees. I took it, but had trouble with it. I got home. All these people turned up outside a while later. Aunt Sally, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur, Dad and others. Dad came and talked to me calmly, then Mom came to stay with me."
"2033"	"(2008-04-17 (17)) I was at Nana's. Last time we were up there I had started making some dessert but had stuffed up and didn't finish. I had some game with recipes for a cake. We came up with the ingredients for it. I tried again and it was stirring, but it was just pink and white lollies in there. I realized I forgot flour and milk and all the important stuff. I asked Nana for a bunch of ingredients (eggs etc). Dad was annoyed at me because he wanted to leave. There was some show where they tested if talking to plants helped or not. One of the girls on it had lost half her weight and was embarrassed to go on. She actually didn't and went on the show."
"2034"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) I was at Mom's old house. Fatima lived next door and we'd become friends. Her parents and Mom and Darren wanted a chat with us. They had recently got our reports and were disappointed. I had an A in Accounting and a score of 201/202 and the others were ok and one C. Fatima had one C and 2 D's and the rest were 0 (Accounting and something else). I said that I got a C in Biology because I didn't send off all the assignments in time. Darren asked something. We were outside, but under a sheltered bit. They went away and we tried to sneak past Mom to go back to my room but she saw and we all laughed. There was a ghost. Fatima was trying to sleep. There was a cat with xx eyes. Fatima's father was on the roof with the ghost and the ghost pushed him off. I was playing Runescape. Varrock had the best bank but to get in you had to go through this thing where you jump on these monster's heads. If you missed the head it took heaps of damage. I ended up going to Falador instead. I also got some teak planks at some point. I got an IM from Seamus on MSN. He sent me a message through some site though. He said I had changed heaps and I was emo because I had been listening to ""Choirboys- Run to Paradise"" and I was annoyed that there wasn't a space between Choirboys and the hyphen. I said I hadn't changed and that I'd liked that song for ages. I didn't really understand what he meant by what he said. We continued conversing and it was really funny. My music playlist on Windows Media Player kept going all stupid."
"2035"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) This guy on some show would do stuff to people to see how they react. At one of the houses he said ""pee on the wall and blood on the doors"". Then he realized they had a son because he saw baby stuff on the ground. They came home and someone and I went out the back and over this gate at the front of the next door neighbour's house. Some guy was like ""Hey I just saw you-,"" and I said ""Yeah, we lost our ball""."
"2036"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) I was at 'home'. Sometimes it was Mom's house. Kenny Hotz was there and he was trying to kill me I think. I hit Spenny with a metal pole and he fainted. I hit Kenny and he was bleeding, but was ok. I ended up in the pool. I had a shower at Mom's house. I got out and realized I had forgotten to wash the conditioner out. Ezra came to ask me something. I was then at 'school'. Some guy called Tim Course, who was an actor, was coming. Ms Corbett was in the common room, which was different. She asked me to go. Calvin and Liesl were there. We were getting put in groups and Calvin was trying to get me in his group, but I wasn't going to go to see the actor guy."
"2037"	"(2008-04-18 (17)) This friend of mine and I met up with Frank Whaley and he was talking to me for a while. He and my friend fell asleep on a lounge behind me. I was taking photos of him and Tigger with my phone. I was thinking that he was really hot."
"2038"	"(2008-04-19 (17)) I was at home. Nana, Dad and others were there. Santiago told me to move the exercise bike into the games room. There were different groups of females. They were allowed to request one thing each for some competition thing. One of groups was black women. This other group had this pretty girl in it and she wanted this cream and I was like ""Why don't you just get food instead?"". I was out the back. Leslie was knocking on the door. I had been looking after her kids, but I'd forgotten all about them. Nana thought something I don't remember was bad for young kids. Dad was making my lunch for school, but we only had bread with sultanas in it. I asked if any shops were open and the only one was called Copenhagen. We went there. We were outside and Nana saw a competition where you jump up and hit this part of a poster and if you hit all of them, you could win trips to different places. She won a trip to this theme park. Dad and I were waiting for her to finish there. On the TV it showed her going down a waterslide. Then these people wanted to interview us (we had all gone now). They were setting up video cameras in this shop. We were lined up, so Ezra was at one end, then someone, someone else, Trevor Fehrman, Dad and then me. I complained about the order and Dad said to go next to Ezra and I said ""No, I'd rather be next to Elias here"" and pointed to Trevor. They were asking Dad questions and pulled him away from the shop. We went to follow them but they told us to stay. The interviewer kept pulling people away and then it was just Trevor and I. He said ""That was a tidal wave"" which was a reference to an earlier joke. I laughed. There were boxes for Sims 3 and we were arguing about it and the people were filming our argument."
"2039"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) Dad said he was going to leave for Seabird today. Ezra was there. I said I'd just stay home then because I still had to wash my clothes, do my iPod etc. I asked if he could just go tomorrow and he decided to."
"2040"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) I was at 'school'. Fatima, Calvin, some others and I were outside of our class. Someone gave us a sheet of paper which said ""I love someone"" and my name was on there ('I' had signed it). I said that it wasn't my hand writing. They went to show someone else the paper and I followed. I left before them but this teacher lady made us all stay back. My desk was at the front of the classroom. We were seated: Fatima at the wall, Calvin, Lucia, someone, then me. Lucia was out of her seat.  We were doing some stuff on the floor. Eugene was behind us and he said that they couldn't fit behind me. I started yelling about them calling me fat and that I didn't ""have to look like a prostitute like them"". I saw Eugene looking at me and I was like 'oh...'. His friends asked him later to ask me out, but he said he didn't want to (it was mean). The teacher was in this office and said ""Izzy?"" and I said ""Me?""."
"2041"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) I don't know where I was, but I found my diary from 2002. In it, I had written that I was going out with Eugene. I was like 'what the hell?'. Every entry had something to do with him. One of them said ""Me and Eugene are going to get married""."
"2042"	"(2008-04-20 (17)) I was at Nana's. There was a boxing match and this guy wanted to win on 30 points. They could get 'free' points by spinning a wheel. The other guy got 40 points. We went outside. The boxer guy was there. A friend of Ezra's was there and I started hitting him. This curly white haired guy was near the fish pond and I said ""Who's the creepy dude?"". The boxer said ""My manager. My father,"". His mother also had curly white hair. We all went to leave but all the exits except for one had been blocked. We went out and there were stairs. We saw this car drive off, but then it came back. This dark coloured lady got out. She had set up an obstacle course. I passed the first obstacle and was going over to the second thing. I had to go through a hospital and this lady gave me a baby boy to hold. He was really small and kept opening his mouth but he was 'muted'. I got to the second thing, which was on a computer, and the lady came so I gave her back the baby. Alejandro finished at the computer but someone else got his computer. Eventually I got a computer. We had to play this Mah-jongg game. If you made a mistake you would get an electric shock through the mouse. I finished and then was at a chess board. This giant lizard escaped and it stepped right on my side of the chessboard. I told the lady what happened and she said I could move on. The lizard was then a dinosaur. It kept coming after me. I was running up and down stairs and then went into this shop. The whole inside of it was cushioned, airy, bouncy and dark. The dinosaur followed me in and I hid under the wall. The dinosaur went past, but then saw me, but I got out. This girl was hiding behind a pillar. She was going to check where the dinosaur was but then its nose came past and was sniffing. Then I was in the car with Dad and we were driving to this forest. The sky was smoke and fire. The trees were burning and they had health like on Runescape and it was going down."
"2043"	"(2008-04-21 (17)) I was at home. Dad was working late or staying out. I had gotten some movies out earlier so I went to watch one of them which had Ana Ortiz in it. The cover of it, showed her pregnant, having the baby. Then I heard a car pull up and I looked out the window. It was a blue car with Tooth Pritchard/Tooth Pritchard (one on top of the other) or something as the number plate. I put the chain on the wood door and went to my room. They tried to get in. All I could hear was loud banging. I tried to call Mom but it said the phone was unavailable. I called Darren but he said they weren't at home. I called Dad's work and told him to come home. At some point, Ezra came back. We were outside somewhere and this guy was trying to get in the building. We began to run away from him and we opened this door and were in a classroom. The door didn't lock and I tried to keep it closed, but the guy got in. I got some scissors and I was stabbing him. There was lots of blood. We also had to kill the cats at one point and we kept attacking them but they didn't die and I got upset because Tigger was so scared and I was hugging her. The next day, Mom came over. Some other people were over at first and I was in my car with the air-con on and I had strawberries and Milk Arrowroots to eat. She came and we went to her place, except we kept getting lost and sometimes we were walking instead."
"2044"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) I was at Mom's. Ezra said Spaceman had been acting weird since he got some purple thing on Runescape. It changed his stats and Spaceman was hissing at him when they were high."
"2045"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) We were at Seabird. Mom came down. I asked if she could take me home and she went to drive off. I managed to convince her to and I got my stuff in the car. As I was packing, Ezra was in the room, then Dad came in complaining because I didn't tell him I was leaving."
"2046"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) I was bored so I went to this place I had been before with the school. It was closed to the public, but there were people inside. I went in and I asked this lady at a computer some questions and asked if she had this program where you put in a scenario and it tells you what would happen (how many people would die, what would be destroyed etc). She said she didn't know. Then I was doing a quest on Runescape. It was called Slug Menace, but was a different quest. There were lots of toys with stripey snakes and puppets and they moved away from me as I moved. The room was empty and quite dim. I had to get into this cage, but had to go the long way. To get through one part of it, I had to light certain things to get certain colours. There was black, green, red and blue. Dad was there at one point. The second time, a room was pitch black and I almost fell down a hole."
"2047"	"(2008-04-22 (17)) I was at a party, it was some famous one. This guy and I (and sometimes I was Katherine Heigl) were in a shop. He was holding me and kissing me and rubbing my feet against chocolates and stuff in the shelves. Then a friend of relative of mine was nearby and I was trying to hide my face. He took me into some male toilets and I said that I was going to go the toilet in the ""ladies room"". The doors of the cubicles were high, so you could see people sitting on the toilet. I went anyway. This girl I was with was watching me, smiling. There were some girls in the cubicle next to me and one had a baby and they were saying how she had to go without sex for a week and she had gone past a gym and all these guys came out with their gym clothes on and they were sweaty and stuff. I was thinking 'what the hell, that's disgusting'. The girl I was with and I went back to the toilet, but then there was a play and we were walking towards the stage. Madelyn was with us too. The girl said that we had to do some thing with Justin Timberlake (like rubbing boobs on his head) and I was like ""I'm not doing that and I'm not touching Justin Timberlake!"". She was wondering why and that she thought I was more outgoing or something. I said that she didn't even know me very well and that this was ""the first party I've ever been to"" and ""I'm not as wild as you think I am!"".  We got to the stage and Calvin text me and it said that Madelyn was coming near me and I realized he was there because I was standing next to her. I was involved with the play, so I sat on a chair on the stage (there were heaps of chairs behind the curtain) at the front. Evelyn, Gavin and others were singing Camelot (Monty Python and the Holy Grail), which I mouthed. The tape stuffed up and they had to stop the play. There was a guy called Ned and he told me some story. Darius was playing Evelyn's lover in the play. Eugene wasn't there. We were in the common room later and Daryl was asking ""Who do I like?"" and I remembered that I'd seen photos of the person on his Myspace but I couldn't remember who it was. Everyone thought it was going to be a guy, but it was Genevieve."
"2048"	"(2008-04-23 (17)) I can't remember what happened at the beginning, but I went to Northtown High School (which was different) looking for something. There were lots of black people and they weren't letting us through. Later, I was leaving and going down some steps and these girls were getting in the way and yelling things at me. I pushed past them. My car had a hole around the area that the registration sticker thing was. Every car had it, but my sticker was a little bit above it, so you could put your hand through the hole. Poppa put his hand through to grab something and I asked if we could cover it."
"2049"	"(2008-04-24 (17)) Someone in our close family died. I went to a shop with Dad and Ezra and we were buying food. I didn't want to go to the funeral because ""I don't believe in funerals"". Dad yelled at me about it. Later, we were at a place where they were buried. I had written something about Runescape and in this hill there were print screens of Runescape stuck on the side. We walked across the hill and went to this house. It was Granma's. She gave me and Ezra these cool pencils to draw with. Mom and Ezra were waiting in the car for me, while I wrote down the brand of the pencil. It was in Greek or something. This cop came and I realized there was going to be a raid. Mom got sick of waiting for me and left. I called and text her to meet me around the corner. She got me and I said there was a raid. The radio was on and there was a Searchers song playing and then Summer of 69."
"2050"	"(2008-04-25 (17)) I was in a shop. This guy was putting on a show, by hanging people up and eventually killing them. I was one of them. I managed to escape, but he caught me straight away. I escaped again and he came after me and eventually got me. I escaped again and went and hid in the music section. There was a guard at the exit. I moved a little and the guy looked and he realized something was up, so he came over to check and I hit him with a chair. He shot his gun and fell. I ran out. The guy was there and I ran into the carpark. I called Dad and told him to come with Mom. The guy was sometimes Michael Rosenbaum. Mom and Dad came and the licence plate was different. The numbers at the end had three lots of numbers and I realized that they were dodgy, so I ran. The guy would let me choose a section of the carpark to darken and I could hide and then he would come after me. I went to some foreign girl's caravan. I told her my boyfriend was after me. Her sister came. She let me hide in this corner of the caravan. The bad guys came to question her and they were James Spader and Vanessa Williams. They were talking to the girl and I got bored and jumped up, but James just asked the foreign girl to marry him. There was something about David Tennant and he had red hair and his brothers had red hair and freckles."
"2051"	"(2008-04-26 (17)) I had to 'build' houses for some little people (like figurine size). To build it, I had to click on stuff and cook it. One of the things I had to do had sausages and some people in the oven until 12:30. I started having trouble with it because there were so many people and their happiness rating kept going down."
"2052"	"(2008-04-26 (17)) I went to a pool. I had a shirt on over a full bather's suit. The people I was with took the shirt (it fell off) ran off and tried to lock me out of this house, not realizing I had bathers on. There were bees and I was trying to fight them off. There was a dirty kid and he was evil."
"2053"	"(2008-04-26 (17)) We were at the beach. Austin worked there. I was with Dad and Ezra. We took the van and as we walked back to the car Dad said ""I should've let you drive"". It was ANZAC day. I was looking for Eugene's car."
"2054"	"(2008-04-27 (17)) I was seeing a play or show or something. I was involved with it somehow. I was there with Kyle MacLachlan, but he was like Dale Cooper (Twin Peaks). While they were getting ready for the show, we went off to this restaurant. The food was already at all the tables and you had to pick a table to sit at. The one we chose had good shakes."
"2055"	"(2008-04-27 (17)) We had an excursion and we were going to a shop. I didn't have money with me and Calvin was there. I got bored and called Mom to get me. We had to get into groups and Duane said ""We'll have Evelyn in our group"". I was then at school. There were gangs of white people around a lot and we had to watch out for them. I saw Eugene walk past and then saw his brother Rodney walking a bit behind him. I decided to walk home. Colleen and a guy with a red bag were in front of me. I realized it was Eugene. Colleen kept touching him. Johanna was then there and they did this weird thing with their arms (holding hands and making shapes). I kept getting trapped in it, so I ran ahead and they were laughing (friendly). Then I was at Granny's old house. I went in and I was lying on a mattress on the floor, watching TV. My phone was being screwy. This darkish lady came and I said that I didn't know anyone was living here and that it was my Granny's old place. She let me stay and later this other lady came and she said ""This must be your Granny"" and I said ""No, she's Alice Muriel Wedding"". I text Mom and Darren. I tried to call Dad."
"2056"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) I was reading a little red book. It had random stuff in it, but also had a Twin Peaks thing in it. I was reading it, but watching it. Truman went to some barn after Josie died and there was a problem with insurance. The next day, they found Truman dead, slumped over a window. Dale Cooper (sometimes it was me) was in this other barn with some others trying to work out who killed him. There was a photo of Jack Nance in the book as Pete. Darren came out and the Log Lady was there and Darren was saying stuff about who killed Laura Palmer and that it was obvious and I was thinking 'they already solved that'. I was at home and Dad wasn't feeling well. The next day it was freezing cold and we had heaters on. Dad was in his room and he had this really bad cough and was sweating like crazy. Ezra was on his laptop. Dad went into my room and took a notebook of mine to read and I was like 'what the hell are you doing?'."
"2057"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) Eugene and I were dating and had had sex. He was staying over. Ezra and Dad were making up some sleeping plan and it was messing up our plan to sleep in the same bed. I called some counseling place and they were talking to both of us. Then some kiddy van pulled up outside. This guy came out and was giving us stuff and informing us how babies were made, how to look after babies and Eugene and I were like 'what the hell?'."
"2058"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) Eugene and I were dating. We went to the ball and were waiting outside for the main room to open (it was at 'school'). We were both wearing casual clothes. Ezra was also there. We kept sitting down on lounges and Eugene would sit right next to me so we were touching. I kept looking at him, amazed that we were together. We were also at this other place at one point. The walls were all concrete and the windows were just square holes in the wall. The people there were acting weird. I thought they were going to say something bad about us, but they said that I was pregnant. Eugene jumped up and we hugged excitedly and then I was like ""How am I pregnant? And how do you know?""."
"2059"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) I was walking through these weird woods and I was thinking I should teleport to Ardougne. Eventually I saw Dad's old work and went past it to this video shop. As I passed I heard William, it Was Really Nothing playing and I was singing along to it. I was in the video shop, and outside it looked like there was a fire (there wasn't really, it was just effects). There was a creepy dark room."
"2060"	"(2008-04-28 (17)) Ezra got this dog and it was called Tess. It was quite big. We kept it out the front of home and it just sat at the door. Farrah had a Myspace and it said she was 16 and I was thinking that it wasn't right. I complained to Mom about the dog because it was going to go feral because no-one spent any time with it. I went to school, but I had an excursion (just me). I went to some school place and I was in the art room. Other people were there too. There was a big slope in the room and a table was nailed down. We had eggs with a brown thing wrapped around it. Then we had to put curry and some sweet stuff in it. It was taking forever so I just ate it, instead of cooking it, but it was actually meat or something. I was hoping we were there for two and a half more hours so I would miss out on all of school (it was Tuesday by the way)."
"2061"	"(2008-04-29 (17)) I went to the movies to see some The O.C movie. The cinema was packed out and I was sitting next to Liesl. She had her feet over the arm rest and kept kicking me, so I moved over. The movie started and I realized it was going to be really boring, so I left. It was really late, so this guy had to unlock the door for me. I called Mom to get me."
"2062"	"(2008-05-01 (17)) We were at a shop looking place. Dad was there. It was home sometimes. There were all these teddy bear touch lamps on, and so I was turning them off. One of them wouldn't turn off because I had to download a patch. I downloaded the patch on a computer but I needed it on mine to use it. Then the site to download from was down and I couldn't find something to transfer it with. We were then at an old lady's house and if we guessed her full name we could download it because she blocked the site or something. Mom, Ezra and I were looking around her house. I found out that her initials were DSL. I found something that said ""Danielle, Scandella, [something] "". I said the name, but it wasn't hers. I complained because her last name could be anything and I said that the people at school had last names such as Conell, Ivanovich, Lundquist, Pritchard, Johnston. Sometimes she was a guy who looked like Michael Parks. I went into this really cold freezer and I was putting ice-cream back. A servant told me the guy's middle name was Izzy. I was then at a beach, which was the first known beach or something on Earth. Dad, Poppa and Uncle Wilbur were there. We were on a ledge of a rock formation and waves kept coming up (they were gentle). I put my phone on a ledge higher than the water. I went to swim out and I was holding my phone, but I accidentally got it in the water. I pulled it out but it was completely screwed."
"2063"	"(2008-05-02 (17)) Robert de Niro got a job at a takeaway place."
"2064"	"(2008-05-02 (17)) I was walking with Calvin and we were talking. Eugene was in front of us and he turned around and said ""Do you [whatever we were talking about] ?""."
"2065"	"(2008-05-02 (17)) I was looking at a school photo from year 7 and Elijah was in it and I was thinking that I didn't remember him being there. There were big photos."
"2066"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) We went to Nana's. It looked the same with a few small differences. Ezra was on a laptop outside and was sick. Mittens was on the swinging chair and Tigger was sitting below it. Mittens kicked Tigger in the head. Ezra said Spaceman was under a chair. Mom made me talk to this Asian guy on some site. She said she was trying to find an old friend of hers and her daughter was now 20. I was on the computer in Dad's room at home. Darren was there doing something. Austin came over looking for him."
"2067"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) Sherilyn Fenn had done something to help people have sex for the first time. Twelve people, myself included, were paired up and went off into rooms. Calvin was there too. I got paired up with Eugene, and the rooms were really dark. When we had finished I went off into this other room where two guys and a girl were in the bed, but one of the guys had no partner, so I joined him. We were having sex and it was really vivid."
"2068"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) I stayed at Mom's which was really different. I had a double bed which faced the window. The curtains were green/yellow. The night before I had gone home with Dad, but I woke up and I was back at Mom's."
"2069"	"(2008-05-03 (17)) I stayed at Mom's, which was actually Nana's, but was completely different. Eugene, Darius, Jeremiah and Alejandro were staying there. The next morning Mom was going to go to the deli and Darius, Jeremiah, Alejandro and Ezra went with her. Mom said that ""Eugene is still asleep"". I was playing on a computer outside all the rooms (which was outside on a balcony, ledge thing). I went down the stairs and got a new water bottle and it was school (but different). That fat Denton was annoying me. I was fighting with him and kicking him and throwing water bottles at him. I locked him in a shed. My water bottle was in some sand. I saw Eugene's father Abraham in a car and they all left. Alejandro was still there though. I complained to some people, including Autumn, about the Native kid. There was some The Simpsons thing about corn and they were eating it. I was at home and Dad said the internet was working. It was but the ADSL light still wasn't on (we didn't even have the router plugged in)."
"2070"	"(2008-05-04 (17)) I was at home. Dad and Ezra were there. Dad said he was going to go out (it was night), so I asked Mom to bring food over. She came over and this cop car went past slowly. It was being dodgy so we swapped Mom's car for mine and then these guys turned up and pointed a gun at Mom's head and mine until they got something. I don't know what happened but they left and we they got back they said the cops pulled them over. I was telling Dad, who was watching something, that the guy on the show he was watching was in Monty Python and that he was my favourite Python (obviously, Michael Palin) and that it was his birthday tomorrow."
"2071"	"(2008-05-05 (17)) Calvin had been playing my random old songs to people and they were singing them. Some people had them now on their iPods. Isabel was there. I was at a university or something and Eugene, Jeremiah, Darius and Alejandro were all in the class. I'm not sure what it was. I had to collect eye things and find somewhere to set up. The class was then smaller and Autumn was there. Jeremiah said he got into some university and was going to leave to go there before school finished."
"2072"	"(2008-05-05 (17)) There was a boat in the water which collected 'freaks'/immigrants. This girl with long stretchy arms jumped in. This young girl's bottom half was horse-like and she liked riding horses. I was at some evil person's house and the backyard had all these broken cars in it and a big pile of mess. I tried to get into some police car (which was GTA IV like). Some guy went to this shop and they had jumpers on a rack which were orange and blue. There was a creepy kid in there and he tried to scare me. Mom was meeting this lady who gave her drugs and we forgot to pay and I remember seeing lots of money. Later, it turned out we had been tipped off about her."
"2073"	"(2008-05-05 (17)) Ezra and I were doing something, but I don't remember now."
"2074"	"(2008-05-06 (17)) I was at school. Ms Madsen had stuff on the walls which were like medals and stuff that her students had won. Someone had got a gold medal for an essay on An American Werewolf in London. I was thinking I wanted a medal for doing an essay on a cool movie. Then I was at home and I had heaps of them from her (of all the ones she had got). I found one that I'd got for some games thing, which was silver. There was something about Meg Ryan. Mom was on the phone and I showed her. I was thinking about looking to see if Eugene had one. I had asked Mom to bring me food but she brought a coke and this disgusting looking burger. I threw them straight in the bin when she gave them to me. She came in and made a mess of this stuff I had, including sand. There was a photo of this playground covered in sand and Darren had taken it. I was playing GTA IV. On the game, the character had another girlfriend called 'little party trick'."
"2075"	"(2008-05-07 (17)) I was at school and I had a biology test last. I was studying during 'form', but we had been called to the library, which was different, for a meeting. Calvin came and sat next to me, and Elijah sat next to him. Evelyn sat on another chair next to me. We were on a lounge. I don't know what class I then had, but Elijah was still around and I was talking to him. I kept getting called out of class for stuff. I was in chemistry and there were more people in the class, but Eugene wasn't in the class and it had always been like that and I didn't like it. In one class I got three notes to go somewhere. I can't remember the first place but I had to go to Falador and this place in the Underground Pass (which was different). Jeremiah asked if I knew where to go in the Underground Pass and I said yeah but he didn't believe me. I went to this tree, as did Theodore and someone else (they had to go to Falador too). Ms Solomon asked if we had been called to go to Falador. No-one knew what it was. The tree was hard and we had to break the bark off it. Eventually we did and I said ""Say no more!"" and was thinking about that sketch and Eric Idle. There were all these big ants crawling around and they were red and black. I pointed them out and Ms Solomon said they weren't ants, but spiders. I said ""fire spiders"" and I then said ""fire giants!"". They were dangerous so I moved away and lots of them were all over the ground and in the tree. They turned into human looking creatures, but if they touched someone they would catch on fire. They also didn't respond to pain (a lot like the L'vrai in Mindbridge, which I read last night). I was at the office and this teacher had this little baseball bat and was hitting them on the head. I was annoyed that I couldn't finish going to all the places I was asked to go. They took form of the people at school. One of them looked like Darius. I discovered that water killed them so I led some to a pool. I had some dead people from school in the pool and I was walking around the pool (and there was a gate around the pool) so that they would go to follow and fall in. This only worked with some of them. I had to kick the others into the pool. After I had finished, four of them were still ok."
"2076"	"(2008-05-08 (17)) I got put into a higher level English class. I was getting a level four though. The order it went in (IB level English) was my class, other class, and then Ms Solomon. I was annoyed because I enjoyed having Elijah in the class. The class I got put into had Calvin and Evelyn in it for some reason. A leg on all the tables and chairs was broken. Mariam and Isabel were there. The teacher was female, but was then Mr Noonan."
"2077"	"(2008-05-08 (17)) I was at 'Mom's'. Granma was there. Ezra and I were on the computer playing this weird Minesweeper game. It had sound and Granma complained because they couldn't hear it (they were cooking) and turned the sound off, so I had a go at this Sonic the Hedgehog game."
"2078"	"(2008-05-08 (17)) I was with Jeb. It was then Dad. We went to Hungry Jacks and got some nuggets and Ezra said they were yucky. I accidentally put mine in a bin, instead of eating them. Dad and I went to this island which was supposed to have nothing on it, but there was a KFC and another shop or something. The people there tried to get us. This guy was driving down a freeway. He ended up getting angry at something and got caught by some people. He was put underground and attached to a rope. People would be thrown in there and the more he caught the longer his rope would get, which meant he could reach out further to catch people. He was then a creature of some sort and a woman got thrown in. She escaped. There were other creatures around at different places. The closest one to him was this really violent 'guy'. It got odd then and I think the guy was actually a prisoner (had been thrown in). People with bad tempers were thrown in. He managed to escape and he was running around the streets. He turned this corner in a car, but then he was lying on a skateboard rolling down a hill, it went over a little bump and the skateboard disappeared. The cops were after him and he jumped on a bus and was thanking the bus driver. Then it showed outside the bus and the driver motioned to some police that were driving next to him. The guy noticed and jumped off the bus and kept running. Then it was me and someone and we were climbing up a tree. The person I was with asked what was in my hair and I noticed I had blood in it and I said that it must be because I was ""pumped full of adrenalin"". I think I was then him and the other person was Kristen Kreuk, who he liked. This girl who was friends with him and these other guys said she was the sister of him and his brother and that it was all a training exercise. Eventually they got free. But they kept getting hassled so at the end of the movie (which it was now), they met up with some guy and when they got back in the car, it exploded (with him, his girlfriend and his son in it). Then at the funeral, it showed Kristen Kreuk looking across and then it had zoomed out and they were both there on this hill. They were then at their house and their son was asking her how long she had stayed alive for (her double in the car) and she replied ""200 hours"" and told him that he was going to have another brother, ""like Kyle""."
"2079"	"(2008-05-09 (17)) It was Thursday night before the chemistry test (last night) and Eugene, Jeremiah, Darius and sometimes Bradley were staying over with Ezra. They were in the lounge room playing GTA IV and I asked Eugene what mission he was doing. It was one that I had done and I told him that. He followed Ezra to Dad's room at one point and he looked into my room. Jeremiah asked me if I had studied for my chemistry test and I said that I had forgotten about it and hadn't. He said they had forgotten too. I remembered that I was having the day off because I was sick though. Mom and I went to the school to do something and when we were leaving Mom had to drag me out because I couldn't walk. Ms Braun helped her and they took me to the car. The outside was decorated for Christmas. Ezra text me asking about a movie. Eugene thought the movie was one thing, but Mom thought it was another. One was about a girl who was molested or raped or something and the other about some Indian and chicken. The chicken one (Mom's choice) was right. Tigger had kittens or something. I put them in her mouth so that no-one would know. Nana made sausage rolls. We were confused about something. Evelyn was in some group."
"2080"	"(2008-05-09 (17)) We were out the front of home. We had a pool shaped hole out the front and we decided to fix it up. There was me, Dad, Ezra, Aunt Sally, Uncle Vic, Uncle Wilbur (who had lost weight) and Poppa. There was music playing and Poppa and I were trying to guess what it was and what year it was. I Will Follow Him came on and The Great Pretender which we said was from 1955. We were thinking that it was year Nana was born. I was taking photos and I was going to put this thing on my side (the hole had a wall separating two sides). I said to Aunt Sally ""they don't know"". Tony and Michelle (both 24) were there."
"2081"	"(2008-05-09 (17)) I was at school, as was Eugene. I don't remember anything else now."
"2082"	"(2008-05-10 (17)) I was at school. We had an assembly. Calvin and I were a bit late. On the way there I had bright blue pants on and I realized and was like ""What the hell?"". Eugene and Darius were behind us, talking. Calvin said ""you know sexy Marconi?"" and I said ""No, but I know Lucia Marconi"". When we got to the place, it was full and we had to go upstairs. It had floor hanging over so if you looked down you could see the assembly. The floor was broken so we had to sit back. Elijah came up there. When they left I put my proper pants on. There was this room there which was a mess and things were broken in it. There was a badge with my name on it. I suggested we clean and fix it and use it. Then it was clean."
"2083"	"(2008-05-10 (17)) Mom and I were driving down the road next to Midvale High School. This bus was coming around the roundabout and it hit the curb and hit us. We were ok. I think Mom said she wanted to take us to Dad's, but I said I'd just walk there because it was just around the corner and quicker."
"2084"	"(2008-05-10 (17)) I could go to the past. I was at a shop with Ezra and Dad. We all found a lounge/chair we liked and asked this lady to show us on a tour. There was a games section with Monopoly. It distracted Dad and Ezra and Ezra wanted to buy the Monopoly and I said that he already had a spiffy one. There were pieces of paper with bands on them -- Herman's Hermits and The Beatles are the only ones I remember. Then I was in the past. I was with some famous singers including The Beatles. I was friends with John Lennon. We were all playing card games and the public was watching. I told them to say that whoever lost was going to retire. Then I was earlier in the past and John Lennon was young (the first time we met). He had become more attached to me than his mother and she was annoyed at this, but when he was a teenager she died. I had taken my camera back and I was taking heaps of photos. I saw everything in black and white but the camera took photos in colour. I took some video too, and some guy was singing and dancing from the roof and also video of John Lennon. He was playing darts, when he was young, and this fat lady was calling people retards. I went to the UK in the past. Mom told me to speak in an English accent because they might not like outsiders. But I figured they wouldn't like someone putting on an accent more and so spoke normally, sometimes I was a guy. They were being shifty at first, and then I said what if I was a bar reviewer or something and they acted more friendly. I checked my phone and it was ringing (it was on silent). Alan was ringing. Alan was this guy who looked like the main actor in C.R.A.Z.Y. and he was friends with me. I got out of the bar and then it was hung up. I got this text saying he was in an accident. I called him and he was like ""Why didn't you answer?"" and he was crying. I was near this lady's house and she didn't like me on her lawn and she kept putting her sprinklers on. When I got there, I was a guy and he was a girl. She decided to run off with me and become famous. Her mother was annoyed but when she thought her daughter would be famous she was ok about it."
"2085"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) There was a list of birthdays. Michael Palin was on there. I was on there and Nana was too. I went to January 8 but Eugene wasn't there."
"2086"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) We went to Seabird again. We got there and I realized I had forgotten some stuff -- my camera, iPod etc. Ezra and Dad were there. We were waiting in the car for a bit. Mom was coming up later to drop some stuff off, so I called her and she was on her way and she said that I ""HAD"" to come to a restaurant later with her and Darren. I told her to pick me up. Dad complained because I left early. The restaurant was this one where they would help you with a diet. Mom gave me a brochure for it and I chucked it into a fire. It was an expensive looking place."
"2087"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) There was this movie in the Top 250 with Will Arnett. It was a superhero comedy thing. It started and he had this 'ring' around him and it broke and people were laughing. Then his wife (who was Olive from Pushing Daisies) explained he was actually dreaming and in a room somewhere. His dream became this fairy floss monster. He wrote a symphony for his wife."
"2088"	"(2008-05-11 (17)) Nana, Dad, Ezra, Poppa, some others and myself went to see this psychologist guy for something. He was pretty cool and we went through this thing together. Nana wanted to listen to 80's music on my iPod. The psychologist told me to listen and try to hear his voice while listening to the iPod. His voice started fading. I listened to Dancin' With Myself and Goody Goody Gumdrops. When we left, I was then at 'school'. Calvin was waiting with my bag. Evelyn was dressed in orange. I saw Darius and Eugene. We went outside to leave and one school called Andrew Gardner was blocking the easy exit and if someone not from the school tried to go through, they would throw popcorn and wouldn't let them through. I got lost and somehow ended up in a vent. I got down and was in this weird place. I went through a door and there was a stage with people on it and snipers. This guy said it was just a show. I went outside, but there was no way to leave. I went back inside, and it was now a garage looking place. I went back to the vents. The next one had a dying rat and cobwebs. I asked the guy to clean it for me. There was a washing line with my undies on it so I put them in a bag. He cleaned the vent. There was a video on my phone of snow, and then the vent was filled with snow. He gave me a towel so I'd be warm and to clean as I went through the vent. In the vent, it was cushioned and squishy. There were holes, with a ladder leading down. I went down some and was looking around for a way out. One of the ones I went down there was a young black kid and he said ""I'm blah blah authority figure"" and then I was Will Smith and I rambled about some law thing and put him behind some stuff. His father was tied up. Then this woman came and she had a daughter, Grace, from Will Smith and she had a son now from another guy, except Grace was pale and the mother was pale. Then they were teenagers and trying to be as slutty as they could. One of the girls said ""I slept with [someone] and got pregnant!"". Then it was That 70's Show and they were running around dancing and I was trying to get back in the vent, eventually I did."
"2089"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) We were back at school. We had a male teacher and we had written our names and some other stuff up on this board a while ago. We were told we were going to be doing some pairing up thing. The guy started pairing us up and everyone was annoyed about it. Elijah and I got paired up. Calvin was there too. Ms Madsen was doing the role and was asking us who was there and who didn't go to the school. There was someone called Choo Choo. Someone was singing Oh Sherrie. Then we were driving (Elijah was driving). He hadn't driven before but after a while he was driving really well. He was smoking later on. Then I was driving and sometimes the car was a bike. I was driving over this beach (it was where we had to drive). All these Ethiopians (they were black and someone said they were Ethiopians) were lying over the sand and everyone had to manoeuvre around them. I did well (and I was going fast). We went to this shop to pick up my laptop, which was actually some guy's (I was the guy). It wasn't there. The case and charger were there. I said ""didn't one of you use it as a [thing you put under a dodgy leg of a table] ?"" and I was blaming on this guy called 'Pool Cue'. I said ""I'm not saying it's at your house, I'm just saying Pool Cue did it"". Some guy smashed a bottle."
"2090"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) I did some quest on Runescape. You had to get married to this guy who lived next door to you and it was a long quest."
"2091"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) I was watching video on a video camera of Calvin, Ezra, some others and I when we were younger and went to the Royal Show. It was afterwards and we were pranking people, asking them to take us to places. I was filming from a while away. Then I was there. We went to this indoor place and I was like ""Don't I seem much older than I was?"". Abukar was there and some other people. I was then standing up and another me was sitting on a chair. I touched the other me and got sucked in. So we decided we wanted to film it, but another me didn't come. Elijah and Evelyn were there too. We thought some of the people there were dodgy. We were reading Laura Palmer's diary (Twin Peaks). It mentioned tapes and that ""Izzy's condition is cool. It's Izzy cool. Cool. Cool. Cool."" but never said anything about what it was (she was trying to hide it, in case someone found her diary)."
"2092"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) I was watching Twin Peaks and Albert and someone went to this place and the guy said to them ""I have an opportunity for you""."
"2093"	"(2008-05-12 (17)) Calvin and I got paired up for something in Biology. Elijah and I were paired up in something else. We had to create what our kids would look like. I don't know what Calvin and I had to do. I went to my room to get textas. I don't remember who, but someone said ""Who's that noob on my bed?"". Dad was in his room. Mom was in the games room."
"2094"	"(2008-05-13 (17)) I was baking poffins on Runescape. I had to go to this outside place and they all went on a conveyer belt. I had heaps already there and some were made. I was trying to find blue ones for Feebas."
"2095"	"(2008-05-13 (17)) Mom called me to say there was a job at some movie premier place to escort a B-grade actor called Scott Ferguson. I was like ""What the hell?"" and hung up. Then I was watching a movie. Scott Ferguson was actually Chuck Liddell, but was Patrick Dempsey. He was there with a ""big name chick"". He was there with James Marsden and I showed Dad. They were gay and together. There was something about Patrick Dempsey being stereotyped in the 80's to play gay characters. Judith Light had been playing lesbian characters. I then looked old and I looked in the mirror and complained. I looked really strange. Something exploded in the shower and I had to have a shower. Mom complained about my Beatles shirt. We went to Midvale shops. Mom was driving the car stupidly. Someone said ""Smudgy"". The back of the car got smashed and I yelled at Mom and Darren said something I don't remember."
"2096"	"(2008-05-13 (17)) I was at school sitting at a bench with Calvin and Evelyn. I asked why we were at the bench. Calvin said he didn't want to sit in the common room at lunch. It was really sunny."
"2097"	"(2008-05-14 (17)) I was playing Runescape and I was still trying to do Regicide. I had to kill some other thing, but I didn't have any food with me so I didn't kill it."
"2098"	"(2008-05-14 (17)) Calvin and his mother came over. I don't know why or which house I was at but eventually she left."
"2099"	"(2008-05-15 (17)) I was on a bed with Calvin, Jeremiah, Selena, Ezra and others. We were at school or something. I think we were watching TV. Jeremiah was listening to someone's iPod. I said ""I got The Beatles"". I tried to take a photo of something. Elijah was there too. We were walking and saw Theodore. At another time, Elijah locked himself in a toilet."
"2100"	"(2008-05-15 (17)) This guy who looked like Jim Sturgess was driving his car fast. Ben Horne (Twin Peaks) also liked to drive his car fast. They were driving near a forest."
"2101"	"(2008-05-16 (17)) I went on my laptop to get some pictures of people. I had a James Spader folder. Ezra wanted to use the USB so I said I just wanted to look up a picture quickly. He said ""Yeah the guy from 21"", (Jim Sturgess), which it was. Then I went into this room so I could read this book in peace. Austin and someone came in and were talking, then all these people from school came in and were talking. It was fully packed and I was sweating so I got out. Lucia and some other girls were sitting at the door doing their nails. I said I wasn't worried about where I was stepping and I stepped on Lucia's hand and she yelled out. She said ""Yeah, but you're heavy"" and I said that I didn't care. Mom was there and was watching TV. Britney Spears was on there and her hair was all wavy."
"2102"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) Nana and Uncle Wilbur said they went on my website and that it was disgusting (the diary entries). I was trying to explain that it was just for me."
"2103"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) Calvin and I were at home. I thought I heard a noise and asked Calvin to look, but he didn't. We closed my door and I called Mom and I said someone was outside my door and he was trying to keep the door shut. I got some scissors and stabbed the guy. Then Mom came."
"2104"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) I was at Mom's. I went to have a shower, but Ezra was in there naked, so I walked away."
"2105"	"(2008-05-17 (17)) I was at a shop. I had lost some weight and needed a disguise for something. I went to the girl's clothes section. I tried on this little top and it was too small and my boobs looked huge, and I was thinking 'what the hell am I doing?'."
"2106"	"(2008-05-18 (17)) I was at school. I had accounting and had to go to the library. Elijah, Daryl, Calvin and Genevieve were there. We went in and there was a guy at the desk. I explained we were there for accounting and he was like ""oh, I don't know if I can let you"" but eventually he did and I tried to sit next to Calvin but Genevieve got in the way."
"2107"	"(2008-05-18 (17)) I was playing some game. I got stranded in the woods with this guy and a girl. It was night. It was like a quest and I was reading a guide on what to do. I think I left it for a while and then it was day, which made it easier. I then had to catch some pig and a fox thing. Later, these people came and rescued us."
"2108"	"(2008-05-18 (17)) I woke up on Wednesday morning. My phone said it was 4.45am, but the lighting looked wrong, so I checked on my computer and it said 10am. I left my room and asked Dad and he said it was 9am. He had given us the day off school because he wasn't feeling well."
"2109"	"(2008-05-19 (17)) Dad worked at this little 'ticket' place (like a booth thing) and he had been working there for a while, but I didn't know. Ezra had known though. Dad liked this girl that worked there. We went there and these bad guys came. They wanted to steal the shampoo. We got in the car and the girl did something that allowed us to get out. I was then at home and there was a class next door and Ms Madsen asked me if I was ""logical"" and then a while later asked what I thought of some story ""with the purple stuff"". I said it was stupid. The next morning, I think, I woke up and felt dizzy and sick. I was walking down the hallway and fell over. Dad said he wanted to look at my phone. I slid it over. I told him I was too sick to go to school and he was annoyed."
"2110"	"(2008-05-20 (17)) I was in a building with a female friend of mine doing some work/study. We were in a stairwell and it looked really rundown. There was a girl with red hair in this red room. There was a window on one of the walls (in the stairwell) and a while later I looked out the window and there was a bright red cloud. I told my friend to look and there was a flame going across the sky and then a big mushroom cloud of fire came up. The aftershock came and the building shook and knocked us down. We were on the eleventh floor or something and we were running down the stairs. We made it to the ground floor and there was a restaurant and we climbed through the window to get out. Jeremiah was there and he said ""The great wall exploded!"". I called Mom and she said she hadn't heard anything about it or seen it. There was this weird animation that showed what would happen after and something would turn into a planet. Then we were poor and it was post-apocalyptic. I met up with Eugene, Daryl and some others for something. Eugene and I were dating. He was handing me cutlery and plates and things from the restaurant to take. The guy accused us of stealing stuff and we were denying it. We needed the stuff as it was hard to get and was expensive (needed it to survive). Then I was in accounting. Melodie was complaining about Fatima and Fatima was arguing with her. Then Ezra, Mom and I were in the car. I had called Mom and she told me to go to the corner of these two streets. I was wondering why and thought she was shifty. She took us to this other place and we were 'rebels' now. I tapped Ezra on the shoulder and motioned for him to go back to the car. We all got out and Mom gave me the keys to fix the window. I jumped into the driver's seat and drove and Ezra got in. Then the car was little and yellow and it was a game. The car kept getting smaller and I had to find a power-up to change into another vehicle. It turned into a duck and then I found something and it changed into a turtle which was extremely slow and the bad people were walking right next to us."
"2111"	"(2008-05-21 (17)) We were at a shop and they had this 'game' where you had to crawl along these blocks, most of which were high up and in the air and you had to balance, and it was an Are You Afraid of the Dark game (I don't know why it was called that). Dad, Ezra and I were on it. Ezra went ahead and then I got in front of Dad. Ezra was going to some creepy religious thing and the people had these things on their heads that made it look like they had no faces. We had been on this before, and they had changed this bit where you have to get ice and now only people tall enough could get it. There were DVD sets on display of Are You Afraid of the Dark, which were coming out soon. I went to another shop later with Mom and they had giant ice-cream sandwiches and they were back to normal. Jeremiah was somewhere and he said he was going to marry this girl who liked some other guy."
"2112"	"(2008-05-21 (17)) I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV. Then it was a movie. It stayed close to the game though and as the main character was driving down the road, he was weaving in and out of traffic (like in the game). I was also doing something on Runescape. Then Dad and I were walking somewhere. I had a snake but it bit me, so I let it go."
"2113"	"(2008-05-21 (17)) I was at a house. I was worried about a killer. I tried to call Mom but there was no answer. There was some spoof movie and there were people outside and there was a guy standing on the pole near them, who was the killer. It was a rip-off of Jeepers Creepers."
"2114"	"(2008-05-22 (17)) Ezra and I were both able to acquire an ice-cream we had invented. When we wanted it, we got it. Ezra's was this hazelnut Magnum type of thing and mine was something else. Everyone wanted to try his. We went to this shop and we were on this little go-kart thing and there was a poodle. We knocked everything over and the shop workers were annoyed."
"2115"	"(2008-05-22 (17)) I was at home. This black girl (who we knew) was talking to some guys in a car. She was going to steal some drugs and I was unlocking the door so she could run in. After unlocking it, I told her I didn't want to take them. Then I was at Mom's. We all got inside and I locked the doors. I went somewhere else for a while and when I came back she was talking to them through the fly screen. I went to lock it but the guy shot at the lock, so I closed the wood door and he shot through that. Then they came in. The guy told us that the drugs he had were stolen from a casino from these really bad guys. I explained that I didn't know about the drugs and that it was the black girl's idea. I had snuck off earlier and called the cops but they weren't working because it was mother's day. The lady I spoke to said she'd said send someone to check it out. She spelt 'Barlow' with two A's and then crossed it out. We were in the dining room at Mom's, but it was different. The guy said that if the bad guys found us we'd all be dead. Then the door busted open and this guy in leather was there and he looked mean. The guy that was with us looked at me and we grimaced (we knew it was the bad guy). The lady on the phone had come with them too. He took the main bad guy (the one who was doing all the talking) and did something to him and I think he died. He made this girl lick his feet, and I told her not to breathe. Then this lady cop came and someone told her to shoot the other guys and we were all arguing over who the bad guys were."
"2116"	"(2008-05-23 (17)) We were at a shop, which was school and we were sitting in a group. I accidentally took a photo with my phone and it made a noise. I was sitting with Calvin. He got excited and said that Evelyn and Darius had just walked through the door together. I looked up and saw Evelyn going down to another corner and Darius coming towards the group I was with. Later I was in a clothes section. Darius was wearing that dressing gown that I liked. I went through the clothes looking for another but there weren't any others, then I saw him wearing another blue one so I went back to look again. When I saw him again he was wearing the one I liked and he had bought it. I complained to Mom and him that I'd wanted it for ages. He said ""Well, it's either yours or mine"". I don't know what happened after that. I saw Eugene's brother Rodney and I heard him talk and was thinking he sounded similar to Eugene (but he didn't). There was some game with a helicopter and you go to a spot and then deliver something to another spot."
"2117"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) Ezra and I were waiting in the car for Mom at a shop. I thought I saw Jeremiah in the car park and went to check and to ask Mom how long she'd be. I was then teleported to a dungeon and unlocked a music track on Runescape and I had to kill a blue dragon, but it was only level 72 or something. Then I left and Mom still wasn't out and it had been over an hour. Bradley was also talking and laughing with someone and kept looking at me and I thought he liked me. I was also thinking that his new haircut was really hot."
"2118"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) I was at some get together thing at a really big playground. It was filled with kids. This guy told me to do the countdown, so I did. Mr Reilly, Ezra and Eugene were also there. I was then at Mom's and my room there was like my room at home. The ceiling was also collapsed at some places. I asked why Ezra always got the good room. I was then at school and in some class with Mr Stevenson, but it was in the science block."
"2119"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) I was watching 3rd Rock From the Sun. They found this kid and John Lithgow didn't want to tell him they were aliens. I was trying to explain the proper Earth talk. Someone was writing and it said some girl was in a demons body."
"2120"	"(2008-05-24 (17)) I was at a deli in the lollies section and they were expensive. Mom said to just get individual packets because it was cheaper. They had the pineapple lollies. They also had these weird ""John Lennon"" Santa lolly. Someone called Dad and I answered and they said they were going to the UK and that no-one could stop them."
"2121"	"(2008-05-25 (17)) Nana sold her house because they couldn't afford it for much longer. They had a 'business' running out of it (eggs, etc) and Asians had done some bus thing where only Asian's could take the bus to work. I don't know why that mattered. Her new home was a bit bigger than Granny's old house, which I mentioned to the others. Poppa was there. They explained they had room for Aunt Sally and Dad if they wanted to stay (which were little two story blocks). We were all out the back and the backyard was still the old house. They had to fix it up and then the old house backyard would disappear. I was thinking we wouldn't be going up there anymore on Sundays."
"2122"	"(2008-05-26 (17)) I was on a 'holiday' with a male friend of mine, possibly my boyfriend. We had gotten this ""adventure"" package which meant we could watch a movie I don't remember or The Hills Have Eyes. The other movie had a fat guy in it, and that was the one we were going to watch. We were watching it in the office at home (it was clean), and Dad, Poppa and Nana put a bed in there for me. Nana had not set up the computer monitor, which she mentioned to me. Before, I needed stuff for Biology and I couldn't remember what it was. Austin was on the computer. I went to the Biology site and they had a games competition. Ezra was playing too. Mom was there."
"2123"	"(2008-05-27 (17)) Dad was friends with a gay guy. They worked together. Then Dad was me, and Ezra saw this guy playing poker by himself so Ezra wanted to play with him. He lived next to Mom's. Ezra saw them building a room on the roof and said if they'd got that house, he'd still have the better room. Someone came over to the gay guy's house. He was a gardener. We were outside for quite a while. I was playing Runescape and was killing something and this guy died and when his stuff appeared I tried to take it but I only got this cape, and it wouldn't let me get the rest. I walked away from the area and people were running back for the stuff. I was in this cave which was muddy. These kids were running down steps."
"2124"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) I don't remember but there was something about someone called Sadie."
"2125"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) Eugene and I were talking with some others, but I don't remember now."
"2126"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. They said something smelled, but not as bad as me. I was walking home down the street across the road. When I walked across there was some guy and he went to stab me, but this other guy there stopped him."
"2127"	"(2008-05-28 (17)) There was these fish called Ugugu and they were seeds at first and they turned into this axolotl thing. There was a scary one that kept trying to suck on my finger."
"2128"	"(2008-05-29 (17)) There was a platypus called Peter, an elephant called Ellie and another thing. They were in a classroom and Peter or the other one was explaining a plan to catch this ""bilby"". They were outside. They had set up a cage underneath this little undercover area, which had a curtain surrounding it, on top of the cage, were some ropes. Ellie tried to catch it, but it didn't work. Peter got caught in the ropes and the bilby was coming. I was then the one caught in the ropes and I got on top of the cage and saw the bilby coming through the curtain, and it was a really big blue/green monster, which scared the hell out of me) and then I woke up."
"2129"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) I was doing a quest or a mini-game on Runescape. I got teleported to this guy called Nostrodamus and he told me to teleport somewhere and then back there. It was then real life and Elijah and Theodore were there. Elijah said ""Turn that way for me"" and I said no. Then it was Runescape, sort of, again. There were three people there. One guy got drenched, and the other two were in rooms. A person there told the guy to soak the others and two more soaked would die. He told the others and said one wouldn't die."
"2130"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) I was at some place with Calvin and Elijah. My dream books and dreams were on my bedside table. Calvin was trying to look to see who I liked and I said ""Just wait man!"". I said that the person I liked had hardly been in my dreams. I was then flicking through the books and showing Elijah some of the pages. One of the pages had a list of 'top 10 guys' from school and Eugene was first obviously. I said ""oops"" and told Elijah not to say anything. Calvin wanted him to tell him what it said. Elijah wrote down a list of who he thought my top 10 was and Dmitri was third and he was first. I was at a place outside with the school. There was a big track for a rollercoaster type of thing. I was watching people on it and Jeremiah asked me to join them and I said no. Fatima and a girl were with me. I was climbing up from there and Eugene was coming back down and then Alejandro and I went at the same time. There was food and some strawberries. They were giving them out and at the same time, Eugene and I said ""No cream!""."
"2131"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) We were playing sport at school, but it wasn't school. We were in this huge outside area which had two 'storeys'. The bottom part had a Jacuzzi thing and Geneva liked it. Mr Quinlan was supervising them. Fatima and I were sitting out, but we decided to join in. Mr Quinlan said ""Fatima! Where's your team?"" and she said we didn't have one, but he said he had clothes in his bag (put on his red shirt). I told him I didn't have my shirt and this lady said they had some. He was going to send us down, but he had sent a guy down earlier and he had got on a bus and gone back to school. The game was like minesweeper and you had to dig in areas and those without mines had stuff under them. There were little Pikachu's on the ground. Then I was at home and I was out the back. The tree started shaking and I looked at it and a heap of branches fell down onto the spa. I didn't get to close but then saw a gigantic frog on it. I ran inside and Grady was in the kitchen. I said ""It's a giant frog!"". There was an even bigger one out the front. Then a HUGE one was out the back. It was walking and it stepped over the house. I was worried about my car."
"2132"	"(2008-05-30 (17)) I was telling Calvin about a dream I had had where everyone was wearing leaf outfits. It was playing out live for me though. Calvin said ""And Eugene!"". Someone was covering and someone else was hiding in the bush. Darius said something about some flower. Evelyn came back and was hanging with us and we didn't know what to do. Julianna had done something and had called her parents to apologize, but they were still complaining."
"2133"	"(2008-05-31 (17)) I had this tall ledge in my room. I had made this thing which would tell you stuff about how you'd be in 20 years and it would send whoever did it, some mail with all the details. Then I had a quick one where you put your thumb on it, with this other thing up your bum or another orifice and it would give you a spiffy fingerprint thing. Mom and Ezra did it. He put a thermometer in his mouth. I wanted to take it to school and do people at school, specifically Eugene. Nana was getting rid of her pets. We got Simba and Fido in the car. This kid with cool hair was wandering around and this guy started getting rather close to him and so we tried to get the kid in the car. Another day, the guy was trying with some other kid, and we got him in the car too."
"2134"	"(2008-06-01 (17)) Ezra and I were outside this cinema at this rocky place. We saw Austin and Ezra asked him why he was there (it was late at night) and he was waiting for Indiana Jones 4. We had keys so we let him in. I finished Monkey Madness on Runescape. When I was killing the demon, I had low health and ate some tuna, but I finally killed it. The next day we were at a shop at the food hall. Calvin was there. This lady there accused me of breaking into the cinema, but she had no proof. She and this other girl started chasing us and we were throwing cakes at each other. They kept putting them over my head. I caught the other girl and told her that the other lady was making it up but she didn't believe me. Finally, she got caught and we decided to take the cakes."
"2135"	"(2008-06-01 (17)) We were at Nana's. Mom was there too. There was food including vegemite toast and peanut butter toast. We were taking the ones that hadn't been touched. Ezra asked Poppers for money. Mom was doing my hair so I couldn't get up to him to get the money. There was a dog outside and I said ""Fido! You're not Fido!"". Poppa, Nana and Uncle Wilbur had a feast out there. We all sat down and ate."
"2136"	"(2008-06-02 (17)) Mom had gotten a crossword scratchie and got 15 words on it (which was the highest and worth $130000). I was looking at it. She had forgotten to scratch some other stuff (which increased her winnings). We were at this shop and this lady who worked at a clothes shop made these pants for me and they were so tight my legs went red. Dancing in the Dark was on the radio. I don't know what happened next, but I was then in the car with Darren. There were zombies. There were a lot wandering around. Darren went into this little deli and I locked the doors. This female zombie kept hanging around. Darren came back and she attached herself to the window. We went to this place. Then Darren was someone else, a friend of mine. We went to this guy's house, who turned out to be Robert Sean Leonard and we were knocking on the door to wake him up. He let us inside, but realized this zombie liked that house (he had a house, this shed like house and a little stingy house thing), so he sent us to the stingy one because it was safer. There were little, squishy beds. Some little zombie kept staring at me. I started talking to it in a silly voice. She was like 2 years old and I thought she was retarded. I was like ""stop teasing me!"". Her father started bashing her for teasing people and I was like 'oops'."
"2137"	"(2008-06-02 (17)) The external Accounting exam was on at Westland University and it went for 3 hours."
"2138"	"(2008-06-03 (17)) I went to the movies. I had to go in by myself, but the school was seeing the movie too. I had asked the guy at the door if I could take a seat and go somewhere else, but decided to stay in the cinema. Later, I was at Calvin's work and I was telling him I saw some movie, which was the 4th in the series, but what I was actually describing was The Eye."
"2139"	"(2008-06-03 (17)) I was with the school, but I don't know where we were. Elijah and some others were doing some flower things. Eugene and his group were hanging around a bench."
"2140"	"(2008-06-04 (17)) I went to school, which was different, for an exam. I also tried to get my leavers jacket. I went to Mr Billings and he said something that meant I couldn't get it yet. I was sitting at a desk with Autumn, who was next to Alyssa. Autumn was talking about the Grand Exchange on Runescape and I said that I liked it. The exam was in a big room with steps and everyone sat along the steps and it was packed. Elijah was at the exam. I thought it was Accounting so I text Mom to bring my chemistry notes. She got there but then I realized it was the chemistry exam and tried to get rid of her, but she insisted upon giving me the notes. Finally, the exam started, but they had given me and Autumn a year 7 exam, so they took it and gave us the proper one. But we had to get these tube things and they only had munted ones left. I said ""what do we even need these for?"" and the guy said to get everyone out of the building and told this kid to blow this horn thing and everyone ran out silently. This lady said we didn't have to do the exam."
"2141"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) Dad and I were playing Scrabble, but we had cards which had people I thought were hot on them. Robert de Niro and Al Pacino were in a row. We were then playing another game thing. There was a big sphere in the middle of my room. There were coloured balls that went round and dropped into a space."
"2142"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) I don't remember properly, but someone was doing something and they had accidentally killed this person, then had to kill this other person to cover it up. Someone needed to get out of this building and Jack Nance (as Pete Martell) was in a car. One of the people killed was Catherine (Twin Peaks)."
"2143"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) Ezra and I had to cross the street, but I don't know why."
"2144"	"(2008-06-06 (17)) I was at school and was sitting with Calvin and others. Evelyn came and was talking and laughing with us until we pulled out something about Evelyn and Darius and she moved far away."
"2145"	"(2008-06-07 (17)) Mom was going to see a friend. I drove I think. Mom met up with this other guy first, who was a 'behind the scenes' guy and he was weird looking, but hot. As he was leaving, Mom said ""he's kind of weird"" and the car did something weird and I said ""ooh"", but she thought I was saying ""ooh"" at the guy and kept telling everyone that I liked this guy. I went in and was resting on a saloon type of door and then saw someone who looked like David Spade. Then he said ""How's Kylie?"" and I was confused and he said ""never mind"" and I remembered we had had met him before. I wanted to leave to I complained to Mom and she left, just as these others got there. I was at this place and I walked past Eugene and thought ""oh look there's my boyfriend"". I had to go across this obstacle thing. There were chairs and planks in odd positions. I had to carefully maneuver over them. At the end this chair had a leg missing and if I fell I would've been badly hurt. I got over it though. Then Bradley and Eugene were going through it. I put up the chairs at the end to help them."
"2146"	"(2008-06-07 (17)) Dad, Ezra and I were on a holiday, but it was at Nana's (and none of them were there). We were in the lounge room and it was set up differently and there was a lounge with an air conditioner on it. There were some kids nearby who liked to play with Ezra. There were zombies outside and they were like 'brains' ones. We closed the blinds. Someone was at the back door talking to them and I realized he was going to open the door so I ran there and locked it again. I told Dad they were going to get through, so we grabbed our stuff (I grabbed my keys and my phone, which had fallen between the lounge cushions) and went to the front door. We realized my car was in front of the garage. There were no zombies at the front door, but we couldn't see enough out of the door, so we stayed inside. We then saw the zombies run to the front door so we decided to go down these stairs to this fence and not many zombies were there. They were trying to climb over the fence and we were kicking them down. I got down first and started punching them and stuff. Then we ran to this circle, which was surrounded by zombies. I went down and there was a shelf with dumbbells so I was hitting them with them but they were too heavy so I ran back up. It was then a shop. I was climbing along shelves and it was a chocolate section. One of the chocolate's wrappers said it was Oprah's favourite and it had some alcohol in it. I was eating some of the chocolates to try it and I started feeling sick. I was feeding the zombies chocolate and eventually they were all full and drunk. Then this zombie had a sore hand and I suggested a bandage. He went looking for one with me and he found it first. This girl behind a counter thought I was shifty. Later, I had a job at this girly place in the shop, called 'Soho'. They had weird hats and we needed to sell one a day. There was a jumper which was brown and it didn't protect from the cold very well. I was also at school at one point and Ms Bigwood made me popcorn with lots of butter and it was gross. Mom gave me chicken sandwiches. I went to eat. Fatima was at a table, so I sat with her and then she moved."
"2147"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) I got mail from this Asian girl saying she loved me and we had the same birthday and were both born here, except she lived in the US now. She had found my site. I was confused about it. Her name started with a 'T' and was long and Asian like. Mr Reilly (I assumed it was him) sent me a video of some girl saying ""Rawr!"". There was a computer, Mom and Darren were on it, I think. My car was just a shell and it was light. I went inside and got a call from some guy called Dennis and he said he was ""Brad's Dad"". I was wondering why he was calling me and how he got my number."
"2148"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) Mr Gutenberg had given me some study guides for math."
"2149"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) I had been watching something and it mentioned a movie called ""Two Guys in a Bed"" and that they were in a bed for the whole movie. I looked it up and it said Justin Timberlake and Will Arnett were in it. It was also made in 1997. I downloaded it and I was watching it and it wasn't bad. Then Justin Timberlake was actually this latin-y looking guy and he was in highschool. He was playing basketball in a gym and this guy asked him if he had ""slept with an older guy"" and he said yes. Clea Duvall was also in it."
"2150"	"(2008-06-08 (17)) I had been doing a family tree and had discovered that we were related to Martin Sheen. It had a photo of Charlie Sheen, then Martin. Someone like Martin's sister had someone who was related to us. Nana saw it and she was like ""Sheen?"" and I said yeah and that I was going to go as far back as I could."
"2151"	"(2008-06-10 (17)) This lady did some charity thing. She told the group one day that they got a heap of money, but then the next day, her, this guy and another guy called Alec, left and went to Australia and took the money. This cop person (who was me sometimes) was there and there was a thing saying the ""girl is med-hot, Alec and is cool"" or something. They thought he was going to kill her. They discovered she was allergic to pepper. They put a thermometer in the guy's mouth, who was then Ezra and the temperature went way up and the cop said ""You're under arrest"" and Ezra was confused. He said he liked peppers in meatloaf and he had bought ones the girl wasn't allergic to."
"2152"	"(2008-06-10 (17)) I was at school. My bag was moldy. I was then at Mom's old house. She told me to throw it in the bin outside. Calvin was there. Ezra was saying that Elijah's middle name was ""Thilby"" and I thought of James Wilby, and how I keep thinking is name is Thilby."
"2153"	"(2008-06-11 (17)) I was at 'school'. When we got picked up we had to climb over these lounges. There were lots of blue ones and a pink one. I always went over the blue ones and Josephine went over the pink one. Emery and Ezra were annoying me."
"2154"	"(2008-06-11 (17)) I was at home and Mom, Calvin and this guy were there. Calvin found this stuff of this dead girl's and one of the things had Stanley Tucci and his phone number on it. This guy was in the room (and we suspected him of killing the girl) so we called the number and someone said to hurry up and get him. Before we could say anything, he left in my car. I accidentally got in the passenger's seat. The guy left but Mom went to talk to him so I left quickly and went down a side street. People started coughing and I realized this was the disease ""from Runescape"". Then we were in a little house. We had to keep duck blood to keep the diseased away (they were like vampire zombies) and keep lights off, etc. It was a game too and I had to get skills up -- farming, health etc. The internet was really slow. We had these ice things to stab the diseased with. They were going to break in."
"2155"	"(2008-06-12 (17)) I had made up this ring tone on this site. At first, it was food, then it was a Sim. It was this apple pie looking thing with extra stuff added. It was nice. Then it was a female Sim. I decided to eat my phone and I was eating one of the sliding bits and then decided I didn't want to so I asked Mom to get me a new one tomorrow. I told her about what ring tone to get. Ezra was also there."
"2156"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) I was at a shop with Dad. They had videos and Dad wanted to subscribe. We found this 'grieble' thing except it was spelt wrong. We couldn't think of anything else to get. There was a chocolate section. There were giant chocolates with an area of 1m2 and this kid ran up to it and it was bigger than him. His mother went to get him and the chocolate started slipping and I went to grab it but it slipped through and landed on the kid, but he was ok. Dad complained because I didn't get it."
"2157"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) This guy had been seeing this girl but they broke up and he had met this other girl. He was a doctor. He was examining her and said that nothing was wrong and she said ""Thank God!"" but then he went down on his knees, grabbed her hands and said ""You're going to die"" and they were both crying and hugging each other. His ex came and he tried to get rid of her."
"2158"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) I was at a house. Ezra and a friend were on the computer. This unicorn thing kept running towards me when I opened a door. There were other strange creatures there and ones like chickens. They kept trying to attack me. I was hiding behind a door. Some guy got attacked and all that was left of him was dust."
"2159"	"(2008-06-13 (17)) We had an excursion. I had driven there and other cars had come to (people had been allowed to drive others there). I had a navigation thing. I don't remember what the excursion was but some people had to choose a girl and then they were all put into groups and they had to have kids with the men. Kristin Bell was in a group and I said ""she's going to make some ugly babies!"". There were four groups. Group one had some pretty girls in it. Will Arnett was one of the guys and another hot guy (don't remember who) was in it too. I had become friends with Martin Freeman and that whole day had been recorded and it went for 78 minutes. I went to drive back. The car was small. Some random people got in the car. I was trying to work out how to reverse the path for the navigation thing. I was reading the manual and trying all sorts of things and eventually everyone left the car. I finally worked it out but I was driving too fast. At the top of the screen was a police icon. I got pulled over, sometimes I was on a motorbike. The cop said he couldn't talk to us with something in my hand. There was a helmet. I explained to him about what happened. I had no information about the bike. He drove us back. The clock said it was 3:02pm."
"2160"	"(2008-06-14 (17)) I was playing Runescape. I was in a field and I had to go through this gate and there was a monkey or something at the top and I didn't want to pay to get through so I just walked through and it was throwing stuff at me, which hit for quite a bit of health. I went to a shop and I was with Mom. I wanted to get a game but they only had ones I didn't want."
"2161"	"(2008-06-15 (17)) Two couples were in a bed. There was a black guy in each couple and one girl's boyfriend. This woman and some kids were naked. There was a computer with a female voice. One of the black guy's was a killer. I think we were at school. It was like a movie and everyone looked different. I was running somewhere and I walked past Eugene and Darius but they didn't look like them. There was a line of kids outside the classroom I wanted to go into and I ran past. There were cobwebs. I waited until the kids got rid of them and went into the class. Eugene and Darius had followed me in, but I left straight away and there was a spider. There was a secret group. Payton was recruiting people into the group. They left the light on and I complained that others would see. Melodie wanted a pillow so I gave her one. Samantha's sister Cyndi made a pasta dish. I told her off. This teacher guy tried to get in. We had four rooms or so and everyone was assigned a bed. Eugene and Darius decided to join. They were in the bed across from mine. I wanted Eugene to be in my bed."
"2162"	"(2008-06-16 (17)) Exams were on. They were all done in this little room at one desk. Eugene, Jeremiah, Bradley and others were there. Jeremiah had 3 hats. My neck was sore and Ms Solomon told me to rub this bit of my neck, so I did and eventually it cracked and felt good. I think we were doing the English exam. Jeremiah was next to me and a yellow hat was in the way. Mom worked at McDonald's. There was a really cheesy burger. The shop was set up strangely and it was hard to wash up. There was weird soap. I was out driving with Dad and I saw the oldest number plate -- started with 3DE."
"2163"	"(2008-06-16 (17)) I went to a play. It was actually stuff from people at school of when they were younger. Some of it was speeches. We had to sit in seats in certain areas and there were only two seats left -- one was next to Eugene and the other next to a teacher. I asked if I could just sit somewhere else a little further away and they said no, but I did anyway."
"2164"	"(2008-06-16 (17)) I read a bit of The Liar and it was really good. Some spy lady had to go into this computer but it was then me with Eugene and the others. It was taking a long time to download the stuff and the people came back (one of them was Jeremiah) but I managed to print out some stuff. This teacher caught us and Eugene told me to go back and he'd give himself in."
"2165"	"(2008-06-17 (17)) I was sitting on this lounge, which was two sided. Samantha, Silas, Calvin and Evelyn were on it too. Sometimes Silas wasn't on it. Evelyn was talking to us like nothing had happened but would sometimes just stare at the ground and we would giggle. She left to go to the toilet and we had been sharing some food, so we got Calvin to go to McDonald's (which was right next to us) and get a clean plate, to pretend that we had eaten everything. Roland was there, so Calvin asked him to get it. When we got back someone else had finished off the food anyway."
"2166"	"(2008-06-17 (17)) I was on IMDb and ended up on some actress's page and it said Christopher Walken had died and I thought it was odd that I hadn't heard about it."
"2167"	"(2008-06-17 (17)) I started a new account on Runescape to see what it was like for new members now. The skills only showed up when you talked to a tutor for that skill. I was telling Ezra. Then it was Dad's work (I wasn't there) and Gunther hadn't come in and he was due for his shift hours ago. He was getting worried and then he came in, drunk. Dad got home late with some random movies, including Singing in the Rain."
"2168"	"(2008-06-18 (17)) There were zombies. Dad, Ezra and I were at Nana's. Aunt Sally and her kids, Poppa, Nana and other random people were also there. For the first week or so after getting settled there we went to a school. We soon stopped going. Some Spanish kids were with us and they were growing vegetables and had zombies wandering around where the vegetables were growing. There were two kittens and two babies. I had something and someone complained about it because I didn't need it. I was wondering where Eugene was and I was annoyed that there weren't many people my age here."
"2169"	"(2008-06-19 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I went through the drive thru at McDonald's except I got a barbeque roller (from KFC). It was going to take 30 minutes and Mom wasn't going to wait so I jumped out of the car and went in. Then I thought I saw Eugene's father Abraham and looked up and saw it was his father and he and his brother were also there. They ordered and sat down to wait. I kept looking at Eugene. His father mentioned his mother and Eugene said ""I liked it when she wasn't dead"". This ugly freckled girl who worked there asked me if I was going to order or if I was waiting. I said ""I've got an order"" and she said ""Well, you look like a type A, would-,"" and I stopped her and said I've already ordered and the girl who took my order was holding the bag and gave it to me."
"2170"	"(2008-06-20 (17)) I got to school late. I thought I had chemistry because it was Wednesday but this random class was in there. I went to English (which was in a different class) and saw all these old school books of everyone in the class on random desks. No-one was in there. I had been put between Dmitri and Alejandro. I saw Elijah's book. I was looking for Eugene's desk but then he and a few others came in. Duane and Eugene were playing Pokemon together and I was playing by myself. I ended up talking to Evelyn about Neopets until I said ""Your mother's gay"". Her password was 'rarity'. Ms Solomon said we were going to the library, so we went to the library. Ms Olmstead complained when I cleaned up some mess. I was outside the library and these two girls were saying that people never knew what they had in their bags. I tried to get my bag on, but it was too heavy. They said they had put sand in it and I chased after them and I was going to throw it at them when some other girls heard what was going on. Dad went to Midvale shops and bought a Danish. Eugene was there and Dad had said something about his leavers jacket (something rude of a sexual nature). As we were leaving, Eugene and some others were laughing at a bus stop."
"2171"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different. We had a lizard with a red thing on its head and it burnt you if you touched it. Mr Reilly had had said before that they were extinct, so we had to be careful. We got them all in a bag. Teller came over and he spoke with a British accent. Mom and Ezra were there. Teller was pretending he was going to drive into us. He was really funny. I was telling Ezra who he was."
"2172"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) I was at home alone. I was going to stay at Mom's later. I saw a lady who looked like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos out the back trying to get in. I yelled at her and she ran away. A few minutes later I was on the phone to Mom and other people came. They stopped running from me and they were checking out the games room window. I told Mom to get me now. Where the games room window was, was now a door (which was two doors). They started pushing a limousine into it. Finally they pushed it open and I ran to my room and told them not to take my stuff and that they could take anything else. One guy said ""you can have anything but your stuff"". I said I'd give him $5000 for my laptop and he said ok. I left with Mom. Later I went back and there was basically nothing left in the house. I called Dad, and I also had Gunther listed in my contacts. He came and I discovered my laptop was gone and they left some stingy one. I was really upset. I said I didn't want to have to make my Excel spreadsheet for my dreams again or type up my dreams again (even my external hard drives were gone). I was also thinking of the photos I'd lost and the ones I'd taken of Eugene. Dad was doing some quiz on the internet for something. The window in Ezra's room had been taken off. I got a text from one of the guy's and a computer game had stingy requirements. His text said ""nice cats man, the next thing they lose is their skin"". I found a skull in the cupboard under the microwave and it looked fake, but it was real and it was Mittens's. I thought if Mittens was dead, then Tigger must be dead too and I was really upset."
"2173"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) Dad, Darius and I were at some place. Darius was being stupid and it was really funny."
"2174"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) I was at a shop. I got lost and ended up at one end of the store and there were two little shops next to each other. One was a fortune teller and the other was a blood place (donate, get tested for stuff). I got in this other line, not knowing what it was for. This guy turned around and he said ""this is for a Matiz"" and I said ""What if I was looking at a Matiz"". I was going to go to the blood place to check it out, but I decided not to and went to the fortune teller. I asked what she did. The readings were expensive - $60. She told me what each option did and then she said ""if you show me the money"" and I said I didn't have any money and I was just wondering. She didn't explain properly anyway so I left. I was on MSN later and she was talking to me and had a font, which was a nice purple colour."
"2175"	"(2008-06-21 (17)) It was the morning of the careers excursion. Darius, then Jeremiah, Bradley and Eugene showed up and I was thinking 'yay, Eugene!'."
"2176"	"(2008-06-22 (17)) We had gone to this place for an excursion before and it had been built in the early 2000's. It was in the middle of being built and it was underwater (not of all it). The first time we went there we were lining up and in another queue were celebrities, I remember seeing Adam Baldwin and Matt Damon and Tom Welling was in a car. The second time we went, I didn't notice anyone I knew. Mr Billings got some of us to go down to these seats. Elijah, someone else and I went and sat down. Darius made a stupid pose. Calvin and I were then sitting somewhere. Later when we went back, Tiana and some others were sitting in front. Some chocolate fell and they were going to steal it, but I got it back. There was another seating section and Eugene was sitting there, but if I sat near him it was too obvious why I was sitting there. Rodney came and sat near us at the front. There was something about Big Brother and Adam Sandler went in and he had no shirt on and was dancing and singing."
"2177"	"(2008-06-23 (17)) These guys were going to breed buffalo or something with chickens for a competition. There was going to be a ""buffalo chicken"" race or like ""best quality"" competition. To get them to breed, the buffalo had to run at a certain speed and hit the chicken, rupture the side of it and lay an egg. They were the hardest thing to breed. The first chicken they tried got flung over and died. The next one was successful. People got hit too. One of their mates got hit and impregnated. One guy said ""You guys didn't even try to go down on him"" and they laughed and said that wasn't the first thing to come to their minds and the guy said ""No, like CPR""."
"2178"	"(2008-06-24 (17)) I was at a shop, and it was a game sometimes. These girls were after me. I hid behind a pillar and they gave up. We got a new teacher in form [yesterday, we got a new one] . I was on eBay looking for something. I went to some school place and met with Eugene. We were going out and we walked to his room (he had his own one). The beds had nice blankets. First we went to a room with lots of beds. We were lying in his bed and he had his arm around me and was stroking my arm."
"2179"	"(2008-06-25 (17)) Ms Solomon asked who liked music from the 80's, then 60's and then asked about movies. Calvin was on a computer next to me. She did something to our index page. Alejandro pinched someone and Calvin complained to him."
"2180"	"(2008-06-25 (17)) Dad, Ezra and I were watching TV. Some of the channels weren't working. Dexter was on and Michael C. Hall and Miguel Ferrer were shown. Miguel was some guy who was in the war. He was also in a TV remake of The Shining that was made in 1989, playing a dead guy. St Elmo's Fire was also on."
"2181"	"(2008-06-26 (17)) I was in a shop. I don't know what happened at the start, but Dexter (Dexter) was there. We were friends and I knew he was a killer. Calvin and I found stuff that belonged to people at school, including stuff of Eugene's and Darius's. We were going through it. I was with Dexter and he killed this girl because she knew something. His hands were covered in blood. Darius liked this girl. I spent a while convincing her to go out with him and finally she did. They hugged. Dexter killed this other girl and as we were walking away I thought he was going to put his arms around me. Later, we were all sleeping the shop. I was listening to Mister Roboto. Ezra, Mom and Dad were there too. Then another time, Dexter and I were making out and they thought we were going to have sex and gave us condoms. Mom got her car back and it was full of smoke. I went with Dexter, who was then Austin and then Dexter again and he dropped me off home."
"2182"	"(2008-06-27 (17)) This girl and her boyfriend ended up with this dude. I don't remember properly, but Pete Wentz was in a van along with them and the guy's sister. It was then dark and Pete and the sister disappeared. They were trying to find the guy's sister. They went through McDonald's drive thru, but the van was too big so they went back and got a smaller car. Then they were at the guy's house. The girl had now fallen in love with him. Her boyfriend was going through all these trapdoors trying to get out and to find the guy's sister. His girlfriend and the guy were trying to kill him. At one point the boyfriend came up through a trapdoor and his girlfriend pointed a gun at him. Then they were in an underground place that looked like an abandoned Royal Show and they were near some show bag stalls. All these people that the guy had killed were hanging on hooks with posters of them next to them. Pete Wentz and the sister were down there. It had then been a movie, and Dad said ""he wasn't there earlier"", as he had thought Pete Wentz hadn't been in the movie at all."
"2183"	"(2008-06-28 (17)) A bunch of us ended up in a shop, including Eugene. We thought something bad was going to happen. I went outside and saw this mist coming and I told everyone to go inside. We then had to go into this other section in the shop and everyone was taking a long time to get in and so I shut the door (it was airtight). Jeremiah didn't get in. We had to flush out the mist. People left behind passed out and were on the floor, but they were ok. I was getting some stationery and some magazines to read. I went out and took Tigger with me. Some guy attacked me. When I got back he was there. I told them to get rid of him because he was dangerous."
"2184"	"(2008-06-28 (17)) I was at home and I thought I heard the bathroom light on (the fan). I went to go have a look and Dad opened the door and Vivian was in there naked."
"2185"	"(2008-06-28 (17)) I was on Runescape and some people were doing a competition for people to run down a freeway and the winner got houses on Runescape with good items in there, and also random items like ""tuna and a waterfall seed"". Then I was in a shop and people were gathering for it. I had to find a girl called Bwana Como or something. I found her, then I was a guy and I wasn't me. He told her he had a surprise, but within a short time he fell in love her. The next day, they woke up together and he had slept with her. They had been sleeping on metal pipes. His mate complained about her. He saw a creepy dude watching him. Then I had to get in to this place with some stuff. Someone had this statue and we 'flew' into it through its belly button. Poppa and Dad were there. They opened this trapdoor as I went down. I ended up in a girl's toilet but I couldn't get into the shop. I tried to leave but this girl tried to take me and put makeup on me and I punched her. I kicked some other people and then left, running. I called Mom to get me. I was outside, and this group came out too. One of the people was Ezra and a really a fat kid. They attacked me and I was hitting them with a water bottle. I asked Ezra why he was with them. I said the girl was bad and that boys could do things (in poker and stuff and the girls would 'whip you'). Ezra dropped his Pokemon Diamond [though he has Pearl] through gaps in this bridge. Mr Billings got in and brought it up and it was ok. Then they left me alone and Mom came."
"2186"	"(2008-06-29 (17)) I went to Comic-Con and met with Jewel Staite, but I don't remember anything else."
"2187"	"(2008-06-29 (17)) We were at some place and when I left, I left with Eugene, Jeremiah and Darius. I was driving and they were all in the back. We went to McDonald's and I was thinking the passenger seat was empty because Bradley left. Eugene was behind the passenger, then Darius in the middle and Jeremiah behind me. We ordered heaps of food and a girl served us."
"2188"	"(2008-06-30 (17)) I was in a room. Jeremy Piven and some other guys in there too. We were watching TV. I went into the next room (which didn't have a door) and I was naked and getting changed. I turned around so that my back was facing them so I could put a towel around myself. Jeremy Piven then said something to Kevin Dillon and when I turned they were looking and Kevin turned back around but Jeremy kept looking. I then sat down and felt really uncomfortable. Then I was at a shop outside, and all these people of a certain age (and other characteristics) turned into females with tongue piercings and I was extremely annoyed about it. People outside were going to break in."
"2189"	"(2008-06-30 (17)) Some guy (or guys) had killed 15 people and their murders were a mystery. Someone, a lover of this guy who had been killed, said he'd give the address of an old lady who could help to someone. I had a list of the 15 murdered people and I was not allowed to tell anyone about them. Ezra kept trying to get it. Mom was there. I said ""I bet the lover is a guy"" (he was gay). He was. He gave me the address on a band-aid. A lady was recording us and she had Mom's license plate recorded and had zoomed in on her computer and it was really good quality."
"2190"	"(2008-06-30 (17)) Poppa came over and was in my room. He started going weird, like convulsing, and I called Dad and Mom and they told me to drive him halfway to Nana's. Then it was a game and I was looking at a map and couldn't find the police."
"2191"	"(2008-07-01 (17)) I was in a backyard. Jewel Staite was in a chair, signing autographs and the like. Mom and Ezra were there. I was telling Ezra about how nervous I was when I got a photo with her. Granma was then there. Mom made some rice salad. There were some signed videos but I don't know what was on them. I had gone to the shop earlier and Michael Palin was there and I had fainted and then Paul McCartney was there too."
"2192"	"(2008-07-01 (17)) I was driving down Princess Road and I got to the roundabout near the bridge and then I realized Mom wasn't with me and I was driving by myself so I pulled over."
"2193"	"(2008-07-02 (17)) Dad, this girl, a guy and his girlfriend and I went out into space to the moon, I think, to find this 'star'. The girl didn't like me and I was worried that she was going to try to kill me. The guy and his girlfriend kept making out. The star was loud. The door of the vehicle we were in (it was just a room) didn't close properly and it was like a shed door. The girl said to close it on my side and I thought she was going to do something, so I moved to the other corner. It then showed her looking at ice on the floor and it was coming from the roof. I noticed ice in front of me and I showed Dad. I realized we were back at Earth and I said to let the girl out first (so she couldn't do anything to me). They put her down in a carton of milk. Her friends were excited and happy she was back but then ditched her and befriended this other girl. This other star went past and it was also loud. Someone said there was a ""mini Australia"" on the moon. We were then in a bar. People were dancing and I was trying to take a photo. This girl was doing a weird dance and she had red hair and green lipstick on and bright yellow eyes. I asked about her and they said she was weird. They had different characters there and she was one called 'Lisa Simpson'. Charlize Theron was there. The sky had these diamond shapes all in a row, so I took a photo."
"2194"	"(2008-07-03 (17)) I was at school. We had an assembly in a classroom where the girl's toilets are (but they weren't there anymore). They said girls have to not pee, although some went in there earlier and peed on the seats. Jeremiah was sitting not too far away from me and Silas was talking to him about Eugene, about how he didn't like waiting more than three seconds for a response. Then Silas said ""What about Beatles noob over there"" and pointed to me and Jeremiah leant over and whispered to him. Jeremiah kept saying words to me, like ""parallel"" and I was confused and he was laughing. This girl sitting on the ground started singing a song ""bleep"" and Darius was laughing. They took us to where I get picked up from and we held onto this fence and this bus pulled us along. I called Mom as I didn't want to wait there for 20 minutes. It was then night and there were trees across the road. Eugene was in there but there was a weird glow coming out, which was how I knew he was in there. Then he was right near me, and our faces were close and this light was shining through the gap. Then he was playing Pokemon. His friends said they were going to watch a ""27 year old movie"" and Eugene said he'd rather watch a new movie and I said I'd rather the 27 year old movie and he said we should go. I hesitated and he ran after them and then I did. I saw Mom and I told her I was going with them. Eugene also played Runescape and he was level 100 summoning and some other skills were 100 too. His total level was 1511. I was trying to work out how he got to level 100, since the maximum level is 99 and he had only joined in December 2007. We ended up at this creepy cinema place. These people broke in and caught me. Eugene had hid in time, and was flashing this light for me to follow him. They made me get a glass for them and the water in one turned into blood. The guys were covered in blood and someone said they were dead."
"2195"	"(2008-07-04 (17)) I was bored and went to this funeral place. It had a cemetery and a building. I was walking through the cemetery and there was a funeral happening and Kiefer Sutherland was there. Then I was at this creepy place that looked like it was set in the western times. I asked this young girl, who looked like Jennifer Morrison and was also British, where I could search where the funerals and gravestones were. There was a roller door and I had to push my finger under it. There was a bright light and I got trapped there. Then, I found the building and I saw Eugene sitting with his family. I had actually gone there to look for him. He gave me a little wave as I walked up these stairs. I was wandering around waiting for Eugene to get upstairs, then Dad and a friend of his came and they were getting haircuts. Eugene and his family came and they were saying speeches. Julianna was talking and I was angry about this, as I was annoyed that she was close to their family. Jeremiah was there too crying and smoking. Eugene was crying too. Jeremiah said ""Yeah, yeah we love you Eugene"". Then they left."
"2196"	"(2008-07-04 (17)) Samantha had a party somewhere. It was supposed to be a dress up party or you had to ""go to the toilet and then brush your teeth"". Calvin was there. It was not Samantha's party all the time. There was a girl and she wrote me a poem thing. I was then dressed as Betty (Ugly Betty). There were some photos from the party and I was looking for ones with Eugene but there weren't any. Daryl was there too. We had to leave. This guy we came with killed someone. This girl I with got in a car in the backseat and I said ""who's driving?"" and she said ""you are"" and pulled a gun out, so I drove. Then there was me, some other people and Kevin Dillon. This guy explained something, proving we were bad guys. ""He's wearing a necklace on his neck, this symbolizes..."" etc. Police came after us. We got out of the car and I went into this area surrounded by dogs. I had to climb over the fences and distract the dogs long enough. I got trapped in the middle, but managed to run to the next area and there was a little dog. It was eating ears. I got out and it was gone, instead there was a little turtle."
"2197"	"(2008-07-04 (17)) I was at home and there was a bus out the back. It was an excursion for the last day of school. Calvin was on there. The bus driver was a driver I'd had from ""year three"". He remembered me and Melodie. He had to drive through the kitchen. Everyone was then in the games room. I said to Theodore, ""Not Tigger, you can attack Mittens""."
"2198"	"(2008-07-05 (17)) I had an excursion which was like a sequel to one we'd gone to in year 11, that I hadn't gone to. Calvin came. We were told to go to this meeting room after lunch. At lunch Calvin, Eugene, others and I were in the room. We realized no-one else was there and I said ""where is everyone?"" and Eugene said ""I dunno"". We walked out and everyone was sitting in chairs and a guy was talking. Ms Solomon gave us gel stuff to put everywhere there was hair. It made my hand look nicer. I was naked and she was putting it in my hair and I was covering myself. I was looking in a mirror and I let go and saw my boobs and quickly covered back up. Some guy with a really squished up face said hello to Calvin (first, we were in a tree along with Spaceman and had gone to run away and I had trouble getting down). He had annoyed Calvin last year but obviously didn't get in trouble for it. He kept hurting him and me to a lesser extent. He was trying to drown me at one point. I went into a room to hide. The excursion was a 'study' excursion and there was a lady in there. I told her I was doing biology study, but she made me study a map of Spain."
"2199"	"(2008-07-06 (17)) I ended up in 1910 with David Tennant as the Doctor (Doctor Who). The TARDIS had screwed up and didn't come through with us. Sometimes I was with Eugene not the Doctor. There was a video of this girl and a guy with a doctor on some rocks. The girl hated them but she was enjoying herself anyway. The doctor mentioned Bonnie and Clyde. Then it was like 1919 and we met up with these other people who traveled in a TARDIS. They knew we were too and I went to go with them but the Doctor said ""Izzy! Don't touch it!"". He explained that I'd get disconnected from the other TARDIS and I would disappear, so I didn't touch it. In the mid 1920's, we met this lady who was a psychic. I asked her what you play games on and she said ""computer"" and I mentioned a song and started singing ""I asked Bobby Dylan"" and she said ""I asked The Beatles"" (The Seeker). There were photos of Bonnie and Clyde and there was a whole section in a library dedicated to them. There were photos from the movie, but with different people. Somehow I told Dad that we were stuck in time and had been for 10 years (although it had gone faster for us, we also hadn't aged). He went inside the TARDIS and hit something, he got out of it and it fixed it. We got back and I hugged him. I went to hug the Doctor but I thought 'we did enough hugging'. Dad and I were walking across a road and there was a car with an old number plate."
"2200"	"(2008-07-07 (17)) I was at school. Mr Billings was talking to me and told me to see him at the Year 9 block sometime. He asked why I didn't call my Biology teacher and I said I forgot. I went to the library for Biology and it was different and huge. Ms Atkinson was there and she had a short haircut. I went into an area to study and Elijah and Josephine came in. Some teachers started pulling curtains tightly around a square area, including around me. I said ""What are you doing? Meditating or something?"" and Josephine said ""yeah"". Then four of us were sitting and they had there legs crossed over like they were meditating and I was trying not to laugh. Sometime later, we stopped some kid on a ledge. I pushed him off and first yelled at him angrily and others complained about what I did. We were then in some big house. Everyone there slowly left to sleep in another room (because I hurt the kid) except Calvin, who stayed. Ezra was there too. We then decided to run upstairs as a joke and pretend to all be leaving me. We went up and everyone had started going back, we then left. We met up with some Irish guys. I got the impression one of them liked me. Silas and I were mucking around and the guy said ""Oh now I love Sasha Wyatt"" and he cried. I thought it was because he thought I was with Silas. I was worried about sleeping that night because I didn't trust the Irish guys (there were three of them). I walked past this area, which we had hidden out in before and it was now too rundown to stay in. Nana was there. I said ""ok, why don't we just stay in a house?"". I then realized it was a bad idea because 'they' were about to come home. Then it was a movie and this lady, her two sons and her husband were in their house. She put the kids to bed and then she left and it showed a spider web with a big bug on it on the door (it was Halloween, and supposed to look like a decoration). I said ""now the spider will move"" and it did. Later, the kid woke up and was screaming. The Mom woke up and sprayed insecticide before opening her eyes. Then she opened them and smiled and got up. There were lots of bugs and she was spraying them. They had to leave because other insects (in other houses, they were taking over) would've heard them. Then there was a pub looking place and it had weird ads on the walls (one of them was for a movie with people who had been taken over by something). The cops came to find them. One of them said they had been there just a few hours ago. There were hairs in the roof. There was this weird thing that I was 'giving' hair to. I pulled the hair through the top of its head, like a comb and then it had blond hair, but it turned to spiky red hair and there was green straight down the middle."
"2201"	"(2008-07-07 (17)) I don't remember the start and it was possibly a continuation of the last dream (definitely a different dream), but Eugene and I were running from zombies, but they weren't really zombies. They would mostly walk slow, but would suddenly start running fast. They also didn't seem very zombie like. We were at a big shop, in an outside area. There were lots of dead people around -- slumped over in chairs and on the ground. Their eyes were turning red and their skin was saggy. There was a radio, which was repeating old recordings and it said something about a weapons/military place and I suggested we go there as there would be good protection. As we were talking, some zombies started to slowly come towards us and they sped up so we ran. We ran behind this column and hid there. They ran past and so we came out from behind it, but one was still there and when we killed it we made some noise, so took off before the others came back. We went into a food hall and we were hiding underneath a table, but I decided to run into the next room. Eugene hesitated and the zombies came in and he thought they were going to get me and said ""sorry!"" because he wasn't going to go with me, but the zombies didn't come for me, they just wandered around the place, looking around, so Eugene ran to the next room with me. I don't know what happened to him but in the next room it was full of zombies. I was alone and some of them were eating. They completely ignored me. I started waving in the face of one of them, who was eating a bloody foot, and I hit him with something. He growled, but other than that they ignored me."
"2202"	"(2008-07-07 (17)) I was at school. We had an excursion. I wasn't wearing any pants because they were wet and I left them in the car. Calvin was with me. I had to go to the toilet so I went to the toilets in the Year 9 block. The last toilet had one wall missing and the door was low. This girl was looking over the top. This chubby girl did a dance. Some girls had been teasing me and pushing me and we had made a rule that they couldn't film it. I attacked them. I was walking to the bus and I told Ms Vickers that I forgot the key to the car (to get my pants) so she said she would take me home. Bradley and Darius were in another car. Jeremiah was taking stuff to the excursion. Eugene wasn't there. As we drove home, we missed the turn off at first. The house was different. Dad had a roller door at the front door. I couldn't get inside. I tried to open this window. I finally got inside, but grabbed two bars of chocolates and put them in my pocket as I had gone there to get food, not my pants. I went back to the car and Ms Vickers was now Ms Solomon."
"2203"	"(2008-07-09 (17)) There was some disease thing where under everyone's skin were these little maggot like creatures. One guy went to a lady to get rid of them. He stood naked and they rolled over his body. It was a fairly painful procedure and he would lose bits of skin and stuff and he chose to keep his hair, so it showed the maggots crawling around under the skin on his head. Mittens was infected."
"2204"	"(2008-07-10 (17)) Dad was playing Runescape. I went somewhere for the day (it was Tuesday). When I got back, he had taken the day off to play and he had level 92 mining. Ezra and I were amazed and confused. From the ore he had mined, he could make 425 million gp."
"2205"	"(2008-07-10 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I were at someone's house. Austin was there and he was doing something with tobacco. I was picking at the food and Mom thought I was trying to 'look cool'. I felt dizzy. Ezra was asleep. I was outside and my laptop was in the car, because it downloaded faster. Ezra, Dad and I were at some place, with The Simpsons playing on a huge screen. Pokemon and Invader Zim also appeared somewhere."
"2206"	"(2008-07-11 (17)) I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Burke came back and everyone was surprised. He and the Chief went into a room because he needed some medicine or something. Yang walked in and his pants were down. They hugged."
"2207"	"(2008-07-11 (17)) Ezra, Mom and I were in a car. I found out that Michael C. Hall was at some place, so I went there with a friend of mine, who was actually Katherine Heigl. This black guy was guarding the entrance. When I got in, she wanted to meet Michael straight away but he wasn't there yet. I was thinking of Comic-Con and Jewel Staite. My eye started itching and it got bad. There was random furniture around. I looked in a mirror and my eye was all red and there were all these pimples on my face. Michael got there but he was also sick, as were some others. People who weren't showing symptoms got tested. Katherine walked past me and I told her off. This Indian woman was with us. I was talking to her and she looked up at the ceiling behind me, so I looked and then looked down and Michael was standing there. I jumped and said ""you scared me!"". Then the place was actually in the water and they were testing different areas of the water for poisonous areas. The Indian thought she had been bitten by something."
"2208"	"(2008-07-12 (17)) Dad and I tried out for Big Brother. We got in but first we had to meet in groups of four and get acquainted. We were with another girl and a guy. The guy was next to me and looked like David (BB06) and was kind of hot. They told us stuff about themselves. Dad said his last name was spelled ""Goatse"" or something, but I thought he meant like David Bowie. I said ""My name is Izzy Conell, I'm 17 and in year 12 doing IB and next year I want to do forensics"". The guy got something out of my hair. There was some guy with no legs and he was dancing around and singing. He got rejected from the show. Then I was at school and in the middle of a class. Terrence was there. I didn't know if it was him at first but it was. Then we were on the computers and I signed in on Runescape and he looked me up on the high scores but kept misspelling my name. He added me. He said he hadn't seen me ""since that time at Mom's"". I remembered back and we were in bed and we were kissing and he was touching me and I was thinking 'why the hell did I do that?'. This teacher lady told me to get Biology homework and I said I'd give it to her tomorrow. Calvin and I were in some water on Runescape (though we were in it). I didn't want to go on the main land because it was in the wilderness. Ezra got a new GTA, but was in Al Kharid and it was all desert like and you couldn't use prayer in the wilderness part and Ezra was annoyed about it. We were then at Mom's and the computer was laggy. There was a warning siren, signaling a nuclear war. Mom got me back inside. I was trying to say that I just started watching Threads yesterday."
"2209"	"(2008-07-12 (17)) Others my age and I were being held in a camp which was at home. We all planned to escape and we were put into two groups -- the cows and the locusts. I was in the latter. We climbed over the garage and ran. This guy and I ran up the hill and hid behind a bush. I suggested it would look less dodgy if we were walking. Ezra called telling me to escape. I saw Mom's car and they had others in the car and we got in. We drove away. There was a Pseudo Echo St and Listening was playing on the radio. I said we weren't bad guys. I thought Mom was taking us back but she took us to a restaurant. Then I needed to pee. There were two little 'pee booths' and when you flushed it went into someone's mouth (there was a pub thing underground). The guy I was with called someone and I'd translated what he said, working out that he was bad. We went into this cinema. Two kids were taking food from the back room. I took a Milky Way. Mom, Ezra and others found it and they were taking stuff. The staff were coming and I warned them. I snuck out and asked the staff where the toilet was so it would seem like I was an innocent bystander, and then we had to make clothes to go to another camp. I wanted to escape."
"2210"	"(2008-07-13 (17)) Dad and I went to this place which had men stripping. I was wondering why the hell he brought me here and asked if we could leave. We walked and we chatted to this guy for a bit. Also the wife of the president took photos of him with some guy. We had to get frisked because of something about GTA 4. I saw the guy we were talking to in the car and when we got there he took some popcorn. He was planting evidence to say we had killed this lady. Later I was at Mom's and the middle room door wouldn't close and it was really creepy. It had been this girl's room, who was now dead."
"2211"	"(2008-07-14 (17)) I was at home which was really different. Ezra and a friend called Andrew had had a fight and there was danger of Andrew killing Ezra and Dad was friends with his father and they organized to meet up and discuss it. I had to go too. It was like 1 or 2am. I turned off the lights at home to leave. Andrew had an older brother, who was there. Then it was a game and people came. I got a sniper and was shooting (it was like GTA 4). The game had sold out and this shop needed more."
"2212"	"(2008-07-14 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom was there. We were there to do a drug deal. Then a fat blob (literally) came and we hid from it. I was with someone, who later was Calvin, and we were crawling and running from the blob. It caught up with us and said it had its stuff. I left. I was trying to call Mom to pick me up but she didn't answer. I was waiting outside and Evelyn was there and she said she'd get her car and get us."
"2213"	"(2008-07-15 (17)) I was on an island. It was nighttime. First it was in a building and this lady got given a gun. Later a demon/dragon was on the island chasing us. I ran into the building and up the stairs to the top level. Selena was there and she got a gun. It was at the window and she shot it, but it was ok. I ended up on the roof, in a room, with it. It wanted these sheets and I had just enough and then it decided it wanted 1000 more. I tried to say we needed to call someone. Then it was a game and I was reading the guide. There were two options for this part, I could ""romance it"" or kill it."
"2214"	"(2008-07-16 (17)) I was outside at this place. I don't know what it was. It was GTA 4 sometimes and I had taken my girlfriend on the game there. She didn't like it. Then there was a huge cop chase and so I spawned a car and Ezra, others and I got in and I driving it."
"2215"	"(2008-07-16 (17)) I was at a shop and it was someone's birthday and I was invited. I had to wear this yellow singlet and I asked Mom to get me some pants. It was 4.50pm and she wanted to go to these other shops before they closed. Then it was Jewel Staite's birthday and she was hugging and kissing everyone and I said ""happy birthday"". Then it was someone at school's birthday. I was surprised I had been invited and wondered why I came. I got my log book even though I didn't know how to park. There was a mistake on the certificate and it said ""Staite, Jewel"" instead of my name. I rewrote it. I was taking out plugs and took out my computers one by mistake."
"2216"	"(2008-07-17 (17)) Along with my usual 8 bird's nests on Runescape, I also got 7 ""Eloi"" seeds, which were worth 300k each, but they all sold for all 30 million. Then I was Clark (Smallville) and he suspected Lex (Smallville) of doing it to try and gain his trust."
"2217"	"(2008-07-17 (17)) I was at home. Eugene was over and he was in Ezra's room. I wanted to take photos of him, but it was too risky. I don't know why he was there."
"2218"	"(2008-07-18 (17)) I was at a shop. I was in this 'secret' room and I would climb through this hole into this other room with all this fun stuff in it. Next time I went I was with a guy. There was a teacher in this other room complaining at him. Rebekah was around and I called her a ""stupid ugly cow"" and she spazzed out. We hid in this place in the secret area that you could lock. There were four kids, each one with a different hair colour -- blond, brown, black and red."
"2219"	"(2008-07-18 (17)) I was arrested for some reason. I befriended this cop because he didn't think I did it and we liked each other. He was going to be interrogating me in this warehouse, alone. I had a jacket on which could shock me. I was tied to a chair and he untied me and we got in his car. I was thirsty and we went to this Chicken Treat which was in the middle of a country place (there was bush around). The people there grabbed you. I ordered popcorn chicken with sweet and sour sauce. Ezra and Dad were also there. We all sat together. Mom was then there and there was a song on the radio called Peaches, which was by some guy. Mom said it was a guy and a girl and something about David Cronenberg. Dad and I didn't know what the hell she was talking about. Some time earlier, Mom and a friend wanted to do a dance."
"2220"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) I was at Eugene's for some reason. His mother made these cookie things. She dropped them and I was picking them up. Eugene and his father Abraham asked how to spell my name. I spelt it out and they said ""we would've called you Katie Sophie"". There was a water container and we were refilling it. I was talking about Simba. We then had houses on the beach."
"2221"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) It was the first day back at school. I didn't want to go and Mom dropped me off at home so I could do something. Dad left. I decided to stay there, but ended up on a beach and there was a new waterslide in the middle of the sand."
"2222"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) I was watching the episode of Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction about the psychic girl [watched it last night] . The actors were different, but it showed the two 'popular' girls in the cinema with her and after the movie they could go to the party because they would be alright."
"2223"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) I went to a class and asked for everyone's notebook. There was a guy with a notebook and it had stuff about a movie called Take That and how it was a gay movie and he looked gay, so I let him keep it. I had met this guy from this event. He came into the class and someone said something about marriage and he got down on one knee and asked if I would marry him. I said ""me or the class?"" and he said ""you"". The class were clapping and then I kissed him."
"2224"	"(2008-07-19 (17)) Mom, Dad and I were in this cave, which was like a building, and they were telling me about oral sex. I was trying to tell them I didn't want to hear about it and they were demonstrating it on a replica of female genitals and it was really gross. I found this toy bear with lots of little sealed bags in its butt. They were pictures of people of who they thought had had oral sex. Nana and Granma were in there, along with celebrities too."
"2225"	"(2008-07-20 (17)) I was leaving 'school' with Ezra. I called Mom to ask if she was here yet because I needed her to look for some X-Files thing, but she was already there. I got in the car. I Wanna Be Your Dog was on two stations on the radio. I was reading That's Life and this girl won a date with David Duchovny. There was a video of it and he kept looking away from her and looked bored. I asked Ezra about the 24 parody with the day off and he said ""Is this your card?"" and I didn't understand and he said ""take it to the left"" and I realized what he was talking about. Ezra had broken stuff under his bed so it could get fixed."
"2226"	"(2008-07-20 (17)) Ezra was hitting me with this thing which would go into you and sting. I complained to Mom about it. I hit him with something."
"2227"	"(2008-07-20 (17)) I was at 'school'. I needed to find something I'd left behind on Monday, but I couldn't remember what I'd had last that day. Eventually I remembered it was chemistry and I was walking away. Ezra was staying behind for a study thing. Somehow I ended up in this class with other people, including Calvin. The teacher said girls who didn't take ""mith"" in Year 10, had to take it now, but I had (because of Runescape). Daryl found out that I had liked him and he said he liked me. I was trying to avoid him and I was annoyed that it wasn't Eugene. Porky was in her cage and she was still alive, which I thought was odd. Then I was at university and I had a text to meet them in a toilet -- it was Daryl. We left and went to some cafe place, but it got blown up. We were dressed in bear suits and went back to this other place. We had to clean it and wear these tight shirts. The lady called me fat."
"2228"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) There was this thing to get rid of insects, and you had to use more insects. There was a really infected house. At the end it was clean. The whole thing was a scam though."
"2229"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) There was a movie with Kiefer Sutherland when he was 14 and Elisha Cuthbert, who was 10 and I was showing Dad."
"2230"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) I was playing Sims 2, and Mario was in it and he had sex with this 'rock' (literally rock) woman."
"2231"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) I was in a car with Lex (Smallville). Something came up about never dying and he started going fast and crashed into this river to see if we would survive."
"2232"	"(2008-07-21 (17)) I was on Runescape and they changed something and I got attacked as I was going out and ended up on 0hp but I was still alive and out of food. Ezra was watching. I used the ectophial and got food. The banks were different. In 'real life' I was at these booths at the ""Jagex headquarters"" and some guy was in one near me. There was funny graffiti. This girl came. Then I was walking up these stairs with people following. Some guy was having a party. I waited outside and then left and joined these two guys. I was at school and I had text Mom earlier to pick me up because I forgot to have shower and straighten my hair. I had six messages. Genevieve was in a room and this guy told these people he was single and she said 'really' and he admitted that he was going out with her. I went outside and Mom was there."
"2233"	"(2008-07-22 (17)) I was driving with Mom and Ezra. We went to McDonald's. I think we were outside. We ordered a new ice-cream each plus one old one to share. There was music playing, which was all stuff from my playlist except Mama (Genesis) was in it. Ezra complained about the music and I said ""I chose this!"". Some guy was talking to Mom about ice-skating. I checked my downloads and I had a movie called Ficur Ng which was about talking monkeys that only say ""ficus"" [Watched Kiss Kiss Bang Bang yesterday] . I also had a Marx brother's movie and other stuff. I had 110 movies downloading in one day. Then I was in the car with Dad. He was going to go through a drive thru but it was full and every time we came back it was a huge line. One day he parked on the side of the road and it was getting dark and the guy at the gate went out to get food, so we couldn't get in. We went back to the car but this guy put something on it to say it couldn't be driven. He said the guy at the gate had paid him to. Then this fitness couple, who were Mario and Lisa from Big Brother UK, plus this old guy and a young girl, who was Stephanie from Big Brother UK were training to escape from some place. They pretended the guy was a part of the team but they knew he was a bad guy and had a secret plan. Lisa was pregnant. The place was really creepy and had lots of dry plants."
"2234"	"(2008-07-23 (17)) I was watching Big Brother. Ben was the only one I recognized. There was an ugly old lady on there (she was about 40) who was interested in Ben or this other, uglier guy. Ezra was like ""how the hell does she have a chance with Ben?"". This Big Brother wasn't letting them have any fun. They had a small TV and they weren't allowed to have one-on-one conversations. Then it wasn't Big Brother. This guy from the house took Ben and some guy to lunch at this restaurant. It was a big, shiny, black building with lots of windows. A van drove past, and the van along with the building had CRS on it [referencing The Game I suppose] . I couldn't remember where it was from. Then the guy left. They blew up the building from the top storey down. Ben and the guy decided to risk it and jumped out a window. They were ok and were relieved and then saw matches scattered around and so they ran. Every time they got away there would be more matches. They ran through this forest and throwing sticks behind them and I was also running with them. At the end of the path, which was then in a building, we turned around with sticks out to defend ourselves at the same time. No-one was there and we laughed. But then this guy started throwing random stuff and we had to do certain things to stop them. Then Ezra was there. There was a fast ball and this guy kicked it and I said ""Go Kenny!"". The guy thought for a minute and then rolled a slow ball, I missed it and everyone was wondering how and I said that I thought it was going to be fast and got confused and we laughed."
"2235"	"(2008-07-24 (17)) I was watching a movie with Ezra. I had seen it before. Leland Orser was in it and he lived in this huge house. I remembered he had died and become psycho or something, but after that (he got killed by a ghost) it was real and I was there. I had met him before and he decided to leave his stuff to me. I went there and saw him sitting on the stairs. He said hello and he asked ""You're dead?"" and I said ""You're alive?"". He said that ghosts could make things happen (turn lights on and off etc). I went to bed there and he staying with me for some reason. He got in the bed and I went to lock up. I went back and he said something to me and I turned on the lamp and said ""ow""."
"2236"	"(2008-07-24 (17)) I was on Myspace or some similar site and I was looking for Eugene, but I looked for his birthday -- 8 January 1991."
"2237"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) I was at a warehouse like place. I needed to go somewhere and Dad, Poppa and I left in a van. They had to drive it a weird way and no-one knew how to drive it. Poppa sat on the roof. I said ""what about Matt Frewer?"" because he was back at the warehouse. So we went back and got him. Other people came with us. I was then at a shop, which was Mom's. I accidentally brought a hat through those things that beep to warn when someone hasn't paid for something, and it beeped and a security guard came and I said ""I work here"" and he made me fill out a form about what had happened. I was on my laptop and it was going slow. Silas was there. There was a quiz and he had Leon as one of his favourite movies. There was a girl, who was sometimes my daughter, who broke her leg. I was thinking if I had a boy I would make the middle name Edward, because it was Michael Palin's middle name. I was then at school and there was an obstacle course. Sometimes it was at home. There were ten swings and a slide in the way. I was digging underground and there were rabbits, rats and guinea pigs. I asked Nana for garden gloves and they were made from a bra, and so had a squishy thumb. There were some Asian people there. This lady was asleep in Dad's bed. I was looking for something and Hungry Like the Wolf was playing and this girl turned it off and I kicked her out of my room."
"2238"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) I was at a shop for an excursion for school. Calvin and I were following Evelyn and Darius around and laughing. There was a machine with balls with fortune telling readings on them. They were all stuff to do with us and we got all of them out. One of them said ""Eugene loves me"" and there was one about Evelyn and Darius, and me and Eugene. I kept it. Barack Obama was in an aisle and someone said ""Isn't that the president?"". Ezra was talking to him. People were lining up and this ball shot out of the machine and this guy put them all in a bag and I was going to keep them, but he put them in a bin. We were waiting for him to leave, but he didn't (he didn't want us to get them), then when he thought we weren't looking he moved the bag. Later the guy turned the power off. Calvin and I quickly went through all the bins and I found the bag. Everyone started gathering outside and someone said Evelyn, Darius and Eugene were missing. I got a torch and said I'd find them. I heard breathing in a dark, quiet end of the store and found Tigger and Simba in a shelf. I told them to come out and I kept looking and found Gizmo, who was actually Eugene, and we all left."
"2239"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) There was something about Robert Downey Jr, and his first name was actually Richard."
"2240"	"(2008-07-25 (17)) Mom got a message to steal some cars from a library. This lady would always leave her alone with the car and then Mom would drive out with them. The fourth time, the car was really fast and I was hanging on the back of it. We got to her house, which was different. She had bought some small bits of land at this park. There was a tiny area, like 5m by 2m. She needed money later to help Granma and got a message to steal a car, but it was at someone's house so she didn't. I said it was like GTA 4."
"2241"	"(2008-07-26 (17)) I had been staying at this person's house pretending to be someone else. I had brought my Wii there. Mom and Ezra came over and she pretended she was my driving instructor and I was packing my stuff together and Ezra and Mom helped me get the stuff into the car. Then some others and I were on the run. People on these boats were shooting at us (we were at like a park). This girl and I ended up swimming under this bridge. We swam to the next city. There was something about Cloverfield. Then I was at school, but it was different. I was outside and there were stalls around and it was all on a big field (no buildings were in sight). Elijah and Autumn were there. Elijah was giggling. Some guy asked Autumn if she remembered him, but she didn't. They had slept together. She had slept with Elijah too. I went to the canteen and there was a Twix, which I really wanted but it was $8, so I decided not to get it. Then Mom bought me one from a drive thru."
"2242"	"(2008-07-27 (17)) We had an excursion. I was taking photos with my phone but they came out straight away. Eugene and Darius were staying quite close to me. There was a tunnel with water and the head of the Statue of Liberty. Samantha and I took a photo. I had photos of Eugene. We all sat down and Calvin sat next to me and was joking about Evelyn and Darius. I went to put the photos on the computer."
"2243"	"(2008-07-27 (17)) Granny had a house by herself and I was there. It was really hot. She gave me a muffin but it was too hot, and she told me to wrap it up and put it on the toilet. She went to bed. I walked out of the kitchen and Alec Baldwin was there. He was friends with Granny. I text Dad saying there was a Baldwin here."
"2244"	"(2008-07-29 (17)) I was watching Big Brother UK. I was telling Dad about a couple in there who pretended that the female half was pregnant. They got Kylie Minogue in there. She was in there for a while when she got called to the diary room, but had to go through this other room which was full of obstacles and tunnels. David Tennant helped her escape and she ran. Hugh Laurie got up and said something, but she was gone. There were lots of blocks. Then she got back and Big Brother said that she was allowed to stay in the house. People were having an argument. David Tennant was there and he said ""Look, calm down"" and saw everyone looking at him, so to take the attention away from himself, he said something about Georgie, a contestant in the show and also the guy from Summerstorm. A lady in the house got a laptop so she could write a diary. Then it was my laptop. I had to say that I wouldn't use it to meet or annoy ""Michael Robert Downey"" and it was actually Michael Palin, but it said Downey for some reason. It kept changing colour based on what I was thinking. It went green, orange, light blue and black."
"2245"	"(2008-07-29 (17)) I was outside at school, I think. Eugene and a guy in front of me were talking about smoking. Darius was smoking. I was thinking 'what are you doing Eugene! Don't smoke!'. There was a girl there with an attitude problem."
"2246"	"(2008-07-29 (17)) There was an interview with that Michael Owen guy and he was scared of the dark and had agoraphobia. It was a really random interview."
"2247"	"(2008-07-30 (17)) I was at a shop. Ezra and Mom were there too. Mom came to get chips. Dad had gotten a divorce from Nana and Poppa and I was wondering why he would do that. Darius was trying to sell stuff. Ezra had some scales. I spilt money all over Darius's back and then I was picking it up. Midge Ure was playing a piano. When I got near it, he finished and Ezra was talking to me and said ""you have dreams?"" and I said ""yeah"" and he said something and I was annoyed and he said ""and dreams about that gran vienetta son"" and I laughed and the guy who sings it was right there and he pushed me so my butt would be in Midge's face. This red haired guy called Rex was around and he reminded me of Brucie from GTA 4."
"2248"	"(2008-07-30 (17)) We were at school and had sport. Mr Reilly was teaching us and he lagged and got there late. We had to wear a white shirt. I was getting changed and the shirt was too small. I was putting my Spongebob shirt on, and Mr Reilly was coming to I told him to stay away as I had no shirt on. I said I didn't have to play anyway because I had screwy knees. Everyone was on a huge basketball court. Alyssa and Rebekah were there. Then it was raining and Evelyn was next to me. Autumn was also there. I had been there for a while and I thought something was going to happen. It was then dark and this lady walked into the rain and started biting people and they turned into zombies. We ran and then were in a shop. I ended up with Eugene and some others. Calvin was there too. I was trying to call Mom on my phone and this guy saw me with it. She was in the area so was going to come and get me. The guy was going to take it and I started hitting him. I smashed a window with a water bottle to get out. I was walking down a street with some people and there was a baby, which had been killed and had a spanner in its head and there was blood everywhere. I went to the carpark and Mom came and I got in the car and I was trying to tell her what was happening. She was laughing about it. There were cars pulled over on the road. There was blood everywhere and zombies. They were blue and their arms were weird. Mom said ""well, at least the roads are faster"". I was wondering why I had left Eugene."
"2249"	"(2008-07-30 (17)) There were zombies and they had taken over and there weren't many people left. There weren't really any laws anymore, ie people drove however they wanted to. There was a family of three women, one of which had refused to move in a few days. The other one got angry and sent her to her room. They didn't keep their door locked and one locked it and then an alarm for zombies sounded and they bolted out this other door into a hall, with other units and ran to a carpark and into a caravan they had. Also, Mom and Darren had bought a caravan. Then it had been me living there and I ended up at this place where they housed lots of people. I had a room under a bunk. Calvin visited once. There was a guy pretending to be a different nationality because certain nationalities weren't allowed. I was hoping that Eugene would turn up. I had gone back to the house and there were zombies everywhere so I was killing a few. I was then in a dark alley with Ezra and it was sometimes GTA 4. I couldn't spawn a car and there were zombies around, who were starting to get anxious."
"2250"	"(2008-07-31 (17)) I saw a bit of some bad movie and this guy had a male and a female guard standing on a rocky ledge. The whole place was outside, and was rocky. There was a big ditch next to it. There was this other guy with them who was very flamboyant and gay. Something started controlling the guards and they walked off the edge, killing them. One of them got replaced by Steve Sandvoss. This girl on the internet was in love with him and she was 15. I was then at some place with Mom and Ezra. There was a TV show and something was getting killed on it. Giovanni was on it in his leaver's jacket and said ""is it live?"" and he was going to be in some movie. Then we were there and it was a Friday the 13th movie, except Robert Englund was in it. Someone decided that I was going to be the first guy to be killed and Giovanni was the girl. The place it was set at was not far away and we were walking there. The actor playing the killer, was actually a killer, and I said ""do you really trust him?"", but we had no choice but to go there. The room we went to was really green and had some red/brown in it."
"2251"	"(2008-07-31 (17)) Nana made some food for me. I wasn't feeling well. She gave me some chicken. Aunt Sally was there. I told Mom I thought I caught Austin's cold."
"2252"	"(2008-07-31 (17)) Calvin and I, and possibly others, had built an inside swimming pool at school (which was different). It was for Year 12's only and there was no private shower or toilet. We hadn't gotten anything for doing it. Calvin, some others and I were swimming. I said something and Calvin said ""yeah, Eugene"". My bag was in the water. There were 'hoses' hanging from the ceiling that you could swing on, although you weren't allowed to. I was naked and was swinging from one. Some younger people told a teacher and Mr Willingham came and asked who did it and I put my hand up. I got my bag and some of my stuff was in the water, but it was ok. My phone, keys and iPod had been cloned. Somehow I had a time machine and Calvin, someone and I went back to 2003. We were at a shop and everything was really cheap, so we decided to buy heaps of chocolate and we did. There was a $200 bar of chocolate. We were buying it on these cards we had. We eventually ran out of money and we left. We only had a small amount of time to stay there."
"2253"	"(2008-08-01 (17)) I was with the school at a cinema. You could make the seats higher. Some people went to a different room for a while. Eugene was in the second row behind me. We were going to watch The Dark Knight. I was on IMDb and it was number two now and I was like ""Yay! It's not number one anymore!"". It's rating was now a 9.4 and less people had given it a 10. I was extremely happy that people had come to their senses and given it a lower rating. [I checked its rating in the morning, and it had actually gone down] ."
"2254"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) Someone was saying that I was one of the few people who checked up on previous Big Brother contestants, pointing out Tim Brunero as an example. Someone checked up to see who he was sleeping with, including myself, but he wasn't sleeping with anyone. I was at Mom's, then I was at school and I had an accounting test. Ezra had some test results. Ms Pascal saw my phone and gave me this other thing to use instead. Someone said ""I'm John Lennon"". There was a video on Youtube of Kevin Spacey, but it was actually a photo of him."
"2255"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) I was at school and Calvin called me to ask if it was a pupil free day tomorrow. I said yes and then said no. I had a text from Evelyn asking the same thing and I said no again and then said ""sorry, yes I got confused"". At the end of the day, I was waiting for Mom at a different spot. I went to the other side of the road and Eugene was there. Mom walked up to me and said she parked the car somewhere else. Eugene was playing with a manhole lid. Mom said to him ""be careful"" and introduced herself and Eugene was looking at us."
"2256"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) I was at school in the library. Indians were in there praying. This guy came in and threatened to let off a bomb. I left. I was in a shop, when the bomb went off. Darren had this electronic map game thing. This president guy made me make the decision to do something about the guy. Someone offered me coffee and I said that I didn't like coffee."
"2257"	"(2008-08-02 (17)) I was on IMDb and the rating of The Dark Knight was 9.5 and it was still number one and all the other movies in the list were random, new ones that wouldn't ever be in the Top 250. I was thinking that all these teenage idiots must've been rating all these lame movies because of The Dark Knight. I was annoyed that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was now nowhere to be found."
"2258"	"(2008-08-03 (17)) Before Batman Begins had come out, there had been a TV show with Christian Bale playing Batman. I watched a bit and saw him (I hadn't been sure it had Christian Bale in it). I was then at Mom's and Austin was singing Yellow Submarine. Ezra was there too and I was discussing something with him. These two guys, who were friends, were at some place and they fell in love. Then I was one of them and was hiding under a bed. There were lots of beds around, with beds underneath them."
"2259"	"(2008-08-05 (17)) Mom picked me up from school early. We went to the shop and I was in my leaver's jacket. I saw Ezra. He motioned to Mr Noonan, who was in the shop, and I shrugged. Then Mom came and started yelling at Ezra for wagging."
"2260"	"(2008-08-05 (17)) I vaguely remember Robert Downey Jr and that's all."
"2261"	"(2008-08-06 (17)) I was at home, and it was in the morning before school, filling up water bottles and there weren't any in the fridge I could take to school. I filled one up with cold water but it had a dead fly at the bottom. Dad came to get a drink. I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone and this guy and his girlfriend/wife lived in a small, stingy apartment thing. He kept his brother in a room behind his closet. He would only let him sleep when he had a bath and could only have a bath when he did. He wasn't allowed out of his room either. He had a brown rug to lie on. The other guy's wife was tan and had dirt on her face. Something happened with the police and so they all left. The brother who was locked away, dobbed his brother into the police for freedom and got interrogated by some guy who pretended that he was going to kill him. This black guy smacked him around for a bit. The guy's wife told him to hurry and said urgently, ""I'm doing it"". These insects came out of somewhere and they were really bad effects and there was also a bad effects rat. Some creature hissed. I was then at home and Dad was watching Gone with the Wind and the 'chapter' was 2.37. Dad was talking to Ezra about lynching."
"2262"	"(2008-08-06 (17)) I was writing down a dream about Robert Downey Jr., where he had been at Nana's (which was totally different), looking through these photo albums. He had also been driving really fast. I couldn't remember if I'd written it down or not. [When I woke up, I thought it was a dream I'd had, until a week later when I went through them and realized it wasn't] ."
"2263"	"(2008-08-07 (17)) I was looking up stuff about The Monkees [there was a biography show thing on TV last night] and first the internet wasn't working. My computer was on the table. Dad was in the family room and Ezra was around. Then the net was working and I told them it was working again. The only Monkee I recognized was Davy Jones. I was trying to find some other band, but I couldn't remember the songs I wanted to download from them or The Monkees. I was on a site which had autographs and interviews and it was local. There was one with Al Pacino and his wife was called Diane and there was a photo from Scarface."
"2264"	"(2008-08-07 (17)) Calvin came over with my leaver's jacket, but it had ""No. 1 No.1"" written on it. He did it as a joke. I was then at school, in class. Eugene was in there. I heard some old recordings of mine coming over the speakers. I bolted out of the class to this room where this girl with a black cloth thing on her head was sitting at the desk. I threw stuff at her. I asked the principal to turn it off. I had had a dream about it happening."
"2265"	"(2008-08-08 (17)) I was at Mom's but when I left the room it was home. Something happened and I asked about why it was important to remember stuff about 'snow scraping'' and something for school. Darren said something and then said ""it's like 10 minutes from here"". I went to put my dinner in the microwave. Dancing in the Storm was playing. This crack appeared in the carpet in the living room. I went outside and told Mom. Mom told me to fix it. I aimed the microwave away, as the radiation had cracked the ground, which was now like ice, and it was dangerous."
"2266"	"(2008-08-09 (17)) I was at school in English. My desk was facing the back of the classroom, and three girls, including Josephine, some other girl I knew and this new girl who was ugly and chubby. They were talking about someone who they thought was ugly, and the way they were talking and looking at me, I figured it was me. Josephine said ""and all that fat"" and I looked up and they were looking at me. The new girl called me ugly and I said ""look at yourself"". She was like ""at least I'm not as fat as you"" and I said ""At least I don't look like you"". I got angry and so picked up her desk and pushed her back. I picked it up again and hit her with it then I left. Ezra was in a class outside and Ms Madsen was telling me to stay in after class. I said that I was going to call Mom to go home. Ezra followed me and I told him off. I was saying that ""teenagers are stupid"". I called Mom and she said she would come and get me."
"2267"	"(2008-08-09 (17)) Dad shared his birthday with some people. These two guys were playing this game and they were bad."
"2268"	"(2008-08-09 (17)) Ezra got off GTA 4 online, and let me play. I drove around and then got bored."
"2269"	"(2008-08-09 (17)) I was on the computer on a game, except I was playing it out live, and it showed red and green dots. It was in this street, except it was in abandoned village. I jumped across a building. I was on top of the building and bad guys were gathering around on the ground. I was shooting at them. Others came and we finished them off. This gate was open and we left and were trying to find some information. Elijah found this room with ""our homework"" in it. This teacher person came. Then we were in a carpark and we had to put things on our heads so we didn't get wet, then it was raining. Ezra was there. A car of someone who was bad came. I can't read the rest of my notes."
"2270"	"(2008-08-10 (17)) I was at Mom's and we were having dinner. Ezra was being slow. Mom and Darren were at the table. We had gnocchi and they put hardly any on my plate so I asked for more and Darren did. We put sauce on it. Someone said something about West Virginia and where it was near and Darren was singing Wheeling West Virginia and I was like ""Yeah, I think, what are the lyrics for that damn song?"" and Darren was like ""I was just joking"". I said something back that I can't remember."
"2271"	"(2008-08-10 (17)) I was in class, in English. The class was different and I was at the very back. Ms Madsen had assigned leaders for something and they got these black coats to wear. The leader names were 'wind, earth, water and fire (me)'. I was putting the coat on and these people were watching me and laughing so I went out of the class to put it on. It was tight, so I took it off. This girl said they were laughing because of the ""fat around your elbow"". Fatima was next to me. Eugene came in to the class wearing a suit with a red tie as a costume for his class. He had a ring on and an earring and I was really annoyed. The girls kept bothering me and I got annoyed and said ""so what? Why is that funny?"". I pinched her cheeks hard and said that she had fat there. I threw something and it hit Johanna and I said ""Sorry, didn't mean to hit you"" and she got up and tried to attack me. There was a whiteboard at the front of the class. I tried to poke her in the eye with some pointy object, but I only did it gently, because it hurt my eye and it wouldn't go through anyway. I gave up and ended up knocking her out. I left with Fatima. My phone broke and I text ""smile"" and then ""... or not"". People were after us. People on the street could turn into them (like The Matrix). There weren't many people around though. I got into a car."
"2272"	"(2008-08-11 (17)) I needed to go to the shop for some reason. I drove by myself but had my L-plates on. Ezra was with me, but he ended up driving instead. He reverse parked, but had a bit of trouble. We only had $1 but they had a deal for two lamingtons for a dollar so I got that."
"2273"	"(2008-08-12 (17)) I was at some friend of Dad's place. We were on Hotties, on my account. I was worried about typing in my password but figured it was just Facebook. They had a young daughter who was really munted looking and one side of her head was big. She was crying. We went home and my money on Hotties transferred to Dad's account, because his friend had stolen my password."
"2274"	"(2008-08-12 (17)) We were going to ride horses for Ezra's birthday, but he wasn't feeling well and I didn't have my shoes."
"2275"	"(2008-08-12 (17)) I was leaving somewhere and there were two cars and I went with Alejandro. Scarlett was doing some play and she was on the stage. This guy started chasing them."
"2276"	"(2008-08-12 (17)) I was in the bathroom and I turned my head a certain way and I could see an enlarged view of inside my right nostril. It was gross and dirty and scabby and I was thinking that must be what's wrong with it. I couldn't get the view back again."
"2277"	"(2008-08-13 (17)) Mom, Ezra and I went to this shop like place. There was ice-cream which looked glow in the dark at first. This lady made us one. It was cookies and cream and was nice. There were these robot hairdresser arms. Then I was at a house. I had to leave so I pretended to storm out angrily (I wasn't allowed to leave) and I jumped into the car. I was someone else sometimes. I was combining photos of people and I did Evelyn and Darius. I had recent photos of people at school. I showed Ezra. Mom disappeared and went to this place for bad adults which was next to a place for bad kids. She got out to deal with some killer person. There was some flaming Indian thing. Someone asked this person on a horse how he could only stay with one girl. Something happened that was actually a joke and had something to do with radios in 1980."
"2278"	"(2008-08-14 (17)) Dad was staying out late and Mom wouldn't pick me and Ezra up. I decided to make some food. We had a new microwave in the cupboard where the toaster shelf is. I put food in it and went to my room. I was thinking that I should return the microwave and get a toaster instead. Later, Ezra said he smelled something burning and I remembered about my food. I went out and it was all smoky. The cupboard the microwave was in was burning. Ezra turned it off. We panicked and tried to call Mom. She wasn't answering. Later, I was with Mom and Ezra. Dad was in his van except it wasn't him. Mom got us a new microwave, which was huge and old looking; I said it looked ""30 years old"". We went to the shop and got a mudcake and a lamington. She was asking about some robotic thing for Darren."
"2279"	"(2008-08-16 (17)) I was at school in this underground area near the canteen (which was bigger). There was a desk thing and Eugene and two others were on there. I sat down another time. I had to sit behind Eugene and someone. I went into the office, which was different, and I had my iPod and Shake It was playing. There was a book with records of all the students and the guy had the page open to Eugene. He had done well in something and got 99.8 in it. I had biology and I saw Evelyn and said hello and asked what she had [talked to her for the first time since May yesterday] ."
"2280"	"(2008-08-17 (17)) I was somewhere that was possibly school. This guy's girlfriend was on the phone talking to a guy and they made plans to meet up and have sex. I tried to tell my friend without telling him, that they were supposed to have lunch together. I was having lunch with him. Later, we were doing an experiment in chemistry and we were supposed to use the Bunsen burner but some people didn't and they got sick and I didn't. Later people were turning into vampires randomly. I was also in the middle of turning, and it took a while. Elijah was in the street. I went into the sun and sparkled (like in Twilight). I could smell blood."
"2281"	"(2008-08-17 (17)) I was at school and Calvin was there and had come back from his trip earlier than expected. Eugene and Darius were near us and he said something about me and ""Swamp Boy"". Later, I was at a park with Farrah. We went across the road to this little rollercoaster and I remembered going on it when I was younger. We climbed up and Farrah went for a ride but I realized I wasn't going to fit on it, so I went to climb down. Ariana was on the ladder and she wouldn't go back down. I was going to fall, so I pushed the ladder and she fell, but I had done it in a way that she wouldn't get seriously hurt. Dad put it back up and I got down."
"2282"	"(2008-08-17 (17)) I was at a carpark. Eugene and some others were there. There were smashed computers everywhere."
"2283"	"(2008-08-18 (17)) I had a sea lion. Poppa had something to do with it. We were moving it somewhere bigger. We were chucking it in the air and we could see a brown thing in the clouds and it moved in flashes. I showed Mom. I asked if it was going to go to her pool, but she said no as she was keeping the sea lion a secret. I don't know where it ended up. Later it was night and I went to the shop. This car stopped in my way and I had to get in. There were two guys in there and they asked me some questions. They then let me out, but there were these other guys. It was misty and one of them said ""we like mist"". I ended up in this weird town. This girl kidnapped us, but she had a shower and I escaped. This guy friend of mine had already escaped and I caught up with him. This Asian boy had raped this girl and was standing in this hut thing looking away from me. There was a spaceship thing and there were three guys. We all had to pair up. We were all in suits. I found this guy I had been looking for and we went into this capsule and got sent to the ground. He was then Peter Weller, and I didn't think he was going to survive, but he did."
"2284"	"(2008-08-19 (17)) I was at Westland University looking for apartments. I asked this lady if I had to fill out a form and she was being really difficult. Mom came. The apartments were nice and you could get fresh slippers brought to you every day, but I didn't get the point of it."
"2285"	"(2008-08-19 (17)) We had an excursion and went to some famous dead artist's place in this old abandoned town. There were old buildings in the town. When we got into the artist's place, there were animal costumes and I put on a llama outfit. There were also statues and things around. We went into this elevator, which was on the outside of the building and it started shaking and I said ""We should've taken the stairs"". Selena had this other animal costume on and we were pretending to be a couple and were taking photos together, but they all turned out blurry. We were then playing some pass the parcel game and I was next to Eugene. We had to all put our arm around the people next to us and so Eugene had his arm around me and I was extremely nervous about it. He fell asleep, but his arm slipped off and he woke up. Nana was also around. We were staying in a room that was really high up (the building was really tall). We had to climb up this ladder and there was a secret password. Eugene, Shen and I were staying in a room. These bad guys were coming and Shen said ""oh no"". I was looking in my sandwich to see what I had."
"2286"	"(2008-08-19 (17)) I was with Mom in the car and this cop guy pulled us over. He was talking to us and then I said ""I feel like some Grand Theft Auto"". The cop ran off to his car and got on his walkie-talkie thing and I called out ""No! I meant the game!""."
"2287"	"(2008-08-20 (17)) I was at school in Accounting. The seats were back to normal. I was next to Elijah though. I got results on a certificate for four of my subjects which were out of '10%'. For Chemistry and something else I got 0%. I ripped up the certificate."
"2288"	"(2008-08-20 (17)) I was talking to a werewolf. Vampires also existed. I was angry and was trying to stop them from doing something."
"2289"	"(2008-08-21 (17)) I was on a street. Ezra and I were trying to get somewhere. This evil guy was around and Ezra and I ended up in this alley thing. The evil guy got in and half killed me, but once he left I was fine. He got six bags of blood from someone. I tried to call Mom but I got no answer. We left the place. Later I was in a building, but cars also drove through it. I saw Eugene's father Abraham and he let me through. I saw Eugene later and he had this thing on his ear, which I realized was something that he was using to listen to some sports thing. This guy was going through my pencil case. He didn't say anything to me. Alejandro, Jeremiah and Darius were yelling about something. Thuy called Eugene 'Mickey'. One of them said something like ""Eugene would've had more to say in a convo especially since Alejandro didn't know much"". Darius was swearing in Macedonian. There was this other evil guy who had light brown hair and brown eyes. He had bushy eyebrows which were angled down, like he was angry. He could easily swap his hair around. He made his eyebrows normal and he was pretty good-looking. I was a car with him later trying to trick him. Lillian, some others and I were in some photos. I had made a face accidentally in one of them. There were other photos of kittens."
"2290"	"(2008-08-22 (17)) This girl and guy had been sleeping together for a while, but they were keeping it a secret. Her actual boyfriend, who looked like a young Hugh Laurie, decided to sleep with some other girl. She was outside this motel looking place and he was in one of the rooms. She saw him having sex with her and she was calling him a retard. Then it was me. I went to this other room and a young James Spader was naked on the bed, but was covered up with a blanket. I sat on the bed with him. We were hugging and my legs were on his legs (which were hairy). He was stroking my legs, which were also hairy and I said ""I couldn't be bothered [shaving] "". He then had grey shorts on and I was wondering how he got them on. I think he could go to the past sometimes. He had this radio from the past. I got McDonald's breakfast and dropped it off to these people, but I had forgotten some. I was going to give it to them tomorrow. Later, Ezra and Dad had been in a small accident, they came back in the back of a small Ute. The doctors had thought Ezra might be pregnant. Mom was hanging up my underwear on a line outside the building, she said ""there might be sperm in one of them"" and I said ""ew"". I was at school and Mr Reilly had done a family tree of me, he was pointing out ""Tommy Conell"". Alejandro said something about an ""arch of life"". There was a photo of my room when it was clean and Jemma said ""What's that on the roof?"" and I said ""That's my floor"". She thought my room was messy. Mittens and Tigger were in a photo. Eugene was in the class. I was going through my phone and Ms Quintana was in my contacts. I was telling Calvin later as I didn't know how she got on there."
"2291"	"(2008-08-23 (17)) I was watching a movie, except it wasn't, which was like a sequel of Children of the Corn. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) was in it. Granma was pregnant. Smudgy and some other cats were in this cage, which was like a glass container. There was a pig in one too. We took something out of a smaller container and I asked why we didn't let Smudgy out. Smudgy didn't like this guy called Jacob, which reminded me of Twilight. Somehow we saw a glimpse of the future and a fire was going to burn the whole world. We realized that someone had done something in Gatlin. Eli, some others and I went there. There were kids infected with corn and we got them to leave. If they were infected with corn, they would burn better there. Eli randomly turned into a tomato on the path. Granma apologized and he turned back and said in a weird voice, ""apology accepted"". Ezra found this scene of Twilight on Youtube, which went for 8 minutes. I said it was ""still stalking me"". It showed Edward and Alice (from the movie) and I said that the actors chosen suited the role. Rosalie (actress from the movie) was driving and I said she didn't."
"2292"	"(2008-08-24 (17)) I looked out of my window to see the moon like two squished ovals on top of each other (see diagram). I was on the phone to Mom and she was watching it. It went white and then close but then it flew back and I got off the phone and it turned fuzzy and red around the edge and then filled in and looked like the sun. I told Dad and Ezra that they should look. It got closer. Dad said he would look when he got something (he was on his laptop). I said ""We're going to die"". I was then thinking that I had to see Eugene. Then there were aliens in the sky and the Earth was shooting back at them. I decided that they were after Ezra. They shot back at us and my door got shot to pieces and it had metal framing which was hanging off. They came to the house. Some of them were squeaky and looked like mice. They were also really fast and I couldn't catch them. I managed to get a few and was hitting them with one of those cake server things but they would just squish a little and not get hurt, so I started flinging them into the air. I gave some other aliens, which were more human-like some cake, which was really nice. I gave them popcorn too. They were joking around with us and I was trying to tell them that Ezra wasn't here. There was a friendly mouse thing called ""Chit"". Ezra and I were later watching TV. Robert Pattinson was on there and I said ""he's in that stupid movie I have to see"". Ezra misunderstood what I said and said ""he's the reason why you want to see it?""."
"2293"	"(2008-08-25 (17)) Calvin had sent me a text saying ""it was subtle"" and I didn't know what he was talking about. I ended up having a baby and it turned out, as I found out from Ezra, that I'd had sex with Silas. I then remembered deciding to have sex, but couldn't remember why. I drove somewhere by myself and I had the baby with me. Mom yelled at me for having it with me."
"2294"	"(2008-08-25 (17)) There were 10 kittens and I had to pick one to keep. Mom had bought all of them. Four of them were just circles. I could hear one of the kitten's thoughts. Someone was saying how they could see something and then not remember it. I can't remember what he said properly."
"2295"	"(2008-08-25 (17)) I was watching Tropic Thunder and it showed Ben Stiller in the war outfit, dirty and bloody and lying on the ground. Tom Cruise was dancing."
"2296"	"(2008-08-26 (17)) I was in science. Lucia was there and she was saying to move the desks around so that Elijah and I would be facing the back wall (she was being mean). I said ""suck my balls noob"" and Jeremiah and Bradley laughed. Bradley was saying to Eugene ""Did you hear what Izzy called Jess? She called Jess a noob"". Eugene said ""I like it"" or something."
"2297"	"(2008-08-27 (17)) I was at Nana's. I had my Gameboy stuff there. I had slept there. Dad was there. I called Mom to get me at 2pm -- it was 1pm now. Poppa and some others wanted to sit at the table so I sat in the lounge and Aunt Sally was down there. All these flies/bugs suddenly covered the windows and inside [I watched the bug episode of Supernatural last night] . To get rid of them, you had to breed them with other coloured bugs and they would suddenly disappear. We were running through the house, breeding them (it was instantaneous). There were four cars outside and the bugs had eaten three of the engines. The other car was older and had a different thing instead of the engine. Ezra, Dad, Poppa and I drove to this friend of Poppa's, the first path was blocked off and so we went a different way. I accidentally killed him with a stick. I checked the time and it was 3.18pm, so I called Mom to remind her to pick me up."
"2298"	"(2008-08-28 (17)) Dad and I were in a car discussing a movie. I was telling him I interpreted some of the stuff and he was amazed at the interpretations I had made. I had been invited to some house. It was night. When we got there though, Dad wasn't there and this other guy turned up. He was saying to me to pretend it was a horror movie and we were discussing the things not to do, so you don't get killed. There was a long empty patch of land next door, which looked quite creepy. He pointed to it as an example of not leaving the group and doing things alone and I said ""and don't have sex"". We joined the others at the back of the house. There was a chubby girl, who was the leader of it, and she said we weren't allowed turn our backs (so we had to look at someone) or we would be killed. This wasn't her fault though. The guy and I managed to look next door and all these people were dead on the ground and were a green colour. Everyone who had played this game had died. We realized that everyone died the same way and that there was a killer involved. We decided to leave before the killer came and so we jumped over the fence we had come in through. As we did, this taxi drove off. We walked instead and found these bridges, which were Asian like and they ended up getting really thin. It was also daytime now. There was one obstacle thing and Ezra was there and we needed to cross these bridges while singing David Bowie songs, and Ezra didn't know any. A long time later, the guy I with or someone else and I went back to the house and the police were there. There was a lady who made me write a note for some guy and I signed it ""Love [as a loveheart] Jacob"". Jacob was a werewolf. Dean and Sam (both Supernatural) were there."
"2299"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) I was in accounting and we had a test. The class was smaller. I got distracted by the teacher, who was Ms Madsen (but sometimes was someone else) and only ended up doing one of the many questions. Darius and Michael (and the rest) were sitting at these desks front of me. I had accidentally hit Darius and he went to the nurse. When he came back he said ""I had to get a test"" and Eugene laughed at him. Eugene asked me a question and came and sat next to me for me to answer, but then got interrupted by his friends. I saw Alejandro outside, walking to the classroom and I went to open the door, but it was already open."
"2300"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) Ms Pascal accused me of having a phone and I yelled at her for not believing me when I said I didn't. Eugene and the rest were laughing. [Yesterday I had felt sick, and she didn't believe me] ."
"2301"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) Eugene said ""If I hear that Nickelback song one more time, I'm throwing this [ring] away"". I wanted the song to come on so that he did."
"2302"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) Mom was going to let me have the day off school, but then Dad and Ezra pulled up at her house. Ezra stayed, but Dad left. We went to McDonald's to get food. Calvin was there and this other girl. I put my leg out and she almost tripped. I said ""sorry, automatic reaction"" and she said that it didn't even move and then some allusions to me being fat. This guy was singing and I was videoing it with my phone. Brianna took my phone because she wanted to do it. Later, the girl and along with Melodie and others were with me. She called me fat and I said ""at least I don't look like you"" and she said ""you're ugly too"". I said ""I can lose weight, but you're stuck with that face"" and that she ""looks like a rat that has been hit in the face with a shovel 1700 times"". She was Asian looking, with dark skin and was ugly. She looked at me incredulously. I was then threatening her with a butter knife. I asked Calvin to get me a sharper one and in a high pitched voice he said ""a sharper one?"". I got one myself and placed the point above her knee. I didn't think I would be able to stab her as it would be hard to get through and also that I would feel uncomfortable, but I stabbed her in the knee anyway and it went through easy and I felt fine. She screamed. I stabbed this pen too and the ink ran out into a bin. I tried not to get ink on my leaver's jacket. I planned to kill her but let the others go."
"2303"	"(2008-08-29 (17)) I was out the front of home and there were lots of kittens near the garage. I was trying to put them in the garage, but there were so many and they kept getting out. I started putting them in boxes instead. This guy was there and I said ""damn, an adult is left"". He reminded me of REM for some reason and then later I found something with Everybody Hurts on it. We got all the kittens in the garage, but I had to leave. In case he closed the shutters and took over the place I was hesitant to leave. Eventually I said ""you promise"" and he agreed and I left to get water and a light. When I came back he had closed them. I opened the bottom of one of them and he popped his head out and I aimed and squirted water in his face and said that I'd shoot his kittens, but he had a gun and shot them himself. The kittens ended up letting me in. Light was shining in my face. The kittens were now people and they killed him. I told the kittens not to go near the pool. Then I was watching a movie and Jason Bateman was in it and he was keeping zombies in his garage. All the zombies were kids or teenagers and they were just like people. His garage was fancy and looked like a house. He had a bed in there and these two zombies (girl and a guy) were on a couch under a blanket. Jason Bateman's character's father said ""is that the guy-,"" and saw the girl zombie pop her head out. And he said something like ""you and that girl"". I liked the way the garage had transformed and so liked the movie."
"2304"	"(2008-08-30 (17)) There were cats in the bathroom, hiding. I heard a noise and I followed it. It was coming from under Dad's bed. Ezra said there was a cat under there. Cuddles was under there. I went to my room and put her on my bed. I saw a dark green/black snake like thing slithering under my stuff on the floor. Poppa and Dad were out the back and I asked them how to kill it. I described it and they freaked out. Poppa, in which I think was an attempt to get me to leave the house, asked if I wanted food and I said ""No, Mom's getting it for me"". I thought it was Sunday and that Mom had to do my hair, but remembered it was Friday. There were some people filming a music video on a beach and the snake was around."
"2305"	"(2008-08-31 (17)) There was a demon killing kids. Dean and Jo (both Supernatural) were talking and she asked him something and he said ""I love you. I've always loved you"" etc. Then Sam and Dean were somewhere looking for the demon, but it was standing over another kid."
"2306"	"(2008-08-31 (17)) I was staying at Mom's, but I was at home waiting for her. I called her to ask how long she was going to be and she said ""Don't worry, I'm coming, it's your turn to stay""."
"2307"	"(2008-09-01 (17)) Some others and I were in a hotel. We were then outside and this gas started coming and was going to be everywhere, so we left. One of the people I was with said it smelled like ""toxic gas"". We were driving really fast and weaving through traffic. We were outside this hospital. I was with lots of others my age. The ambulances were taking off really fast and I couldn't cross the road. Farrah and Ariana were there. Ariana was trying to climb up the back of the hospital, and I was holding this thing steady for her. Valerie was also there. This other lady was around. I had pants on and was hot, so I went into this little room which was away from the hospital to change. There were lots of towels in a cupboard in there. I couldn't get them around me and so the lady made me 'smaller'. It felt weird as I was getting smaller. I could now wrap the towel around and wrapped around like a skirt. Ezra made fun of it. We ended up getting into the hospital but it was just a large room with kids in it and most of them were dead."
"2308"	"(2008-09-02 (17)) I was watching Supernatural/Freaks and Geeks. Someone was telling Neal (Freaks and Geeks) that the yellow-eyed demon was his father. I was saying ""I knew it"". His father had cheated with someone who was actually the demon and his wife had gotten pregnant from it. Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks) was around."
"2309"	"(2008-09-03 (17)) I was at school in the common room. Lorelei was standing up and had some bits of paper in her hands and she was talking to someone and they asked her how many she had. I realized they were dreams. She had thirty something. I told her that I had 2300. She showed me a dream she had written and it had two sentences and a bunch of pictures, including one of Jared Padalecki. I told her it was better to write full sentences rather than put pictures. I said I had five books full of dreams and I was typing them up. She asked why I was typing them up."
"2310"	"(2008-09-03 (17)) I was at Mom's house, which was different. Ezra was moving back there and I decided to go to her house. I got stuck with a lame room again."
"2311"	"(2008-09-04 (17)) I was at the exam place for chemistry. Eugene and I had become friends which I knew due to what Calvin and some others were saying. Calvin and I had to walk along this narrow ledge. Others were in front of us and these guys stopped to buy a drink from a stall. We got held up, so we jumped off but it was where the ledge basically ended. There was a mirror somewhere and it wasn't reflecting properly. Calvin ran into this cinema and I followed him. There was a weird movie playing and he left. This lesbian started talking to me and said her current girlfriend had thought she was a guy at first. I left there and was carrying lots of books and my calculator. Autumn dropped some of her stuff and thought she'd lost her calculator but she didn't. I went into this other cinema, where another weird movie was playing, which had a guy with red hair dancing. I was writing down books to use for my English exam and I had included A Clockwork Orange and written Anthony Burgess next to it. I was trying to remember the director of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but I couldn't. I was trying to remember the ""three hour movie"" he did as well."
"2312"	"(2008-09-04 (17)) I'm not sure where I was but I was in a room somewhere. Eugene was sitting on a chair. Something happened and I realized it was a dream. I saw Eugene in the corner and forgot what I wanted to do. I put my hand on his shoulder and said ""Hey Eugene, what's up?"" and he just looked me and then looked away. I ran my hand down his back and then through his hair, which felt rough and like dog fur, saying that I'd always wanted to do that. I told him it was a dream and to do a reality check. I did and breathed and my nose squeaked and then everything went white and I had a false awakening. I was at the end of Brookland Ave, at the lights. Jeremiah and Selena were there. I was going to wag, but there were lollipop ladies everywhere. I also thought I saw Ms Corbett. Darius and Jeremiah were walking and they said they were going to pick up Eugene and then go to school. I went with them and we walked slowly, but we got to school and Eugene was already there. I saw Alejandro around too. They were all wearing their leavers' jackets. The library had no books in there and had lots of lounges in there. I was telling Autumn that Nana had the same lounges (the recliners). Elijah was joking about it and said ""a library with no books"". We had an excursion and Elijah didn't want to go so he planted this stuff around to excite the teacher into searching for more stuff (like a treasure hunt), so she wouldn't go. Julianna was around and I was telling her how to do something."
"2313"	"(2008-09-05 (17)) I was at school. We were watching An American Werewolf in London. I wasn't facing the TV but then turned around so I could watch it. This lady asked us what we rated it and I said ""10 out of 10"" and she was like ""10 out of 10?!"" and I said 'Yeah I loved it the first time I saw it'. Elijah had cupcakes and he gave one to Ezra. Samantha was also at the desk. They were really nice cupcakes. I felt full and stopped eating them. We were going to be picked up early. Then I was watching Supernatural and something happened to Bobby, whose name was actually his real name, Jim Beaver. He had bones in his desk. He was actually dead and Sam said ""he tricked us"" and then someone slammed Sam and Dean's heads together. I was going through my most listened to music on my computer and the most listened to song was Don't Fear the Reaper."
"2314"	"(2008-09-06 (17)) We went to a cemetery after someone in our family died (or someone else). I was with Dad and Ezra and we were carrying the coffin. Eugene and his family were in front of us. He had two sisters and he was wearing his leavers' jacket. One of his sisters had ""Seecee"" on the back and the other had ""Solaris"". Eugene said it was either a ""Russian movie or a Russian spacecraft"". Then we were on an excursion and Eugene was following me. There was a mirror maze and Eugene went off to get changed. Jeremiah and Darius were around in orange jumpers. Across from the mirror maze were some guys fighting on a stage in a weird way and one of them was in a lot of pain. I asked someone if we were supposed to get changed and they said no and I said ""Eugene is"" and I went through the maze. We then were eating lunch. Jeremiah told Eugene not to sit with me because he thought he had a 'thing' for me. He sat somewhere else. We had to write down a question and I went to get a black and red pen out of my bag, but first I forgot the red pen and grabbed blue instead and then I went back to get the red pen. Last Train to Clarksville was playing. This book of mine wouldn't close, so I just left it open. Evelyn was crawling on the floor to get to a plate. Jeremiah came to the table where I was and asked Alejandro and I what we were eating and I said ""vegemite sandwich"" and he said ""same old, same old"" and I wondered how he knew. Then this girl went to this house with a vampire guy. They got separated and she bumped into her brother. Some guys took their car, which was the car from Supernatural. This vampire morphed into this woman. This girl was later outside at this rocky place with a vampire guy. There was a vampire couple in a bed. The girl was pretty and she had brown hair and a red ribbon thing around her neck. Later I was at home and Uncle Wilbur and Poppa were there doing something for me, but I don't remember what. I had to have a shower."
"2315"	"(2008-09-07 (17)) I was at school. In period 2 I decided I wanted to go home so I text Mom and I said to pick me up before 10, so I would miss out on lunch 2. I left class and Mom came and she said the office ladies had been really rude and they were going to make us talk to Ms Pascal. I was trying to explain that I was sick, because of those headaches I keep getting, but they wouldn't listen. Ms Southwell was also there. I got angry and pushed all the paper off the desk and went and sat in the car."
"2316"	"(2008-09-07 (17)) I had to collect kittens from this giant red dog. We had to crawl inside it and it had walls. If we touched the walls with this electronic stuff we would get -2 points. Each kitten was worth 1 point and we needed 6 points to pass. It was dark inside the dog. Then I was outside and there was this forest area with these metal drums with dark, murky water in them, with snakes in them. We had to reach in to grab them. There was another area with animals surrounded by fences. There were dogs and there was this really pretty pony. This guy came and I don't think I was supposed to be there."
"2317"	"(2008-09-07 (17)) I had an apartment thing at school. I lived with three others. It was quite messy. I went to the toilet and when I wiped there was this green, plant like stuff on the toilet paper. I wiped again and then the toilet paper was the plant stuff. I left the toilet and in another room there was a guy with his head on the desk and he looked like Daryl. I left the apartment and ended up in this undercover area and I took my shoes off for a second, but then I couldn't find them. I asked this teacher guy for help, but then I found them. I text Mom to get me because I only had private study left. She said ok. I told her to go to the far end of the street so that I could sneak out and didn't have to sign out. She said she was going to get some ice-cream first. I sat down at a bench and saw some white shoes walk past and I looked up and Eugene walked past with his brother, talking to him. Calvin came with some girl. We got some photos and we had our leavers' jackets open."
"2318"	"(2008-09-08 (17)) I was at school and it was Monday. I was annoyed that I was in Ms Solomon's class now because it meant I had English on a Monday [I don't really] . Eugene and someone sat in my seat, so I had to take one at the front. Ms Olmstead was teaching the class. She mentioned --Torrent and she asked what letter came before the -- and no-one said anything and she said ""not even the people who know want to tell me"". Someone asked Eugene if he knew. We went on the net and Ms Olmstead told us to do this quiz that would tell you what nationality you are. Mr Nixon was in a dropdown list. I saw Ms Solomon and I was glad I didn't have to do this essay."
"2319"	"(2008-09-08 (17)) I was watching Supernatural. Sam fell asleep and Dean woke him up. They were after something that wasn't human (I think it was a dog or something). It could so something 'supernatural' and they were trying to talk to it. Sam was then in the car with some girl and Jess was in the back. These police told him that his car was leaking gas. Sam was saying to someone ""it is better to tell the truth than lie""."
"2320"	"(2008-09-08 (17)) I woke up and went on my computer and realized it was late and we weren't at school. I called out to Ezra to ask why we weren't at school. Then I realized it was Sunday [not really] . I was glad about this. The internet wasn't working and I kept resetting it. I found four more episodes of season 3 of Supernatural, but they were classified as season 4. I had another download going and it had 9mb left. I finally got the net working."
"2321"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) I was watching some show, of which only five episodes were made. Then there were zombies. This guy and a girl were in a room. This door thing kept keeping something open, but if it was closed it wouldn't open again. The guy made sure it was open and let the girl out, but he left too and they left this other girl."
"2322"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) I was reading something on the net and Jared Padalecki had two sons and another kid on the way. Colin Clive was on this reality show to get married. I was like ""I didn't even know he was alive"". He was 80. This girl was at the door for him and she was 40 something. She left because she was awkward about the age difference."
"2323"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) I was at this house in the middle of nowhere. I was with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and going out with the former. Mom came up and left with him. When they left, Jared put his arm around me and we started making out. This black guy was a friend of his and was cleaning something outside and he knew about this affair we were having. I wanted to leave and called Mom but she only just got back and said it would take ""70 minutes"" for her to get back. I started locking all the doors and windows. None were locked because there wasn't anyone around for miles. There were stingy looking frilly curtains on the windows. This guy got angry and picked up the only car there and threw it into the water. Then he was this girl friend of mine and her name was Emily or Jade. She decided to look for a car herself instead of waiting for Mom. We went to this shed and she looked out the window and told me to get a badge and she grabbed this police badge. The only one I found had a fish hook on it as it was used ""for bait"". We made up names and went down. There were two cop guys there and they invited us to eat and there wives were sitting at a table. We saw the bad guy outside the window, but he had seen us earlier so as to not blow our cover we hid our faces. Then this guy with a gun walked past so we went after him. We ran through this crowded undercover place and everyone was shooting. I shot the bad guy but then my gun clicked as it had run out of bullets and he lifted his gun to shoot me, but this girl, who was an ex-girlfriend of his, grabbed him and shot him herself. I threw my gun to this kid and said ""take the gun"". This black cop guy got it off him. Then I was with Nana and I was going through That's Life. I had written stuff in it. There was a page where I had written stuff about Twin Peaks and then the next page had a picture of Kyle MacLachlan. There were photos of Fido and some other dog with its tongue sticking out."
"2324"	"(2008-09-09 (17)) Ezra could add music and other audio to video files in Windows Media Player and it worked really well."
"2325"	"(2008-09-10 (17)) I was at school. I was in the class next to Ezra's in a computer room. We got into a little fight. Then I went into this other room to do my ""art work"" and he had squirted this red/yellow sauce on it. Ms Solomon was egging him on. I yelled at him. Then I said to the teacher that I was leaving. There were only a few minutes left to the end of school anyway. I was then in some lady's van with Mom and Ezra. They went into the bakery at Midvale shops, but they made me stay as they didn't trust the lady. I asked for a chocolate muffin. They had the right notebooks for my dreams, but Mom had already bought me the right one this morning. This grey plane, which looked like a giant beetle, was flying around the carpark. It wasn't being driven very well and I said ""I wouldn't be surprised if it hit us"". Then it landed on the car in front of us, and rolled and just missed us. I took a photo of it as we left. Mom took me to this lady's house. There were cops up the street at another house. Mom suspected this lady of killing her kid. There was no furniture in the house and I said ""this looks like a big hall"", there was light against the wall from the window behind me. She asked me where I'd put some table because her cat, Pudding, liked to sit on tables. She left and I was alone. I saw a cage thing with something dark in it. Mom came and I shone the light from my phone in there and it was a dead baby. Mom called out bye, but the lady realized we'd found it and started bashing us up. These spirits that we'd saved came and were threatening her. This new girl spirit got excited and lost control and killed her. Sam (Supernatural) and I were then out the back chucking stuff into the ocean. There were a lot of bags and they wouldn't push out to sea. There was a little area out the back of her house and there was a lizard and I fed it to something. There were snacks nearby. Sam complained about all the bags and I said ""wait until you do mine!""."
"2326"	"(2008-09-11 (17)) I was playing a game, although it wasn't. I went into a house and there were helicopters and cops outside. I had this sniper and was shooting cops that were on the stairs outside. I ran out. The house belonged to a guy who was friends with the previous owner, who had been killed by the guy (who was me). I was at a deli and I bought a chocolate. When I left I realized I had all these other chocolates. This guy bumped into me to take them (he had put them on me so he could later take them). I kicked him in the nuts. He called out to the shop lady, whose name was Valerie, to say I had stolen chocolates. But we knew her so she didn't believe him. Later she was waiting for a date with this other guy was also a thief. This disabled friend of hers was with her. Dean and Sam (both Supernatural) were outside and this guy tried to shoot them. There were dogs sitting in the snow outside."
"2327"	"(2008-09-12 (17)) I was at school. I was in the library, which was different. I had an accounting test next. When I went out, my bag wasn't there. I told Ms Solomon and she let me search for it. We then had an assembly in a weird room. There were steps for us to sit on, but people were sitting under them as well. I was drawing a picture of a car in pencil. When I rubbed some of it out, the lights on the car broke and it also made this sheet of glass break. A teacher found it and I said I'd accidentally hit it and they thought I'd chucked a sad and broke it on purpose. Someone was on their phone and found my Bluetooth, and so I followed the signal from my phone and found my bag. My Bluetooth was called '2018'. There were some elevators and I was with Mom. Daydream Believer and Don't Fear the Reaper were playing. Darius had his bed in the common room. Margarita was around and was talking to someone. I was driving down the street with Dad. We saw Jayson, Jonas and others standing on the side of the road with these big white suits on, which looked like astronaut suits, so I asked ""What's with the astronaut suits?"". Dad said they were limo drivers. I saw Eugene there and wondered why he had decided to become a limo driver."
"2328"	"(2008-09-12 (17)) I was in accounting and we did a test and then I left to do something. Something of mine fell off. I told Ms Bigwood. I was then eating with Calvin outside the classroom. Abukar was telling a story of something to some girls and they were crying, but Geneva was laughing as it was a joke. Some boy asked me if he could have my sandwich. I said no, but then the siren went so I gave it to him and said ""go to the toilet and eat it quickly"". We went back into class and we were on computers. Calvin and I went on Runescape. Darius was behind us. On IMDb it said it was Alejandro's birthday, although it was the 19th. Elijah was in the class. I joked it was a dream and did a reality check and realized it was a dream and looked out the window and it looked really vivid out there. I tried putting my hand through the window a few times, but couldn't. I went outside and ran a little and put my fist into the air and flew up. I was sort of floating about and it felt weird, but then I fell out of the dream."
"2329"	"(2008-09-13 (17)) I was watching Grey's Anatomy and trying to remember why Denny had been in the hospital. I remembered that someone had been threatening Izzie with a knife and he had jumped in the way to save her and got stabbed [didn't really happen] . I was going to download those episodes again. I was on MSN and Jayson was on there. We had started talking and he sent me some links. Poppa needed me to go to a church in ""Montreal"". I was in the car on the way there but I forgot the name of the church. It was called St Nixon, but then it was Yeates and I thought 'Like Rebekah'. I was then with someone else and they pointed out the church. It was 12:10, and I was supposed to have done whatever I was supposed to do by 12. It was dark. This guard/priest guy was outside and was watching us. Poppa explained what I had to do and that I had to go into the ""hold"". I forgot the rest of what he said though. The guard guy called the cops, so we ran and were jumping and running around for a while. We ended up jumping into the hold, but it wasn't really. We kept making noises and then they would hear us and we would have to run again. It was then daytime. It showed this lump of ground and it moved. Then it showed this lady outside her house being questioned by the cops. Then it showed this other cop holding a gun to this guy's head, who lived across from her. They were going to kill him if she didn't tell them what the ground was for. They were actually aliens. They lifted up the grass, and the ground underneath was really soft and they put their hands in and pulled out a big, old phone. Then I had a flashback of me talking on it to Poppa. One of the aliens said ""How long did you know?"" and the other said ""13 years"" and the other one said that he'd known for ""38 years"". My partner and I were in disguises leaning against a wall around the corner. There was a lake across from us, and we ran and jumped into it. We were swimming under the water looking for something on the bottom of the lake. The aliens were now swimming behind us. We reached the end, then I quickly leapt around to the other side, using the sides of the lake. The person I was with was then Autumn. They ended up taking my partner to see what I would do, but I ran and got into the car and drove. It was then dark and I didn't put the lights on and almost drove into the lake. I put my lights on, but I had ended up on this rocky wall and I couldn't get off it and I had to drive carefully. Some parts of it were snowy. Three years later, I got off. I went back to the town and got a motel room, which had no TV and the lady was offered me hers. I then went to Mom's, which was her house, but Nana was there. Dad and Ezra were there too. They had these sausages, normal ones and ""French"" ones. The French ones had this hairy skin like stuff on them. I opted for a normal one. Dad had a French one. Ben (Big Brother) was there. Mom knew him. He thought I was Ezra when I first came in and said ""Hey Tommy"" and I said ""I'm not 'Tommy',"". I went to my room and Ezra's bed was still in there."
"2330"	"(2008-09-14 (17)) I was watching Supernatural. Then Dean, Sam and I went to this town because of murders that had happened there. We noticed that everyone looked emotionless (and it was called Happytown). Someone normal was talking to us about some creature that had a lump of stuff on its bum and I joked that it had a ""rectal prolapse"". We were then near this dirty, swampy water. There were ducks in it. I think someone was getting attacked on the other side and we all jumped in and swam. I had a fork in each hand and was trying to swim around the ducks so I didn't stab them. Sam and I were joking about it as we swam. We got to the other side and near another bit of water and this mother duck, which was this deformed creature came out. They stabbed it in the bum and it had a rectal prolapse, but it had this flap of skin coming up from under it, so the prolapse was kept in it. We could see this field a while away with this other lone mother duck with a prolapse. I was helping Sam get his stuff into his bag and throwing the useless stuff away. I was looking at rocks around the place for a certain type. Then the mother duck said it was going somewhere and Sam was like ""The colt murders?"" and it said yeah. It said that the people of the town were being controlled and some other town was sending the Happytown people to be sacrificed. We left and then we were on a street. Sam and Dean were down the street a while from me and I was with a girl. We saw this lady and pointed her out to Sam and Dean and they shot her in the butt a few times. We ran over to say that that's not what we meant, that she wasn't bad. She was ok, and we took her to the hospital. This nice car drove past and it had a black guy in it. The girl said that it was probably a good candidate for the bad guy. We were then in a hotel. There were female ghosts there and they were trying to get us to have sex with them. They turned me into a guy and made me have sex with one of them."
"2331"	"(2008-09-15 (17)) This guy wanted to be a magician. It was me though. I was then playing this game, although it played out live. I was in a police station and I had to unlock this thing and hide behind a wall for a certain amount of time. I started unlocking it but then this guard came and I hid behind the wall. Every time I went to leave I did it too early. It would then reset. Then the magician guy's friend got blown up, but he thought it would reset, but it didn't. He was ok though. I was then outside a shop with Ezra and we were walking around to get somewhere. I saw Milo Ventimiglia and I hugged him and stole his car keys as this was part of a timeline (we were time traveling or something). He had a blue car."
"2332"	"(2008-09-15 (17)) I was with a bunch of people. We had to decide who was going to die for something. I got chosen, but I wasn't on the list so I didn't have to. It had something to do with selling souls. But when they were doing it, I was lying down with the rest of them as they covered us with a blanket."
"2333"	"(2008-09-15 (17)) Vampires were now known about. They were blue. This girl was going out with one. Three others came and threatened her but she ignored them and then they were cool (it was a test)."
"2334"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) Mom and I were at this house, as she wanted to buy it. It was big and they said it was an Asian design. The front of it looked symmetrical, with two rounded sides with a pointy roof on each and a flat roof in the middle. I was looking at the bedrooms and they all had a double bed in them. There were two master bedrooms and two normal ones. One of the normal rooms had a bathroom next to it and I wanted it. The other one was bigger so I hoped Ezra would take it. We went out the back and it had a huge backyard. We were in the middle of a garden. I joked that we would need the scooter thing that Poppers has to get around it. He was also there a while away from us."
"2335"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) Dexter (Dexter) jumped into the water and swam to get rid of evidence. Then I was with Dad sitting on these train tracks. Al Pacino and Robert de Niro were there. Al was telling us what we had to do and I joked to Dad if he knew which one he was and he did know. We had to quickly cross the tracks. This girl said something to Robert de Niro and he came over and leant over to talk to her, but this train came and killed him. It reset and so he didn't die, but someone else did. He fell into the water next to the tracks and this boat exploded."
"2336"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) I woke up and was writing down a dream I had about Chris Barrie, which was the first dream I'd had about him."
"2337"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) This teacher had sheets of paper with information about all the students on them. I was looking as they flicked through and I saw Eugene's one and his middle name was Rodney and I thought that was silly since they named his brother Rodney."
"2338"	"(2008-09-16 (17)) We were at school and the siren went, so we were walking out of school. The little white car (1BEE) was there. Ezra and I got in, but Mom went off to the school. We didn't know how long she was going to be so I drove to her house. I called her and thinking we were still at the school asked, ""Why don't you ask one of the teachers?"" and I said we were at her house and she was angry."
"2339"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) I was at school. I had an accounting test but Elijah walked towards health to do a test. When I got to accounting though, he was there. Calvin and Darius were also there. The class was like a restaurant."
"2340"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) I had just woken up and was in bed writing down my dreams and Dad came in and turned my light on and told me angrily to get up."
"2341"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) I was in my room on my computer and I had read a magazine earlier that had posters of Martin Sheen from Apocalypse Now, Jensen Ackles and a picture of James Spader. I showed Ezra the pictures of Jensen and Martin. I was typing something personal later on the computer and Ezra came in and I was trying to hide it and get rid of him. I had downloads going too. He wouldn't leave. We both left the room at the same time. There were no water bottles in the fridge and I complained. Ezra left a cup of orange juice on my desk and I ran to his room and poured it on the floor. I realized he'd be angry and ran out. He stormed out angrily and was coming towards me."
"2342"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) Bill (True Blood) and I were going out for some reason. Also, vampires weren't known about. We went to this house. There was a couple there. Hitler was there too. Bill and I were speaking German to each other. Hitler said to me that people liked him and they even had this mask thing of his face on the wall and there was a fish plaque thing as well. I said ""There's one of a fish too. I prefer the fish, you might taste funny"". He got angry and came after me to kill me, but Bill got rid of him. We were then at another house, which was Mom's, but not. We had actually gone back in time before. Ezra, Mom, Bill and I were at the table. Bill left and I said that he'd remembered that at 2.47am he had to save me. They didn't know what I was talking about. I went out into the lounge room and words appeared on the window saying 'ghost is here'."
"2343"	"(2008-09-17 (17)) There was some supernatural thing going on. I was watching this video of this lady, who was a pro zombie killer, was left at this fake apartment block. It was night. At the end of it, this helicopter came and she went outside and all the zombies were dead. I was also a good zombie killer. I was at this house with some others and we had been fighting zombies. I came across this normal blonde haired dude who threatened us, but he got away. Later we were walking down a hall and he was there and had someone next to him and behind us. Scarlett was attacked by the guy behind us and she fought with him. I killed the two near me with a knife and Scarlett was gone and I figured she had been killed. I turned the corner and this guy with spiky black hair was there. I thought I knew him, but I didn't. I think I killed him and this guy I did know turned up. We were rivals. He walked out of the building, saying loudly, that I'd killed his friends and my friend, Scarlett. There were cops surrounding the exit and I was arrested. Then it showed Scarlett in hospital and she was ok. Callie (Grey's Anatomy) said to her, ""I love you"" and kissed her. I was let off and I ended up setting something up for the guy. I had gotten him to pick something (a number or a card or something) and he said ""I pulled out 70"". He chased me down a street and I jumped into a ditch and then the cops pulled up and got him. This old guy was talking to them and said he'd seen two people. They asked if he knew the names of them and as I ran off, I heard him say ""Izzy Conell"" and I was thinking 'damn it!'. I went home, which was different and was like a unit. I had to walk up steps to get to the front door (a second storey). Ezra had an empty water bottle, so I went to get more and he filled them up, which surprised me. We were having mudcake with cream [we had some last night and it was really nice] . I showed Mom and she was unfazed. We also had lasagna for dinner. There were Pokemon game boxes on the table."
"2344"	"(2008-09-18 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We were doing some things before school. We went to get breakfast and I realized it was 12.15pm and Mom had already dropped Ezra off. I was then at home and I asked for the day off since there was only two periods left. I was showing Mom some photos at one point of Samantha and her sister Cyndi. I said her sister was ""only 14"" as she was wearing inappropriate clothes. We turned down a street and I thought I saw Samantha driving a car. I saw Eugene's car outside of a house and I realized that it was his new house and I tried to take a photo."
"2345"	"(2008-09-18 (17)) I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone or something. There was a small town and not many people were around as there was something that stopped them from leaving. It was night. This guy worked at a shop and this thing only allowed him a certain number of customers and he let an extra customer in and he said he was worried about this ""tailor"" coming. This lady came to town and walked into a house which had its door open and then walked out, and this wasn't allowed at night. She went into the shop and the guy said ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" and asked if she was the tailor and she said she didn't know what he was talking about. Then the tailor came and it was this short and ugly guy and he had lots of rings on. The woman stood with her face to the door and tried to leave quietly as the tailor killed the shop owner. He saw her and went after her. All the other residents of the town and her were running up the street to get away. Then I was the woman. He was shooting at us. There was a big circular ramp thing, which we had to run up and jump over this fence into our backyard, then into the pool and we would be back in reality. I couldn't be bothered running up the ramp so I jumped up to the top of it. I got over along with this girl and a guy. I dove into the pool and when I came up, no-one was around and it was day. Then the girl was there. I went inside and had a suspicion that she was the tailor. She was facing away from me and she turned around and had his face, but still her body and her hair (which looked funny). He turned to his normal form and he was going to kill me but I suggested we work together. He said ""So you tell everyone"" and I said ""No! Well, yeah"". I explained that I would tell people about all the myths and things that would make him appear. As an example I mentioned Bloody Mary and said ""kids do it"" and he said ""I do [kill] kids too"" thoughtfully and I said ""there you go!"". He took me up on the offer. The girl whose body he had taken over was in the games room. He grabbed the vacuum and put it on her vagina on high, to kill her. She was screaming. Later we were outside a house and this lady gave us this golden bowl, which was one of the myth things that the tailor could use. I said ""I know the perfect person for it"" and he said ""that Rebekah girl?"" and I said yeah. I remembered that earlier in the town, I had mentioned that I hated Rebekah. Later I went home, which was now different. I had a bunk bed. My 'sister' (she was a young adult) usually slept on the top bunk, but she was away. The tailor now looked like Rimmer (Red Dwarf and he looked season one/two-ish) and he said that he looked how I wanted him to look and I was thinking ""you got that right!"". He still had the rings on though and I really hoped he would take them off. He took the top bunk. I also had a brother who was around the same age as the sister. He came back and was not happy about the guy staying there. I was at a table and reading a magazine. There was a picture of David Tennant but it looked like Callum Blue at first. Then I was watching Ugly Betty. There was a flashback of last season and Gio and Henry were with Betty at a gym/yoga place and were waiting for her to make her decision and they both were knocked out. At the start of the new season, Betty was now missing. Her sister, who was different and pretty, went to the gym place and asked if Sookie worked there. They said yes. Henry saw her and asked if Betty had chosen. Gio stood up and the sister said ""Gio!"" and they hugged and kissed. Betty had now been the woman in the town and had died and Sookie (True Blood) was in her body. Back at the house, Sookie was lying in the bottom bunk. She had no shirt on and her bra was lifted up. In the kitchen, the tailor was wearing her shirt and teasing her brother. Then I, except I was someone else, was walking through this forest, at night, which had wires everywhere. I ended up at this house, which also had wires everywhere. The lights were off and it was dark. I noticed there was no furniture in the house and realized it was a surprise party for me. I turned into the next room and they yelled ""Surprise!"" and turned the lights on. I was getting married. There was a penguin, standing on a table, but it was actually a cake. I touched it and realized it was really solid."
"2346"	"(2008-09-18 (17)) I was at school in English. I asked Ms Solomon for help with this graph thing, which was actually Biology work. My tooth was hurting and was loose. I was chewing some bubble gum and I sucked at it and my tooth came out. I spat it out and there was heaps of blood. I was wearing white socks, and they, along with my shoes got covered in blood. I got a tissue and then asked if I could go home."
"2347"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) Rimmer (Red Dwarf) won an auction to sleep with some virgin girl [I read something like that yesterday] . She liked him though and they stayed together for the weekend. He had told her that he was someone else, someone who was rich and powerful etc. Later, the Red Dwarf crew had to go to her and he had to go along as himself. When they saw each other he smiled sheepishly. Lister told her that he had lied, in a way that made Rimmer sound bad and Lister sound good, and she said ""well at least he's good [in bed] "". Then it was me with him. We had watched some stupid romantic comedy and we decided that it was 'our' movie. We went to a planet. Kryten said the scan showed that there was lots of doors and humans had come before to replace plastic sheets with doors. We were outside near a paddock thing and Rimmer was tapping a song on a wooden log, which was part of the paddock. He said it was a lullaby his father used to sing on Io. It sounded tingy, so I tapped the wood, but it wasn't as tingy. There were these magazines on the ground somewhere and one had Angelina Jolie on the front. It was from far in the future. I found a book and was like ""Oh my God!"" and it had a family tree with me and Rimmer at the top and all our descendants, who were mostly actors. Some of the names were purple, from having been previously clicked on as I had looked them up from movies and stuff before. I was completely amazed and couldn't believe I had looked them up before. We were trying to work out how it was possible that it existed and we decided that we must have gone to 1995 and started a life together [the timeline was different, so I wouldn't have been young then] . Then I was at a shop with Ezra. They had 24 stickers for a 24 sticker book. We didn't open them as we didn't know if they were any good. I was watching some teenage show and I was talking in a voice like in White Chicks and I did the laugh from it. I ended up opening the cards and there was one of Elisha Cuthbert and Kiefer Sutherland (who was young). There was a video on Youtube of this young girl, who was about six, talking about who she thought were the 10 hottest guys. One of them was Ted Bundy and I thought that it was odd for a young girl."
"2348"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) I was at home. Mom and I went for a drive, but when we got back it was 7.50am, and Dad was leaving for work. I wasn't ready for school and asked Mom to take me. She said no and left. I decided to stay home and I went back to bed. Later, I saw a car in the driveway. I closed the wood door as it pulled up. It was dark outside. I ran to my room and put my school clothes on. The light was really dim in the room and something felt wrong so I did a reality check, which worked. I was then in a class with others who were lucid. I tried to put my finger through my palm [had read about it yesterday] and was saying ""there is no spoon"". I woke up and it said it was 25:99 and so I did another reality check, which worked and was talking to Ezra about lucid dreaming."
"2349"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) I was with the cast of Red Dwarf in a basement place, which had quite a few levels. I saw this guy's head pop out from somewhere and I said ""It's the 217 guy!"". He opened this door, which led outside, and told us to go outside. It was Earth. I said that I should stay, but I didn't. We didn't walk too far and there was another door, on the left side of the path. As I went to go in, it started to close and I made it through, but Kryten was left behind. I had to run across this dodgy bridge and then I was standing with Rimmer, who had screwed up his line (which was something about Lister). People started walking towards us over this oval. There was this girl and Rimmer ran to her saying ""Shamara!"" and hugged her and she was confused about it. Poppa, Dad and Mom came, along with various other people I knew. It wasn't real though."
"2350"	"(2008-09-19 (17)) I was at Nana's. Granma was there and her food was moving. Dad and Mom were there too. I saw Spaceman, Mittens, Fido and some other pet. I was petting them. There was something about Brad Pitt and Claire Danes."
"2351"	"(2008-09-20 (17)) Mom decided to this thing where she would make a honking sound and we had to say whatever we were thinking at the time. At one of the times, Darren said something really random. I was trying not to think about Chris Barrie. The next time she honked, I was."
"2352"	"(2008-09-20 (17)) I don't know where we were, but a bunch of people from school, some others and I were there. One was a guy that I had been with when I met Jewel Staite. We had this other picture of me and her. Someone was coming to see him and he gave the photos to me to hide somewhere (so no-one knew anything about him). Eugene and Darius had a room there. They changed something on the door, so it said Eugene was Finnish and Darius was French. I think Eugene and I were going out. I got into a car and Ezra was in the driver's seat. Eugene came and the car started reversing out into the street and wouldn't stop. He got stuck on the bonnet, but decided to stay on the outside of the car. There was a girl with a balloon and I grabbed it and it started shrinking and popped and she blamed me, but I said it was already popped (it was). I saw this director guy and recognized him. I found something about him and was like 'That's where I know you from!'. Some guy asked us if we knew any actors (for a job). Then it showed some of us entering a building (we had taken up the offer). I had to get in to this place and I had a bag strapped and this other guard checked it. While they were distracted, Theodore slipped into the toilet just behind them. I went into the bar and Johanna and two others were there. I went into the next room and some girl I had met before decided she wanted help with applicable math. They cancelled intro calc to do it and Fatima came in and was trying to work out what happened. This girl and guy were trying to get this other guy horny and when he did they pulled a gun on him. Maeby (Arrested Development) was outside a window of the building on a high storey, attached to the inside door. If someone opened the door, she would be killed. A lady tried to open it, but she couldn't. Maeby slid into this thing, so the cord wouldn't be as short and therefore wouldn't cause her to be killed. Ezra was confused about what she did (it was something that she wouldn't have been able to do in real life). There was some experiment, where these people had guy a big hole and there was lots of sand next to it. Something changed the reality and now Germans had dug a bigger hole. The reality kept changing. Some of the new realities included Alejandro being there, our postcode was 6064 and other random stuff. There was some alien disease. It was like the Hex virus from Red Dwarf and I was thinking 'Rimmer!'. I was also watching some Red Dwarf thing. Cat was on it, but I didn't recognize him or any of the others, except for Rimmer. In this reality, I had met Chris Barrie. There was a book by someone which said that The Beatles were their favourite band. There was a shiny spot in the book, which had Jared Padalecki written in it."
"2353"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) I went into Ezra's room and he was watching season 2 of Red Dwarf. I remembered how skinny Rimmer was compared to season 7 and 8 and was thinking he was really hot. I was going through stuff on my computer later and I was in the TV shows folder and I had to scroll through everything and it was cloudy and taking ages. Ezra had downloaded the latest Heroes episode and asked me what happened to Claire in the shop and I had no idea what he was talking about and he gave the episode to me. Claire and Peter were in a flashback. I was with someone sitting on a dodgy ledge thing on the beach and we were scabbing money off people somehow. Sometimes I was with Dad. Ezra and I were playing this virtual reality type game and I was a hologram. We were trying to escape and he died. I was fighting and trying to steer this huge boat. I was having trouble controlling it and then I had to fight this guy and I was having trouble with him, so I grabbed my lightbee and was fading away, so as he punched me, he fell off the boat."
"2354"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) I was at school, which was different. There was this competition on, where we had to go through some different stages. First, there were three different lots of bugs in three different places, near each other. I realized they were breeding with other things. I can only remember scorpions and spiders. Eugene was there, but he didn't do this part first. The people who were doing this one, went inside this house, which was just past the bugs. As we climbed up the stairs, which were circular, there were also three lots of things scattered over the stairs. The first one was serial killers and Ted Bundy was one of them. They would come to 'life' and one had an axe. This girl and I decided to just run, instead of identifying them. We got to the top and since only the top 3 could pass, I was worried someone would get rid of me, so I pushed her off the side. This fat guy, this other guy and a girl came, but the fat guy fell off and accidentally took the girl with him. The other guy and I were the only ones left. We didn't want to go back down the stairs so we had to get out through a window. I grabbed a towel and put it around my hand and punched the glass. I said ""I watch too many movies"". Then we had to go to this room, ""om1"" and there were random tests. The room had computers in rows in the middle of it, but I sat at a round table at the side. This guy with a posh accent was talking to me. The tests were really random, one of them was it would give us a German title of something and we had to rate how ""fierce"" it was."
"2355"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) This girl was dead and had died at a young age. She was a ghost in this dilapidated house. She made me follow her and fall through the floor. I discovered that her father had poisoned her. Then it was me that had died and that's what had happened to me, but it wasn't Dad that poisoned me. I was a ghost and was trying to tell Mom."
"2356"	"(2008-09-21 (17)) I was with some friends on a street and we were trying to hitchhike. It was early evening. We were thirsty. Eugene was there and we were going out. I was thinking that we never made it out of this and were never found. This guy pulled over and I thought he was dodgy but this girl and I went to get in. The girl sat in the front and I opened the back door to get in and I said ""Eugene"" and he quickly came over. We were in the middle of the back. As we drove, I put my arm around him and he did the same and said ""it's ok"". The guy did something and when he stopped, I jumped out and ran and Eugene followed. The guy stabbed the girl. I got really puffed out. I kept looking behind to make sure Eugene was with me and the guy was close behind. There were houses around, but they were all empty I think. I was trying to text our other friends to tell them not to get in his car so that we didn't all die. We did manage to get away."
"2357"	"(2008-09-22 (17)) I don't know how we got there, but I was at this house. I think two guys lived there. I was with a male friend who I liked and a female friend. They took one set of keys off of us, thinking they were car keys and wouldn't let us leave. Calvin told me a joke about a guy who puts his finger up people's bums to see how clean they were. I was like 'it's not that funny'. The guy I liked was now Eugene. One of the guys wanted to test us. He wanted to put us in an animal porn video. We were playing Scrabble and the guy almost had the letters to make 'Johnathon'. The guy left to do something. Eugene was next to me and I asked him if he had keys and he said no, but I hadn't realized the guy was still there and he suspected Eugene of having keys and found them and took them. I said ""sorry"". There was a room behind us, with a shelf against the wall full of videos. They were all animal porn and I was trying to stall the guy by asking him what the best ones were. There was one of him having sex with these two dogs (he was having sex with one and the other was doing him). While I stalled, I managed to attack him. I got our keys and attacked the other guy. Then it was a movie I was watching and the two girls there escaped. They met up later and shook hands instead of hugging (they had been friends for ages, but the experience had driven them apart). I was outside somewhere. There were these bin like things, which were thin-ish and cylindrical, with a line a few centimeters down. If I touched the bottom part of it, it turned blue and the top bit turned white. Some didn't work. This other guy was doing it too and it was easier for him. One of the bins was dodgy and it wouldn't work for either of us when we touched it."
"2358"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) I was on the net and had a message from a guy about a post I'd made on the Red Dwarf forum about my desk, which was written rather oddly, and my preferring movies over TV shows. He said he knew a guy called Doug who knew where to find Top 250 movies. On Red Dwarf, some guy liked to sleep in Lister's bed at night. Lister found him and was like 'what the hell are you doing?!'"
"2359"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) In chemistry, Mr Reilly asked if I'd done some chapter and I said no because I'd been away. He gave me Eugene's book and said to take it home. Eugene came in and was looking everywhere for his book, but I didn't say anything because I wanted to take it home and read it and scan it."
"2360"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) I was playing Runescape and it played out live. I had to run south to this place, but I wasn't totally sure of what to do. People from school were there, including Calvin and Eugene. I started running, but realized I'd forgotten my stuff, so ran back to the bank. After, I started running there again. I saw Eugene, Autumn and a girl go a different way than the guide said, so I followed them. I went down a hill, but I didn't know where to go and Autumn and I went the other way. I later realized that the other way was a shortcut. I got to the place and this girl was there and I think she had some weird disease. I think she tried to have sex with Eugene."
"2361"	"(2008-09-23 (17)) I was on Chris Barrie's IMDb page. I downloaded a bunch of movies that he was in and I was on the message board later. He had an account and was answering questions. On his profile it said that he had ""4 sons, maybe"", because he had three and his wife was pregnant, and ""I have had sex"" and something else. It also said he had a son born in July 2003. I was telling Ezra about some movies. I watched some video of Chris Barrie and he was walking on a sidewalk with a kid in a pram. His shirt said ""I -- C... B...""."
"2362"	"(2008-09-24 (17)) I went for a drive with Ms Solomon to her house for some reason. It was a somewhat long drive and past a forest. Later, we were in Canada and they pointed to a white bit on the map (it was snow) and said it was hard to get around because it was big. I was riding on a trolley thing. Payton was too. He asked Ms Solomon if we could get our reports now. People were on the road. One group had a member lay down in front of us. They would also shove people's faces into others' bums. Evelyn was one of the ones who got forced into someone's bum. I was then with Calvin and when we got to the place we saw Evelyn inside and tried to convince her to leave her 'friends'. She refused and we said that they were mean and we weren't, we would ""make jokes"". We got her on the escalator and kept pushing her, so she didn't go make up to them. We went outside the building and they wanted her to ask this guy out. He was old and married. To distract him, I went across to this little shed and screamed and pretended to be looking for the screamer. He came and was annoyed. Eugene was then with me somewhere and I did a reality check and I was thinking it was weird to breathe. Then I was in 'my room'. There was a bunk bed and a penguin toy on the top bunk. It was black and white, like usual with a yellow/orange beak. I was looking at it as it was very vivid. I tried to make Eugene appear and was turning around. I had slept in my bra and it was hurting me, so I took it off and then had no clothes on. Dad came in and I woke up and was like 'go away, I'm naked'. He left."
"2363"	"(2008-09-24 (17)) I was at home. Tinkerbell was there. I was taking photos of her but they were all blurry and she looked a lot like Tigger. Ezra was there. Sometimes everyone could see her but sometimes only I could."
"2364"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was watching a movie with Linda Cardellini in it. She was the main character but she was different. Her brother, his friend (who looked like Bradley) and this other guy went on a holiday. A crocodile tooth got in her and she died, but they took her somewhere and this guy ate something with the crocodile and she was then alive, but different. When she took this stuff, her eyes went black and she went a little crazy. She made her brother and Bradley makeout and hug and then gave Bradley boobs and 'femininity'. This guy called Brian realized and said she was doing it because she liked him. He was in this room and she made the window disappear. I grabbed his hand thinking if I was touching him she wouldn't be able to erase him, but we got confused and I let go and he faded away. She killed some people and then brought him back. Her eyes went normal and she smiled. I looked the actor up and his name was James Me, but his website was ""nathanscott.com"". I was then watching an episode of One Tree Hill. Ezra came in and I paused it on James Lafferty. He wanted to check the show out and I said ""no, how about you get out of my room?"""
"2365"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was watching True Blood and Anna Paquin was talking about something. I was then reading about the book."
"2366"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was staying at this hotel place with Eugene. It was Tuesday. I went to this shop to check my downloads. There was a computer screen with a computerized woman on the screen who looked like Hilarie Burton. Then, Eugene, some others and I were outside in a carpark behind a tall shop. This helicopter had smoke coming out from it and crashed into the other side of the building. We ran to get away because the helicopter was still going crazy. Then I was in a building somewhere and I was filming with my phone. This guy there gave Orlando Bloom a room. This guy was in manhole in the floor and he went under to see this girl and then his chest and throat were being ripped apart by little hands. Then it was happening everywhere where there was a hole. These babies, or deformed monkeys, would tear you apart. I went to the shop where the computer was and there were lots of emergency vehicles on the road. I checked my downloads again. This hole nearby started opening. I ran outside and this guy in a beanie was there. We were trying to work out what to do."
"2367"	"(2008-09-25 (17)) I was in bed at home. I was shaking and my eyes were shut together and hurt. I was thinking I would try to have a lucid. I felt something touch my arm and I was thinking that it was Eugene, but nothing else happened."
"2368"	"(2008-09-26 (17)) I was in a hotel like building in the middle of the woods, where I lived. I had my computer there. This guy came and gave me a pack of stuff for my video camera, but I then heard a high frequency squealing, which signaled a bomb about to go off, so I ran. Nothing happened, so I went back to grab some stuff. He came back and we were trying to find out about the bomb. We were looking at photos on the computer and doing a scan on the people's eyes to see if they were a liar. If they were liars their eyes would go red. There was a photo of me and a clown, and the clown's eyes went red. It was actually Jensen Ackles. There was another photo of him and Jared Padalecki, which also scanned red. It meant that they were after us. I grabbed my dream books and we left. This other house blew up."
"2369"	"(2008-09-26 (17)) I was at school. I was waiting for Calvin to come so we could open the time capsule, but he never came. I went to form, which was in some weird place, and this girl gave me the notices. I was alone in the room. When we left, I saw Elijah lining up outside a classroom, which was next to the library [there is no building next to the library] and I joined him. We were doing our practical chemistry exam. We all went in and were given a sheet of paper with experiments on it. The first one involved a Bunsen burner. Autumn did it for me. I had a CD with my music on it. We put it on and Hot in the City was playing. I was reading a list of songs on it, which included Daydream Believer, We Didn't Start the Fire and Strangelove [they were all in my playlist at the time, except for Strangelove which I hadn't heard before] . The next experiment involved seeing how much leg fat you had, which would tell you how many volts your leg could handle by putting these resistor things on your leg. Jeremiah volunteered to do it and we stuffed up and he got electrocuted, but it was only ""640V"" and he was ok. Mr Reilly got Eugene, Bradley, Darius and Alejandro to do it. Darius wrote on the board ""I'm Haley, I'm city and country"". Johanna was then there and made a joke and no-one laughed."
"2370"	"(2008-09-27 (17)) I was outside a shop. Mom wanted me to read this book, but I'd already read it and she didn't believe me. I was then with a guy friend and we were crossing the road from Midvale shops. There was a school across the road which was an all boy's school and an all girl's school in one (although in the dream, this didn't seem odd). Anyone who didn't conform to the gender stereotype was shunned. I was wearing a jacket, so tucked my hair into it so no-one could tell that I was a girl."
"2371"	"(2008-09-27 (17)) I was in my room and there was a big black beetle on my bed, which climbed onto my wall and these little red ones were following it. I sprayed them. Nana and Poppa didn't like something. I found a dream about Dmitri that I didn't write into my book, from the 4/6/06. I was then at this place with some people. It was a school, but it was a bit dodgy. There was a blow-up like playground. I thought something was wrong and there was never food anywhere. There was a cold squishy thing in a hole. Dmitri was there. We were all wandering around and teachers kept asking us which class we had. There was this one dodgy lady teacher who kept turning up. It was lunch time, but we took a long time to sit down to eat. Samantha started eating and then the bell went. We laughed and complained. I asked this girl with chocolate if I could have some. We snuck out of the lunch room to explore. Then we were looking off a ledge and there was a girl, who was Kim (24) but was in another body and Nina Myers (also 24) was also in another body and they were fighting, but Nina had powers. Ezra and I were confused about it. Dmitri was at a table eating. I went and sat next to him, but he was writing or talking about me and told me to move. I didn't know this though and was annoyed. Later we were on an oval place. This guy we were with said my boobs were on a ""nice right angle"" and said they were like a triangle and this other guy agreed. I folded my arms over so they couldn't see. I think the other guy was Chad Michael Murray."
"2372"	"(2008-09-27 (17)) It was night and I was at home by myself. I was in the lounge room watching a movie/TV show. I turned on the lounge room and the dining room lights but they were really dim and I thought of reality checking but thought 'nah, it's not a dream'. I looked out the kitchen window and saw the back of a guy's head, who was sitting down outside. I jumped into the corner of the room, which also had a lot of mess and called Mom. I said there was a guy outside and I was freaking out. She said she'd be over when something was done and I could hear Darren talking in the background. From where I was sitting I could see cars coming down the street. The guy called out to me to turn the 'clicky' thing on (the TV). I called Mom again. I then pressed play and was watching the show. I kept calling Mom. I then thought I saw clothes poking out from the dining room wall, but I figured they were there before. Then they moved back. I heard someone in the kitchen and realized he was inside. I had trouble calling Mom so I text her. She said they were finally coming. It was now daylight. I jumped out of the spot and went to go outside. I was worried about the guy locking the door. He came out of the kitchen and was balding strangely. I argued with him and grabbed him to pull him outside. He tried to let go. I remembered something like this happened before and they disappeared before Mom got here. I took him outside and Mom got there. I yelled at her because it had been like 12 hours and she said she didn't think anyone was here and I said ""I told you there was a man outside!"". The guy gradually turned into a young (20-ish) girl and he explained that he was some creature which ate electricity. Some more of them came out of the neighbour's house. He said we were in an alternate universe where everyone knew about them. He said he tried to make up for scaring me by washing some clothes and making dinner. He also said that people would marry them and they had to turn into them. Then I was watching Red Dwarf, but then at the shops. Lister had disappeared in the last episode. Some guy was walking around with a hood on and it was Lister. He didn't remember anyone and I was thinking 'they've done that enough times'. There was some food that Rimmer had created there. It was gross and it had his face on it. He tried some and spat it out in disgust. They started chasing each other around and Rimmer and I found an entry to some room. There was a picture or something of 'Dave Lister' and something and someone coloured it in stupidly. He then chased us. Then it was Kenny vs Spenny. Spenny was trying to finish it. This girl he liked went to Savannah [someone went to Savannah in an episode of One Tree Hill I watched last night] but had died. He ran down a hall and then Kenny finished it. There was a room with the girl Spenny liked and some others and Kenny was using them as puppets. He said that it wasn't funny. She wasn't really dead. Kenny kissed her and she laughed and said ""ew"" but then continued kissing him."
"2373"	"(2008-09-28 (17)) I had been to this place to get a TER before and passed, but went back to enter another course. I went with Calvin who was sometimes Haley (One Tree Hill). It was in this huge building full of obstacle courses, all physical activity stuff. If you made one mistake you failed. I got to the last obstacle, which was this little playground and had to climb up a rope ladder and go down it. I saw Eugene and his mates and Calvin pointed it out. He was also like ""Oh, I might go to University too"". Eugene waved at us. I went back to get my shoes, when I finished. Then the people there congratulated us and said we passed. I had used a fake ID because I didn't know if you could do it twice. Peyton (One Tree Hill) didn't want something either. They let us off. Then it was episode of Red Dwarf. Rimmer wanted to be a ""matre d"" which was someone who goes out to kill themselves in a war."
"2374"	"(2008-09-29 (17)) I was in a lucid dream (in the dream) with some others. We were in the common room but it was unattached to the school and was different. I said it wasn't really a safe place because of all the glass. It was night. We tried to find weapons but none were around. A girl wished for a chainsaw and one appeared along with some baseball bats so I wished for a chainsaw too. Zombies suddenly came and were walking through the wall. Lots of them came and we were killing them. Jeremiah got bit, so I killed him but later he was ok and kept looking at me strangely. We left and I had wished for a car and me and a girl got in it, but we stopped and there were two zombies in it. I grabbed the girl's gun and tried to shoot. I hit one and missed the other. I couldn't reload. I jumped out of the car and couldn't work the gun out. Other people came and killed the zombies. Someone else wished for these jet ski things. I got on this one called a 'bananarama' and it was yellow and blue and little. Ezra was there. We were driving on a road and there was a bend, on a cliff. I fell off the side of the road, but managed to get back on before going off the cliff (it sort of flew out and got pulled back). I went around it a second time though and fell off and into the water. I wished for a path to the road, but ended up with a rope instead so I climbed up. The way I was climbing meant I was rubbing against the rope and ended up having an orgasm. There was some movie from the 1920's and Granma was in it. It was like Dead Like Me, but was Blazing Saddles and I thought it looked lame so I didn't want to see it. It was also in black and white. At some point we were at a house, which was home and we had no food. We were hiding there from the zombies. Dad had Oreos. I had a couple of biscuits and a piece of toast, which I ate."
"2375"	"(2008-09-29 (17)) I was at a shop waiting for Mom. I bought some muffin cake from the shop and it was pretty and tasted nice. I went to find Mom. I asked someone where she was and then she was behind me."
"2376"	"(2008-09-30 (17)) I was reading about some show and some of the episodes in season one had James Lafferty and Chad Michael Murray in them and also some other actor."
"2377"	"(2008-09-30 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill. Andy found out that he and Karen were related."
"2378"	"(2008-09-30 (17)) I was in my car, which was big and different and I was going to be living in it. I had an apartment at Westland University too. I was setting it up. It was like a game and you had to have a dispenser on the wall, either tampons or condoms. My hair felt gross so I put it under a tap. I called Mom to fix my car. It had stopped working and then it was a bike. I called Dad to bring some stuff. I brushed my hair."
"2379"	"(2008-10-01 (17)) There were zombies. I was with Eugene. I've forgotten most of it, but we were at a house and a few zombies came. There were two people there too. We kept moving between some spaces and zombies would come down the hall and Eugene would kill them. At the back of the house, was a cliff thing made of sand. There was sand down the wall of the house too, and when we threw sand on it, it would react with a spark. We climbed down the cliff, but Eugene and I had to go back. He got to the top first and he grabbed my hand and pulled me up. There were zombies down below and we were throwing sand onto the sand to get them. Some got to this guy (one of the people in the house) and he died. We heard motorbikes and Eugene told me to move stuff around to look messy (to make it look like we had taken over the house). Then Nathan and Haley (both One Tree Hill) were at a school and people were bothering them. Peyton was wearing a mask which was spotty and gross. There was a theatre. A long time later we had a baby. Babies were required to dance in a cot, but we hid her. There was a map of the school. We were trying to work out who was going to 'work' and who was going to stay home with the baby. Then it was Andy and someone's baby. There was a gate, and the baby was behind it. They were trying to trick each other into who was going to stay with the baby. I was watching some bloopers from shows. One was a lady who said ""intelligents"". Another had two guys sitting on chairs and in the middle of a joke they both fell off at the same time and died. Some science fiction show had 8 episodes that crossed over with Red Dwarf. Lister and Rimmer were the only two I recognized. I was trying to talk like Craig Charles by saying ""Dave Lister"" and emphasizing the ""er""."
"2380"	"(2008-10-02 (17)) In One Tree Hill, Dan did something bad to Haley and Nathan. Months later, he was in a car in the carpark of the dealership. There was a Quikeze in the back of the seat and some proof of what he did. Cops came for him. Then Haley (or someone) was racing him. He got surrounded by cops and stopped."
"2381"	"(2008-10-02 (17)) I was at 'school' opening the time capsule. Tiana and Ramona were there, and they were sometimes Calvin and Samantha. Dmitri was still at school. There was a new time capsule in a box. It had Eugene written on it and I was worried someone was going to see it before we opened it. Mr Gutenberg said I had to do a test tomorrow. Jeremiah was there. Some lady's kids were there."
"2382"	"(2008-10-02 (17)) I was somewhere with Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush. Sophia was the daughter of a guy Mom was friends with. Someone said there was a photo of her on the fridge with two girls and Chad. We were on a rooftop and we were doing some in-joke thing, where he would put his arm around her and then he'd do the same thing to me and we laughed."
"2383"	"(2008-10-03 (17)) I went out with Mom and we were walking. We saw Dad and Ezra come out of a building and walk down the steps. We went to this oval and I had to play some game. We had to control these bugs that ate certain things and also had to ride some and go through these circles around the place. The goals were listed like in Miss Management. We had been to the oval place for an excursion before."
"2384"	"(2008-10-03 (17)) I was in an underground carpark and lying in a bay with Eugene and we were making out. We got up and went to another bay. Later, Deb (One Tree Hill) came and had sex with me. I didn't know why I let her."
"2385"	"(2008-10-04 (17)) On One Tree Hill, Haley walked into a room at school. There were three guys around. She was pretty far along in her pregnancy and had a photo of her and Nathan on their wedding day. This guy said she should be ashamed of her last name. Lucas came and attacked the guys. This other guy came and took down all of the guys. They took down a ladder. They were then in a grassed area with benches and people around. Lucas had blood around his mouth. Some other time, Haley and Nathan were talking to Dan. She blurted out that she had feelings for him. It was awkward and he left. She told Nathan that it was true. Later, I was Haley, and I went into a room which was Dan's. He said ""West bank"" and I said ""that's helpful"" and then said ""city bank"" and he said ""good one"" and we laughed. He said something about Deb. I had Mom's phone and it had nice buttons."
"2386"	"(2008-10-04 (17)) Someone was in a bakery or something. Shia LaBeouf was there and someone said he was ""a second Shia"". Someone tried or did kill someone. Someone was chasing me."
"2387"	"(2008-10-05 (17)) A ghost was either getting visited by or visiting girls to kill their boyfriends if they were cheating or betraying them in some way. This woman and her boyfriend were in a building and the ghost came for him and she said ""you're not cheating on me"" but he was and he was killed. Mittens was in an underground area and someone, possibly me, said ""you know I'm shortsighted"". On One Tree Hill, all the main characters were gone. Anna was back and I was annoyed about it. There was a movie with a wave in a building and it had good effects. I showed Mom. I was trying to get Ezra to say ""kill me"" on the phone so it would allow the ghost (who was a girl) to be able to kill anyone. The ghost was in a kitchen and was controlling ghosts or maybe people. There was a knife in the toaster and it got hot. This lady didn't want to kill this girl, so I killed her."
"2388"	"(2008-10-05 (17)) I was at school and it was over. A mural [I can't read it properly so it might not be] had poo on it. I was with Calvin, and we were near Eugene. Calvin was sometimes Ezra. I stuffed up this experiment. There was green stuff. I watched it wash down the corridor. I told this teacher a joke about condoms."
"2389"	"(2008-10-06 (17)) I was doing a quest on Runescape. It was a 'choose your own ending'. Ezra, Roland and another friend of his were there. First I was by myself and there were zombies. I had to right click and press zombify and then quickly kill them and save something. I got bit. I was then in a shop/museum and I had to get something. Also this fat kid stole some yoghurt. I got in the car. There was another place and all of us were together. I had finished the quest and gotten the reward which was three lots of 70,000gp. There was a room with a king and a person we had to release. I walked past and we were looking for the key to take a car. Someone saw us and we ran. We went into the water and they came after us with a canoe. We took a canoe. We had to pick two random colours and/or numbers. I climbed up a ladder. Darren said something to us. We were then little and in a fridge in a kitchen. We had to make food for this old lady. There was a still picture of a cat. Ezra got this same ending."
"2390"	"(2008-10-06 (17)) I was with the school at some hotel place. I got room 264 and I was by myself. There were three other lots of beds in the room (they were in lots of two, so there were eight beds). Later some Asian guy had to join me. Mom came and was helping me set up. These other people came in and joined their friends (other people now were staying in the room). The balcony was next to my bed and we looked out the window and saw this ugly couple in a tree, kissing. They started taking their clothes off and Mom yelled to them and they said ""oh, do you have a child in there?"" and so they only took their pants off. There was a magazine on the bed with Sophia Bush on the cover. I went downstairs to this place with someone. We saw some dogs outside and then ran into this stairwell. I closed the door as they got there. We ran and hid in this big office like room. The door was clear. We looked to see if they were coming. They weren't so I ran out to the elevator. A dog came and I kept pressing the button so the elevator would close but people kept coming in. Eventually the dog left, but I kept missing my floor because of the close button. It was there when I got to my floor but someone hit it on the head. I went to my room and the Asian guy was actually a dog."
"2391"	"(2008-10-08 (17)) It was a long time after there had been a zombie outbreak. I was with James Lafferty, who was my boyfriend. I was at some place with people from school. I had to go under water to get this thing with a sticky thing and pick something up, it was a game. There were kittens and puppies and I had them in separate sections. This girl had been training kittens and bunnies to turn them against us. We ran away. We were in a field and this guy came and helped us. We went to this place to do a trade. The guy came on a plane. There was an auction and we bought him for $500,000. There was a submarine and a guy with axes. He cut a guy's arm off and we ran. We went into a building and I could see waves out the window. They were really big and people were swimming. There was an elevator which was voice activated. I said I didn't trust it because some numbers were dodgy. There was a room with computer chips and we were then small (the chips were bigger than us). A guy who was normal size was fixing a computer. We got out and I had my arm around James. We went to a shop."
"2392"	"(2008-10-08 (17)) I think this dream carried on from the last one (there had been zombies). There was a picture, except it was a video of the Red Dwarf cast and I was painting over it with white, leaving only Chris Barrie and Norman Lovett's face. We were outside a house. A car was coming. People would look for people who were under 18 as they didn't like them out after a certain time. I was 18. We all ran back inside, but they saw us and called us out. Three of the people I was with were under 18, but they thought that we were younger and so took us. I had to go in the car with the leader. I asked why I had to go and he said he was going to be my boyfriend and I said ""I already have one, I'm married"". He dropped me off at home with food and said he would be back. The phone didn't work. The lights in my room weren't working either. The house was clean and we had a computer in the house that kept it clean. I ended up in a building trying to send a video message to James Lafferty, who was my boyfriend again, to help me. The guy who owned the building though was dodgy and he called me Ackles and I thought 'I'm not going out with Jensen Ackles' and because of this I realized he was bad. He said ""good try"". I ran from there and got outside. Then it was sometimes a TV show. There was an accident outside. A parcel was let out. I found an underground place looking for James. There was a game and I had to climb up a ladder and couldn't fall in the lava underneath and then I had to go through the door. I eventually did it and had to go over the same tiles as the guy in front of me. I didn't, but I passed anyway. Then a friend of mine owned some place and gave me a 'bed' which was actually a lounge and had a cow print like pattern, which reminded me of my bed at Mom's. The guy who had captured me before had a room across from my lounge though. There was a big area full of chairs (mine was there too) and there a couple of actual rooms on the side but they were expensive and hard to get. I went to see someone I knew and I said ""I'm 18"". Then something was happening and supposedly everyone was going to be there so I was going to go to find James."
"2393"	"(2008-10-09 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill. Carrie and someone in the Scott family or close to the family had become friends with her and they brought her to Nathan and Haley's house. She said she was getting help now and these other people at the house tried to get rid of her before Haley saw her there. Nathan had an apron on and was covered in chocolate as he was making a cake or something. They tried to stop her going in the kitchen, but Haley saw her and got angry demanding that she leave. Then a few kids were there and they were all boys. I couldn't remember who was who. Keith was there too. I said he wouldn't be able to raise his kid. Haley and Nathan had had a new son and it was just born and it had a ring on, which looked huge and like it was going to fall off and I was like ""Ew, why does a newborn have a ring on?""."
"2394"	"(2008-10-09 (17)) I was at school. This lady decided to take us for a drive while dropping Elijah off at his house. Bradley and Theodore were also in the car. After she dropped Elijah off, she asked if I wanted to go home so I told her to go behind North Midvale and she thought it was far away. Bradley went to sleep with his head on my arm, I tried to move it but decided to leave him, so I tried to take a photo but I couldn't position my phone properly. She went to drop Theodore off and made me, Bradley and some people go in. She made this girl called Alice, who was then me, pretend to be a scientist and Bradley went off to be an assistant. There was a balloon outside this classroom. The building was round and so just outside the classroom was a round outside area where the balloon was. These people were supposed to tell me what colour it went by doing certain things to this thing inside. It went green by leaving it and smelled bad. It went yellow/gold with these things in little cardboard boxes. This girl burnt the next one which screwed it up and we had to start again. I then left, but got lost. I found this colourful little playground and I took a photo of it. I then tried to find my way out. Eventually I ended up back at the playground and noticed a gigantic one next to it. Jamison had his head through a hole in the playground. I thought we had been there before. It had a cool waterslide. We all kept going on it and Dad and Ezra were there too. Then I was there with the school. There were photos of us. Bradley was acting weird and supposedly liked me. I couldn't find my shoes. I had taken them off at one point. I asked a lady if she had seen them. Then I had no shirt on. This person had my Beatles shirt so I put it on while I sat on some stairs. I went to the place again at a later time and got a locker. At the end of my trip there I was packing stuff and putting things in certain boxes. I was going out with someone and packing for them too -- shampoo, hair dye etc. Mom was there and was helping me pack."
"2395"	"(2008-10-11 (17)) I was looking out a window at the moon. It looked huge because of a light from a building that was on. You could see all the detail. I went to take a photo but they turned off the light. Later, the light was back on but they took it away again and then it rained. Mom and Darren were there too."
"2396"	"(2008-10-11 (17)) I was with Mom. She had been friends with The Spice Girls. I asked her how they became friends. Then we were in a car and Feels Like I'm in Love was playing. I was singing along to it. Ezra was in the back. The guys from Entourage were in there too. Someone told Vince I had liked him when I was younger and he was teasing and flirting with me. Eric said ""there's a problem, you, Vince"" and I said ""I was going to say that"". He wanted to go to this Chinese restaurant. Turtle did something for me and I said ""Thanks Turtle"". This girl hurt her leg and she was a cheerleader. Some people were undercover somewhere."
"2397"	"(2008-10-11 (17)) Samantha, Calvin and I had these capes and when we put them on we turned small. Calvin grabbed onto the back of a car and we grabbed on and were flying around as it drove. We ended up getting off at this busy street because we were getting too far away and I said we should get back. We were in a grassy patch in the middle. There were two lanes on either side of it. At the top of the road going back towards home there were then stairs leading up to a gate. There was a black prisoner there and he tried to stop us. Then I was at a house with Dad, Ezra, Nana and Poppa. Nana put a raw sausage on a plate and said it was dog. I said I wasn't going to eat dog and said ""dogs are for pets and chickens are mostly for eating... unless you're Asian"". Nana said we had eaten it before without knowing. I left. I went with Mom and Uncle Vic was at Granma's and I had read this on Wikipedia about how it happened (it hadn't happened yet). We stopped at a deli."
"2398"	"(2008-10-12 (17)) We were going to a cinema. Ezra had been driving really fast and went through a wire fence and I said ""this isn't GTA"". We parked in this dodgy place in the bush. There was a fence around that and we found holes in the electric fence and got to the cinema. We had brought water with us but it was half empty. It was almost time for the movie to start. I went to buy snacks but Dad went somewhere and I said he has the money so I went to him and asked. He gave me a $20 note (but later it was a $90 note) and wanted a Yorkshire pudding and instructions of heating it. I ordered myself a water bottle. I had to hold bottles for Dad and Ezra too and they didn't carry much. Some lady told us to put our right index finger on our forehead sideways to see who was stupid. It was a Red Dwarf joke and she said that people who couldn't do it would get holowhipped. Dad and Ezra were then wearing red and green costumes, respectively, from The Dark Knight and I said that it was lame that people were dressing up. I saw a bunch of people going into a cinema so I followed them. It was number 26, which happened to be playing the same movie we were seeing. It was really fancy. The lights went dim and off as we went in. Dad sat next to some person dressed as a furry animal. It was packed and only a few lone chairs were spare. Ezra and I sat a few seats behind him. I gave Ezra his Coke. My water was in a red sports drink bottle and I took a drink but it was a disgusting juice and I almost vomited. I couldn't find water anywhere. I took Dad's drink and took a drink but it was something gross as well. On the screen, a short film of The Importance of Being Earnest was playing. I was then driving down the hill on our street. I had had a few drinks and ended up crashing the car. I was with Mom. I was then at home. I was on the phone to a cop and I was upset. The guy tried to calm me. They then came over. They made me take a breathalyzer and I had to take big breaths. It said I'd only had one drink but this was due to time wearing it off. They tested this red jacket that was in the car and it said I'd had four drinks, but I'd actually had two. I thought you only got in trouble if it was over the limit (I wasn't). Later I was in bed at Mom's, which was different, with some guy and we were making out and I was thinking he was the cop from before but he looked different. There were some bunnies at the front door and I was putting them in a cage."
"2399"	"(2008-10-13 (17)) This guy I knew and I started going out. Then it was a movie, but sometimes not. He left his house and Penny (Big Bang Theory) moved into a new house and later left. She then got a castle and had some thing at the very bottom. It rained and flooded and I had written my dream from the night on a shirt so I grabbed it. There was only one room with walls that wasn't part of the castle. The dream rubbed off. There were outtakes and rabbits were running away from Jared Padalecki."
"2400"	"(2008-10-13 (17)) I was at school. It was a huge building and it been painted white with bits of black."
"2401"	"(2008-10-14 (17)) I was watching Entourage. Ari and his wife had a specialty shop each in a shopping centre. Hers was a general store. There was a new shop opening and Ari was giving his shop a facelift. He and his wife were competitors and they were getting people to run between them. He went over and realized and sobbed to someone saying ""I've really made a mess haven't I?"" and then they were trying to work it out. Zachary Levi had married this ugly woman and had twins."
"2402"	"(2008-10-15 (17)) I had this girl friend and I liked her brother and thought he liked me. We were in this place which had chairs going down in steps, and a stage at the bottom. She was on a quiz show and had just won the latest episode. Dad asked me if it would be ok if she won again and I was like 'yeah, why wouldn't it be?'. We grabbed some stuff and left. We were in this carpark with the school at this place. I thought we were doing some Runescape thing. I wrote something on my foot. Elijah, Ezra and others came through this small space near some stairs. I started miming Tongue Tied and doing the motions. This girl saw me and was wondering what I was doing. I walked around the stairs. We had to these activities and take photos of us doing them. There was a trampoline and Silas was on it. There was a shelf with stuff on it just next to it. I got the camera off it. There was a photo of Silas, Samantha and someone. There were photos of me and Ezra when we were younger too."
"2403"	"(2008-10-16 (17)) I went for a drive with Mom and we went to some underground carpark, then to someone's house. They had these weird things for the pool. They were long, grassy, green things that were used as 'tubes'. We went back to the car and there was an alcohol/drug tester bus. Mom called out to me that she was ready to go and we left and didn't get stopped (by calling out she was pretending she had been tested). I had an email from Roland and it was signed ""love""."
"2404"	"(2008-10-16 (17)) This guy could talk to some fish thing through mind reading. Only one person could do it and it was whoever had the highest 'level'. If someone went into the area and had a lower ability they would die. This teenager guy called Duncan, who was hot, went in but the guy pushed him out and I went in. I was ok though. It turned out that the guy, Duncan and I had exactly the same level."
"2405"	"(2008-10-16 (17)) Some family had organized for their daughter to marry Dad, but heard something about him before hand and said no. I went there to talk to the girl (now it was me that was supposed to marry her I think) and the mother yelled at me because she thought I was going to get up and go the father who had just pulled up. The daughter yelled at her and said she wanted to go with me. We all sat down to talk. They complained because I didn't go to church anymore and I was going to say 'church and God suck"" but I said I didn't have to go to church to ""prove my love for God"". I felt like an idiot saying that and having them think I was Christian, but it was the easiest thing to do. This older lady told me I should wear shorter shorts and do some cheer thing and I said ""or not""."
"2406"	"(2008-10-17 (17)) I was at school. I don't know what I did for most of the day but at Lunch 2 I did something that prevented me from eating my lunch. Then I remembered I had to do an exam at noon so I quickly started eating my sandwich. Ms Pascal said hello and asked if I was ""mighty awesome"" and this girl giggled and said to a friend, ""Did you hear that? Mighty Awesome!"" and they said it was that guy from Chuck (Captain Awesome). I got to the front office, which was different and threw the crust into the bin, but it hit someone's burger on the table and I was thinking they weren't going to like that. I went into the room to do my exam and Ms Solomon and Ms Madsen gave me the questions. Autumn was doing Applicable Maths and the exam too. The first question was ""gobble"". I got my calculator, ruler and notes out of my bag. The people doing the year book had a secret room with a picture of a girl who was killed by a drugged up guy and was the same guy who killed a guy called Jimmy Edwards [name of character in One Tree Hill, but unrelated] . I was looking at the pictures and there were profile photos of Chris Barrie, Milo Ventimiglia and Martin Sheen. There was a joke about Martin Sheen and him winning lots of rewards. Some guy's restaurant/shop had a back room with books in it. A cop was looking around the shop but ignoring the room. I said ""shouldn't you be checking in there?"". The guy got worried. There was a problem with the electrical wires and I was crawling on the floor and hit one that was uncovered with my finger and it burnt and left a mark. Dad told me to rub it on the floor and it hurt so he was showing me how hard to press."
"2407"	"(2008-10-18 (17)) I was watching Ugly Betty. Daniel and Betty were going out. They were kissing. He put on a black jacket and someone got this UV light and it had stains on it. He had black stuff around his eyes [episode I watched last night, Alexis did] . He had a baby, but it wasn't his [in the same episode, it was discovered Daniel Jr. wasn't his] ."
"2408"	"(2008-10-18 (17)) I was at Mom's, but it was different. I was on the balcony and so was Spaceman. There were no rails on it. He was sniffing something. I picked it up and was going to throw it over the balcony, but threw it inside instead and he ran after it. I said I was glad I didn't throw it over."
"2409"	"(2008-10-19 (17)) I was watching some show. Kyle MacLachlan was in it as a detective guy. He discovered the murders weren't by people so he left. There was an ugly girl character and it was her 17th birthday. Her parents made her stay in her room. She was lying in bed and turned up her music. It was night. She asked for someone to join her. There was a tree at the window. The roots came in and said ""can I come in?"" and then it shoved its roots through her and she ended up at the roof and she died. Later I was in a field with some guy. There were a few houses and he thought this one we were near housed the bad guys. I thought it was the other one and there was something about Henry DeTamble (The Time Traveler's Wife book) living there or something. We went there. Then this girl and I snuck in a hole behind a bar in the house. The people were in the same room and were saying that he shouldn't have taken notes of some scores from 1969. There was a guy and a girl. One of us made a noise and they heard us. The girl grabbed a bottle as a weapon, but when she saw us she just laughed. We came out. I don't know what happened then, but they gave us a drink of water. I was suspicious of the drink so didn't drink it, but the girl I was with did. I asked her if she was sleepy, but she fell back and I grabbed her but then she was Tigger. I was then trying to escape with Tigger. There were two different ways to run. One took longer to get to exit and had guards, but I chose that one. As I ran past, the 'camera' turned to them and one said ""why do they always choose this way?"". I got to the exit and put Tigger down because she was annoyed and she walked back the other way, so I went back to get her. I took a car and started driving. I was going fast and couldn't control it. I decided to pull over and this other car was pulled over already so I had to drive a little further. There were three kids and one was called Haley and she was homeless and asked if she could go with me and I said yeah. The streets were surrounded by trees. There was a sign in German or something. Then I was at home and we were getting ready to go to Mom's. This guy was there and we freaked because he was the bad guy and he said we had to stay with him."
"2410"	"(2008-10-20 (17)) There was a program to do morphs between two celebrities. There was another thing I found. There two photos of this girl and one was darker and the other was lighter. The lighter one was crisper looking and she had shiny lips. I did a morph of Mom and Dad. I put random settings so it had green eyes and purple lips."
"2411"	"(2008-10-21 (17)) I was checking my emails and I had heaps. I had an email from a social networking site, saying ""Eugene Pritchard has added you as a friend"". I got excited and checked his profile. He had photos up but they were bad quality. One of them he was holding a blue toothbrush in a strange pose and I was thinking 'who takes pictures like that' and I noticed that the toothbrush was the same as Dad's. I noticed he had these necklaces on and I was thinking 'damn, I thought you were perfect!'. I didn't know if I wanted to see more, but I did anyway. There were photos with him wearing earrings too and I was deeply upset and his turns on were listed as ""braininess, piercings, tattoos"" etc. I was annoyed about this."
"2412"	"(2008-10-21 (17)) It was Friday and we got up ready for school. The day before were at Mom's. I answered the door saying ""I like chickens"". This serious Spanish-like guy was there to get money off Mom because Dad had borrowed a stolen car because he had been in an accident in his car. Some time later my car was in the garage but it was there sideways underneath the roller door. Ezra was in the passenger seat and made it go forward and then back and I told him not to. I wondered how it got there. Dad closed the door but then it was inside the garage normally. I sat in the front and Ezra was in the back. It was then a convertible and the top was down, but part of it was sticking up. I was wondering why we weren't taking the work van, but remembered it was Monday. It drove really smoothly. I asked Dad to leave the cars out of the way so I could go for a drive later. Some dude took the stolen car as we left. We got to school but it was 7.49am, which was late and Dad drove through this park and went in this really dodgy way to get there, but it was totally different. I then remembered I wasn't going today and Dad said he'd drop me off at Mom's afterwards because he had stuff to do. I asked why he didn't tell me I wasn't going earlier. As we drove back through the school I saw people walking in. I saw Alejandro, Bradley, Darius and Evelyn. I looked for Eugene but remembered he came from a different way. Instead of going to Mom's, we ended up in this dodgy, grey city. There were a lot of high roads and tall grey buildings and was really creepy. I asked where we were. There was no good music on, so I checked the old music stations and Maybellene was playing. I sang along to ""oh Maybellene"" and then said ""I can't believe I didn't know Chuck Berry was black"" and Dad replied ""I don't see what's so great about blacks"". I sang along again to ""Maybellene, why can't you be true, oh Maybellene"". The Angels Listened In also played along with this other really catchy song. We went to a car yard place to get dads car. He gave the lady at the entrance booth a receipt."
"2413"	"(2008-10-21 (17)) I went for a drive with Mom pretty far away. We went to this shop and Mom bought some stuff and asked if I wanted to get an ice-cream from the shop. I said I wanted cookies and cream. We were at the top of the shop, and there was a big slope going down to the bottom, so I slid down that. It was also really cool in the shop. There was an ice-cream shop at the bottom as well. Mom didn't get one from the shop, so we were looking in there. There was other random stuff in there and pies. I asked Mom if the one I wanted was in date and she poured pepper and other spices into it, because she thought there was a lid on top of it, and this would tell you if it was ok. She had ruined it so I told her we should go. Outside the shop, I had a bicycle. I was getting my licence. We were riding it and people were in my way and I kept almost crashing. This lady was stroking her hair in front of me and wouldn't move. This other guy smiled at me and also wouldn't move. The L-plate came off. We finally managed to get out of the carpark. Mom had to go back to get the car. This British guy was hanging around. It was 3.24pm and once we started driving we realized we had forgotten to get Ezra and we were supposed to pick him up at 11am."
"2414"	"(2008-10-22 (17)) I was at school. I had planned to sign out. I went to the office at the time I wanted to leave. Calvin was there to sign out too. Ms Atkinson was there and she was going to eat lunch and told me to fill out the slip. I asked the other office ladies if they would sign it and they said ""you're just going to put it in your pocket"" (accusing me of being a liar) and I said ""What am I going to do, eat it?"" and they laughed. I went. I started walking and then saw Ezra and Emery. Mom's car was behind them but I didn't see it behind Ezra. Then we were at a shop or something with Granma and Mom and they were in a relationship I think."
"2415"	"(2008-10-23 (17)) Mom took me home. There was a plane in the sky so I jokingly said that it was going to crash. It then went down and there was a loud noise and then lots of smoke. We freaked out and then drove closer to see it better."
"2416"	"(2008-10-23 (17)) I was at school handing in my English stuff and I was told I actually needed to hand in one more."
"2417"	"(2008-10-23 (17)) I was playing Runescape. I was getting attacked and lost of heaps of health and died but I only had gay items on me."
"2418"	"(2008-10-24 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different, and in my room. I decided to put pictures of hot guys on my wall. I had these pictures in my diary and they were of Michael Palin and James Spader but also one of Terry Jones. The wall I was going to put them on was in my cupboard. I left to do something and when I came back Mom was in there looking around. I was then taking them down and they were blu-tacked there."
"2419"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was reading a book which was online. People were voting for the comedian who had the funniest quotes. Rik Mayall was number one at the moment. Chris Barrie and Will Arnett were on the list as well. Will's joke was ""the only way to inhibit a dwarf is with a club"" which was really funny. Chris' picture was disco like and he was wearing glasses."
"2420"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was walking with Ezra near home. We saw police and a car and thought it was Santiago's but it was his brother's. It was a yellow car. I had to walk past to get 'home'. Then I was a guy who knew the guy who owned the car. I was an inspector and this cop guy told me I couldn't get inside, call anyone or travel."
"2421"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was at home. This girl always used the same movie and notes for essays and things. There was a gay movie with gay sex in it. There was a nice desk in the movie. Two more people had taken my quiz and I had a comment. They said ""bald isn't hot"". Ezra was around. We had this meat thing for dinner and then another meat thing, rice and salad like stuff and a nice chocolate thing for dessert. Ezra was tired."
"2422"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was at this guy's house. His mother didn't like me. She thought I ""killed Duran Duran"". She called the cops on me. She asked if I was drunk that night and I said I didn't know because I had had drinks one of those nights. She thought I broke a guitar. We were upstairs and we both turned and I hit her and she fell down the stairs and died, but had a smile on her face, because she 'knew' I'd get in huge trouble for it. Out the back were some broken cupboards."
"2423"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was going through the chemistry exam, checking my mark. I saw I hadn't answered a multiple choice question so I circled it with the correct answer. It was question 23 and the answer was 'C'."
"2424"	"(2008-10-25 (17)) I was at home. In the pool, I had a fake crocodile lying on a real one. I looked out through the games room door and saw the real one was upside down and I thought it was dead. It then flipped around and I realized it was alive. There were kittens out the back. One was a cute little brown and white one. The crocodile went to eat it. I banged on the door and it ran away. I went outside and took the kitten inside. I showed Dad. We looked out the games room window and saw there were eight more feeding off their ma. One was purple-y with stripes and a black one with bits of white. I needed to save them. Tigger was outside too. I called the place I got the crocodile from and they said they would get it soon and I said I needed to get rid of it now. It started slamming into the door to get inside. It eventually did and I punched it. It stopped moving and Dad said it might not be dead and I ripped its head off and said that they didn't have to worry about it now."
"2425"	"(2008-10-27 (17)) I went to a newsagency. Dad was waiting outside in the car. It was night. I had $10. I got the Dolly Diary and some other stuff. The guy behind the counter reminded me of Rosso (Freaks and Geeks). It came to $11.10 so I said I had to get some more money. I asked Dad and he threw it on the ground and there was lots of money on the ground so I was grabbing some."
"2426"	"(2008-10-27 (17)) I was at an Indian wedding place. Me and a male friend decided to play a joke and so as the couple came out, we went through the shop pretending we were getting married. Later I was at school, which was different, and all these characters from Freaks and Geeks came. Some of them weren't real ones. They were people I'd gone to school with. I said ""now Linda Cardellini will turn up"" and she did. It had been ten years since we all saw each other. Linda had gone out with James Franco's character and was still in love him. She was calling him Brendan though. I was looking for Jason Segel. I went to find James. He was sitting on a bench in the middle of the oval (which was hilly) with a friend called Mark. I said ""Bobby"" and then Mark, who was really annoying, and I had a short argument, then he left. James was Bobby from Twin Peaks. I asked him to talk to Linda and he agreed."
"2427"	"(2008-10-27 (17)) I was at school. I thought it was home time and went to walk out, but then Lorelei sat down on the path outside the front of the office and started eating. It was only 11am. I wondered why we were here since we had finished and so I called Mom to get me. She was hesitant but I was like ""We graduated!"" so she came. I was waiting with Lorelei. She gave me this little white thing as a graduation present. As I walked to Mom's car, I looked back and saw Darius, Eugene and lots of other people there. When I got in the car I commented on this to Mom."
"2428"	"(2008-10-28 (17)) It was this week but it was the last week of school. I was annoyed because they had said last week was the last week. We didn't do any work and just mucked around and it was really boring. On Wednesday Dad went to get breakfast from the shop. Mom picked me and Ezra up and we went back to her house. I decided I was going to go back to bed and go into school at 4pm for graduation practice. There were three water bottles on the kitchen sink."
"2429"	"(2008-10-29 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and we were on our way to her place, but had only just left home. She stopped on the side of the road. This car pulled up next to us, a car length away with two people in the car. Then, another car pulled up in the middle of us, and this one had Lafayette (True Blood) in it. I said ""Two of em!"". They did their thing and then I was in the back seat. Mom put this envelope on the back floor on my side. I looked at it. She had made it up. It said Sasha Wyatt with a face on it. It was to me from Westland University and was green. It had money in it and she gave it to me because it was a lot of money and she couldn't do anything with it. I was then at her house and I was complaining that I wasn't going to get into university because I was going to get a low TER. She said that it was my fault and I said I know, but that I could've done well in the exams but it wasn't going to boost me enough. She asked why I put veterinary science first and I said that it was still what I wanted to do most though I knew I wasn't getting in. Then I was Dad and Ezra in the car. We saw Samantha walking on Princess Rd at the park, so Dad asked if she wanted a lift. She got in the back, behind the passenger. The time capsule was there so I moved it. I had written who I had liked on a small piece of paper and it was on the top and said ""Kohler"" and I was worried she was going to say something. She lived at an apartment block and I walked her up. I kept leaving my bag and running back for it. Her father didn't like people coming into the area so we left."
"2430"	"(2008-10-29 (17)) I was sitting outside the front of a house. It was empty, and it was surrounded by a fence, except for the side with the driveway, which was on the left side of the house (if you were looking at it). I had my bag and it was fully of sandwiches which were moldy. I was taking them out and I had two good sandwiches in there but they weren't wrapped so I decided not to eat them. I had a huge pile of moldy sandwiches next to me. Teacher-M-08 walked past the house (the side with no fence) and I quickly got up and tried to leave. He had this ability to 'glamour' which meant he could control you. It was a form of population control. We were in a desert like area, but there was a grassy oval up a hill just across the road from the house. The area was surrounded by a track and this train cart thing would go all the way around it. Some times an 'alarm' was sounded and everyone would then try to get on. If you got on it would suddenly go really fast at the end, but if you made it you were safe and could glamour. People would also try to get on if others were trying to glamour them. I started walking towards the oval. I was standing next to two teenagers. Teacher-M-08 was watching me and was told to glamour one of us. We started running to the track. There was a hill with step like things that you had to run up, to get to the track and it seemed like it was pushing you back, and it was really difficult. I got onto it but it went too fast and I fell off. Then it was a movie or something. This boy got hurt on it and was at some authority's house while he was healing. Teacher-M-08 was outside but the windows were tinted and you couldn't glamour through the tint. Teacher-M-08 told him he was ""forever immortal"". There was a track inside the house. The boy asked this lady what happened at the end and she said ""you end up in hospital"". It was rigged at the end, so no-one ever got to it. The kid was determined to get to the end though and he did. Somehow he was alright and was now able to make people into these faded images and the glamourers were confused and couldn't glamour them. Now, everyone could do what they wanted. These two girls were hugging. One stopped and said she liked men and only went to ""her kind"" when she was desperate. The boy was now older and was sitting back and he could do whatever he wanted."
"2431"	"(2008-10-30 (17)) I was at school, which was different, and it was graduation night. It was an undercover area. Ms Braun started singing and dancing to Tongue Tied, so I joined in doing the movements too. I had to sign a sheet to allow it to be released afterwards (it was being recorded). Eugene was there and looked really upset/angry. I was sitting on a lounge near him and wanted to take photos but he kept moving. Darius was on a chair. Ezra grabbed Darius's shoe and threw it and he just sat there. I got it and threw it back over. Mom and Darren got there and I wasn't in the right clothes so told Mom we had to go now and I ran really fast through this grassed area. I saw Elijah. Fly was playing ""I want to get away, I want to fly away"" and I thought it was fitting. I still hadn't got pants or shoes. It was 6.43pm and it started at 7pm and I wasn't ready. There were chairs on the stage and I helped to arrange them. Evelyn asked me about the funny stuff I'd written down in class and if it was in my diary and I said no. I was worried her parents would see her talking to me. Mom had called some teacher guy about how I was going in Biology and I wasn't doing well. I said it was because one of the assignments was for me to watch Red Dwarf and I loved it. Mom said it was average and I said it was hilarious. Then at school there was a Red Dwarf section. There was a picture of Rimmer with a big mouth and a story about Lister. Boys and girls had to all go into the same toilet. I was waiting outside but had to go in and some people were naked and I was grossed out. I had to go to the toilet but the cubicles were all open ones so I didn't go. We were in the carpark. Mom asked if I knew the guy I like's car and I said ""Yeah, and he's here with his mother, father (Abraham) and brother (Rodney)"" and Mom asked ""sister?"" and I said he didn't have one. I saw Eugene's car on the other side of the carpark."
"2432"	"(2008-10-30 (17)) This guy had a picture of himself in a red room. He was in a hotel. He didn't remember anything that happened before the photo, which was recent. He went to a car yard and it asked how many years he'd been playing 'Pokey' and he said eight years because he could get a free car (for lease). It was a scabby car though. The guy worked there was gay and they became friends. He had an argument with his boss and the guy let him stay with him. He was getting changed and the gay guy had no shirt on and the straight guy had no clothes, so put on a pink shirt of the gay guy's. This girl (who was a love interest) came up and saw them and thought there was something going on (jokingly) and walked out. She thought it was funny. He was driving with her and was looking somewhere and drove off the bridge. He was trying to get her out of the car and he ended up dying and she was ok."
"2433"	"(2008-10-30 (17)) I hadn't eaten my dinner at Mom's, so I was trying to get her to get me something to eat [this happened last night too] ."
"2434"	"(2008-10-31 (17)) I was at school. I had to do this chemistry experiment but it was with plants and I had to make the plant make music and explain why it did. It made music, but I only got one mark for each answer (there was a total of 10 marks). I got back the work and they were all like 2% for each."
"2435"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We got to her house and it was different. Quincy and a friend of his came over and his friend was made to stay in the car with me. Mom wanted to keep an eye on him as she said no friends of Quincy had been good. There were some biscuits in a bag and Mom said ""I want some biscuits"" and the friend jokingly took them. Mom was telling him a story of someone coming to the door to tell us to watch Supernatural."
"2436"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) Dad and I ended up somewhere and found this cheap hotel. There weren't many people. We got room 12. We got to where it was supposed to be, but there was a just a wall with a kitchen look to it and an oven. There was a thing at back to turn and I was worried about flames. It clicked and opened and there was the room. It had stingy blankets."
"2437"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was reading about Jeremy Piven and there was something about 'half a neck'. I asked Mom if she remembered Dad talking about Ari and she said yeah and I said ""no you don't""."
"2438"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was in a shop like building. I thought I was daydreaming. Sometimes people from school were there. We were going somewhere on buses and they sent two groups. I was in the same group as Calvin, Eugene and Dmitri. I was thinking this plane was going to crash and then bonding would occur between Eugene and I. Everyone split up though. Rebekah was sent into the lower school bus. I then had no pants on and as Ms Pascal locked up the doors I said ""Wait!"" and decided not to go. I put on pants and changed my mind and ran back out. Ezra was there and I asked ""are they still there"" and he said ""yes"". They were gone though. I ran down the street and saw the bus turn down the next street. It was dark and the buses had lights all over them. I saw a broken bus just outside with a note on it saying it'd take one month to repair. I went back and told this lady who worked at the school. As I was talking I saw a bus appear on another road (the road with the broken down bus had a bit of bush land behind it, and then other road). I saw a colourful portal like thing. The buses were coming back. The people were dressed in old-fashioned clothes. I said ""you must've gone through some kind of time warp"". They want back through the portal. Dad ran out of the building, but then it wasn't Dad. There were zombies. The guy (who had been Dad) stabbed them with a knife. I asked for one. I said 'don't we have to cut their heads off?'. When I cut them, it felt like cutting nothing. We finally killed this batch and then all these people started eating the dead bodies and started turning into zombies. I chopped this guys head off and then I yelled ""No!"" and I clicked on something and exited the area (it was a game now). I ended up in this underground part of a house. There were two groups. One had an option to talk to them. I had to block the door with dragons and I decided it was too hard and stressful and gave up. It was a quest on Runescape."
"2439"	"(2008-11-01 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. Emery was trying to take a photo of my Wiki. Some little girl friend of Mom's was around. Later, Darren was driving down this road with forest on either side. I was telling him to slow down because I had heaps of Christmas presents, ""this is Nana's and this is dads"". There was a bit of sand covering a section of the road and it had grass and frogs in it too. It was there to block the rest of the road. Darren maneuvered through it, there were people scattered in it too. He was just hitting them. At the end he stopped and got arrested. Mom got 'points' but Ezra and I didn't get in trouble."
"2440"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I had been staying at Eugene's and going back there at like 2am. I was sleeping in his room but in another bed. The bedspread was Indiana Jones themed, but it wasn't the 'real' Indiana Jones. The guy would talk to himself and talk to a Family Guy post on the wall, which voted for a different Indiana Jones. Later we had graduation. We all got crowded into some building and didn't know where to go. Ezra was there. He came back to Eugene's too. Eugene got bad results -- he got 3% for two subjects. There was a video of him and some Spanish joke about 'Kevin's county'. There was a girl who looked like Colleen. Cuddles was in a school and she was doing well at math and was ""inquisitive"". Mom was there as well."
"2441"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I was watching a boxing match with Ezra. It was a girl vs guy. The girl got the guy down and he ended up dying. His name was like Michael Spinocolli or something. I thought he was a race car driver for some reason. Later I was reading about him and his name was actually Ben McCallum. Later I was with Mom driving and I realized it was Ben from Big Brother, but his name was Brett, sometimes Brendan. I realized when it said he was from Midvale. I was telling Mom and she was in shock too. His profile picture was of a black-ish guy."
"2442"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I was at school, which was different and we were sleeping there. I was next to Calvin and some girl. We had to be inside by a certain time or we got in trouble. The girl and I were outside and we went to the toilet. I waited outside for her and then we went back to the school and then I realized I needed to go to the toilet. I asked the teacher and went back. There was 'platinum' toilet paper. People worked in the toilet. I went back and there were little pineapple lollies. We ate them. I had photos of Eugene. We had both been stuck somewhere and I had saved him but he hadn't spoken to me at all. There was some guy called Piggy and a friend of his died. He said that if he died he'd only be remembered as 'Piggy'. But he had helped me through something and I thought I'd remember him for more."
"2443"	"(2008-11-02 (17)) I was on Facebook. Mom posted a photo of her, me and Ezra. A lady commented saying that ""those are my kids"". We had a long argument over it and I think she eventually realized we weren't."
"2444"	"(2008-11-03 (17)) I was playing a Mario game. I called it Super Mario Sunshine a few times. It started off as a race and I had to collect stuff on the way. You had to collect people (celebrities) and coins and other stuff that was scattered around. You got stars (like in Mario games). I won the race the first time but skipped a lot of the stuff. I tried another time and there was Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore and some other girl. The other girl had to take Neve's place and wear a weird hat. There was a wood slope up and you had to be Beaver Mario to get up. There was a platform with holes, which was covered in people. Dad came home and had no pants on. I told him and he put a shirt on. I told him I was playing because I was going to study later and it was boring."
"2445"	"(2008-11-03 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different. I was on a balcony and it was apartment like. We had a cover thing and they put it down. Darren was there. I went downstairs and there was a jumper. I pressed ctrl-c and it turned out smaller -- it was a setting. Mom had gone on my computer and seen my Chris Barrie desktop. She was telling Darren later and said she ""had no clue"". I had been in some Red Dwarf episodes and I was thinking I wasn't funny or good enough to be on it. I wondered how I had been on it."
"2446"	"(2008-11-04 (17)) I was Mom's, which was different. Ezra wanted to go on my computer to play some game, so I created a new account. I had torrents downloading and four of them were 1gb and we only had 800mb to last the week. This game I played you had to run across the country? It was linked to Runescape after you did a quest. I got into a war and the army was weak but it won and I got points in some skills. Mom was taking me home, when we got to the street before home she decided to walk to the deli. The street was a bit shorter. Lydia drove past and asked if we wanted a lift and then drove off before we could answer. She came back and we said yes. Then Ezra and Fatima were there. He asked what Fatima's name was and mentioned that she wanted to change it. We finished at the deli and they had left so we had to walk. We got to Princess Road and there was work going on at the shops and on the road. This guy said he'd set us up in this four room motel as there was a tornado supposed to be coming. I said to Mom that I'd woken up that morning thinking I was going to die. She didn't believe me. He mentioned big waves. I was like 'I'm going to die!' and then he said everyone had gone to some school so I took off to go there. Mom said not to because only one person had mentioned it (and so it might not be true) and it reminded me of something I had read or watched. I don't know where we ended up, but I saw a tornado forming in the distance. I was freaking out. Then there were waves. We ended up under this gazebo and people were strewn about underneath it. Another one was coming up and Mom and I wrapped ourselves around a leg of the gazebo. The wave was huge. Then it was a game and I paused it. You could choose what you remembered about the wave and I chose not to remember anything. There was another wave and then it was some giant guy. Someone knocked him over with a spring and then Hancock (Hancock) was kicking him. I said to Mom ""Hancock's a good movie by the way"". Also we were at a shop at some point and there were lots of diaries of Nana's. I saw one from ""1991 January 25"". There was a little conversation on how she discovered I was born and the name was Jessica. I didn't have time to work out what it meant."
"2447"	"(2008-11-04 (17)) I was at a small cinema. People from Red Dwarf were there. Someone said to a waiter how Rimmer hid. Ezra and I went in and it was a ""fake alien"" story. There were people in seats. We hid in the seats with Rimmer. I was sticking out and realized Rimmer was doing the same. This alien came and took him, but left me and Ezra alone. They pulled his pants down and raped him. It was funny though (it was an episode of Red Dwarf) and we laughed and he just stood up afterwards and pulled his pants back up. He had a serious, but sad look on his face and I was thinking he was a really good actor."
"2448"	"(2008-11-04 (17)) I was walking out of school, which was different. I went to the carpark and was following Eugene. He went to his car and I couldn't see Mom. She waved at me from this weird silver car at a different spot. Later we were at some theatre place. Some actress had hung herself and had fallen through the floor, which was the roof above the stage. I was asking Dad when elevators were made. The school was there, I think. I was taking photos and video. I was on Myspace later or something and Dmitri had photos. Calvin commented on them and I was worried he was going to tell him that I liked him."
"2449"	"(2008-11-05 (17)) I ended up taking a Technical College course except it was actually a university course for those who didn't do well and it was at Westland. It was veterinary nursing and was my first day. I was in the car with Mom and Darren and I said to Mom ""I don't even have enough clothes to wear a different outfit every day"". I gave this girl there a sheet to say who I was. There was a random mix of people there, one was an old lady and there was a teenager with the rest of her family. There weren't many people there though. There were microscopes. I discovered there was a forensics course there but I hadn't seen it when I applied and I was annoyed. The first class I had was mixed in with another class which contained Bradley, Eugene and some of the others. I was sitting in a room with benches and this old guy gave me a drill thing. This other guy came later and gave me a bigger one and I said I wasn't part of that class. I asked Mom if I could swap classes. There was a video of a heart rate experiment we had done. I didn't like Eugene at the time and when he was near by heart rate didn't change, but when Dmitri was near it went from '46' to '100'. His stayed the same when I was near him though. There was a list of information about people in the class. For me it said ""adoniss"" and I had a number which was white and a 7 and thought 'No it's Eugene's', his was number 8. I was then on a plane, I think. Calvin was there and we had photos."
"2450"	"(2008-11-05 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill. Jamie, now that he was older, wanted to get more involved with exciting storylines. He asked Haley if he was going to be in 15 episodes and she said he was only in 11. He fell or was going to fall and I thought Nathan would catch him. There was a flashback in the next episode with Keith."
"2451"	"(2008-11-07 (17)) I was at this school thing and we had to sleep in this room, which was separated into sections. There were beds and lounges scattered around the room, which was quite big. Darius had hired prostitutes for him and Eugene to lose their virginity to. They were in a different section to me, and pretty far from me. I was upset and angry about it. I went to my section and saw the prostitute and Eugene kissing and then a curtain covered them. I went to sleep. Later, Ezra was in a bus which scraped the wall. Ezra thought I was angry at him. Eugene and Darius were waking up. Then I was closer to their bed. Darius was stroking his prostitute. Eugene woke up and said ""now I have to break up with her"", which he said was the hardest thing for him. I grinned and said ""she's a prostitute"" and he realized and laughed. He looked sort of weird, but still hot. Then I was in a car with Dad, Ezra and him. I was trying to take photos of him and put my phone on silent. He was singing. We were getting McDonald's but I said I didn't want anything because of the pink burger I'd gotten the other night (in real life). We went to a shop and I wandered off to the newsagency. I was crawling on the floor and the lady that worked there thought I was dodgy so I left. I saw Eugene wandering around. Ms Solomon was in this place with others. There was a thing in the water and at a certain level it would attack something."
"2452"	"(2008-11-07 (17)) I was in the car with Mom and the radio is on. A song that sounded like Genesis came on and I said ""Genesis is always on"" and Mom said it was David Hasselhoff."
"2453"	"(2008-11-08 (17)) Mom had gotten me a puppy and a grey kitten the night before. I hadn't named them yet. I had the kitten in a litter tray and the puppy was in a birdcage (the tall one we used to have out the back) temporarily so it didn't run off. I gave them fresh food and water. Later I was at school, which was different for graduation. I was limping. There was a video of it, which showed Eugene and afterwards with his parents. We had to give a gift to the school and we had to read out a bit of a story along with a recording in the background saying the speech. Mine had lots of pauses in it. Only three of us did it and it was to show that without practice you will make mistakes. As I was leaving this guy who was doing MIS was there and I had to help him do something, but I left. I couldn't find Mom and it was 3.24pm. I saw Bradley eating. Mom came and Granma was there too and she was doing something with drugs. Someone had a daughter (maybe me? I don't remember)."
"2454"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I went to Granny's old house for something. Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur, Dad and Ezra were there. Later, Elijah was there too. I was telling a story to someone about how Dad and I had gone there and this guy from ""208"" (a TV show) was there. Someone was playing a video game on the TV. Elijah got bored and left. He actually went to a place to see if his computer was fixed. We were going to see a dead relative and someone thought my clothes weren't formal enough. There was a blue car and then someone and I were climbing in stuff in water."
"2455"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) Some of us had powers. I got up and went to this underground carpark. This guy was shooting at me. I hid behind a pillar. He got me a few times. These people came and got him. Then there was another guy."
"2456"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I was watching Chuck and a girl asked Sarah and Chuck why they weren't together. Sarah said they were exes so the girl would leave them alone. We had to swim far underwater. There were two others and Bradley was there. There was a graph of emotions for Bill (True Blood). His emotions were all low and he was called something different but because he was so old, it had made his emotions go down which was why he rarely smiled."
"2457"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I was with Nathan Scott (One Tree Hill). We were signing a marriage certificate thing. We had to sign a different paper and then a lot more. On the last one I signed my name, although my last name was ""Abrams"" and I wrote ""I -- Nathan"" in this really nice writing. Nathan had written ""I -- Izzy"" the same way."
"2458"	"(2008-11-09 (17)) I was in a motel. It was stormy. We had two rooms. There was a bunk in one and two single beds in the other. There was some loud thunder. I went out with Mom. Later she ran away from me so I chased her. We got to some trees and she stopped. We had to get inside because there was a bad storm coming. Eugene and his mother were there. Something was happening to her. I tried to bring her to the single room so I could share the bunk with Eugene but she went to the bunk. I asked some people for help to drag her. I got a chocolate thickshake from McDonald's, but it was strawberry. I was at a shop with Dad and we were trying to decide what ice-cream to get. I decided to get 'Chest of Nuts' but then the shop closed on us. They said they'd give it to us if we came back before Saturday (it was Thursday)."
"2459"	"(2008-11-10 (17)) I was at a school with Calvin. We were trying to find our way out. We had a map but it didn't tell you the specifics (roads etc). Eugene and Darius were near us. We found a carpark and the road was leading out. Eugene's father Abraham was in the car driving out."
"2460"	"(2008-11-11 (17)) I was at Calvin's house which was big. It was night. His mother, who was a woman with curly red hair was in the kitchen and was talking to me. She said if I stayed balanced for ten seconds she would give me something, but I couldn't and we laughed. She suggested I stay the night and left the room. Mom was waiting for me outside. I saw her leaving and ran out. She drove back around to the door (the front of the house was like Nana's). Calvin came out. Ms Solomon was arguing with his him and his mother so he decided to stay at our place. He tried to get in the car, but Mom thought he was already in and drove off. I started laughing, so hard I couldn't breathe and I couldn't say he'd been left behind. Mom did some weird noise and then said a joke to Ezra and Calvin and she realized that he wasn't there and went back for him. I was watching TV and they had an ad for 'You Don't Know Jack' and Jack Nance was laughing and talking and I said that he sounded different. There was some lesbian show on. There was a transvestite too and some guy was talking to her about whether to make the bad guys on his new show black so as to vary the 'culture' or not. This guy was getting ""exulted"" because of his legs being shown. I was then at Nana's and it was day. Mom and Darren were there though. Sometimes it was their house. I was packing stuff up to go home and I had to go back inside to get my bra and water bottle. Darren left to do something. I went through the front door and the dining room had a thing that covered most of the door to the kitchen and you had to slide under but there wasn't much room. The door at the end of the hall was the same to I went back out and told Mom I couldn't get in the house. I went around to the garage thing and opened the door to the house, which had more doors inside. There was this creepy girl with curly hair about three doors in (they had little windows on them) and she was staring at me. I saw this creepy boy outside and I told Mom to get in and pulled her inside and locked the door. The kid hit the door and Mom was like 'there's nothing wrong with him, he just wants to play' etc. Darren got back and shot him with a special gun, except now he was a girl. Darren said some cop would be here soon and the girl had 24 minutes to live and I thought he meant until she was infected and turned into a zombie, so I shot her 28 times before realizing he meant that she could still be saved in the 24 minutes and I apologized but no-one seemed to care. The girl inside was now up the second door and was snarling."
"2461"	"(2008-11-12 (17)) I ended up in the future in a game, except it was playing out live. We landed in a spacecraft which was then a car and we closed the doors they locked. This meant we were stuck here. We had no weapons. This guy had a gun and we were trying to hide from him. We went into a building. There were Asian people and they tried to talk to us, and I think trying to help us. Instead of hiding we decided to fight. This other person got a gun and I hid. Then we were in a shop and I ran out as the guy came. There was glass around the corner and I knocked the guy off and took his gun. People were coming across the lawn and we were shooting and I kept missing and someone called it ""target practice"". Then there were hairy monkey things outside and I said they were ""what Austin evolved into over 100 years"". There was a train station which allowed you to teleport to places. There was also a fast ride which was really fun. You had to control it for a while at some point and jump over obstacles and get coins. I got game over at one point."
"2462"	"(2008-11-12 (17)) I was at school. Everyone was in this room. I was standing with Calvin and Eugene was there too. Ms Bigwood was doing some effects thing on photos. She got some off my Facebook and she asked me if they were ok. There was one of me smiling with Nana and I didn't like the smiling ones. Evelyn was standing with us. She kept saying ""Eugene"" which was annoying me and I wondered why she had started saying it. There was another photo Ms Bigwood did where she had made us covered in chocolate."
"2463"	"(2008-11-13 (17)) Selena and I were hanging out. We were staying in some hotel room. We had these little boards for in the pool, which holes for your hands at the flat end and a curvy end at the other side. First, I just was out and she came and we decided to use them. We had bathers on. There was water in the hotel. It went uphill and I kept choosing the bad path. We were talking about driving and the speed limit and I said I ""sometimes go over, but go straight back down again"". She said Brianna had said I had a "" [something I don't remember] finger shirt"". There was a pool and this lady said we weren't allowed to have the boards in there. We had to distract this dog for a certain amount of time. We took the dog and she went after it and we ran away. She followed it."
"2464"	"(2008-11-13 (17)) Mom and Darren were buying stuff on their computer. I can't read some of my notes. This other computer didn't have Java which I discovered when I went to play Runescape."
"2465"	"(2008-11-13 (17)) We got our TER results in the mail. I got 95 and I knew this was wrong so I thought it must've been someone else's. There was a note in there about Jeremiah so I realized it was his. I checked out the council number and it wasn't me and I was annoyed as well because I would've liked to have gotten 95."
"2466"	"(2008-11-14 (17)) I was with some guy, who was sometimes Ezra. We were lost and walked past a pen with a bull in it and it was angry. We ran up this tree and it got out. I dropped my phone and Ezra went down to distract the bull while I got it. We waited up in the tree and someone came eventually and punched the bull in the nose."
"2467"	"(2008-11-14 (17)) I was on Runescape. There was a quest with a scary monster so I went on Ezra's account to see how hard it was. You could log out and not save what you'd done. I died on his account and lost his stuff, but it saved. The next day he had made all the money back, which was over 100 million gp."
"2468"	"(2008-11-15 (17)) Mom and Ezra were going to Bali. Mom left without Ezra though. So later, Dad and I went to do something. Then Dad went back and I went clothes shopping with a girl friend. There were some purple dresses and she tried to get me one and there was some joke about someone's parties and John Lennon. Then I went back but I went with Ezra. We were on a plane and there weren't many people in the plane. There was like two rows of seven seats each. We slept. Then there were zombies and I was in a shop with some guy. There were kids there and were climbing up the chocolate shelf and the zombies were pushing them forward and we were jumping from the shelves. There were lots of people running past. I decided to leave because there were heaps. This girl got punched in the face (by me or otherwise, I don't remember). I managed to get out. Then it was a movie we were watching. The zombies were still in the shop. They pretended to get a food plate, to fit in with the people and I complained that they weren't supposed to be smart. One got its head sliced off but it was still ok. Someone explained the zombies visited each other and got 10 points for chopping a head off. The plane was full now. We were watching Saw 5, but then it was something else. This guy on the plane liked a girl in the movie and he put his hands over his pants. Then I was with Dad and Ezra in a car and it was night. It was ages after zombies and everything was deserted. We stopped at a petrol station because Dad needed to pee, but some people showed up. The car had 8ZE as part of its number plate and I thought it was Eugene, but it wasn't. I told him not to leave us because we'd die. This guy with a mace came to the car and was about to smash the window but we drove away, but now I was driving. The guy ended up electrocuting himself in a tunnel. Then I was walking, during the day, on a boardwalk on a beach. There were a couple of shops around. The bad guys found me and I attempted to bleed in an attempt to attract Edward (Twilight movie) to help me, but I was a vampire and so couldn't. So I yelled out ""Edward!"". Then I was Bella (Twilight book). Edward was near and he heard me the second time. Also, some time before I was at a restaurant and we were eating this really nice lobster. This Asian dude held up the store. I put my phone down my pants. Then I had gone in the past and replaced my phone with a gun. They then didn't have guns and I aimed the gun at him and he tried to escape."
"2469"	"(2008-11-15 (17)) I was at a shop called Shoe Stand, which consisted of walls and shelves with shoes. It had bags too. I then went with some people into a school. One girl actually attended the school and her younger sister did as well. These people were doing media in a classroom and they unlocked the door for us. One of the people didn't want me using the desk because I'd move them. We had a big argument. Then one of the girls got this thing out of a desk and made the whole room over in a few minutes. It was now night time and somewhere else. This girl had a gorilla suit and was in the woods. Someone came and she hid behind a tree. They were looking for her. She went back. The next day there was a dead deer with two holes in it outside someone's door. A vampire was questioned and it was Bill (True Blood). He said ""When we turn, the urge to feed is too great, we cannot protect our prey"", which explained why the deer couldn't have been killed by a vampire as it would've been shredded. Then I was the girl and I was coming into a barn through the roof. Bill hung out in there. He got me and I went to look up and he turned my head away. The 'camera' showed the roof and it had bits of insides in the roof. Then he was someone else (it was still him though). Take on Me was playing. We were covered in mud or something and he was naked (I don't know if I was) and I was rubbing my hands on his chest and stomach and then I put my head on his stomach to sleep."
"2470"	"(2008-11-16 (17)) I was at school, which was different. I was outside. We had these cords connected to us and mine got tangled underneath the building and other random places. I went to the office and I pulled it out of the wall and went to Ms Pascal, who was in a meeting. She took it and told me to leave. I came back later and she gave me a ""toxic turtle"". Classmate-F-06, Lydia and I were in this small room with a big window and a door leading outside. Classmate-F-06 asked if anyone here couldn't smell. I said I couldn't and neither did she. Then Lydia said she couldn't either. I said ""your mother"" and Lydia glared at me and it turned out her mother was dead. I thought it was odd that three people here couldn't smell. I was thinking I had to tell Mom. There was some game and Calvin visited me and gave me furniture for my room on the game."
"2471"	"(2008-11-16 (17)) I now had 13 quiz attempts on my quiz and four quiz comments, mostly saying ""yes"". The rating was 4/5. Someone had gotten 88%."
"2472"	"(2008-11-16 (17)) I went to my accounting exam. Dad dropped me off. I brought my graphics calculator and I told Ms Pascal and she wouldn't give me a normal one. I called Dad and he got there a few seconds after she started the exam. I looked at the page and then it was hours later and I didn't remember doing it."
"2473"	"(2008-11-17 (17)) I was at school. I was naked except I was wearing undies. My hair wasn't straight but was tied back. Elijah was following me around. I called Calvin and he turned up with Dmitri. I was trying to get out. I ended up in Northtown but it was different. I called Mom to get me. It was night. I got to a cheesecake shop and they gave me the uniform of ""Big Jimmy"" to wear. I was driving a car and the police drove past and then saw them behind me. I got out of the car and ran but they didn't do anything. Big Jimmy and his father were walking on the street. I gave them the uniform. He had been in love with Sookie (True Blood) and had a picture of her with vampire bites which had upset him. He had a torn up teddy bear that said ""first love"" on it."
"2474"	"(2008-11-17 (17)) I was on Pet Society. There were new clothes, lay out and a shop now had mats in it."
"2475"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. Dad was telling me that it was one week since he had had some dream. There had been an entrance to something and he had gone in it. I realized I was dreaming. There was a pipe thing with two entrances in it. Dad said he could see it too and he said he must be dreaming and I said 'no, I'm dreaming'. I pinched my hand and felt nothing. I got them to do the same and asked them how strong it felt and they replied with random words. For some reason, Ezra ended up chasing me and I ran into a bigger shop and he kept getting things to throw at me. First it was a kettle and it was always heavy stuff. I tried to make him stop and then tried to make the stuff disappear which didn't work, but it always missed. He threw a heater at me. I hit him with it. I ran out and there was a car parked just outside and it was unlocked so I tried to get in, but I didn't get in in time. It was actually very vivid at the time and I was thinking it was going to be a lot to write down, but was worried my poor dream recall lately might affect it (which it obviously did)."
"2476"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was driving with Mom and Ezra and I was in the back. There were all these people on the street and I said they were ""Pettigrew's"". They all looked like Jason Bateman and his last name was Pettigrew. The kids looked like Emery though. There was a list of Superman movies and one of them had a black Superman. I went to this old lady's house and she gave us drugs. She said they were really strong and asked me if I was ok because she had seen some silly photos of me the other day."
"2477"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was out the back. Tigger was on the table and I fed her and gave her milk. I kept spilling it though and it was in packets. This black cat was talking to a box and then I realized Tigger was behind it."
"2478"	"(2008-11-19 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom and I climbed up these boxes, which was really high. Ezra was on the other side and I yelled out to him and he had to climb all the way over again. He had a Labrador with him. Mom and I went down. Greg Grunberg was sitting on a lounge in another room and I walked past him again and went to get my phone and ask for a photo. My phone wasn't there. I asked Mom to ring it and it was in the boxes, but it was Ezra's phone. I told her to call Ezra's and I found my phone. It was low on battery so I put it on charge. Greg was going to the toilet, he said something scared him and he said that he ""shat myself"" and I said ""waste of a trip then""."
"2479"	"(2008-11-20 (17)) I was at home and it was Father's Day tomorrow. I was sorting out the DVD's in the family room in a row. Then it was food, venick like (or however you spell it) and I arranged them into a circle. When I came back they were gone and Mom said she put them away before Tigger ate them. Ezra was coming back to her house to stay. I had to get my external hard drive. I had Your Love playing as I was packing it away. We went to a petrol station and this truck and a car had had an accident and were pushed to the side so they weren't in the way. Then it was just me and Mom there. We were going to get something for Dad and I said ""those trees are gay"". We were then outside this hospital and there were lots of tables. Nana had been at the hospital a while ago. Ezra, Dad and other family were there. There were these computer booth things scattered around and Ezra had made a quiz on them. Kate (Lost) was there and drank out of this cup and then spat back in. I was really thirsty (in real life too)."
"2480"	"(2008-11-21 (17)) I was at Mom's and Ezra was over. On Yahoo, there was a video of Farrah with fire sticks. I called Dad to tell him and he answered with ""five"". He had already commented on the video. Ezra was then at home. I was complaining about the equilibrium of the water bottles. I was telling Mom that some guy from something she watched was in True Blood (I was talking about Rene) and that he was the killer. I was explaining that Sookie could read minds and she was like ""Sookie?"" and this had something to do with a killer that had struck nearby. This girl had a 'Tanaca' (I think) dress on. It was then the next morning and I hadn't slept that night. I had stuff on my bed. There was some party thing and Eugene had facial hair, which looked hot so I was trying to take a photo. Mom was going to see a guy called Ted. I said ""Ezra's not here I have no-one to play with"" and went for the drive. Gavin was somewhere."
"2481"	"(2008-11-21 (17)) There were another lot of external hard drives. It was the 23rd of whatever month it was. Mom asked me when I was going to study and I said my first exam wasn't for ages. She said it was in a couple of days. I went to check and the accounting exam was on today. It was 8.20-30am and it started at 9.20am. I went to her place and it was her old house. I ran upstairs and got changed and got my calculator and stuff. Darren was asleep on their bed. I went to the kitchen and there wasn't much food. I grabbed a muesli bar and went back down. Ezra said it was too late and it was nearly 9.30, though the clock said 10.18 (it was an hour fast). I fell to my knees and cried and was crying out that I was going to get like 5% average and that I'd be lucky if I got a TER of 1. They ignored me and commented on the neighbour's lawn."
"2482"	"(2008-11-22 (17)) I was at a shop with Calvin and we were later joined by Evelyn. She had a lot of meat and rice in her trolley. Later I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Sloane and Derek were in a room lying on a bed. Derek was lying on his side at the edge and he ended up masturbating to test out a new sexual position (on his side) and was slapping his bum. Sloane was shocked at this but masturbated as well. I was wondering what the hell was going on."
"2483"	"(2008-11-22 (17)) I was at the hospital because of some friend of Ezra's. It was hard to get to other sections because you had to go over this maze which had water moving in all different directions. Deb (One Tree Hill) and some guy were having sex in the water. She was pregnant and then had the baby and named it all these 'Cajun' names and Jeremiah was one of the names. Then the baby was this extremely cute kitten and I was holding it and said ""you're the cutest thing I've ever seen""."
"2484"	"(2008-11-22 (17)) There were zombies. I was with Eugene and some others. It was dark. We went into this building. There were three rooms. The one we were in had a big red 'foam' mattress thing (like a rectangle) and it almost went as high as the roof. There was an archway leading to the next room, which contained a windowed door leading outside and a normal door leading to another room, which also had a red mattress thing and was like an inside gym. This room had a bolted door at the far end. It also had another door leading to the first room. Anyway, I checked the place for zombies. I opened the bolted door and this black guy came in saying they were coming. Elijah helped me close the door and we had trouble bolting it. The zombies started pushing against it. I ran to leave. I went to go through the door we came through but zombies had already started coming through so I ran the other way. Eugene had gone that way too. There weren't many zombies this way. There were a few steps outside leading down to a carpark, which was quite full. We ran down the steps. Eugene got a car and picked me up. I was in the back. I was about to lock the doors but I saw Sophia Bush in the carpark and let her in (we were friends). There was a guy driving a car in front of us and he was driving really slowly and kept stopping and we ended up hitting the back of him. We got past him but he started chasing us. We drove over an oval and he followed. We ended up losing him shortly after that and drove into an underground carpark, which was also pretty full. We parked and were looking for a fast car. I found this silver one which looked fast and it was hard to drive. We left the carpark and saw Autumn riding in a closed Segway."
"2485"	"(2008-11-23 (17)) Madonna, sometimes Granma, brought me to this boardwalk near a beach. It was night. She had set some stuff up and wanted to show it to me. There were feathers placed around as some sort of clue. There was a hot tub with flower petals in it. I was trying to take a photo of it. The reason for it was she had fixed something with swans in it and the petals were for someone called Rose. Then I was in a car waiting for someone. Someone was outside so I locked the door. I tried to take photos with my phone with the flash on but I couldn't see them. They came up close and it was Jeremy Piven. He walked around the car and smiled. He told me to call him, now, which confused me but I did anyway. I selected 'bitch' on the phone which allowed him to go somewhere. Then Robert Downey Jr. got in the car as the lock didn't apply to him. He went to Red Rooster and asked ""Do you want anything?"" and I said ""Can I get a Flayva?"" I think he was annoyed. I think Jeremy Piven and I ended up having sex and we had been for a while. Mom and Ezra were going to Seaworld and I was telling her about the cool stuff such as the jet skiing and the beach at the Gold Coast. I accidentally said ""Lindsay Lohan"" instead of something."
"2486"	"(2008-11-23 (17)) We were going on an excursion and we were on a 'bus'. Calvin was on the floor and he was eating chicken wings. We were going to some aquatic place to help some animal. Then it was a game and there weren't enough people to play so we recruited some players and we were successful."
"2487"	"(2008-11-24 (17)) I was with Sam and Dean (both Supernatural). Something was killing these people and we went to investigate. We were talking to some people, all girls. Sam and I kept giggling. They gave us this rainbow coloured band and I put my finger on it and pulled and it was squishy and we laughed. The killer thing was a blob. I think it was killing people who had a disrupted childhood and I thought that Sam and Dean would qualify. It started chasing us and so we ran off in the opposite direction to the people it was chasing and then it disappeared. Sam started making faces (like in the bloopers) and that model pose. Then I was playing a game in the sky. You had to make words out of the letters but it was going too fast. At the top of the screen (and the top of the 'word tree') was fruit."
"2488"	"(2008-11-25 (17)) I was doing a movie, but for a scene, some guy had to perform oral sex on me. When he did, no-one was around. He did it for ages, but not much was happening, I was just very wet with saliva down there, which was gross. He stopped and told the director, who then replaced him with Hurley (Lost). I walked out before he got there. I complained and they said ""well, don't you like Bradley Cooper?"" and I said ""Yeah I do like Bradley Cooper"". I was telling Ezra about the casting and how a fat, old director casts an old, fat actor and a young, thin director casts young, thin actors. The director of this movie was Judd Apatow. Later we were doing something in these woods and talking about camping. Something happened with a dog."
"2489"	"(2008-11-25 (17)) It was night. Mom pulled up the front to take us for a drive. Ezra and I went out and Dad came to see what was going on. It was then 2.30am and there were chicken things out the front."
"2490"	"(2008-11-25 (17)) I was playing a game, out live. I was at a house and someone knocked on the door. It was some weird guy with a squishy head. He said he was new in the game and I told Ezra to deal with him. We were in some caves and there were patches of grass with Pokemon in them. The only one I had was Nidoran (male). A trainer battled me, but he had 3 Pokemon and it took away two, so it was fair. I did a tail whip movement and it knew what move it was and the Pokemon did it too. Later I was at a school, which was big. I was at a bench with Calvin and some others. Forrest came up to us and I asked if he'd do something for me and he said he would do it tonight. Samantha asked who it was and I giggled and said ""a friend from when I was younger"" and she said ""he's small"". I was then in a room on a computer with profiles of all the people at school. The photos had a 360° movement. I saw Mackenzie's one. I was editing mine as it showed my birthday as the 13 September. I was learning some American ways, ie using stuff on the opposite side. There was a ladder thing I had to climb and I had to put my left foot first which made it really hard. I was hanging on and there was a long drop below. I was scared. This guy friend of mine came to help me. There was a long queue waiting to go behind me. I was now in a muscly body and did it and everyone clapped."
"2491"	"(2008-11-26 (17)) I was with Mom in a car at night. I had chickens at Nana's but I hadn't fed them in a while. We went past and there dead ones. Her house was different. We went around the side, near her room and the light went on. I went to the front door. As it opened I said ""it's Izzy"" and Nana said ""I was about to hit you on the head""."
"2492"	"(2008-11-26 (17)) I was at a library at a table with That's Life. I was facing away from the front and I was sitting at the back. This Native guy and a white guy came in and they were dodgy looking and I thought they were going to hold it up so I was going to leave but I didn't want to seem racist. But then they did hold it up. I put my phone in my pants so they couldn't get it. They sent me and this guy to lie on the floor. They shot the guy and I had the feeling he was with them. They let me go. I called Mom and there was a guy with a sniper near a tree just outside so I ran away and called her again when I was near Northtown. She was already there. I told her I was ""near Dad's old work"". She got me and we were driving down a road with lots of trees on either side. I saw tornado things in the distance and I freaked out and then saw more, but they were all going the other way."
"2493"	"(2008-11-27 (17)) I had met Broken Lizard before. I only remember Erik Stolhanske and Paul Soter though. I went to a cinema. It had a small screen. There were a bunch of guys I was friends (adults) sitting in a row at the back, so I sat in the row behind them (you entered the room through a door at the back). They ignored me and then moved and I was annoyed at this. I remembered back to when we were friends. I had gone out with one of them, but this other one and I had decided to have sex. I remembered back to this and we were on a lounge thing and he was on top of me and I wondered why I did it. He was really nice though. He came to the cinema and said hey to me. I was then outside of Mom's and I had photos of celebrities and other people for my PowerPoint presentation and for my Wiki. The photos were in plastic and I took them out and tried to put them back in but they were ruined. Meyer came over."
"2494"	"(2008-11-27 (17)) I was at a carnival with the school. I was with Calvin. We were walking on the side of the road to avoid something. The carnival didn't actually start until ""7 November"", which was a while away. I had to go to the toilet (at school I think). The cubicles didn't have doors so I went to the shower. I had been in math and the teacher said we could go to the toilet. Then I was with Dad in a building. There were rabbits so I pet them. There was a giant rat thing with a spider and it was shaking. These guys shut the place down. The guy told us most of them were ok but I felt bad."
"2495"	"(2008-11-27 (17)) I was watching Ugly Betty. Lindsay Lohan was back on but as a different character. Betty was hiding in a house and to be with Lindsay (I can't remember if she liked her or not). They had knocked the house down. These garbage guys said they'd been doing disposals for two people and something happened twice in 20 years (can't remember). Someone had been mean."
"2496"	"(2008-11-28 (17)) I was showing Mom a bit of the first episode of Chuck. It was really weird. Chuck walked into a room and he said something weird and his sister was sitting in a corner with a bald head and said ""Anton!"" and I laughed and told Mom that I'd forgotten it started off weird. Later I was playing a game and this girl was going for a job interview and her choice of clothes was a Pokemon shirt. Then I was the girl, but not. The door to my room was back to front. I called out to Mom ""I'm going to a job interview but I can't lock the door"". I told Mom we had to take the keyhole off and switch it but she said it would take away the auto lock thing. I said I didn't care. While I waited for her I was going through the stuff on the shelf in there -- it wasn't my stuff. There were movies; one was the ""original Red Planet. Oh there's like 1800 of them"". Some of the covers were faded the rest had red covers. There was a movie that started with an 'I' (I think it was called Ilysum) and it was French sounding. The girl on the cover was from something and I told Ezra it was really weird ""like almost David Lynch"". There were pictures as well and one was of Malcolm McDowell from A Clockwork Orange and I said ""Oh, I'm so taking these"". Dad was at the table and I thought he was at my spot, but he was in the one next to it. He was eating something."
"2497"	"(2008-11-29 (17)) I was in some building with the school. We had been practicing this game and it was now the official exam or whatever. We had this strip straight in front of us and a hot air balloon at the end. We had to go down the strip and get something. I didn't have a balloon on mine. Autumn was next to me. I got the first thing and the lady said I was disqualified and I had no idea why. She said that you had to stay within the width of the balloon when doing it, but I said we didn't have to do that when we'd been practicing and that I didn't even have a balloon."
"2498"	"(2008-11-30 (17)) I was at school and it was different. We were getting tickets for graduation. Mom and Ezra got our tickets at the library. They left. I had to get a 'fracture form' because I had hurt my ankle ages ago. This lady had been writing very neat and spaced. It said 'Sydney Fox' who was a teacher. I asked ""is it a 'y' or an 'I'?"" and she had written 'y', but I thought 'I'. I saw an official sheet and it had spelled it with a 'y'. I was then waiting outside for Mom. Eugene was nearby with his friends. Jeremiah was telling him about Facebook. I got my phone out and took a photo but it wasn't on silent, so I moved it away and the photo was blurry. I put it on silent but he moved. They were sitting on the grass further away and it showed thought bubbles. Eugene's brother Rodney was there too. I took a photo of them. Bradley was next to him. I remembered Calvin saying that Bradley was ugly. Then I had a car. I drove out while trying to call Mom. I was on the road and the speed limit sign said ""Q"" which meant 75. It was then a bridge, which was right on top of the water. Then there was some really pretty water. It was jelly like and bright blue. There was a lot more of it further on. Then I wasn't in car and I was in it. It was cool and felt really nice. The waves rolled over me and I just lay there. It was in a place called Sublima. Then I had a car again and I didn't know how to get out. There were chocolates in a shelf. Most of them were nutty and one was a Violet Crumble. I waited for Mom."
"2499"	"(2008-11-30 (17)) I was watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Jason Segel was talking to his uncle and his mother. This girl came along and his uncle went and put these two curvy balls together (which was some sexual joke). There was a laugh track and Jason Segel was looking at his mother and trying not to laugh. I was like 'what the hell is this? This isn't funny'. Later his uncle said to him that he ate ""shit for you!"" and then ""literally. I had my legs around his waist..."". I remembered something earlier with Paul Rudd jumping off a cliff."
"2500"	"(2008-11-30 (17)) I was outside somewhere. There was a house behind me and my car and this other red car were on the lawn. A retard girl and her mother were there. The retard would open her mouth and go ""dur!"". It was really funny and I was trying not to laugh. I had to wash her head. I held Mom's hand and she scrubbed. Calvin was watching. My car looked orange, so I sprayed it with the hose, which caused the other car to go orange. Mom then sprayed the other car, which turned mine orange and we kept going back and forth."
"2501"	"(2008-12-01 (17)) I was at Mom's. I had a file on the table and I knocked it and it fell out and went all over the floor. I was picking it up and Mom got home. She asked where her coke was and I had chucked it in the in. I went home and she gave me lots of chocolate. Ezra gave me more. Dad was on my laptop getting a show off there. He said ""I like your screensaver"". I said it was my desktop. I looked at it and it was still Chris Barrie, but there were fewer pictures. I had a cube with all the guys from The Young Ones on it. I only remember Mike, Neil and Rick on it though. Ezra was complaining that Lost was different now and weird."
"2502"	"(2008-12-02 (17)) Ezra was playing on the Wii. I wanted to play Bully, so he said he'd save his game and let me on in a minute. When I did start playing, it was different. I had to find a date for a dance. I was looking at the girls to find a pretty one. One of his enemies was annoying a nerd, so I chose to beat him up and let the nerd go to the toilet. I was helping others out. The bad guy complained and said he came from a bad family. He decided to fake something so the bad guy didn't have to do something. I had to go to the toilet (in real life too)."
"2503"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I was watching Lost. Charlie had met Jack ages ago and he had almost made him give up drugs. Someone secretly saw some guy. A lighter had no gas, but there was still a flame. Someone told Locke to watch out for some guy. I watched a trailer for Twilight, which showed Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. I told Darren it had a 4.5/5 rating on Flixster which was really lame, because it sucked. In True Blood, Sookie was in a chicken suit and her feet were on an angle and she couldn't work."
"2504"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I was a kid. I was weird looking and my lips looked funny. I kept forgetting I was younger. Ezra and Dad were around. I was in a hotel. There was something to do with Lost."
"2505"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I was at home, out the back. I was with Ben (Lost) and some others. Sawyer (Lost) was one of them. We planned to break into a casino. At first it was just to steal something from a smaller place, but he changed it to a casino. We were in the garage at a table. Then there were other tables around and it was a McDonald's. The roller door was open and Ben said it was so people would think it was a distraction. He wanted it closed a certain way and I asked why not just lock it there and he agreed, so I did that. Ben was a leader-ish guy and decided to go his own way since no-one in the group had listened to him. He went inside. They were saying that he was ""hot enough"" to do that. Ben was then a bad guy. I decided to go with him. I went in and locked the door and put the metal rod in so it couldn't be opened. He asked me why someone of ""high morals"" would decide to go to the ""dark side"". There were two drag queens who kept trying to be a part of the group. We wanted one of them, but not the other so we were trying to trick them. Then Brad Pitt was part of the group. We were breaking in somewhere. Then Ben had this huge room with replica casinos everywhere. When we first opened the door, Mom was in there. Then someone turned around and said ""hey Mom"". Some of the people were wearing SWAT like gear and had guns. One of the casinos there had those red sensor beam things."
"2506"	"(2008-12-03 (17)) I had a baby and the father was Eugene. Then it had been Mom, but she had actually just renamed me and Ezra. He was now called Ian Holder and I said if you add ""Somer"" then you're Boone (Lost). Ezra said ""I don't wanna be Boone!"". I was renamed to Kim, but then changed to Amy. I was driving and Mom called to ask if Ezra could borrow my shoes. I said yeah but they wouldn't fit. Then I was at home with Ezra, who was sometimes not. This guy was trying to get in through the kitchen window. We got him away and then I couldn't lock the front door. He got in, but I was still holding the wood door. We got a knife and were tying to stab him."
"2507"	"(2008-12-04 (17)) I was at school. It was university. Eugene and I were the only people our age. I didn't know what to do. I hadn't brought stationery because I hadn't known what I needed. I called Mom for help. This girl showed me some different organizers."
"2508"	"(2008-12-04 (17)) There were werewolves. To prevent them going to you, you supposedly had to greet them and say their name. We were at some stands. Claire (Lost) was pregnant and was kicking one leg back and forth. This attracted them. We got to her and this girl said she'd have to have the baby. We took her to the car. She wanted to have it at the airport. Mom was getting stuff out of the boot. A werewolf came and we told her to run. Later, it showed the door of the car covered in blood."
"2509"	"(2008-12-05 (17)) I was going to the Comic-Con with Mom. It was 4pm and I was going there to meet someone. I forgot my shoes. We went back there and it was 4.30 and I realized we wouldn't make it in time. Mom said that the show ended tomorrow and so I gave up and said ""oh well""."
"2510"	"(2008-12-05 (17)) We were in this sewer like place and there was a bit of a jump somewhere on one of the levels. Each side had these squishy platforms. Elijah was there. Gemma jumped across and hit her foot. I jumped and missed and I laughed. This guy had a vision of him under a table in his 'shop' class. He was working out how to do something with a piece of wood. I was thinking it had something to do with time travel. When the flash ended, he brought his mates down to show them, but the wood wasn't there. One of his friends was Sawyer (Lost). He had another flash of a tree outside and something on it. He realized that it was a different day he would find the wood. I was with them now. We were outside in this park like area. Calvin and I were walking across it. Cutter walked past and asked me if I was the one with ""lots of rooms"". I'm not sure if it was rooms. We climbed down some steps and zombies were coming. I ran out and there was another flash which we realized happened later too. The zombies were everywhere. We ran back. There were people running everywhere. We went up these ladders in the sewer place. As we climbed up this ladder, there was a movie review behind it. Michael Emerson was in it and they mentioned Cate Blanchett and said ""things to consider"" included Michael Emerson. I was thinking he was awesome. There was a photo of him included and he was bruised and battered. We waited on the highest platform. After a while I opened the door and there was a hallway in a building. There was room at one end of the hall, where a woman was sitting on a chair at a desk. I said hello and she said hello back. I said I was just checking that you weren't a zombie. She said she was and showed us the bite on her hand. I backed away."
"2511"	"(2008-12-06 (17)) I was at school which was different with Calvin and we were trying to leave. I got a call from Ms Braun saying the yearbooks were ready but they weren't actually the yearbooks. I had $20, which was enough for it as they were $7.99 each. I went to health block and Mr Quinlan was in there. Ms Braun sent me to the English block. Ms Pascal was on the phone when I got there. She asked if I was in trouble or wanted something. She gave me the yearbook thing. She asked if I was ok about the ""English Sofia award"". It was like the ""razzies"". I was getting it for being the worst English student. I remembered getting a note about it before. We were then at the liquor store at Midvale and it was really neat and tidy. Ezra was there. I remembered when Dad used to work there and it was messy and big. 'Greasers' used to hang outside and Poppers and the others would call the cops on them."
"2512"	"(2008-12-06 (17)) Calvin and I were in a car and then were walking down a street. There was a big woman with blonde hair in a clothes shop -- she was Nordic looking and reminded me of Elijah. I told Calvin about her. We went to the end of the street and then we were going back and we saw a car put its brakes on. The driver guy hit his head on the wheel and then drove off. As we walked away, Classmate-M-03 fell to the ground as he'd been hit. I said to Calvin ""Classmate-M-03's been hit"", but he refused to look around. We got back to the shop and realized we'd left the car and I said I didn't want to walk all the way back. Calvin said he would. I saw Alejandro walking the way we wanted to go, so I went with him. We got to a school. We were outside the gym. I took my pants off, because it was hot, but then realized I had no shorts. We went in through the gym, into the room next to it. A teacher lady kept walking in and out and the other students there helped us stay out of sight."
"2513"	"(2008-12-06 (17)) Someone and I went to this famous person's house. There was a band called Petrol Station who had made Snow Patrol famous. I walked down the road to the house and there was a big patch of grass. We went in and there were people walking around. There was food on the table and they let us eat. It was all lollies and sugary stuff. The guy we were here to see walked past and then we couldn't find him. We were in a lounge room. These guys came up to the door and I went to open it and then they were gone. They were coming back up the stairs and round a bend, so I ran to the door and screamed and it scared them. I locked the door. There were biscuits and chocolates in the fridge and took some."
"2514"	"(2008-12-08 (17)) I decided to watch the last few episodes of Twin Peaks. This guy and his mother pretended he had turned into a mermaid so he could leave the place. He was swimming in a lake and the cops came and caught him. He jumped back in and now it was me. I was swimming backwards with a cop after me. I was swimming really fast, but he was really close. I almost reached the other side and we had a fight underwater and I got out. There was a creepy lake next to it where someone had gone missing. I sat on this swing and the creepy lake tipped over. I grabbed onto a branch. Then there was a skeleton and it was talking to me. I showed it the swing and then it looked like a normal person, a girl. We went to the cinema and when we left, it was packed. I tried to call some people but no numbers worked. One of the people I tried to call was Alyssa. We got to the carpark and a car pulled up with people in it. Samantha was in there. I asked if she could see the person I was with and she said yeah. The skeleton got in and I sort of explained who she was. The door wouldn't open and I was worried they were going to trap us. Then I was in with Dad in a car. Mittens and a cat called Sam were with us, on the outside of the car. There was a snake and it bit Mittens and then it was near Sam and I said ""Sam!"" and it got hold of her and then let go. We opened the window and Sam came in. We left and I said that we'd left Mittens."
"2515"	"(2008-12-08 (17)) Leigh Whannell gave me videos of his original Saw ideas. They only included him and his mate and were totally homemade. I thought it was good. I was showing it to Mom and Darren. They were bored and Mom started making faces and sticking her tongue out."
"2516"	"(2008-12-08 (17)) I was at a hotel place. I don't remember why but this guy let me in to his expensive suite. There was a comfy lounge outside the room. Then people I knew were there. Ezra, Dad and some others took beds in one of the rooms. Theodore was in the other room and he was the only one in there. He took the first bed, next to the wall, closest to the door. There were about 12 beds, three rows of four across. I lay on all the beds to find the comfiest one. The only comfy one was at the other end of the row of Theodore's (next to the other wall). He made food, which was bacon and steak. It wasn't cooked properly. He said he'd put it on for longer. We had Bully and Saints Row for the Wii. I accidentally hit reset and it reset mine and Ezra's data for Bully. We had gotten really far and I was like ""Nooo!"". I was telling Mom about it. I went to play on the X-Box. I was playing Saints Row but told Darren it wasn't, but it was. You could play with the Wii remote and I was punching some guy on the game."
"2517"	"(2008-12-09 (17)) I was watching Lost, but then it was real. I was in a submarine. It was filling with water and was up to our heads. These guys went under water to get some bar (rectangle shaped and silver) and gave it to me to put in this other room and I had to set it right. I got it in the right place and the water went down."
"2518"	"(2008-12-09 (17)) I was at home and out the back. There was a baby and it was laughing at me. Mom was nearby."
"2519"	"(2008-12-10 (17)) I was playing a game with Ezra, which played out live. You were a superhero, I think. You had to kill some Superman villain and then The Joker, which was the furthest I had gotten. I blew them up. Then you grew. I was the size of bottle caps at the moment and was collecting them. The next stage you were the size of people, I think. You had to collect eggs. I had other people with me to help. Elijah was one of them. Then I was sitting in a hedge maze thing with Ezra and Eugene was there too. We were playing a board game. The die was made of paper and I accidentally ripped two sides of it."
"2520"	"(2008-12-10 (17)) Betty (Ugly Betty) was on an island. She was sitting on a flat, round wooden thing, that was like a swing over a pit. This guy came on to sit and said it was safe to drop. I think she dropped, but couldn't get out. Amanda (Ugly Betty) was saying that Bad Ronald was real and was trying to show Betty. Then I was there trying to get through a jungle. There was some sludgy sand and I thought it was quicksand so tried to get out. It was really hard to lift myself out of. I met up with some others. Granma had lived on the island all her life. There were photos on a computer and it said who was going to get them when she died. Some of them were for me, but I changed them so they were all going to me. Mary Lynn Rajskub had pictures on there and they were really ugly. Someone's father was dying. His son was with him and he was sick. The father was lying down and they were waiting for this black girl to come back with some bandages. The son decided to kill his father and put his hand over his nose. He was crying and there was blood everywhere for some reason. Then the girl got there. Haley (One Tree Hill) was his girlfriend. She was there too. Then I was at a table/desk and lots of other people were seated around it. Eugene was on the other side and I was trying to take a photo of him, and was covering the light on the phone with my finger. He was then James Lafferty and I took a photo and he was smiling his crooked smile. Haley made a face at a girl which was funny. Then she made a face at my camera opening her mouth pretending to put her mouth over it. She laughed. Michael Emerson had been credited at the beginning of season 2 of Lost although he didn't appear ""until one month after"". I was thinking that I didn't remember that."
"2521"	"(2008-12-10 (17)) I was at home, which was a new house. I was in the lounge watching TV, which was a movie that was a cross between Lord of the Flies and Battle Royale. A pregnant lady had died. People had forgotten about the island they were on and they now had to fend for themselves. At the end of the movie it zoomed into a face of a small black boy, hiding in the trees. I thought he saw someone coming (at our house). My room had thin curtains on the window. When walking into the room, my bed was in the middle of the room coming out from the wall towards the window, which was on the left wall from the door. There was a desk just in front of the window. There was a small stream and a lot of bush and trees outside the window. Dad's room was across from it. I went to my room and I thought I saw a shadow of a head outside and I tried to call out to Dad, but no noise came out."
"2522"	"(2008-12-11 (17)) I was at a shop. I went to go in one of the shops inside, but the lady closed the gates on us. We went in another way. I was with Calvin. We snuck around trying to avoid the staff. We went to hide and there was a box of Nintendo 64 games. I grabbed Banjo Kazooie. This guy started following us and we pretended we were looking at TV's. He made us leave and closed the gate. I still had the game and banged on the gate and the price said it was $3.20 and I gave him a $5 note and he said he'd still tell on me, so I gave him another $3 and he left. The inside of the cartridge looked all screwy, but it played ok. Mom said it might not be ok though. I went back and replaced it with a better one and put it in a female friend's bag. Then we went out and it was raining. We ran down this slope. I was insulting one of the lady's that worked there and then realized she was eating at the table behind me. It was almost time for Mom to pick Ezra up, but I text her saying I was at Centerville shops and needed to be picked up. Later, she, Ezra and I were in the car. She was at a deli getting us a hamburger. It was going to take ages."
"2523"	"(2008-12-12 (17)) Eugene and I got ourselves a house/apartment. We had a double loft bed and brought a huge TV to put under it. We joked that we had more stuff than when Mom first got a house. The bed was shaky. I was lying on it. He came up and I said that we needed to get a better bed. He agreed and put his arm around me. Then there was a thing to record past times. One of my dreams that was recorded was about Sims 2. He put it on the low setting so I could dream properly. Then it was The Simpsons and Homer said he put it on low but instead of actual scenes showing it was pictures of a dude in a bricked house and Homer said ""Doh!""."
"2524"	"(2008-12-12 (17)) There was a big dark green shed in which medical stuff went in. House (House) usually worked in there and didn't allow others by themselves. He was standing outside a fair way away, so all the doctors, myself included, ran in and tried to lock the door. There were two latches and I tried to lock them together but they just kept swinging around. I couldn't work it out and he was coming so I just ran back. He came in and pulled a lever to make this stuff pour from the rood, which was like animal insides. Before it got to me, I ran out. Then I was behind the big shed at home, which now had a fair amount of space next to the fence. I had gotten clothes from the second storey of the shed. The shed three storeys, but they were tiny (not high enough for a person to stand, just to store stuff). I was going out with Eugene I think and he was out the back too. He had clothes in the shed too. I was getting dressed and I heard him coming around the shed to see if I was there and I banged on the shed so he didn't come and he jumped and didn't come around. The shirt I had had a picture of Pikachu (Pokemon) and me on it. I put it on and came out. He was sitting at the table under the patio thing with Mom and some others. There was a chair next to him, so he stood up and moved so I could get in. The pool was clear and we were going to go in. Later, I was at Mom's old house. I left with Eugene. I needed to go the toilet so walked up the stairs to get there."
"2525"	"(2008-12-13 (17)) I was with hobbits (all from The Lord of the Rings movie) and we were trying to get away from wraiths. I was with Pippin, Frodo and presumably Sam although I don't know if he was with us. Merry had left earlier. Pippin had psychic abilities and could hear how far away the wraiths were. We got home and were hiding at the window in the dining room, they were too close so we didn't have time to go anywhere else. The table wasn't there. They came in and found us straight away. I asked the leader if I could get a water bottle. He said no and I said that I was going to get thirsty. We had been in the desert at some point. He gave us names and mine was ""Honesty"". I was then doing a quest on Runescape which was supposed to be the longest quest. I was with a girl and a guy. I was in a red place that looked like the city of TzHaar and had lava streams around. I couldn't pause the quest until I found a job (it was like a social simulation game now). I was immune to poison and couldn't lose any health, because you had to stand on lava for some of it. I had to assign a job to Ezra first and I gave him the best paying one and it gave all positive attributes and one skill a day (though, not a Runescape skill). I had to get a lower paying job somewhere else, the options included at a hairdressers and a cinema. I don't know what I picked."
"2526"	"(2008-12-13 (17)) I was on the side of a road. I'd made a bet or something that I could hitchhike. I was wearing skimpy clothes to help get picked up. Rebekah was there and she was a hitchhiker/prostitute. I said ""she may be expensive, but I'm [something I don't remember] "" and we laughed but she said ""you know what I do every night?!"" and she did some stupid thing because her mother had died or something. Then I was walking down another road. It was a long straight road, and I walked past a road to the left (like a T-junction) and a cop was parked on the side of the road. The road was now sandy and bumpy and this person was driving waiting to be out of sight of the police before picking me up. The cop came and ended up crashing. Then it was Freaks and Geeks and this had been a test. It showed one of the main female characters having sex with someone and then all the secondary characters were masturbating each other. I was like ""ok..."". Then Mom took me home. It was late, I think. Darren was in the car. I had to transfer some stuff I had downloaded. When I came back to Mom's, they were on porn sites. I was then watching Lost, but Laguerta (Dexter) was on it and she couldn't remember anything she did after getting in her car the night before. Then Ben and Juliet (both from Lost) were talking. I thought they were going to kiss and I was thinking 'ew, Ben's too cool for her'. Then Juliet was with some other guy. Laguerta remembered had seen the dude and had either had an affair with him, or had found out about one."
"2527"	"(2008-12-14 (17)) I was at school, which was different, with Mom and Ezra. It was pretty much empty. The ground started shaking and Brianna and Selena came out of nowhere and we all ran into this building, which was the girl's toilets and stood under the door frame. It shook a lot. Then it stopped and we went out and said it wasn't an earthquake. I said it was became they don't come in waves. I was thinking it was like Cloverfield. We went down to this place and I had to crawl through this vent and go through the teacher's area. I ended up in this shop/cinema. Ezra and I started grabbing bags and chocolates and water. Then I was in a shed place with some people. Shaun Micallef was there. He was going to talk to some guy. Mom was outside. It was night. I kept looking at the city waiting to see a Cloverfield like monster. Then Michael Stahl-David and some others were on a boat and they fell into the water. They drove the boat to some oxygen tank in the water. Then I was watching a movie. This guy had a scar on the right side of his face. He was talking to this guy in a pub, I think, and told him the story of how he got the scar with a few details omitted. He knew the guy he was talking to had given him the scar. Shortly after they almost got into a fight but then the guy said ""I'm Jack Lint"" and the guy was shocked and then was laughing evilly. The scar guy attacked him somehow."
"2528"	"(2008-12-14 (17)) We were getting takeaway for dinner. At around 2pm, Mom went to get it. I was watching a movie and doing stuff and got distracted. At 9pm I went out to see what was going on. Darren called her a cheat. She hadn't been back and no-one could get hold of her. I called her and on the second time she answered. She said her car had broken down. Later I was with her and she continued saying it was because her car had broken down, but she was acting nervous like. There were four really bright stars in the sky and I was trying to take a photo."
"2529"	"(2008-12-15 (17)) I had been going out with this hot guy and for some reason that I couldn't remember we had broken up a few weeks ago. Me, him and some friends were going out. We were all in this big toilet while some of the others got ready. He was there with a girl and he was hugging her and had his arms around her from the back and they were mucking around. I was at the wall and was bored. I slid down to the floor and put my water bottle on my head. Later, we were outside somewhere and Ezra was around. I was thinking that we should play Warcraft. We were talking about Crusades and our daily production on the game, but it wasn't really Crusades. The guy and I made up and he said he wasn't over me etc, but the girl he was with wouldn't leave him alone. I was sitting down in this forest and he walked past Elijah, who was sitting on a stump playing a guitar. He was playing the first few notes of a song. My guy friend said to him ""you won't [or will?] get her like that"". Elijah didn't know I was there. I remembered back to a while ago and we'd had sex and A World Without Love was playing. I was trying to remember why I had sex with him."
"2530"	"(2008-12-15 (17)) I was at home, out the back and these kittens kept coming inside. I would get one back out, but then another would come in. There were three black ones. I went inside and locked up and then saw Tigger swimming in the pool. I unlocked it and ran to her, but I couldn't grab her and I accidentally pushed her under. I tried to dive in, but I couldn't (I was like, floating upside down), so I swam under and she was at the bottom. I grabbed her and pushed her out the top. I got out and the pool tasted like Vital Green and I had some yellow sliver of slime on my leg. I put her inside and Ezra came and gave her a pat. I realized I was thirsty (I was in real life too) and got a drink. I noticed I had some dreams on the bench, so I grabbed them. There was an old envelope of mine and I opened it and there was a brand new, crispy $50 note in it. Dad mentioned a new Keanu Reeves movie called ""Klaatu"" coming out and I said ""Klaatu barada nikto, I've seen the original, I'm not interested in the remake"". I went to my laptop and I had a weird movie playing. The USB was plugged in and had random stuff on it. I had a 4.5gb ISO with Crash Palace on it. I didn't know what it was at first, but I played it and realized and was pretty excited about it. I decided to finish watching The English Patient. Then I decided to go to the shop. I walked there and only brought my water. I was wearing a tight-ish girl like shirt that was almost navy blue. I was near some girls in the shop and these other people came and they owned some alternative clothes shop, with clothes that no-one would wear and there were quite a few scattered throughout the shop, and dissed our clothes. I was walking down the same way they were and they said to be that ""it must be embarrassing walking around wearing that"" and I shouted ""it must be embarrassing walking around with that face!"". I walked back and went into this shop. It had a small entrance and this old lady was going in too, so I stopped and let her go first. When you first got in, there was a shelf full of DVD's. There were DVD's for Thank God You're Here and they had Shaun Micallef on the front, which I thought was odd since he was a guest star. There were DVD's for Lost, but they were in CD cases and the covers were boring. They had strips, the top one had Locke and the rest had the episode titles. There were four episodes per one. Point Break and another Keanu Reeves movie were on the shelf. There were a few other movies which I had decided to download last night. Across from that, were the video games. I was looking at them. This lady was following me around, watching. I had gotten a pack of little Easter eggs and was eating them. I had a plastic bag, that I was keeping them in. I realized I had forgotten my wallet and my phone. This business like lady was next to me, and I thought she was a vampire. She had dark red lipstick on and a black bag. I was going to ask her if I could use her phone but I decided not to. I asked the lady who was following me, since she worked there and told her I'd forgotten my phone and wallet. She brought me to a counter. They went on the computer and asked for my ""Netpay"" number. I said I didn't know what they were talking about, although I assumed it was something you get when you have a job, are over 18 etc. They said they had to make sure I could pay for the call. I saw the prices for some of them and it said ""1 x 9.05"" ($9.05 for one minute) and it was like $400 for a 30 minute call. I told them again I didn't know what they were talking about and that I'd just finished year 12 and was going to the Technical College/university next year (and therefore wasn't working or over 18). I got really upset saying that I only needed to call Mom so she can bring money because I ate one of the Easter eggs, which I ate because ""I haven't had chocolate for ages"". They said that they wouldn't let me go until I paid and I started shouting saying I needed to call Mom to be able to pay and that I just wanted to go home and finish watching ""a movie with Ralph Fiennes"". A bus pulled up full of old women, and Mom came in after them. She was wearing makeup and looked really gross. She came in and was sorting it out. I went to take the eggs out of the bag but it fell apart and they went everywhere. They said not to worry and I grabbed my water bottle from the counter. I was crying and said that ""I'm never coming here again!"" and I was thinking that I was never going to go the shop on my own again either. I woke up with tears in my eyes too."
"2531"	"(2008-12-16 (17)) Some people had some disease like thing. Supposedly, 85% of people had the initial stage of it, but only 17% of them actually had it. You got powers. I got tested. Later I was in a study with a girl. She asked if I had a sore stomach and I said no. I kept making that weird throat burping noise. She was worried that I'd gone through some door, but I didn't. I was then at a hotel place. This guy and I helped out there. He had powers. We were with other people like that. These three guys, who were kind of ugly, came and one of them looked at this girl and fell in love with her. To distract the hotel staff, the guy took them out into the woods outside. Because of this, I had to go back to Mom's. I didn't want to though because my computer was here. I went into my room there and I had Sims 2 loading on my computer and I turned down the music and then shut down Sims 2 because the people were just outside the window. I called Mom to say not to pick me up. She asked if Aster and Cody were there. I said I'd check. I knocked on the door of a room and Aster (Dexter) answered and I said ""I didn't even know you were here, you could have starved to death this weekend"". I started talking to Mom again but she wasn't talking. I then got a photo of her lying on the ground with vomit like stuff around her mouth. I had to leave."
"2532"	"(2008-12-16 (17)) I was at a shop. Mom was in a little on there and I went to a big one, like Big W. Reiner was following me and asked if I had money and I said no. He said he wanted to do some deal but they wanted to see money. He kept following me so I brought him to Mom. She sent him away. She was eating princess cake and saved some for me. We went to leave and went to the carpark. We walked down this slope, but it was the wrong platform, so we walked back up and around to the right one. The car was in the corner with a smashed car just near it. It had a hole in the back window and a dead cat shoved in it. Mom's car also had a dead cat in it. She said it was probably from some teenagers who I'd had a disagreement with. I said I wanted to get out of here. The eyes of the car were in the roof and we couldn't get it out. Then I was watching Grey's Anatomy. George looked different. This girl started waking up in different places and speaking with a Southern accent. Then I was watching South Park and Kyle saw this pregnant woman and decided he wanted an abortion. He took a tablet (which was how you had an abortion) and then there was a preview for the next episode of Heroes. Sylar was making funny jokes. I said he was cool in season 1, but was lame now. He woke up in a different time and saw a younger version of himself on a swing."
"2533"	"(2008-12-17 (17)) I was in a classroom looking place. Sayid (Lost) was teaching me and some others something. Locke (Lost) was one of them. Everyone else got bored and left, saying he was a bad teacher. I stayed and I thought he was pretty good."
"2534"	"(2008-12-17 (17)) I was doing a quest on Runescape. I had to fight this hard demon/dragon which hit like 18's at first. I couldn't log out while doing the quest, so I just left it logged in at this place for hours. I had my axe with me so I went back to the bank and couldn't find my whip or battle axe. Then in real life, I had to do an exam. I couldn't find the stuff I needed for that either. I had two pieces of vegemite toast. It was 38 minutes past whatever time, and I was late. Earlier, I was at home and Mom had been on my Runescape account and I asked her how she got in when she didn't know my password. She said she did and I said what is it then and she said ""I love Eugene"" and I went quiet and asked how she knew that and she wouldn't tell me. I said that I used crushes for passwords. Ezra and Dad were there too."
"2535"	"(2008-12-18 (17)) I was at Nana's. Poppers had gotten a car by ""ad-bibbly"" and it was blue. We were outside, in the patio area. Margarita was there and I think she mentioned some new song and I called her an idiot. I got up and she noticed I was wearing my Beatles shirt and she said ""Well, you like The Beatles!"" and I said ""Yeah, they're only considered the greatest band ever by everyone"". I was then watching Lord of the Rings, but it was different. Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen fell into some water. The others were trying to get over a mountain so they didn't know they had fallen. They were standing on a ledge just above the water. Viggo had a thing for the mountain. Orlando was complaining and then Viggo took down his pants and Orlando went quiet. They went into the water and steps inside a cave. It was then me and I walked up the steps and was then at a school with some others on a balcony outside a classroom. There were little kids with guns on the ground shooting, but not with real bullets but they still hurt. I hid behind a pillar. Later I was with Mom and Ezra in the car. A song was on and I was guessing the words but then realized it was a different version of a song I liked. I knew all the words. They put on some new song and it was a Snoop Dogg song. Ezra showed me the clip and Snoop just stood there waving his hands around. They also played Game of Love. I was then in a car with a guy and we were playing Warcraft, or talking about it. We were in a pro players game, but he was more of a noob than me. There were security guards outside."
"2536"	"(2008-12-18 (17)) I was at Mom's and there were kittens. I had to pick one of them from each lot. This was where we had gotten Cuddles and Gizmo (and when, it was in the past). There were four that I liked from one bunch and I ended up deciding on Gizmo, and then I was choosing Cuddles."
"2537"	"(2008-12-19 (17)) There was an amnesiac old woman walking on the street. Mom wanted to help her. I went home and looked up what to do with amnesiacs walking on the road. Dad's computer was turned off. Someone was playing some sex game. Dad was on my laptop and I remembered about my Chris Barrie desktop."
"2538"	"(2008-12-19 (17)) My notes are extremely messy and I can barely read any of it. The photos from school were back. There were photos of me when I was younger and we had group photos. I had pigtails and was laughing. Johanna was in them and was fat then too. I had to do this drama thing. We only had to do a little bit, but then the guy decided to make us do two. We had to do something with these guys. They sent us to a balcony to get to know each other. There were two lots of chairs and this guy went to my chair. There was a lady doing tricks in a plane, it caught fire and hit the ground. It exploded and just missed the building behind it, which a heap of people were in. Ezra was there. I said something about it."
"2539"	"(2008-12-19 (17)) I was in a shop. There were those big bouncy ball things that you sit on and bounce around. There were black ones. It had this weird plastic bit on it and I couldn't work out what to do with it. This Asian-y guy I was friends with was there. Someone said that it had that bit to stop people from molesting kids. The Asian-y guy said that it didn't stop him -- he had just gotten out of jail."
"2540"	"(2008-12-20 (17)) I was playing a game online. I was playing the trial version and it let you have a free copy of a book which had something to do with a shadow suitcase. I was watching this 'early' clip of Entourage that had Paula Abdul in it but she was really young and I thought it must've been from the 80's. Ari was played by some British guy who was hitting on some girls in a pub. Eric and Vince were the same. I said ""if Ari looked like that, I probably would have never watched it"" and I was thinking Jeremy Piven was hoter than that dude. The characters were boring which I thought was probably due to the lack of the real Ari. Mom was talking about Calvin and she asked why I never ""got friends off Autumn"". Ezra said something about I Want Your Love and then it was playing on the radio and I was singing along."
"2541"	"(2008-12-20 (17)) I was watching a movie called Dog Wars, sometimes it was real. It was night. These people were taken on a boat to a creepy dark place. They had a young girl who looked like Conchita Campbell and the bad guys took her away from them. I don't know what they did with everyone else. I was in a workshop like building in the middle of the bush. First I was alone in there with Robert Downey Jr. I had known him for a while and I was going out with Eugene. He had his shirt off and was trying to convince me to be with him instead. I went to the door to leave, but it was locked. He put his arm around me and kissed me. I pulled away, but his grip was tight, so I rested my head on his chest and couldn't decide what to do. Then there were these two guys in there and they had caught me and were watching me. I had been talking to them and they were hesitant about giving me up. Another bad guy was coming to check on them, so I rolled under this bed that was now there. He came in and asked one of the guys who'd he'd been with. He pointed to Robert, who was lying on a lounge, and said him. Robert smiled and battered his eyelids at him. It was then becoming daylight and the bad guys began running around madly, with fangs sticking out. I realized they were vampires and they were hissing and trying to get underground before the sun was all the way up. Conchita Campbell was under there and was now a vampire. She had dark hair and lips. She found out something about what they did to the others she was with, and she got angry and left. One of the head vampires pressed a button released all these monsters to capture or maybe kill the people there (including me). Conchita found it and turned it off, but it actually just released more. It was night time again. We made a trail leading them onto this boat. Most of them went into it and then we blew them up. A few strays were coming towards us. I had a lighter and I had to light this thing to get this monster coming towards me. I was too scared to use it and I was with a girl and she didn't know how to use the lighter, so I did it, but it was easy and I wasn't too close to the flame. We blew up the thing we were lighting up, but the monster backed away for a second and continued coming at us. It was only moving slowly as it was big. We were throwing stuff at it. It was then day and I was running down this street and I was trying to make cars hit it, but they swerved. I got to the end of the street and saw it walk up a driveway, into the garage. I quickly got around the corner and peeked around to see if it was coming. It came out and walked back the other way. I thought they were going to follow me somehow to find out where I lived, instead of just killing me now, so I walked down this other street. There was a park next to it. This guy called Wolf, who had a squishy face and looked like Sam Trammell, was there talking with some other guys. They had had two people in this swing at different times and both times they had escaped, so they suspected one of the bad guys was actually a 'spy'. They saw me and I had been another prisoner and escaped and they accused Wolf of being the spy. He showed them the swing and was proving to them that they had gotten out themselves. One of them then found sand under a nut on this metal bit, which meant it had been rigged by someone. I don't know if it was him though. I was reading the forum on IMDb later. Someone was asking some questions. One of them was that Wolf had said ""yesterday my father didn't exist"" and they wanted to know who his father was. A reply was that he was the guy ""kissing Medusa"" at the beginning of the movie and was turned to stone. The movie was made in 1994."
"2542"	"(2008-12-21 (17)) I was with Mom and Ezra in the car on our way to see someone pretty far away. All of a sudden she said ""Oh shit, SHIT!"" and I was wondering what the hell was going on. She was stopped on a patch of grass just off the road. I was sitting in the front and Ezra was in the seat behind me. A cop came to Ezra's window and knocked. Mom was hiding her stuff and then opened his window. He told us to get out because he was going to search the car. He handcuffed Mom to the car and we had to stand up against this fence. I didn't know what happened, but as we got back in the car Mom said he'd found some, but let her off with a warning. There was more in her shoe. The whole area was covered in cops."
"2543"	"(2008-12-21 (17)) We were in the car. I had some Red Dwarf shoes. Darren needed to do something with shoes because of something with his feet. My shoes were size 11 and his were 13. Mom was in the car too. Then I was looking at some Chris Barrie thing. He'd had an accident with another guy in the water. They had fallen in and he accidentally got an octopus killed and the other guy had hit two dolphins. I jumped in to save them, but all the animals were dead. Chris had lost his wedding ring. I saw it on the floor and the creepy crawly was near it so I moved it out of the way and picked it up and took it to the surface, although I really didn't want to touch it. Later, I was drying him with a towel. This person asked how we knew each other and we said ""friends"". He was kind of fat and had a couple of chins."
"2544"	"(2008-12-22 (17)) I, along with some others my age, had to do some Thank God You're Here type of thing. We were doing these interviews with Bill Clinton. He had a really strong accent and I could barely understand him. There were bright lights on us and there was a bit of an audience. I was really nervous. He asked a question and I said ""huh?"" and he repeated it and I thought it had something to do with driving and speed limits and the end was ""what would you do?"" and I didn't want to ask him to repeat again so I said ""slow down"", which would have been a good answer if I'd heard properly, but I hadn't, so they sort of gave up. I think I finished it, but I don't remember the rest. After we finished, we left. I ended up at this food place at the beach. Nana was there with some kids. There was water underneath the tables (like there were holes in the boardwalk). We followed Fido who was sniffing around, assuming he'd pick a safe one. A person had a tape of all the sketches we'd done and was showing Nana. There was one with a person who'd poke you and you had to say stuff. I looked under a curtain and saw feet. One that I was involved in was in a pet shop, and I was actually pretty funny in it. I thought the dogs were toys, but they weren't. At the end we did something else, but I can't remember. This guy had a mirror and made his shiny, which made mine black and I was trying to get the right surface back. At some point, Ezra, Mom and I were in a field like area. There was a shiny yellow creature and Ezra kept throwing it at me along with other stuff. I got upset and was saying ""you're hurting it!"". We went into a building and we had gone in there earlier disguised as workers of some sort to turn off an electric field. We were now turning it back on. I was crying and trying to wipe the tears off my face. We walked up the stairs and turned it on. Later, it was late and Mom and I went for a drive. We pulled over on the side of a short side street. It was dark and spooky so we locked our doors. There were towels. The lady came and Mom threw it into her car and she threw the money. It missed the window and went over the car and into a drain behind the car. The drain was on an angle and was big, so I reached in and managed to get it. The lady was amazed we had gotten it. We left and Mom was speeding and then she saw cops. She turned down a street and they came around another way. We drove into a shop and then back out onto the street. They were called to the shop, which distracted them, but we didn't realize and went back in, thinking they were coming back at us. We were knocking some clothes racks down trying to get out. Then I went in as a witness and they asked if the licence ended in ""251"" and I said no there was a 2 and a 3 and so they let us go."
"2545"	"(2008-12-22 (17)) I was at a shop and we were trying to spend the $50 gift voucher. There was a Runescape dictionary there, which was fairly old. I picked up some educational book. I was there with Mom. I had to go to the toilet. There were Eddie Murphy posters and stuff all around the shop. I turned the corner and saw Midge Ure and this black guy sitting at a table signing autographs. Midge had one ear pierced and his lip pierced which annoyed me, but I was excited that he was there and so I was going to get Mom so I could meet him."
"2546"	"(2008-12-23 (17)) I was at school, which was at North Midvale, in the classroom. The kids in the class were mucking around and nothing was happening so I put my head down to rest and teacher gave me a warning. I asked why and she gave me two more. I said that people were mucking around and I decided to rest and I get in trouble? She gave me a note to see the principal and I threw it on the ground and she said that I'd be better off walking home and I said that I was. She followed me until I got past the gate and gave up. I was then walking on the path and I was like 6 or so. There were other kids around that age watching Bob the Builder on the path. I was thinking it was lame. Eugene was there and said it was lame too. He was young as well. Some time later, we were at his house and I was going through some photos. His brother Rodney and father Abraham were there. I was hoping to befriend him now so I could go out with him in the future. There were photos of me too. I kept going to ask questions about computers, but remembered they weren't up to the same standard yet."
"2547"	"(2008-12-23 (17)) I was watching the third movie of a Will Smith trilogy. He was in some red armour suit thing and I was like ""It's Iron Man!"" He was protecting a lighthouse from some creatures. He was like, the last man on Earth or something. It would pretty much mean the end of the world if the creatures got to the lighthouse. Then it was Eugene. We had been going out, but I was dead now. He was in the building and there were sleep tanks behind him. The people in them looked burnt. He was upset and couldn't be bothered about the creatures. As a last resort he could use this thing to go into space and hopefully find a planet to live on. First, he broke this big statue thing outside and there was a bright light which made the creatures obey him for 40 minutes. He ordered them to get this thing ready but didn't tell them what it was for. Later on, the creatures noticed cars driving around and realized he was tricking them and decided to rebel. Eugene was in the building still, talking to me saying he loved me and missed me etc. Then there was a flashback. I went into an elevator. The doors wouldn't close at first. Then they did but it wasn't moving and I thought something was wrong. I banged on the door yelling ""Sandra!"" and I wondered why I wasn't calling out 'Eugene'. It started getting hot in there. I had discovered the creatures were actually dodgy and so they were trying to kill me to 1) upset Eugene and 2) get rid of the evidence. I realized it was the creatures trying to kill me so I quickly set to work. I had a screw in my pocket, which was used as a screwdriver and used it to unscrew the screws off this metal plate in the wall. I remember unscrewing each screw and it getting hoter with each one. I was sweating and wiping the sweat off my forehead. I took out some papers out of an A4 size envelope and was putting them into another one. There were about four of the big envelopes and the papers were evidence against the creatures. I was moving them so they would get rid of what they thought was the evidence, and Eugene would get the actual evidence. There was also a small hole in the roof, which could only fit a few fingers. Then it cut to Eugene. I wanted to be alive and since they didn't show me die, I was worried I survived and I said ""They can't bring me back to life!""."
"2548"	"(2008-12-23 (17)) I was watching a bit of Twilight. Edward and Bella were in the forest and I was thinking that the movie was lame [last night, I'd been flicking through it, thinking it was lame] . I had read something which Kristen Stewart who said that Robert Pattinson was a bad kisser. In an interview she was demonstrating the kiss. She made a noise, a pause and then a snotty sound and that's what the kissing was like. I was like 'ok...'."
"2549"	"(2008-12-24 (17)) I was walking down the street and there were lots of African kids were walking about. One of them, about three years old, hit me and said ""tag, you're it"" and I said ""I'm not playing!"". I kept getting tagged though. I was then at a shop and it had a section with a TV and chairs. It was called 'Cinema for Convenience'. People from school were there. Then there was a house or something there and it was getting blown up because there was a bad guy there. I had something there too, which was getting blown up. I was hiding behind the chairs. This girl got told a code and mimed it to me and I couldn't read her mouth and I asked her again and she whispered it, it was ""7355"". Some people noticed me hiding but were too busy dealing with the bad guy. I grabbed a big box of Ferrero Rocher and was going to pay for it with the school's money, since they were expensive. The thing got blown up and then we left. I grabbed a box of wafer sticks as we went out. I forgot to pay at the checkout and security came. I used the card to pay, using the code 7355. There was only a limited amount of money though and I couldn't afford the wafer sticks so took them back and got given a marshmallow chocolate instead. We weren't allowed back to the cinema and there was a wall in the way now. It was night. Mom and Ezra were waiting outside in the car."
"2550"	"(2008-12-25 (17)) I was on a computer and checking on my 'hot or not' quiz. Darren had been the last person to take it. The quiz wasn't the same though; there were actually a bunch of smaller ones, with say, 10 questions. Each question either had two pictures of the same person or two pictures of different people and you pick the one you like more. The one Darren had taken had some celebrity woman called Elene [insert foreign Greek-y name] . He had only answered two questions and had ended up with 4%. One of his answers was 'hot', the other 'not'. Mom was saying that Elene was pretty ugly. Then I was at home. Dad and Ezra were there. Dad had all this fresh breakfast food such as bread, but Ezra asked for McDonald's breakfast and Dad complained. My laptop was different. Dad had this ultra spiffy version which had 'toolbars' everywhere, which made it really confusing. At some point, we were in the car and Ezra was in the back. Ezra mentioned two movies from 2006, one of which was The Departed and I said ""Not only are they both from 2006, they both contain Matt Damon!"". I couldn't remember what the other movie was though. I was on a computer later, checking all the movies I watched in 2006."
"2551"	"(2008-12-26 (17)) It was the future/just different. People had to be under a certain level of intelligence [watched an episode of The Twilight Zone last night like that] . We had to take tests. There were lots of Asians around. There were a bunch of people who had cheated on the test and I was one of them and we were 'rebels' against the Government or something. I was in a taxi with Mom and Darren. We were all sitting in the back. I saw Samantha walking down a road, near her house (she had a 10-15 minute walk) and I thought they were going to get her, but they didn't. Ezra was now there and he asked why she wasn't at University and I said ""University hasn't started yet nub"". The driver was Asian. I had this male Asian friend."
"2552"	"(2008-12-26 (17)) I was at Nana's. Ezra, Dad and I were there. I could turn into Fido, but I don't know where he was [yesterday we went up there and we didn't see Fido at all] . Ezra didn't know about it. He was starting to get suspicious that Fido wasn't actually Fido though. There was a pond with weird steps scattered around it. I was sitting on it and he scared me off and I ran. I ran with my tongue hanging out as it helped to keep going. I tried to hide the female parts of the dog. Ariana was inside and had a box of toys. She almost knocked it over. I had to quickly run out of the house and ran out the front, as a dog."
"2553"	"(2008-12-26 (17)) I think a bunch of us were swimming. People kept dying. Someone would bring them to the shore. Sometimes it was a movie. This girl decided to bring this guy back to life. It cut to a few days later and he now looked old, say 50-60. It turned out if you brought them back to life they aged ""5 years a day"" (although he had been a teenager and it wasn't that long after). They were in a library and the girl was sitting down. Her father was pretending that he was his gay partner and he held his hand while they talked. I was thinking he was kind of hot, but mainly his personality. It was then a shop. I was there with some friends, including the guy. I worked there and I put some stuff on a counter and asked Autumn to look after it, but this guy went there and I said ""No, I asked Autumn"" but left. I wasn't wearing a bra so went to the aisle where I'd hidden it, which was in which the multiple power socket board things and grabbed one of them too and some other stuff. A lady there said ""Yeah, get your bra"". I went to an aisle near my counter to get changed. I moved two of the aisles into a V shape so no-one could see. This guy wandered into it though and grabbed the cord of the power board. I grabbed the socket end and starting hitting him in the face with it. Eventually he left. I was then standing with some friends, behind a guy on a computer. Someone asked me something to answer with and I said ""I like pretty chicken"". This guy thought it was hilarious and that 'pretty' sounded so ""female"". I said it must be because I have had Pretty Rave Girl stuck in my head. As I said it, I realized the guy on the computer, who was on Windows Media Player, had Pretty Rave Girl at the top of his playlist. A while later I was looking for something and the aisles had changed. A group of guys started following me on the other side of the aisles. They ended up cornering me and started attacking me (trying to take my clothes off and stuff). I yelled out a guy friend's name, which started with an 'S'. I was kicking and fighting and other people joined in too. I got away from them and we caught them. We had them tied up at two ends of the store, outside. The outside of the store, was actually outside. We were sitting under a tree with 6 of the guys and the other two were alone at the other end. One of those guys ran off, but we let him go. This lady came to us and she was really dodgy looking. She had black hair, black eye makeup and a weird accent. She asked to sit with us and if we let her she'd give us this oddly shaped banana. A guy friend took it and I shook my head at him as I thought there was a gun in it. I never found out if there was. She made us play this game, which played out live. It was very nice looking. You started on this ship thing which was on an island. I went into this building straight ahead of it. You fought monsters, collected gold and got experience etc. I was searching around for a while and I eventually got to a 'boss' fight. I had to fight a bunch of people. I killed them all and they dropped a special sword. I had to join it to this thin blue sword thing, which I found in a room in the building I was in. I joined them and it became useable. Lots of the people playing were dead at this point, including the girl who had invited us to play. Three of us were left now. I had a pretty high score, but was coming second. My character had spiffy armour and cape etc, which was all black. After beating that, I started at the start again and decided to go down this path. There was a big house on the left side and there were a lot of trees and plants on either side of the path and was very green. The house was spooky, so I kept walking. I walked to the end, where there was a little square patch with rubble of a building that was once there."
"2554"	"(2008-12-27 (17)) I can't remember what I was looking at, but it was either a picture or a video and Maggie Grace was in it and was very shiny and had a silver-ish tint."
"2555"	"(2008-12-27 (17)) I was watching a movie with Dad with was a low budget science fiction movie. This young explorer dude, who was ok looking, was in a desert like jungle. I don't know what the plot was. I was reading the trivia for it on IMDb and it said that he was the ""former front man of Poison"". I can't remember what it was name was, but it was three words. I asked Dad what it meant by 'former' as that would make him 16 when Poison was around, but this was right. The movie was made in the mid 90's. It turned out that Dad and Ezra knew him and he was still young. Then I was at 'school', on an oval wearing a cheerleading outfit, which looked like the Christmas outfit on Runescape. I was walking across to leave and wondering why I was doing cheerleading. I remembered it was because I hadn't done something else and so had to this instead. I was waiting in an undercover area near a carpark. Eugene was there. He said ""Mom"" and proceeded to talk to this woman with short, blonde hair and I got my phone out to take a photo of her, but silent wasn't on and as I turned it off, she walked off. She had a pram with a baby in it and I wondered what its name was. Dmitri poked his head around from the carpark. I walked across the carpark and was waiting on the other side looking for the Poison dude's car. Eventually he and Ezra came out, but the car was weird and I only had like 20cm to sit in, so he was going to come back and pick me up with a helicopter from the roof of my 'house' or building. So I wondered how I was supposed to get there. I got there somehow. I went inside and it now a game, probably Runescape. I clicked on the stairs to walk up and I got to the roof and said I could just teleport anywhere now (as I now had access to my bank and therefore my runes). We could decorate our roof, so he was checking all of them out. My building was called 'Hello' and had a word similar to hello with ""fuching"" in the middle of the word on the roof. Someone had an Invader Zim themed one. He said he liked mine. This dude on MSN called me ""the sunlight llama"". It was 2am. He tried to do webcam and/or microphone with me, so I put my status to offline. The Poison guy had to pick 7 out of 36 girls that he liked most and go on dates with them. I wasn't one of them, but he picked me."
"2556"	"(2008-12-28 (17)) I was playing some odd game. I had to climb up these tunnels, using pillows to propel me. The next area I had to go into, someone else was there and they were stuck. I didn't want to go in, incase I forgot stuff that I needed and got stuck. Then we went to Nana's and we were in the lounge room near the front door. It was night. She had a present there for Granny, but Ezra opened it and it had shoes in it and he sketched a 'gamer' insult on it. Nana was upset about it. We saw Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and Poppers pull up outside. We went to a shop. I was looking at the shoes, to replace the ones Ezra had ruined. Mom said she was going to a different shop for that. I was looking for the men's clothes section. Mom asked a guy and he said it was around the corner. Then it was no longer a shop, but a 'fun' place, like a museum/amusement park thing. There were rooms with different themed activities. Gizmo was in a room. Ezra was riding around on a little wooden bike, so I went and got one."
"2557"	"(2008-12-29 (17)) I was at Mom's. Ezra said that Samantha and some others were trapped in my room as the wind had shut the door closed. I went up and he got the door open and I was like ""What the hell are you doing in my room?!"". Samantha came out, holding a baseball bat, worried I was going to attack her. I had a metal pole and I hit her with it. Adelynn was hanging around my computer. I was worried Samantha had read my diary and knew that I liked Dmitri, but remembered she already knew anyway and I was thinking 'She knows about Eugene! No!'. I told Adelynn to get away and get out and I hit her with the pole. She slowly waddled out. I had been making ""breakfast, lunch, dinner, whatever you call it"" in the kitchen. It was cereal and in a black garbage bag. Samantha had put bottles in it, which ruined it. I pulled them out and some had stuff still in them. While I was facing the sink, Samantha splashed me with a little bit of it, sort of spitefully/bitchy. I wasn't supposed to have noticed, but I did so I splashed her back with a little bit, and then I found a bottle half full and poured the whole thing over her. I pushed her out the front door. Adelynn was in the hallway and I was closer to my room. She was teasing me because she was ""going to get work"" and I said sarcastically ""because you did well on your IB?"" (She didn't do IB). Then she said I was fat and I said ""look at you!"" and she started running out of insults and I pushed her with the pole and whacked her with it. I got her outside and she kept trying to come in. We had this barrier outside the house, which was in the middle of a field and the barrier was a fair way away, but she managed to pass the barrier."
"2558"	"(2008-12-29 (17)) I was at a cinema with Eugene, who was my boyfriend. I got up and went to the counter and you could buy raffle tickets there. You had to guess what Dean (Supernatural) had mimed, if anything, in an episode. The proceeds went to charity. I bought one and then went back. There was a guy and a girl behind the counter. A few minutes later, I discovered I had won. The prize was a million dollar diamond ring. I didn't want to get it, but since I could sell it, I went to collect. I said to the guy behind the counter, ""You can have it for $200"". I went back and the rest of the cinema found out. Some congratulated me, and some were eyeing me and I was thinking they were going to steal it. We were walking down the steps outside and this guy was walking towards us. He had been hired to pickpocket it off me, but I thought he was dodgy so I took it out and swapped it with something. It later showed him holding a box of tampons (what he had stolen) and said ""damn it!"". We were then back in the cinema, which was empty and the checkout people were after me. Eugene grabbed me and took me down between the seats to hide. Some time later, we decided to leave the country as they weren't going to stop. I left Eugene with the real one and took a fake one with me. I drove out to a lake, with the people following me. I called him and asked if it was all ok and he said he had the real one ""under the tree"" (It was Christmas). The people were catching up to me and I was on a bridge. I drove the car off into the water. It sank pretty quickly and I was holding my breath. I said a code into the phone which blew off one of the doors. I then said another code and the other door blew off and then the car glided quickly away. I swam up under the bridge, and there wasn't much space to breathe (I could pretty much fit my nose and barely my mouth). The person was nearby, as I could see her on my mini map. I could read minds. I swam a little bit away from the bridge and came out of the water and I said something and she jumped in. Now she was the French woman from Lost. She just went straight underwater and didn't come up, and I didn't get what she was doing. Then I was watching Pushing Daisies and the woman knew she was in a dream. Ned realized and managed to get out of it. I was thinking that it wasn't a bad episode. They had been copying popular stories for most of the show instead of making real storylines. Mom had made me a baked bean toasted sandwich. I had a cat on my lap."
"2559"	"(2008-12-30 (17)) I was with this guy I liked, who was Sam (Supernatural). We were in a forest and we had to get a snake out of this cage to prove who had killed someone. The snake cage was about a meter long and half a meter high and was inside a bigger cage, at the top. The bigger cage was made of a softer mesh and had plants in it, through the mesh and on the ground. It was very green. Before we could get to the snake, we had to find and get this lizard which was in the big cage. We finally found the lizard and Sam said ""go away monkey"" and it leapt off the fence and bounded away into the forest (it was actually a monkey). He said that Sawyer (Lost) must've come in here during the night and swapped the lizard with a monkey. Sawyer was the main suspect. I wondered out loud what the lizard had to do with the snake. Sam didn't know either. The snake cage was now up higher. Before, it was just above our heads, now we had to climb up these oddly placed boards. I accidentally climbed onto a board away from the proper ones. The drop below was pretty far and I had to jump across and it was a bit of a jump. I managed to get half of myself onto and Sam pulled me onto it. The snake cage was now back to the height it was before and we were standing on the ground. The snake was sleeping, so Sam opened it, grabbed it and quickly threw it out of the bigger cage. He stared for a second and then told me to run. We started running through the forest and the snake was chasing us. Then it was third person view and Dean (Supernatural) was also there. My back started hurting and Sam stopped and made sure I was ok. I freaked out about the snake and ran off and through this dark patch of trees, which was also quite clear (the trees were thin) because I didn't want to go in the light. We were then in a building. Dean got a 'hunch' and walked off but then he was Sam. He had a vision and the building slowly faded away and looked like a dark forest. This dark lady with bulgy eyes in a dress started talking to him. Back in the building, he was saying stuff out loud from the vision. What he said gave away the identity of the killer. But, the building was now a police station and they had already arrested the bad guy. The lady from the vision was actually a cross-dresser or something and was the killer. Then Sam was someone else and they told the police to ""check the panel van"" as in the vision he had seen the killer kill a wife and a daughter and had left clues of it being from a snake to cover it up. Then the guy who had seen the vision was shaking his head and saying ""I'm a cross dresser"". He thought he was wearing the dress the lady had been wearing, but he wasn't. I was like 'ok...'. Then it was episode of Kenny vs. Spenny, although I only remember seeing Spenny. I wondered what the competition was."
"2560"	"(2008-12-31 (17)) I was at school, which was different. I was there to repeat Year 12. There were lots of others there, including Calvin, Eugene and a lot of IB students were actually there to do a post-IB thing. Calvin remembered about Eugene suddenly and said ""Eugene Pritchard!"" and I was like ""damn it!"". Daryl was nearby and he knew about the joke and chuckled. Later, Eugene was sitting near me and his bum was close to my face. He had a black stain on his pants and I pointed it out to Calvin and he started joking behind his back and adding people to his city on My City (Facebook game). Eugene turned around and was like ""what's going on?"" but he was smiling and laughing a little. I laughed and said that there was ""only seven to go"" (only seven residents to add before we ran out)."
"2561"	"(2008-12-31 (17)) I'm not sure where I was. Eugene was there with some other people I knew. There was a game and we had to battle some weird monsters. In real life, went to a 'chemist' and no-one was there. From the door we came in, there was a shelf of chocolates to the right of the counter. This old lady came and was talking to them. I got two packs of M&M's -- a peanut one and a normal one and put them behind a small statue at the front of the counter. The lady went out and we saw her through the window talking to a guy and a friend told us to run, so we ran. We got to this pool thing, which had flat seats to sit at (like they usually have at pools, going up steps, except this one was just by itself) and as we ran in I hit my leg on the edge of one, which hurt. I sat on this ledge with a guy friend of mine. I had a dream in my pocket, which I was worried was going to fall into the pool, so took it out and put it in my book, which I put somewhere safe. It was hard to balance. Later, I wanted chocolate so I went back to the chemist. No-one was there again. The peanut pack of M&M's was torn open. I grabbed a normal pack off the shelf and threw it so it skidded across the floor and out the front door. No alarm sounded so I figured it was ok. Later, Ezra got in trouble for stealing a car. I was sitting down with headphones on. No music was playing, but it made everything a lot harder to hear. Mom was talking to me. She then said that she had been told I'd stolen a smoke from the chemist. I said ""What? I took a pack of M&M's"", she sighed, upset that I'd stolen, but then I said ""I left $3 on the counter because I figured that'd be enough"" she nodded and said it would've been enough. I said since no-one was there, that was all I could do."
"2562"	"(2009-01-01 (17)) I got a booklet in the mail as I'd signed up with some job site that sent alerts with what jobs were available. There was a job at Video Ezy in Innaloo and so I was going to call tomorrow about it. I was at home and it was late at night. Mom was there. We went to some place near the city. Daryl was there and he was talking to someone about how you can tell ""what someone watches"" or plays etc. They mentioned Smallville and I said that I watched it and they looked at each other in surprise and then asked about Supernatural and I said I watched that too and then some Anime thing and I said no and they nodded expectantly. They asked about something and I said ""yeah, I mean Pet Society"" and I said I didn't play it anymore. I told Mom we'd met ages ago -- when we were teenagers. I didn't know when that was though, and wondered why I said teenagers, since we were still teenagers and I got him confused with someone. In the distance, I saw a fire. It actually turned out to be close and was coming closer. We were then in the car with Mom and she drove up this hill to get away and there was more fire up there. We drove around for a little while and Daryl grabbed my hand at one point and I tried to pull away but he wouldn't let go, so I just let him hold it. We were then standing outside on a street. Lightning was randomly hitting trees. Mom was judging when they were going to fall and we'd run. We got to this oval and there was a building on it. People were playing sport, and it was raining but no-one seemed to notice. We climbed up the stairs on the building and then Mom said it was going to clear up. Daryl said that in the class we had next, to sit next to him. Then I was in this class. Ezra was in it. We were on the computer and the teacher was yelling at us. I had heaps of $100 notes to look after. The tables were really small. I think the teacher had her name on the board and I said ""your name's spelt wrong"". An 'I' was missing, then a 'C'. She got me a bigger table as I couldn't fit properly into mine. Ezra had been sitting next to me, but it was now Emery. We had to some thing in pairs. I can't remember properly, but we had to jump from these crates in the water. There were eels in there. I fell in and was trying to get out to get away from the eels. Also, I had to some swimming thing in a pool. Dad was there. It had something to do with IB."
"2563"	"(2009-01-01 (17)) I was at Mom's, in her room and Ezra opened the cupboard door and showed me Mittens sitting in there. I couldn't remember why she was here."
"2564"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) I went to the shop with Mom. She bought some expensive thing and I got a little hook thing for my wall. At the checkout the lady said it came to some amount ""plus 1000"". As we left I asked if my hook had cost $1000 and Mom said no it only cost $1.50. As we were going to the carpark, we walked past a black van that was pulled up on some grass next to the carpark which was for a radio station. I walked past to go to the car and Mom walked towards it. I saw Hamish Blake and another guy walking towards it. I looked back when I was almost at the car and they were looking over my way. I was then in the car and they came over singing to this girl, asking her why she didn't come over, and she was laughing and embarrassed. They came over to my side of the car and touched the door doing a funny dance, which made it lock. I discovered the other guy was Merrick Watts. They were messing outside for a while and I was trying not to laugh. I was thinking I should get a photo with them but I thought it seemed too dodgy to ask. They gave a girl from school some Cheeto's and Lillian asked for a couple and the girl just handed her the packet angrily. Lillian was like ""I'd love to get chips off them"". I was then at Mom's, which was different. I woke up and I went to get something to eat. I found chocolate biscuits and chocolate and stuff in the fridge, which I got excited about. There were Spongebob toys on the bench. Mom said they were cool."
"2565"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) I was at home except it had a lot of windows. We were leaving for school. I was outside and the car was on the grass. The window for my room was on that side of the house and I realized I left my light on. I asked Dad, who was inside, to turn it off. He complained under his breath. When he came out I said I'd get in the car when it was off the lawn so I didn't get prickles. Then we were all playing Warcraft, except it was totally different. Swarms would come towards you, but you had to protect houses on the streets from them. Mom and someone were taking the next spawn. I told them not to worry about it because the last guy would get them, but then I realized this spawn were 'elephants' (which were big blue elephant balloons) and they were coming towards our house (they bounced on the houses and smashed them). I looked in through the window and saw my computer and I was freaking out. I could see I was halfway through typing up a dream as well. They got them all though."
"2566"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) We had this really small rectangle patch of grass in the road to later build a house on. I was looking at it, trying to work out how we were going to fit any kind of house on it. I asked Dad what kind of house they could build and he mentioned a cartoon character, which was a reference to the latest episode of South Park that I had randomly decided to watch recently (in the dream). There was a path over it too and I asked if we were allowed to remove it and they said yeah. Mom's house wasn't too far away from it. I discovered Jeremiah lived in front of the patch. Dad had also left some Christmas presents out the front of Eugene's house. They came outside and he called out to them and they just looked at him funny and didn't say anything. I said they were probably wondering why you left them presents and he nodded in agreement. I was then at a house. I was watching TV and there was a knock at the door and I can't remember who it was. Mom and Darren then got back."
"2567"	"(2009-01-02 (17)) There was a new video of Sims 3. This guy put one of each different part to make what kind of Sim he was going to make when it came out (he got the head from one picture, the back from another etc). The back didn't blend with the rest too well."
"2568"	"(2009-01-03 (17)) I was at a cinema at the counter. Dad asked for two tickets to a movie and gave them to me and Ezra. He then got a ticket for himself for Hellboy II. I didn't know he was going off by himself and I said ""You haven't seen Hellboy II yet? I watched it yesterday"", but he wasn't listening."
"2569"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was watching a video of Youtube of Darius paintballing on the street. I was looking for Eugene. The group was him and his friends and they were fighting against each other. There were lots of cameras around and the video had been edited to show it from the best angles. They were spraying fake snow at random places, on the grass etc to make it look nice. This girl with them had a scarf with pink feathers around her neck. The title of the video had the names of the people involved, including Darius's plus a bunch of Macedonian/Russian sounding names."
"2570"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was outside at a school. There was some new thing to do with the Government and people were celebrating it. There was an assembly thing and I was carrying a big flag, which was folded up (I didn't know it was a flag at this point). When I got in the room, there was a smallish audience and there were people standing up in rows at the front. The door was near the front, and I ran behind the people and handed this girl the flag, which we unrolled while I ran back, and it was the American flag, but it was upside down. I saw Elijah in the audience."
"2571"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was watching outtakes from Twilight. David Tennant was in them and there were a few where he was talking normally and I was thinking it was hard to understand his Scottish accent. The outtakes weren't funny at all and I wondered why they even put them together."
"2572"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was at Mom's. My room was different. I saw this squirrel like animal run behind my desk. When I left a while later, Darren asked if I'd seen the squirrel and I said ""I thought it was a squirrel"" but that I thought I'd imagined it. They said they needed to get it. It was just a mouse looking thing. It bit my hand, which stung and Mom put some cream on it. Mom also asked me at one point if I'd worn a pad at all during my last period because ""there was blood on everything"". I was walking to the car and I passed Eugene and I put my hand out and our fingers touched. We were then both sitting in the back of a car and I can't remember where the drivers were going. Then I was with Mom and Ezra. Leslie lived next door to this person Mom went to see. She was holding her baby and it had a dirty face. I spat on my hand and was cleaning its face, while I was holding it. I handed it back, noticing that it was pretty heavy and almost fell back. We drove back in there at a later time, and there were shoes making up the line in the middle of the road. I was then reading a book or watching a movie and in it, this guy went into this warehouse like building (it was shed-like, but big). It had a roller door. He was looking for this guy. The guy was in there and he followed him through this tunnel underground. Then it was a game and I had to pick four out of quite a few options about what I wanted him to do (and in turn, what I thought would make the most interesting reading experience). The guy's thoughts were in the book and he was thinking that it had now been 18 months under there. The bad guy decided to get it over with and confronted him -- he was a demon looking thing [Clive Barker style] ."
"2573"	"(2009-01-04 (17)) I was wondering what The Beatles had thought of The Beatles. There was a picture of John Lennon holding an album and I was then like 'Hang on, they are The Beatles' and was confused about how I forgot they were."
"2574"	"(2009-01-05 (17)) I was at school and in the office because I was doing a private study thing there with Ms Pascal. It was night. There were other people in there. Someone joked about how clean it was, but I didn't get it so just went ""ok..."". Then someone went ""ew, gross!"" and there were three huge cockroaches on the ceiling. I remembered this happening before and the school had set on fire so I didn't unpack my stuff. I thought that maybe I should get Eugene. The biggest cockroach kept following me around. This boy on the net had ways to get rid of them (I think). Then I was at Mom's in the dining room. There was a small TV in the lounge room, but in front of the wall closest to the back of the house. Darren and Mom were there. Thank God You're Here was on and they were about to 'announce' the next person and I said ""Hamish Blake!"" and it was and for the next one I said ""Shaun Micallef!"" and I was right again. I had guessed them because they were two of my favourites."
"2575"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was watching a movie. This guy had quizzes on weird things. One of the questions on one was ""when did you first take pictures with an Aztec Camera [not the band] "". I was at Mom's, which was different, and we were in a big room which didn't have much stuff in it. There was a doll house with Barbie's. It was night. Mom was telling a friend who was there, called Chantelle, that she used to hide drugs in Barbie's. Chantelle left and then another friend of Mom's came. She didn't let her in at first; worried she had the cops with her. She was black and naked. Darren was there too. There was a bunch of little things to add to a car, there was a clock etc, and I was going to put them on my side in Mom's car but she said to put them in my car. Ezra was there and we were starting our diet tomorrow. Mom had made or gotten chips and some other fatty thing and asked if I wanted chips and I said yes, she looked at me oddly and said 'you sure?' and I said that I might as well, it's the last night. I was then driving. It was day. At a set of lights, which was a huge area, there were people stopped even though it was green. There were a few different lane options once you went through the light and you had to pick which character you wanted to be (although nothing happened). I thought for a bit but then realized it didn't matter and chose the Santa lane. The road wasn't very clear and I went over a hill and crashed. These cops came and told me to get out. Then I heard 'Well I Wonder' on the radio. I thought that this had happened before and I had reset at a certain point. One of the cops was dark skinned and he said something to me and then it reset and they came again. I said ""Now Barbarism Begins at Home will come on"", then I realized I'd said the wrong song, but Well I Wonder came on and they thought I'd said the right thing. They didn't believe me, so as they were talking I was saying what they were saying and they realized I was telling the truth. My car was now a rusty old metal board and I didn't know how to stop the loop. Then I was somewhere else and Dad had a joke about Pretty Woman on his Facebook -- something like ""he got the pretty, but what about the cake?"". The 'cake' meant Julia Roberts and it meant she was really ugly. Then there was a poll on Richard Gere and you voted for how cool he was. Then I was watching The Dead Zone and Mary was in a car with another woman, who was naked and they were kissing each other and having sex. The other woman told her to stop because she was bored and Mary said she was just trying something new. Either she or I was walking outside these shops on the sidewalk with a gay friend. There was a religious building next to an anal sex place. A girl in the religious place was trying to hand out brochures."
"2576"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was at Mom's and it was morning but I was trying to sleep. A girl friend of Mom's came over with a baby. They kept talking and doing things loudly and then two more came over."
"2577"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was out the front of home. It was on a different street and on the opposite side it is now though. I had a CD playing in this guy from across the road's car. He said something to Mom and she said to me that he'd said he liked ""12 female singers"". I was like ""ok..."". As we were getting ready to leave, it was now night, we heard sirens. Mom quickly drove into this driveway and did these quick, spiffy turns so she was facing out the driveway. The ambulances and other emergency vehicles pulled up in the driveway in the house next to the one we pulled up in. We drove off and there were teenagers playing at the park."
"2578"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was watching a movie. This girl was on her laptop, on the internet, talking to a guy who was going to give her a code for something off a computer. She was a spy and he was as well I guess. He said that it crashed and it showed him with the computer, which had stuffed up. Then it showed a split screen of the girl and the other was a guy at his laptop and they both said ""Damn it!"" at the same time. What had actually been happening was they were both trying to get the code off each other and the spy guy we saw was just her imagining what was going on. He said to her that he was going to try and get the code back, trying to think what the code could be. He went into his kitchen and this person came in and said ""bananas"" and then mentioned what they were having for dinner and said ""excellent choice"" and left. I thought 'maybe that's the code'. Later his mother mentioned it and said ""excellent choice"" again. He went outside and got in the car and his father was in the back and said ""excellent choice"" again and then he thought maybe it was the code and went back. Then I was watching Sleepless in Seattle [haven't it seen it yet] . Meg Ryan was crying at a guy (the love interest) and told him to get lost and he said ""I'll annoy you with something we both hate"", or something which was a friendly joke."
"2579"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I was in a room, and there was a garden like setting behind a glass wall. Two people were in there because were zombie like. Calvin was telling me about Quarantine and I said you should watch [Rec] because it was probably heaps better [watched it last night, but haven't seen Quarantine] and because Jennifer Carpenter can't act etc. Eugene and his father Abraham were there. Mom had been going out with him. I thought it was strange that they did because Eugene and I were going out. The house was like Mom's. I went out to the lounge and his father was in the kitchen. We joked around for a few minutes. We then had to move the zombies and Calvin was the only person with the code for the door. He didn't want to put it in, but did. He told the zombies to watch [Rec] . The zombies switched between zombies and people, and they were more people like at the moment. Calvin had been bitten, I think. I was then in the dining room and my tooth hurt. I played around with it and then it came out. This other one was loose too and I pulled that and it hurt and was still attached by a string like thing. I grabbed the string and pulled it out, which also hurt. I put them on a tissue and showed Mom. I said that I thought I'd lost all my teeth and she said we'd go to the dentist soon and mentioned that people are always so scared of dentists."
"2580"	"(2009-01-06 (17)) I had just gone to bed and noticed the light from outside was on. It was night. I got up and Mom was in the toilet and I asked her to turn the light off outside because it was too light in my room. [Mom woke me up straight after that and said 'It's so dark in here'] ."
"2581"	"(2009-01-07 (17)) I was at 'school'. School had just finished and we had to go back for a little while. It was only for a few weeks. Depending on which group of last names we belonged to, we were allocated two lots of a few days of holiday. The first one was A-D, but the next one started with D-something and I was in that one. We only had one set of holiday, which was like 3 days in the middle of the weeks. I complained to a female teacher as everyone else had longer ones and had two, so she gave us another one. I was then in a class with a new male teacher. He asked me to introduce myself and I shook my head, he kept saying ""I can't hear you"" and so I said ""Well, I'll just leave then"" and walked out. I called Mom and she said she couldn't get me because she had no, but she was out in the Mighty and I said ""You're in the Mighty! How have you got no car?"" and she was silent."
"2582"	"(2009-01-07 (17)) I can't remember where I was, but zombies came and we were bashing them. I think we were in a small-ish shop. There were these gates at the counters, that were just up to waist level and I was trying to lock a zombie out but the lock wouldn't work. It would turn and click but the door could just be pushed open. Then there was me, a guy I liked and others and we were staying in this other shop which was weird. There was this underground place we were staying in there and it had lots of pipes and it was creepy. In the main part of the shop, we had found a few people. There was a group of young teenage boys and they were pale and sickly. The zombie thing started with ""flu like symptoms"" and so I suspected they had been bitten. There was a computer thing in the shop, which was touch screen, and it would scan the place for infections and the people without the infection would turn up as green squares and those infected were red. I let it scan and there were about the same amount of green as there were red. I told the people who had been bitten or were sick that we'd have to put them somewhere else. As we walked them there I was saying we'd check on them now and then and give them food, and that some would turn earlier than others but we couldn't let them out and that it would get 'smelly'. We walked into this short hall which had a door at the end, which led to a huge toilet (it looked a bit like a change room). I was with a guy and he went in to check it out and others were still coming in. One of them changed suddenly and was coming towards the door and I told my friend that he had five seconds to get out. He got out and I tried to lock the door, but it wouldn't lock again, so I ran down the hall and closed the door from the hall and the zombie was like ""a closed door?"", which he just threw open. I pulled off this metal pole from this bit of machinery I ran past and I was also holding another blunt instrument. I don't know what happened then. We were then in the underground part. This woman had made lots of rows of these ropes, lying horizontally and they were fairly long. About every meter, there was a vial or a bottle of some sort of liquid, usually blood from an infected person. She thought it would work as a vaccine. We had to walk or crawl along the side of the rope and drink the entire thing. I didn't want to drink the blood, thinking it would just cause the infection so I just took a sip out of the water bottle, which was the second last one and got out of it. Everyone else drank them. Someone mentioned Dustin Hoffman being in lots of movies. Later we were all sitting outside and they all looked healthy and I realized the vaccine must've worked. We had to leave there. I think we had this other small shop place. We were walking down a road and the houses were 'Indian' looking (or so I was thinking in the dream). They were poor looking and most didn't have windows (just holes) and were white and had pointy bits on the roof. The whole place was desert-y looking. There were houses and plants, but the plants were very dry looking. The road we were walking on was a main road and there was a road to the left just before the block the other shop was on. On the right was a lot of dry grass and one of those houses down a hill. I was holding onto some stretchy blue stuff that was connected to something on top of a hill (the road went up a hill). A car came with a few people in it and I let the stretchy stuff go a bit loose so I could rest it on the ground and when the car drove over it, it wouldn't snap. I don't know where the people went. I walked up the other shop, but the guy I liked, who was now a young-ish Chris Barrie, and Ezra stopped at this patch of sand before it. They had decided to leave the other shop and use this patch as a new house. I thought the house was underneath the sand. They had a pile of bricks covered in sand in the middle and I asked how we got in and they said we don't. They were making a shop and had been just sleeping outside. I was saying there was no way I was going to sleep outside. I was also starting to not feel well, and decided I wanted to take the vaccine but we couldn't go back. The bricks were painted (to make a picture of the front of a house or shop when put together) and were light blue and white. I stood up and saw a zombie on the road and put a fist up. Chris ran down to fight him. I threw a brick at the zombie but it just missed. He was fighting him and he fell. I yelled ""Chris!"" and then ran down. I grabbed a stick with fire on the end and lit the zombie on fire, and then I threw the stick onto the dead grass next to the road, which also caught fire. I helped Chris up and helped him walk back to Ezra. I saw more zombies coming and so we all ran through the alleys and into a house. It was dark inside and we went into this room which had a bed and a cupboard. There was a window facing the street, which had a curtain over it, but I could see through it, and I saw a motorbike and an open army-like car drive past (which were what we were hiding from).We were waiting for a call from this guy who could help us make something so I didn't get sick and I told Ezra to put it on silent, but then it vibrated and it was the guy calling. He asked if I had all these ingredients and I said I did and repeated all these things ending with '-una'."
"2583"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) I was at school, which was different, with Calvin and we were delivering boxes to the office. There was some carnival thing. Samantha asked us to go and I think I said no but later said to Ezra that we should've gone. Then I was at the carnival in the ball pit, which was big. Margarita was nearby, sitting on the sidelines and called out ""Ugly!"" to me and was asking people if they thought I was ugly. I yelled out back ""Look who's talking you fat ugly cow"" and everyone gasped and I said ""Seriously, have you seen her face?"" etc. They left me alone after that. Then I was playing with Bradley. We were either in a pool or the balls still, and he couldn't see (had a blindfold on I think) and he had to try and find me. I was backing away trying not to give my position away and trying not to squeal or laugh. Then there was some clown thing and a pool full of dead clowns. It showed underwater and they were all floating vertically. One of them had a finger that was almost decayed off from the rest of it. I was thinking of some of the scariest clowns (no actual real ones). This guy had to choose an option and this guy was supposed to help him. It was like a game, and every option limited your next one and what would happen to you. He decided to opt for Option A as he wanted Option B (I'm designating names so it's less confusing). If he opted for Option B first it wouldn't go as well. One way was a 'bad' way. The guy got him drunk and he forgot and chose the bad way (it was good for him at first, but later it wouldn't be). I think before this, he entered the evil realm. This fleshy skin coloured 'monster' (it was like a long, thin cylinder shape) shot out at his face and the guy grabbed it and pulled it off whatever it was attached to. People were discussing it later and saying he should've ripped this thing out from inside its 'mouth'. This guy who was helping him was actually from the evil realm and it was a joke on the other guy. He apologized to his leader and was going to leave because he was bad or something."
"2584"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) Mom was going for a drive. She asked Ezra if he wanted to go. I think I wanted to go get something during the drive."
"2585"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) I was in the backseat of my car in the carpark at Midvale shops. This guy got in the drivers seat and a girl got in the passengers side. I was like ""Hey! Get out of my car!"", but the ignored me and drove away. I asked them to drop me off home and they thought this was a good idea and started driving up the road behind the shop and turning the next left. We missed it first and they turned and went down it. When we got there I took out this little hammer and hit him over the head with it, he was just like ""Ow!"" and I kept hitting him but nothing much happened. Mom came out and I asked her for a bigger hammer and she asked why, but gave me one and I started bashing him with it."
"2586"	"(2009-01-08 (17)) I got to Seabird somehow, but it was totally different and was actually in the middle of a city near a main road. I went to where our caravan was supposed to be, but it wasn't there. This guy who also used it was there and he said his was now in 'The Mercury'. I went to leave and was standing at the side of the main road, which was two lanes but they were both going towards me. The lane furthest away was busy but the other was empty. I walked out to the middle of the road and then realized it was too busy and went back. Then the guy pointed out The Mercury, which was hotel like and the windows all looked like they had blankets and towels on them. I remembered we had number 12 and I went into the lobby. Then this guy, who was me, had sex with these three girls. Two of them were called Eve and Gwen and Eve was black. He was lying with them."
"2587"	"(2009-01-09 (17)) I was somewhere with the school and I was with Calvin. Eugene was nearby and I noticed he had a piercing and then I noticed he was wearing a bracelet and a ring on the middle finger of his left hand and I was really annoyed by this. I was going through my bag and there were lots of notes in there, a total of around $500. It had been given to us ages ago but I'd forgotten about it. Then I was at this building with lots of levels and secret ones below. There were parties happening on most of them. One of them had these baths with special blue water. They were very shallow. I decided to use one. I lay down and then I wanted to call Mom to get me later and I left the building to call her. I went on an elevator to get back. They were dirty so I was cleaning it first. Then it wasn't as shallow. This bath was closest to the wall and there was a square 'drop' in the bottom of the bath, near the wall and there was a little fish thing. You weren't allowed to take it out but I got a cup to get rid of it and it went crazy so I put it back. Then I was someone else and I was lying in the bath and the fish grew into this huge monkey like thing. It tried to have sex with me and held me down. It was rubbing against me and got bigger and I told it to go smaller because I was a virgin and it shook its head. Later, I think, I was at this little hut place next to Mom's to help poor people and Africans or something. I was helping for the day. I had to sit at a desk and ask a few questions and send them out this door. I also was prank calling Charlene asking about her water pipes, talking in a serious voice, and there was no end joke; all I did was ask questions about the pipes."
"2588"	"(2009-01-10 (17)) I was watching One Tree Hill and Brooke was working in a diner. She was serving food and getting flashbacks of war images due to something that happened to her. One of the foods was some sort of sweet pie. There was an old couple. The old lady asked something and this other worker girl said they would hurry. The old lady said to the old man that his pies were served too rushed and were ""put together with shaky hands"". He looked at her and cried. Someone tried to give a phone to this guy behind the counter and told him to answer it. The phone was actually bomb. Then we were in this bank and someone said ""get the transporter"". Then this guy suddenly spun around and kicked all these guns that were on the floor and sent them under these red lounges nearby. He did some other spiffy fighting moves and made it to the other side of the room. I said ""effects!"". He was handcuffed to some guy and was still fighting. This guy said ""why don't you take your handcuffs off?"". The guy, who was British, said ""I don't know ok!"". On Yahoo there was a thing about how Jeffrey Dean Morgan got a call from some woman about some ""exciting"" film role and mentioned him being a hallucination on Grey's Anatomy and something else."
"2589"	"(2009-01-11 (17)) I had thought that our leaver's jackets looked like some Year 10 jackets we had gotten at Whitehall High, although I was thinking that I didn't do Year 10 there. I was looking at some photos on my computer from that time and they were wearing the same jackets, except theirs were a lighter blue. I remembered that Liesl had been on the leaver's jacket committee at both schools and realized she just recycled the idea. I told Mom about it. I went to school for something. We were standing next to the PAC, facing the gym, which was a lot of bigger. They made us all gather somewhere and Autumn bumped into me, and I thought she was going to say ""Hello Sunshine"" but she ignored me. Ms Solomon asked us questions about Bella's 'sadness' in the Twilight movie. All the girls began talking excitedly about it. Then we were in a computer room. I was at a computer in a smaller part of the room, next to Elijah who was sitting to my left. He was typing, but at the same time pressing backspace so nothing would show up. I hit '69' and it showed up. He thought it was funny and asked why I pressed 69 and I said it was the easiest number to hit, so he hit '55' to show that was easier. Eugene was in the bigger part of the room and was to the left of me. He looked tired and grumpy and kept ruffling his hair and putting his head on the desk. He was also really pale. We were then outside and there was a parade going down this street. There was a car on the island in the middle of the two lanes and we hid on the side away from the parade. People were looking for us. People poured out of this building across the road and then some of them would come to the front and sing. Eugene came out with some other guy and he looked kind of chubby. I was with Calvin and I thought he was going to say something about Eugene but he didn't."
"2590"	"(2009-01-11 (17)) I was on my laptop and had my PowerPoint presentation open. I left the room and when I came back I was talking to Ezra on MSN and he had changed my font colour and background colour. The font was now a light blue and the background was yellow. He sent 'Bart rules!' and this colour change had something to do with The Simpsons. There was a movie on later with George Clooney and I laughed and said ""milk!"" and thought about the milk thing."
"2591"	"(2009-01-11 (17)) I can't remember it properly, but Calvin, Samantha and I were playing a real-life game. I brought this burger and we all had to share it and have a certain amount left over for the next part. It was really saucy and Samantha dared me to eat it and I couldn't resist it and took a big bite. I then put it down and went to talk to Calvin. When I came back, the burger was mostly gone and there were only a few bits left. I asked Samantha if she had eaten it and she said she had. I complained and said we needed to share it or we wouldn't get to the next part."
"2592"	"(2009-01-12 (17)) This girl got possessed by some purple smoke [happened in an episode of Torchwood I watched last night] . She became violent and killed some people. We were trying to find a way to save her. She took over Gizmo so we wouldn't kill her. Some stuff she had tried to gather was in alphabetical order, but also with numbers and strokes. I was doing a study thing like the MUPC and I had special study guides which were for after highschool only. Mom was somewhere. There was a quiz to see which guy from something you were. Whatever I got, 85% of others got him too."
"2593"	"(2009-01-13 (17)) I was out the back at home. I was cleaning around the side of the house. There were dead kittens under a slab which was resting diagonally against the wall of bricks. Mom was there. I was then at her place and it was night and her house was different and bigger. She decided to go see a friend of hers. There was a TV show called Hancock and along with some other torrents, I had it ready to download. I started getting scared, as I was alone, and called Mom. She asked if I wanted her to come back and she said she would come by and I said to not worry. I was jiggling the cord from the phone. I was then at someone's house and someone said the neighbour was nice or something. I was in a class and Dad was there, I think and the teacher was there. He gave me a pencil and told me he was going to get me to write a sentence to take these monsters ""out of the world and into words"". I said ""that doesn't really help"" (make sense). He said something and he was a monster/bad guy. People would realize they didn't come there by chance? Some time earlier I was in bed, sleeping. I woke up and Spaceman, Cuddles and Gizmo were on my bed as well as some people. I was trying to take a photo."
"2594"	"(2009-01-13 (17)) I was at Mom's old house. My room was different and someone put this thing on a tall cupboard I had. They went to bed (my bed, which was just a normal single bed) to sleep. I then tried to jump and get the thing but I couldn't reach and didn't want to stand on my chair incase I fell or broke it. Then someone said they had left poison at the back door (it was Santiago). I looked down the stairs and the front door was open and it was like early morning outside. It was too spooky to go down, so I checked the other doors on the second floor. I told Mom about the poison so I went downstairs and there were huge lumps of meat with a needle and stuff next to it. Simba came and I shooed him away. Ezra and I started to clean it up. I went up the hall and there were Christmas cards. I filled two out to Ezra because we gave one to people the day before as well. Then we needed to hide. Then I was this guy and he went into a room downstairs and it was messy and there were beanbags. He hid under them. Then it was me and the beanbags were quite heavy and I was trying not to breathe loudly so they wouldn't move up and down. The people came in and were talking and then they went quiet. It was a girl and a guy. The girl saw the beanbag and said something and then pulled the beanbags off and then I don't know what happened because I was then watching the end of House of 1000 Corpses. It was zoomed in on Denise's mouth and she was screaming and it zoomed out. It had all been a dream and there was actually another hour or so and the whole movie went for three hours. I was thinking that I'd forgotten about that."
"2595"	"(2009-01-14 (17)) I had a kid. The house I lived at was very small but was 2-3 storeys. I was talking to my boyfriend about it saying the kid needed more room. The kid was running and I called out ""Brad!"" (the kid) and I was thinking 'why did I call him Brad?'. He asked me if he could say some stupid words (maybe swear words in our world?) and I said he couldn't say them in front of anyone. Then I was at Mom's. There was a bed near the kitchen. We were all sleeping in those rooms (the house was different). I decided to use my 'proper' bed tonight and I forgot there was a big window. Mom suggested I put the bed against the wall under the curtain. I said it would be too bright. I was watching 24 and Jack was watching movies and doing some US test?"
"2596"	"(2009-01-14 (17)) We were outside somewhere. There were monkeys and they were talking, but it was like a different language. They started getting angry and I went up on the stage in front of them and started singing ""I like to sing-a, about the moon-a and the June-a and the spring-a"" and they were happy and started clapping. The third time, I forgot the words but found a ""mini-moose"" version. The song started off differently to the actual song. There was a fence around this place near by and there was a dog in there. I was on the outside and needed to get in, but this dog was following me so I couldn't enter. There was a lizard at one end. Then I was watching Supernatural, except it was real life. I was running away from some bad people and it was night. There was a petrol station thing. I was then some girl and her clothes had been ripped off and this guy was on the floor with a big fluffy jacket. I took it and put it on. It went down to my feet and was very soft. The bad guys were coming in and held a gun to the guy behind the counter and sent this other guy to get something. I snuck outside and tried to get in this car, which was locked and then I went to this other car and opened the door, but I realized I had no key anyway. The guy heard me opening it and shot at me. I ducked and then he looked up behind me and was shooting. It was a big black cloud and I ran into the petrol station saying that I'd seen ""the scariest thing"". They asked what it was and I was going to say Cerebus [cloud on Lost] but this guy said it looked like the black cloud from Lost. I said ""I don't know if I'm watching Lost or Supernatural"" saying there were so many people in each one. Michael Emerson was in the petrol station and was near me and I pointed to him and said ""he's in Lost"". Then I was watching it again. People ran somewhere else. The door was locked and they banged on it. There was a reflection in this bin of the people and this guy got picked up by the cloud (although the cloud wasn't shown in the reflection) and thrown away. The people unlocked the door and they ran in and started running to get under these gates (it was in this mall type of shop, like the markets) as the gates were closing. A group of people were in there. Someone said this girl was respectable. Her mother thought this guy was Spanish and then English. I said they only think she's respectable because they were being attacked by monsters and she was wearing a long coat. And also wasn't talking about ""clothes and hair"". Then there was some Jack Bauer (24) set thing. There were cookies, at home, and Ezra was taking some. Dad was there too."
"2597"	"(2009-01-15 (17)) I went to 'school'. Mom decided it would be a good idea to send me to the 'boarding' option there. I said no and to pick me up like usual (she also wanted to pick me up from this carpark, which was like inside). I ended up going to it though and they put this metal collar around my neck which had my name and an assigned number on it. I couldn't work out how to get it off. There were two sets of steps, one on each side, leading to these seats (which were steps) on opposite sides of the room. In the middle was just a space for something. There weren't many people. I went up the left one and there was no-one on that side, there were a handful of people on the other one. It was quite dark in there and was underground like (very cement-y). This guy came to my side and sat across from me on the same step. Then this girl sat a few steps below me and said hello to me and I told her not to talk to me. She had been here (or somewhere) last year and we had fought because she was really annoying. It was then quite full and noisy. There was a young boy down at the sign-in area and it was his first year and he had to pull something out of this thing and he got this floppy shoe (a bad 'prize'). The girl continued annoying me and I said loudly ""Leave me alone!"" and she kept going so I attacked her. The main leader guy told me to stop and I said that this was the same as last year. He said they had found ""foreign antibodies"" in me and I said ""you're saying this because I attacked her, she's a whore!"". She had been flirting with the guy earlier. Then Mom and I visited her old house. They had kept it and went back now and then to keep it tidy etc, although I hadn't been back. I lay down in my bed and put my phone on charge. My blankets were a bit dusty. Then I fell asleep. I woke up later and it was a different place. Mom was on the phone asking about this song quiz she had studied for. I had some helpful stuff so I brought it to her. They were playing recorded calls for drug deals on the radio. One of them had Robbie Williams. We were driving. I was telling Mom about dreams and that you can become lucid because the windows don't have proper reflections and we passed a bunch of windows which looked painted like and I used them as an example."
"2598"	"(2009-01-16 (17)) My dreams were now on DreamBank, but the site was different and it had more detail and articles etc. They had put ""new batteries"" in my calculator. I told Mom about it later. Ezra had mentioned being on it but I didn't realize until later that it meant he knew who I liked. I was then at home so I could watch a movie that was in the Top 250. It was oldish and boring and after six minutes I called Mom to get me. She said she'd be there soon and would get me when she came to get Ezra (which was going to be on Thursday). I yelled at her, complaining but then I realized it was Thursday. The movie had now been going for 46 minutes. I heard a high pitch squealing noise and thought 'bomb' and looked outside. There was a light in the sky and it came rushing towards us, it was an 'aftershock'. Ezra didn't notice and I told Mom later. Darren had a 3-way phone? We were in the car and in the back. I was in the middle and Ezra was in his normal spot. We were going to see some friend."
"2599"	"(2009-01-16 (17)) We went to the shop and I was waiting in the car. Mom went in. I locked the doors. Some guys came and one looked like Mark Wahlberg and one looked like George Clooney. Mark was at the front of the car and put his hands on the front windows on the side of the car and was banging on them. I tried to call Mom but her phone was in the car. They eventually left and Mom came back and I told her to check around the car, but she ignored me and unlocked the car. They started coming back and she got in and we quickly locked the doors."
"2600"	"(2009-01-16 (17)) I went to Whitehall High School but I don't know why. I went into a computer room and Tiana and others were in there playing Warcraft. Some of the other people called out to me and I stood still and concentrated and 'teleported', but I was still in the same place (they couldn't see me though). I was watching The Young Ones and Rik was sick in bed and there was another Rik standing over him and I said ""Rik, Rik"" in his 'conscience voice'. This guy nearby was watching and said ""you like Young Ones?"". There was a pool and a rake attached to a pipe and you had to control it and put it down. A lady was with me."
"2601"	"(2009-01-17 (17)) I was at a vet with Mom. There were kittens. The place caught fire and this fireman came. The kittens were near the fire and I tried to save them but the fireman sent me away because of the fumes. Mom was telling me about this trick that Santiago did with his dog, he would grab its tail and it would do something. A girl relative of his (she was about 12) tried it and the dog bit her hand."
"2602"	"(2009-01-17 (17)) I was at a two storey building/house. Each floor consisted of one large empty room. There was a party and lots of people. The host was a lady who looked like a lesbian. I can't remember it properly, but the lady took out a gun and everyone started running and screaming to get out, but she stopped the rest of us before I could get out. There were teachers there. I remember Ms Solomon and there was a 40 year old teacher lady who I also knew. I went upstairs with this girl, I'm not sure if I knew her. We were trying to escape. She took the fly wire off the window and climbed out onto this balcony, which went all the way around. I followed and put the fly wire back on. The 40 year old teacher lady was inside and we motioned for her to come out. This kept happening over and over. When it was the third or fourth time (only the girl and I remembered it happening again and again) we were all upstairs and the host lady was talking to us. I motioned to the teacher lady that the lady had a gun and made a shooting motion and told her to attack her. The teacher lady got the gun off her and said ""is this a gun?"" and the lady said ""yes"". The teacher said ""it's not real"" and aimed at the host lady and shot her in the head. The girl I was with and I were relieved and 'celebrating' and saying that was much quicker, but everyone else was shocked. I left and went to this shop and I had cereal for lunch. Nicolas was there and him and his mates called me fat, but were like 'see that girl over there, she's fat' etc. I said ""look at those guys over there, aren't they ugly and retarded"". They asked how many boxes of some food I'd eaten today and I got annoyed and said that I'd had one bowl of cereal and I kept stuttering. I mentioned I'd had one bowl in the morning and ""one bowl now!"". I also had had a mint slice later. I went to the toilet and there were lots of toilet bowls, but they were all different and scattered around the room and there weren't any doors, instead you put this thing on your lap to cover you. I went to this one I liked at the far end, but there was some brown liquid on it."
"2603"	"(2009-01-18 (17)) I was in a building and then a Rottweiler was outside and was trying to get in. Mom decided to let it in, thinking that would cause less damage. I climbed up this ladder thing to go to a higher floor, but it just went to this small cage thing on a platform. I went back down and onto a desk. The dog ran up the steps and we tried to catch it, but the cage was too small. It turned out it was half human or something"
"2604"	"(2009-01-18 (17)) I was at home. This model girl was in the games room and I drew her. She left when I finished. This other model girl, who was slightly Asian looking and really pretty was lying on a bed. I asked her to come here for a second and we walked to the living room and I asked her what she was doing and she said she was about to go to bed because she had to get up in 2 hours. It had something to do with her son and I remembered and told her not to worry and to go back to bed (I was going to draw her)."
"2605"	"(2009-01-19 (17)) This guy was in jail and was going to escape [started watching Prison Break last night] . I was then at Mom's and was going to have a bath. As I was undressing Mom asked ""Are you ready for your things?"" and I said ""I dunno"". I had died, I think and it was a documentary of me. I was talking to Ezra later. I was then outside this building. Ms Solomon was there and it was a game or something. She left and these people made jokes about her name. The jail guy had developed a habit of enjoying vomiting. His son or something ended up in there too. They would do something wrong so they would go to jail. At the end of the movie, his daughter also liked vomiting (it was a 'twist') and she stole something in a cop station and the cops came. I took a bite of this food thing and it was disgusting and I looked inside and it was all black and moldy like. I almost threw up. I was then at home and people from school were there, including Eugene. There were photos of everyone on the floor and I found Eugene's and it was a really nice photo. The teacher was using a photo as an example and picked up Genevieve', which was a really bad photo and it had gotten ruined and she couldn't use it. There was some guy dressed as a character, which was dressed in a soldier's uniform. I was thinking I would go as Rick (The Young Ones)."
"2606"	"(2009-01-19 (17)) Dad, Ezra and I were lining up for something. I was watching a Kenny vs. Spenny episode and Kenny was in bed with some girls and most of them were blurred. With one of them, he said ""ow!"" and another that wasn't blurred said she wanted a puppy and started crying. I laughed because it made no sense. There was a basketball thing in the games room at home. I set it up. Dad came. Kenny came through from the far wall. I was playing basketball with some people and the winner got something. I hurt my arm and I was playing this guy next, who was the last guy (the last round). I was playing with one arm, but doing ok. Then there was a team and the guy wanted to stab his friend on the other team. I took the pole off him so he couldn't. Some boy had drowned. Granny was packing stuff to move somewhere else. I was getting dressed to go to the shop. I put this tight-ish shirt on with this white see-through net-like material over the top and a pink hat. I decided to put a shirt over what I was wearing but my room was messy and I couldn't find a shirt. There was an episode of some show and I was trying to remember which episode it was from and then that episode was on TV. T-Bag (Prison Break) and others were on a street, and they would walk back and forth between these traffic lights (in a small area). He had batteries and was trying them on a light. This guy opened the one that had money in it and T-Bag went and flicked through his batteries and then walked away. He was twitchy and a thief."
"2607"	"(2009-01-20 (17)) I went to the Cat Haven [going to Cat Haven for induction today] . I was inside and it was quite big and was office/school like. All the people I saw there were women. My induction and first day were on the same day, but I hadn't called to tell them I couldn't make it. I found the main lady and I told her that I could only attend one, and asked some questions too. I felt stupid about asking questions. I was then back from it, but I couldn't remember what happened."
"2608"	"(2009-01-20 (17)) I was watching an episode of Doctor Who or something. They were at a hotel thing and there were prostitutes there. It was old fashioned. This guy had sex with one of them and he had disappeared. Now there were ghosts at the place. There was a list of guys that had been 'taken'. There were a lot more guys that had been taken abut this was a list of certain guys. I realized it was guys who had treated them well and had been nice and 'with love'. I had found this out because I said that it ""didn't seem like these were bad people"". The Doctor (as David Tennant) realized this saying that they were those who had been ""gentlemen"". He got 'turned' into a ghost and they were also wearing masks like in those masquerade balls and they had weird lipstick on. He started singing in this girly voice and then kissed this girl ghost who sighed and then disappeared and he was ok, because he was a nice guy. In the dream, it seemed like a pretty cool plot."
"2609"	"(2009-01-21 (17)) I was at Mom's, which was different. She went missing and Darren, Ezra and I went looking for her. Her car wasn't there. I went to my room and I had a bunk in there and she was in the bottom one, sleeping. There was going to be a wedding, but I don't remember anything more."
"2610"	"(2009-01-21 (17)) Lately, Mom had been spending all her time in the dark. She never turned on the lights or went out in the day time. One night, she took me and Ezra for a drive. She left, but kept the car going slowly in a circle. I got in the driver's seat after a while and started driving. The seat was really low and I could barely see and then Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd (as the Back to the Future characters) flew past on those flying skateboards. Then I stopped and put the seat up. The steering wheel was really loose and it took a lot of effort to turn. I turned around and went back up the street. I tried to turn into the driveway at home and I thought Dad's car was in the driveway and stopped early, but it was just the garage door, and I was half on the grass and on an angle. Dad came out and then his van was in the driveway and he and some other guys were getting stuff out. I held the front door open for them, but they just stood there chatting and I said ""Come on, hurry up and one of you get in so I can go"". Dad said ""What?"" sort of angrily and confused and I said ""So you hold the door for the next guy etc"". I went to my room and 'I' was on my laptop with the fan right next to me (another me). I said ""hi mama!"" in that high pitched voice and then said it seemed weird asking myself what I was doing. But she just ignored me."
"2611"	"(2009-01-21 (17)) Mom mentioned having been at our school and talking to Alyssa recently. I said that Alyssa was a Year 12 and wouldn't have been there. Then Ezra and I were at school and it was different. We were going to leave and there were slugs with legs, which we walked around. Then there was a fairly big purple lizard in our path. We walked around that and then there were huge octopus like legs everywhere (like a meter or bigger thick and very long). We ran and I made sure to run undercover and it was taking people. I got to the end of the undercover parts and was at the oval. Lots of other people were at the start of it too. We all ran at the same time and people were getting picked off as we ran."
"2612"	"(2009-01-22 (17)) I was watching Torchwood. Their hideout looked like an office building. They had two females at a desk at the front to watch who came in. Two people came but they were invisible to them. At one point, Jack thought he saw someone but they made themselves invisible again before he got another look and he shrugged it off. Rhys looked a bit different and was less chubby. Gwen was cheating on him with someone. There was a dark room thing there and I can't remember what happened properly but Tosh went in and the invisible people were there to get rid of her. I think Ianto had a boyfriend and also liked to wear women's clothes?"
"2613"	"(2009-01-22 (17)) I was at school which was different. I was with Ramona. I was showing her my escape plan for wagging so you don't get caught. There were people around everywhere and there was a beach nearby. There was a platform on the beach where a statue used to be and I said ""I stood on there yesterday"". I was showing her how to dodge teachers, as they walked around in the same pattern. Ms Pendleton was there. I got to the end building and the door slammed shut. Then I was watching something like Dead Set. It had the UK Big Brother and Craig Charles was on it, except he was 'Irish'. I was telling Mom that on Red Dwarf, Rimmer had been on Big Brother. Then zombies came. There was a family and there was a brother and a sister who were teenagers and they could blow hard, which would knock the zombies to the wall. Their younger sibling came in. Then Mom and I went to her friend's house. It was in a fancy area and he was swimming in a big pool. There was a sign advertising a party at some other guy's house sometime. Hold on Loosely was on the radio."
"2614"	"(2009-01-23 (17)) I was on Movie Collector and had added Ocean's Eleven. Robert Knepper was in it, according to the cast list and I was thinking that I didn't remember him in it. He played T-Bag (Prison Break) in it though. They were also escaping from prison and some people knew so they were putting plaster around where they were escaping from so no-one could see it, but they could easily break it to get out. In 'real life', T-Bag had killed someone. I was getting married, but it was a fake, so I could get out of the country and we were going to England (it was weird though). The marriage was to Michael Scofield (Prison Break). T-Bag disrupted it and I yelled at him. Then there was a party and a fat girl was dancing. Then I was on Facebook and Salim had commented on a picture of my 'parents' saying ""no wonder your nose is so ugly"" or something like that."
"2615"	"(2009-01-23 (17)) There had been zombies or something. I was with a group of people and we were carefully wandering outside. We met up with two other small groups along the way. We were then at this zoo type place. This guy and I went for a walk and he showed me some stuff. As everything had been abandoned, some animals wandered around. There were quite a few wolves around and they ate the chickens. We walked past a monkey enclosure. The gardens and other flora around the zoo place were really pretty. We gathered some food and other stuff in a bag. The other two groups then had powers. There was a Yoda like creature sitting on top of a stick, which was standing vertically. It was asleep and then it woke up. It suggested we play some game with the stick. We were then in a building and there were beds in the building, but not many. We pulled out mattresses to a large room to all sleep together but we were then using the beds. My bed had a soft blanket with a picture of a white animal (tiger or something) on it. I originally took a double bed because I wanted to share with some guy I liked, but he got his own bed, so I took a single. The others turned on us. They took this helicopter but it crashed into the water. We ended up in the water too and the blades of the helicopter were still going and we were trying to swim away from them. The bag was in the water and it floated away and I figured we'd just get it later. Later I was in a car, driving with some guy. There were a few shops around, but also some park like places. There was a park thing we passed with really nice grass and I said that it was ""really pretty grass"". The next park thing had these big black rocks, and then there were a lot of them stacked on top of each other along the edge of this park. They looked like giant human skulls. I called Mom and Darren answered and I asked him to tell Mom to come and pick me up (I thought the guy I was with was dodgy). I didn't know where I was though and told him to tell Mom to call me when she got the message. Then I was in a small 'diving' shop (I thought it was a diving shop, I don't know if it was). I sort of knew the guy who was working there and I found out he had killed someone and had chucked them into this large body of water just outside. The cops came in and I think he or I snuck a towel into my bag, but they found it (they had been told I was stealing). I said I was buying stuff with it as I had no money. Then I was watching a movie, which explained the human skull rocks. The people in it were giants and they were all women and had no shirts on (possibly completely naked) and they were running, falling, fighting etc in slow motion, zooming in on their breasts often and I was annoyed at the amount of nudity."
"2616"	"(2009-01-24 (17)) I was at a shop. I was with Mom looking at the men's clothes. There was a shirt with a rainbow like thing on it and Mom suggested I get it and I said that ""rainbows are gay"". Then I was with others at the shop and we were vampires. It was hard to tell who was a vampire (they had small teeth, normal skin colouring etc). Everyone was feeding, but I had trouble finding someone. I found a lady with a baby, but then it was a guy. Someone took the baby and I tried to bite the guy's arm, but all it left was a little scratch and I tried sucking on it but no blood came out. I used some medical equipment and discovered he had no heartbeat and then he smiled and he was actually a vampire and was playing a joke on me. Owen (Torchwood) and I were sort of friends but argued a lot. There was a montage of us arguing. He was then rambling, as he does, and said we should have sex and I said, going along with it, ""oh we should, should we?"". Supposedly, vampire sex was really good. Then I was at a house. I was talking to some people and I said Mom was getting an abortion and they questioned it and I had actually meant getting her tubes tied but I couldn't remember what it was called and said she was ""getting her nuts cut"". Darren was related to Martin Sheen and I couldn't see the resemblance."
"2617"	"(2009-01-25 (18)) I was watching Prison Break. I don't remember anything that was happening, but I remember Bellick and T-Bag."
"2618"	"(2009-01-25 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop but it looked like an airport. There was a shop called ""I hate buns"" except it was sometimes ""I love hate"". At first the shop was outside, but then we were inside. Ezra was looking for a shop and we ended up in this sound studio like the one near the Science Museum with this old-ish woman teaching. She had a program open on her computer and showed us a music file and asked us to work out how to get all the music into ""one stream"" -- which we did by pouring water onto sand and making these thick rods made of sand and water. Ezra had spelled out ""hobgoblin"" and I wrote ""Hello"" and then ""Izzy"" in the sand. The lady had a glass and broke it and I called it a glass and she started rambling angrily that it was actually called something else and that it was mainly for 'bigger' people to commit suicide with and then she calmed down and said she was meeting some pedophile guy next and she was going to be late but couldn't contact him. One of us suggested we could go and show him this game to stall him. Then I was in a car with a guy friend. It was night and we drove past this shop, which he had broken into earlier. The door was open and someone was inside. He pulled up outside and was going to go in to stop it and I told him not to, and he hesitated but eventually drove off. Then we picked up a drunk friend and he said he lived in ""New Jersey"" and my friend said ""that's a nice place to live"" and I said ""unless you're in this country""."
"2619"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) I was watching Prison Break. T-Bag had a lot of different disguises and voices to use for different identities. He went to a hospital and there were some kids. He was pretending to be an Indian doctor and he called them to help them and was speaking in an Indian accent. The kid recognized the voice though. Eugene had had a dream (while he was in prison) about an assassination attempt on the president and it mentioned the dream on the news. There was a bloody dude called Billy in the dream. Later, Mahone dreamt of it too. He was on a rooftop or something. He was with Sucre, but then it wasn't Sucre and he turned around and Mahone shot him four times in the back. Later the president, who looked like/was Mahone, shot a friend four times in the back and then laid him down and shot him in the head. Three kids nearby saw and one ended up dying. Mahone and Eugene had a gun fight. Mahone pushed the other two kids in the way and Eugene shot them accidentally and they died. The president was involved with this girl, but he didn't trust her anymore."
"2620"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) I was at school, but it was a different school. The same people were there though. There was an 'assembly' and everyone was grouped together in different classrooms. I was sitting next to Fang in class. During the assembly, Calvin ignored me and sat with someone else. Rebekah was sitting somewhere else and was laughing with her friends. Ezra came in and sat next to me (we were at a desk). He knew my password for DreamBank and I was on it later trying to find out how to change the password. It looked different and had a forum. I couldn't find anything about changing your password. I was then in a lady's home and I had to leave (I was with others and we were on a mission thing). I had to drag this heavy carpet out. Then it was a TV show and this girl was wearing some latest fashion and these people took photos of it so it couldn't be released."
"2621"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) This family had moved into a new house. There was a cat and a dog and they were weird looking and were staring at it. The kids ran into the house. Then the father was actually dead, but they could see him. There was a building nearby that had a public toilet sort of feel and there were vending machines in it. Some guy wanted to get some Picnics for his friend. The father was getting the Picnics and he got in trouble with the police. Someone asked the guy what his pets were called. It was Bellick (Prison Break)."
"2622"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) A bunch of people and I were running away from some people. T-Bag (Prison Break) was there. T-Bag was going to kill this guy, but I took the shank from him and stabbed the guy so he didn't get in trouble. A lot of stuff happened but I can't remember much. Then we were in a game. There were lots of people around and we were running around through this large crowd."
"2623"	"(2009-01-26 (18)) I was at a cinema. The guy serving at the counter was in the clip for 'Jizz in My Pants', the clip was actually different. Someone said ""cash or credit"" to him and everyone was asking if he was the guy from it. Then I was in school and it was a few weeks/months into it. I was doing ok, but I wanted to do MUPC and so wasn't trying. The people there were pretty mean. We were all gathered and sitting on the floor. The teacher looked like Mahone (Prison Break) and he put some music on and everyone was singing except for me, as I didn't know the words and wouldn't have sung anyway. Then they all got up to do this dance. Only two guys and I didn't join in. There was a group of girls that were mean to me all the time and I couldn't find my bag and thought they had taken it, but then I found it in the shelf behind me."
"2624"	"(2009-01-27 (18)) I was at school but it was different. It was the last night of school and we were supposed to wear a 'disguise'. People were all dressed up but I was just in my leaver's jacket. We were in a room, which had round tables scattered around and had balloons etc and was party-like. This teacher called us all to the ""birthday board"" and they were putting people's birthdays on there. Eugene was there and wrote in Bradley's birthday as April 16th or something. Then I think I might have been somewhere else, but Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were sort of friends with me, but they were trying to put salt on my food, along with some other people. I kept hovering over the plate and squealing and running away but they would follow. Then I was in a hall somewhere and I think it was a movie scene or something. A black girl and a guy made a mistake and it was really funny. There was a dog at the back and Mom joked that it was mine. I then had a little camera and I was taking photos. Cuddles was on my bed, sitting in a bunched up bit of blanket. Ezra was playing with a dog."
"2625"	"(2009-01-27 (18)) T-Bag (Prison Break) was having sex with some lady. She was on top, and it showed his face. I was thinking that he was hot and that I missed season 1 T-Bag."
"2626"	"(2009-01-27 (18)) I was at Mom's house, but it was different and in a different place. Across the road from it, was mainly bare but there was a stingy house down this hill (across the road, was a huge square of land, which dipped down and the house was in the middle, but there were trees and such around). Mom and Darren were modifying the house and decided to ask them a question. We all went over and as we got to the door, people started yelling and glass was smashing. Mom got a bit nervous. We went in and they gave us all a drink, but I didn't drink mine and Mom and Darren had some of theirs. The house was very 'hillbilly' like and there were lots of rooms, with quite a few people in it. Eventually Darren passed out (from the drink) and Mom was a bit groggy. I tried to get her out of the house, but the people were going to kill us and I left her and ran off. They just came after me. I found a shard of glass, although I think it was a knife at first, and I began slicing the necks of the people in the house. Only about two of them actually came after me, everyone else just sat about in their room. One of the rooms had three guys in it and they were playing a card game. The room across from it had a few people in it too. I killed two of the guys in the room, but the third guy I couldn't get to. I tried to slice his throat but I couldn't get through it so I grabbed his arm and tried to slice his wrist vertically, but it didn't work again, so I ran off. Then I had a cardboard pole and I ran out the back. This guy had some sharp weapon and I was fighting him off with the pole. I called the cops while doing this and I said ""I'm at the house across from 4 Edinboro. They're trying to kill us! They drugged my Mom and her boyfriend and I only have a cardboard pole"". I ended up finding something stronger right after I said that, but then someone said that we had actually imagined all this and I got frustrated. We were then back out the front of Mom's house and we still wanted to go over, but were now hesitant. We started over and then saw an Asian guy similar to one in the 'vision', so we decided not to. Outside my window, which was one the second floor, was a lattice ladder thing and it was pink. It was hanging off the wall and they put it back in place. I was saying that people could now come to my window etc and they said they would reinforce it all and I said ""I want bulletproof windows"" and then joked that someone would come in the house and the only way for me to get out would be through the window and I wouldn't be able to go through it. I put my foot on the bottom of the ladder to see how strong it was and it started to fall. This guy was at my window, which was open, and told me to grab his hand and I said ""you won't be able to lift me"" but he kept insisting and I grabbed his hand and he easily pulled me up and through the window with one hand. I realized he was Edward (Twilight book) and said ""You really are a vampire""."
"2627"	"(2009-01-28 (18)) I was at a school. I was going to class and someone was acting dodgy and I poured hot tea on them. They said they were just warning us that we had to do a test on some body part next class and we needed to know names of some of the parts. We got to class and the teacher was covering the board and I was trying to look, but they kept moving so I couldn't see, as they had a picture of whatever the body part was with the names on it. Something happened and this creature started attacking people and we tried to run. The teacher got 'possessed' and in the class next door there were 'eggs' from the creature, which were just people covered in a sac, one of them had the legs still sticking out, kicking."
"2628"	"(2009-01-28 (18)) These people were at a party and there was some dress from World War 1. Jack Nicholson had it and someone said he was getting his smell and beer smell on it, and then he put it on and laughed and left."
"2629"	"(2009-01-29 (18)) I was at Nana's and I was staying the night and sleeping in the lounge. I was trying to turn the TV off but it wouldn't turn off. They had this weird video camera thing plugged in, so I went to Nana's room to ask what I was supposed to do, but she and Poppa were both sleeping. So I just unplugged the camera and then it turned off."
"2630"	"(2009-01-29 (18)) I was at a school. I had been there once before but I came back now as a guy, under the name 'Robert Knepper'. Some people from Brookland were there. I had math next and I was looking on the map to find where the class was. I couldn't work it out and kept walking back and forwards before realizing where the class was. I also had drama and I was thinking I would go change that later. I got to the class and there was a guy teacher. I said I was new and my name was Robert and he checked on the roll and it said I had been there once before, and then had two days off. There weren't any seats by themselves so I sat at this long desk at the back, but it was around the corner and I couldn't see the board. There were two other new kids and they tried to sit there too. I moved it so I could see, but it was on an angle and no-one else could sit there. I was then watching Prison Break and T-Bag had a son, who was LJ. I was reading something that said T-Bag had lied in prison about having sex with guys in there etc, and that LJ knew he was pretending. Also, Sucre had sacrificed himself and drowned and in a replay or something, I was wondering what they were going to do with Sucre since he was dead. Then some others and I, the others mainly from Prison Break, including Bellick, T-Bag and Eugene, were on the run. We went to this shop, which someone said was Ikea. The place was flooding and it had also flooded. The exhibits were on high platforms, under cover, but the rest of it was low down and outside and that was all flooded, so we could swim over to the platforms. There was a huge aquatic monster under the water which was passed out. We were running to get out. People were also in there after us. We got to the outside and there was a big gate which was locked. There was a fence all the way around it, which had glass on one side of it too. There was a little garden all along the inside of the fence. I found a head of a statue in the garden and started smashing the glass with it, it just left cracks and wouldn't smash. Sucre's cousin was outside as a guard, with the keys. One of the guys with us asked him to unlock it and he refused and I pleaded with him and said there was a monster right behind us and he looked worried and unlocked it. We started running and there was a long stretch of garden before you got the main road and we saw a police car drive past. I said that that was the first time in a long time they haven't stopped for us. Eugene realized The Company was waiting for us (and had made the police stay away from us) and he ran another way and we all followed. We ended up on this huge house block and there were big trees around and a fence around it. Eugene ran out onto this path behind it and some guys with guns chased him. This girl that was with us shot one of the guys through the fence. I reached through the fence and took his phone and gun. His phone was old like and it wasn't in colour (it had that greenish background and the plain black text). I put it in my pocket and asked the girl how to use the gun. She asked what I did know and I said ""I don't know, only what I've seen in the movies"". I pulled the bullet part out and some of the bullets were like rolls of camera film, which meant they'd been used. She went off and I pulled out this roll and it had bullets of different sizes (and they were battery like) in it. This girl was studying a road map of the house to work out how big it was and how many people were likely to be waiting around and the best way to get out. We ended up back at the Ikea and T-Bag told us to wait at this certain point just outside and then he started counting down and then there was a big roar. He had woken up the monster and it reached over the fence (over another side, but we worked out what was going on) and was taking The Company people."
"2631"	"(2009-01-30 (18)) I was watching Dexter, although it was something else at first. Dexter was with his sister and they were messing around and ended up having sex, a video camera was on and had recorded them. At first they were other people, I think and one of them said ""I can't kiss you, I love you"" and the guy smiled and pulled her close and they kissed. They left the apartment and the video of them started playing. Dexter banged on the wall to hide the sound. Dexter admitted to Rita and others that he was a murderer and Deb walked in angrily and said ""I slept with you!"" and Rita was shocked. Then I was at home and Mom and Ezra were there. Mom went out the back door to leave. This girl asked what I was doing this year and I mentioned MUPC and ""college"". Then I was at Mom's and she had this baby from next door over, I think, and it was noisy and I said ""shut up!""."
"2632"	"(2009-01-30 (18)) I was at school, which was different, for graduation. I saw some people wearing light pink gowns and I was told where to go to get mine. Elijah and I were complaining that they were pink. I saw Eugene there. The group of people I was with and I had white gowns though. Only a few were pink. I went to this place to get picked up. Seamus and Milo Ventimiglia were there. Milo asked what I was doing for the year and I said ""I don't know, thought I'd leave it to the last minute"". He asked if I did accounting last year and how I went and I said ""not very good"". I had my headphones from my iPod in my ears all this time and my ears were starting to hurt so I took them out. My ears still hurt and I couldn't hear properly out of my left ear. I checked the time on my phone and Milo leaned to look too. It was 4.14pm. I was thinking I'd go on IMDb and say 'Milo Ventimiglia went to my school'. I wondered why I hadn't made a fuss of it before. Mom and I went to Santiago's. We waited in the car and he handed me this sheet of paper with a list of songs on it and he wanted me to burn him a CD [burnt a CD for someone last night] . Grace Kelly was the first song on the list and he had ""Cold Pouring Rain -- Dragon"" and I figured he meant 'Rain'. Only some stations on the radio worked where we were, but they were all playing the same song. Next time we went there I gave the CD to Mom, who gave it to Santiago. He was talking loudly and fast. Some girl gave us these books with things to do for exercise but as they were expensive we just took one. It was just places to go which would require a lot of walking around and it was all stuff in the US or Europe; there were lots of pyramid places, giant mazes and museums."
"2633"	"(2009-01-31 (18)) I was watching Supernatural. I don't really remember it properly but Sam and Dean were both there. Then some others and I were shooting a TV show/mini-series/movie thing. It was about zombies. I was watching the first part of it and before this thing we were making there had been a prequel of what had happened before the show we were making and also some of the parts in between. In real life, this crazy fat girl was with us and I killed her friend or something and she was angry/upset with me and I suggested we tie her up. I locked something away in the safe. I changed the code so the other girl couldn't get in either. I changed it to 6456. The main character was a girl. The whole thing spanned years. Most of the movie used CGI. The sets were mostly green screen too. We were shooting a part in this small bushy area and I said ""the first bit of nature"". There was a weird possum thing in the tree. Then I spotted a giant lizard and some scraggly cat thing. It looked a bit like Cuddles. Mom said we should get 'Cuddles'. This scraggly thing was actually a boy and someone called it ""the father of her child"" (something to do with Cuddles). It kept chasing me. Mom had renamed her 'Princess' and Ezra was annoyed at this and said ""I'll kill Princess"". Then one of the characters looked like a young Chris Barrie. He got a call from some guy back home and said there was a pretend war going on. His scene included another guy, on top of a car. After the scene he said he'd been dared to put an extra knee up. Someone was saying how nice his hair looked, especially in that scene and said it was ""effervescent""."
"2634"	"(2009-01-31 (18)) I was watching Torchwood. Owen and Gwen were talking heatedly. It was some time after their affair had ended and Owen looked like he was getting angry and then they started making out."
"2635"	"(2009-01-31 (18)) It was the first day of the MUPC and it was right near where school is. It was a big place. There were about 20 people altogether and we were all staying there. We also had uniforms. There were three girls including me. The other two had done drugs and stuff in Year 12 and that was their reason for failing. There was a little booth outside and I asked the ladies behind the glass if I could change a subject, as I had drama, and I also had health as one of my subjects (it was like a normal school day). We had a fridge which would contain all our food. Elijah was also there. There is a Light That Never Goes Out was playing and I heard this of it: ""and if a ten ton truck kills the both of us, to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die"" and I was thinking there was something wrong with the lyrics (the two sentences are from different parts of the song)."
"2636"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was on IMDb reading about Six Feet Under and then was looking at Peter Krause's filmography and he wasn't in much. He was thanked for a narration on something."
"2637"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was watching Lost, although I'm not sure if it was, and Locke and others (from other shows as well) had to break into this giant shed, which had planes in it, in the middle of the forest. Some of them were on a plane and Locke was trying to distract the people outside. He was then on the roof and this girl up there suspected him and threatened to tell and there was a long drop to the bottom. They were both holding on to the edge and she let herself drop but he kept edging along to the water and when he got close he let himself fall. I was then there with some others, outside and it was night, and we had to get in. There were guards, but lots of bushes and things to hide behind along the way. We slowly made our way to the shed. This girl sacrificed herself so we could go (they arrested her, and then we snuck in while they were busy). I watched some comedy movie [it was new and Apatow like] . It was ok. Jack Black was in it and they had this thing to get rid of fire, which was a gigantic grey flap thing and he said it ""works like my kidneys"" and it was at the door or window and it 'breathed' and sucked the smoke and flames out. I was telling Ezra if he'd seen anything else similar to it. I went to the kitchen and Mom was there. I asked her if she had some food and Darren said ""pdf"" and he said it stood for ""do not prefer""."
"2638"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was on IMDb and I had my own page. I had been in a few things when I was younger, including Teletubbies. I also had a role in a movie from 2008 as 'agent'. Michael C. Hall was also in it. I didn't remember doing it. I was on my message board and I had a few comments. One guy was saying how I wasn't very good in some show I had been in when I was like four and because I'd been in another episode I must've known the director, as the same guy directed both those episodes. In the second episode I had a minor role as a dog and I barked once."
"2639"	"(2009-02-01 (18)) I was in the car with Mom and it was windy. There were these tent like buildings around, made of a thin see-through white material and as it was windy, these poles had been put in place to hold them and also gave them shape. Then Calvin and I were walking around outside. I wondered how deep the ""doopy things"" were and Calvin went and pulled one out and it was barely in the ground. He just dropped it and then we heard someone telling on him and he ran to put it back. This dude, who I thought was a teacher, asked him what his name was and he said ""Bluth, Michael Bluth"". We kept walking. Some parts were closed off and we had to take detours, but Calvin knew where to go so I followed him. We walked up this path which went up this hill and there was a rocky path. He suddenly jumped off the edge and I went to follow but realized it was a long fall and went to stop, but I slipped and was then hanging onto the edge. Calvin laughed. I started edging across until I got to a lower part and then I dropped off. A guy who looked like Bellick (Prison Break) was standing around and he had recorded it. I took a photo with my phone of the 'cliff' thing. Then we went to the Science Museum with Ezra. I said ""I haven't been here for years"". There was a poster on the wall when you first walk in, saying ""squeal for 12 seconds"". Calvin made a squeal and it was like a distorted echo and so I did one squeal. He kept going for a while. Ezra slowly came in after us and I motioned for him to come over. Everything was close together and it looked like Timezone. Two girls were playing air hockey and a guy was waiting for them to finish."
"2640"	"(2009-02-02 (18)) I can't remember properly, but my fourth top tooth on my left side was a bit loose. For years, whenever I touched it, it hurt. Dad got a 'bill' from a place for money from a song that I hadn't paid for and it cost like $900. I had to write some people down and Mom said ""she's got 15 people"". Dad thought I was going to blame Austin for the money. This all had something to do with my tooth. Ezra was there. We left there and I was with Mom and Ezra. I asked Mom which tooth and as she said a 'strong' tooth, I pulled it out. I wiped the gum and this black stuff was on it. I was watching Dexter, I think and Dexter and Deb were talking about their favourite 'team' or something and it was made up. There was something about Torchwood."
"2641"	"(2009-02-02 (18)) There were zombies. They were different though, some were fast, some just lay about, some were smart, some were crazy etc. Because of this people still called them people, instead of zombies. They could also open doors. I wandered into a house and there were some zombies walking around. Then there had been a large family there. They were running about and they were trying to guard the back door from them. Too many zombies were in though. Then I was there and I had a pole and a butcher knife. I stabbed them in the heart (they were killed from being stabbed in the heart). Some were harder than others so I had to slit the throat of one and stab him a heap of times. The house was small and I used this girl as a shield. I went to the back door and there were heaps of them. The girl screamed and slipped out, so I gave her a push and closed the door. Eventually, no-one else was around. I was closing and locking doors and turning off the lights. Then the house was different. It was big and I was with others. Some of it was very glassy. It was also night time. This black girl there was very bossy and she suggested we go outside to do something. Before we went I had locked all the doors. We went out and then we realized all the doors were locked and we couldn't get back in. It was a really nice house and it was pretty well designed. There were back lights everywhere and they were on. There were also buildings across the street, and some had lights on. We got in a car and drove through a brick wall of a different building across the street. We all climbed up and into a room on the second floor (hotel like). We sat on the bed, which was right at the wall. Some cars and motorbikes drove past. There was then a window where we had smashed through and it slid together and I was holding them together. I asked for someone to turn off the light but the black girl kept refusing. I kept asking and no-one would. I got an email from Simon Pegg who was surprised that I was dead and I replied ""yo, not dead"" and said that I was trapped because of a girl and ended the email with ""stay surviving!"". I let go of the window to type and then I had visions of people going past and opening it, which creeped me out. We decided to just stay here for the night and I was annoyed as it would've been nice at the big house and it was safer there."
"2642"	"(2009-02-03 (18)) I was in a shop. I had instructions from some bad guy to go to some shop, but I can't remember what it was called. I was on the phone to the person as I tried to find it. I found it and went in. It had wedding dresses on both sides of the shop, therefore obscuring the view from other shoppers outside the shop. I was told to knock out the person working there, so I kept hitting him over and over but he just got a bit groggy. Then I had to find some 'creature in the dark corner' and I found it and it was a white cat like thing. I don't know what it did, but then I heard police sirens. I used the back door of the shop to leave, which took me outside. The cops were already in the carpark and I had a thing to change my appearance and so I changed into a fat lady. They asked me some questions and then left me alone. I had taken my shoes off in the store and so sat down to put them on. I turned back to normal and then I ran from them. I had a gun and the bad guy told me to shoot the cops, so I shot two of them and then more came and I'd run out of bullets. I got close to a cop and pulled something off the gun, so he couldn't shoot. I got away from them. Then 'I' was a creepy guy with a moustache. He was staying at a ""halfway house"". People there thought he was dodgy. He had this huge room and never interacted with anybody. This little old man was starting to get suspicious and so the creepy guy invited him over. I thought he was going to kill him, but he was just trying to look friendly so they left him alone. The lady who worked there was also starting to get suspicious."
"2643"	"(2009-02-03 (18)) I was at school. There were lots of people and it was the first day back. I was trying to pick out the new Year 11's and Year 12's. There was a tall guy and a girl with big boobs wearing a low cut top. I couldn't remember the quickest way to leave and there were two sets of steps and I didn't know which one to go down. Then I was in the car in the carpark next to North Midvale with Daryl, who was driving. There were kids around and two of them walked in front and we waited for them to go across. They didn't so I got out and they very little and one was just walking into the side of the car and I said ""Go around, tard!"". Some teenage boys were around and they laughed. I got back in and we drove backwards, I saw something get flung across the carpark onto the oval (the long way of the carpark). Then we were walking. When we walked past, I saw the thing that had got flung was a baby/small kid, which was dead and had blood on it. We just walked past it. Samantha and others were with us too. We all had remotes for the X-Box 360 remote, which attached us to another person. I was connected to Daryl. We got to wherever we were going and then left and were walking again. We no longer had to stay together and the remote was plugged in to the back of my head and I pulled it out, which felt strange. I said ""that's been in there for 3 days!"". Elijah walked past and as he did he waved his jumper in front of me. I forgot who had walked past me and I thought 'was that Dmitri?'. Then I realized it was Elijah and we laughed. Then I was at school again and the MUPC was there. There were seven of us. People actually at the school were sitting at other tables. We were all seated around one. The guy teaching us said our first assignment was to find a female 'athlete'. The first girl who was asked who she'd partner up with and her Asian girlfriend, who was also in the class, did some sort of athletic activity so they paired up. This guy got asked and he said he didn't know anyone and the teacher said to ""get your head out of your ass"". Peyton (One Tree Hill) was there and she worked out and she thought the guy was dodgy so to save us both from getting paired with him, she paired up with me. We got called to this bar to watch something on the TV. It showed a nice looking waterfall in a nice forest, which the two winners of our class would get a trip to. It also included bungee jumping. Then there were clips of 'us' from our competing, which was in the form of a TV show. I looked like Eve Myles at first, then I looked like a different person, but was still a lot older (mid-20's). It showed 'me' in a forest, by myself and it was dark and spooky and something was making noises or something and I was making squealing noises. I was rating songs on my iPod, getting ready for the trip. The only song I remember rating was Blue Monday."
"2644"	"(2009-02-04 (18)) I had one day of school left. That morning though, I had no clean school clothes. I wore a white long-sleeved shirt under my shirt. I was at home and Dad and Ezra were there. I was making a microwave meal for breakfast. Ezra was in his bedroom had some giant thing that I don't remember attached to him and it was for MIS. There was a documentary on the TV about a dangerous monkey thing. It showed it eating and drinking at some water. A crocodile came and it bit it and then let go and then the crocodile left. The camera shifted to this other monkey in a tree and then I felt something scratch my back and I freaked out and woke up. When I woke up, I jumped and hit my elbow on the wall."
"2645"	"(2009-02-04 (18)) I was dating some guy and then we sort of broke up. Then it was One Tree Hill and he was Nathan and I was Haley. He had then slept with Brooke, in the four days they had spent apart, and he regretted it, but he didn't know whether to tell Haley. In real life, I was trying to sleep. Mom and Ezra kept waking me up. Dad came over to and woke me. I said I didn't get to bed until late. The first time they woke me up I'd only been asleep for about an hour."
"2646"	"(2009-02-04 (18)) I was at school but I didn't know why I was there. I, along with some others, got invited to spend some time with Barack Obama. He was doing a speech to some Europeans. This lady had written down some notes for the speech but he couldn't read her writing. I had a quick look and got 'inertia'. Her writing was very long, straight and close together. They then gave some people cue cards instead. Two of the important people left and he couldn't start his speech, so he tried to stall it. Calvin was there too. Obama was giving people prizes. He handed around a cardboard box full of little stuff. There was a Star Wars action figure in there, I took a pencil thing. When he finished, we got sent to a class to wait. Lorelei was talking to some black kid and said ""you're bi"" and proceeded to say how bad it is being gay and as I walked past, I said 'idiot' under my breath. I called Mom and told her to get me. Izaiah was in the room and he asked if I'd done some thing with Ms Myzshka (don't remember how to spell it) and I said no and he said he'd told someone that I had added her as a friend on Facebook and so I hadn't been allowed to do whatever the thing was."
"2647"	"(2009-02-05 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I had been dating some guy. We had to break up for some reason. I had this person/creature for some experiment. It got to the car and then we took it back. Some other people had better facilities and he decided to leave us to go with them. In the car I begged him (the creature) to come back. I was upset. I found out something and I was on Facebook and was trying to type an apology to Elijah because we had dated, although I wondered why I hadn't remembered about it before now."
"2648"	"(2009-02-05 (18)) I was out with some people, including Dad and the rest were adults too. It was night. Some guy had given me marijuana earlier. He asked when I was going to pay him back and I said 'you never said anything about payment, I didn't even want it' etc. Dad had given him some money before hand as well. I went home after that. Mom was there. Then I was near a forest-like park with Emery, his 'older brother' and someone else. It was still night. I can't remember what we did, but it was illegal and we saw cops coming and we all ran into the forest. I hid behind a tree, and Emery's brother hid behind another tree. The cops found Emery, then his brother and then me. They handcuffed them, but not me. I noticed my left shoe was on fire and I was stepping on it with my other foot to try and put it out, but it wouldn't go out. I don't know what happened to it though. I dropped my water bottle at the top of the hill near home. As the cop was doing something with Emery, his brother ran off. I almost went with him, but decided not to. I didn't say anything. When we went to continue walking home, the cop realized he was gone, but didn't bother looking for him. His brother came back though. Then he and Emery took off and came back again. Some people were complaining that they were naughty and having to take care of them. After I woke up (in real life), I discovered that Emery had gotten suspended for blowing up a lighter."
"2649"	"(2009-02-06 (18)) We went to a restaurant, like Retro Betty's. We were in two groups; one included Mom and the other had Dad and Ezra. Mom said ""We're here for Brad Pitt's birthday"" and the lady took us to a table that only seated four and I said 'no, we want to sit together'. She left and we all sat in this booth in the far corner. I had to sit next to Ezra. Then I was somewhere else and climbed up this ladder onto a platform. There were shopping bags up there, filled with lots of biscuits and chocolate snacks and bread. It was our shopping from weeks ago that we had forgotten about. I took all the bread out, as it was all moldy but took down the bags with the snacks and went to show Mom. She was next door. I went over and there was an old lady there and they made me take over the vacuum and vacuum this small patch of carpet in the lounge. They went into the dining room or something. There were two cockroaches on the kitchen tiles and I called out and told them but they said not to worry and continue vacuuming. Then I was playing a game, like Sims 2. I had to pick a setting for the Sim and other random stuff like that, as well as creating them. There were a few backgrounds which were really detailed, but they made it look cluttered and I couldn't decide on what to do. This guy told me to not try and make it fancy and just make it how I want it."
"2650"	"(2009-02-07 (18)) It was night, around 3am. I was at Mom's, which was different. My room had a door leading outside. There was a knock on the door. I didn't want to answer, so Mom did. It was a guy saying there'd been an accident and Simba was standing behind him and we thought he'd been hit. There was a car with a smashed light. Then Granma and Uncle Gabriel were around and we went to their place. There was a picture on the wall of some leader whose name started with an 'S'. It was an alien girl and I was thinking it was from a science fiction book. Then it was the next morning, I think, and a lot of people had died. There were ghosts (or something) of Dad and Ezra on the lounge. I thought they had died and I told them to touch my knee and they went right through it. It turned out that at some point last night everyone who was touching another person, skin to skin, had died. This also applied now. It showed a prison and a prisoner reached through the cell and touched the guard and they both screamed and died. I was then outside in a forest. There was a teenage girl and I went to ask her something and tapped her arm. She turned making an 'erggh' sound and her eyes started to bleed and she fell, but I was ok (it was later discovered that sometimes the 'dominant' person would be ok and if they were the 'same' they would be ok, I never really understood what the rules were). I ended up getting caught in the forest. The people there could put these things on their head so nothing would happen if they got touched. One of them looked like Sigourney Weaver. The leader guy told her to kill me, but she whispered to me to go along with her plan. She pretended to touch me and I fell to the floor, then it wasn't me and this other person touched 'my' leg to make sure. I later met up with Eugene. We were staying in a house together, sleeping in two single beds. After being together for a while, I was thinking that if I was going to die anyway, I may as well kiss him (not thinking that it could kill him) and so while we were talking, I leant over and kissed him, but we were both ok."
"2651"	"(2009-02-07 (18)) I was out the back of Mom's old house. There were round fat fish in the fish pond, which had legs and a face that was duck-like. I was talking to one of them and this guy was there, I think. Someone complained about waiting for Ezra and Dad. We were getting the money for MUPC together. Mom asked me something. I was later on my computer and my desktop was of Supernatural."
"2652"	"(2009-02-08 (18)) I started watching this show from the early 90's. It was set in a prison. They showed this guy and I said ""is that Bellick [Prison Break] ?!"" and I was thinking 'not again!'. In real life, he had been turning up in things I was watching."
"2653"	"(2009-02-08 (18)) It was my birthday or a little while after. We were at Mom's old house and I was in my room on my laptop/computer. My aircon was still in the window, but it was hanging out quite a bit, so I pulled it in a little. One of Mom's friends had given her a birthday present to give to me. It was a bracelet. I started complaining in disgust and told her to get rid of it. She told Ezra to put it in my room and I said to put it in the bin. I used one of those metal grabby hands to pick it up and I threw it in the bin in the kitchen. There were cones with chocolate eggs in them and I was eating one."
"2654"	"(2009-02-09 (18)) I was at a shop with Mom. The girl at the checkout was talking to Mom. I was looking down at the ground. I'd gotten a couple of lolly things and I said that I had been craving them. I looked up and realized the girl serving us had gone to one my schools for about a week or something. She didn't seem to recognize me. I was then on the internet and I was trying to find out stuff about Grey and what the toy was called. I found pictures of toy rabbits made by the same people. I read something about Facebook where this person had said ""it used to be MySpace, and now everyone is obsessed with Facebook"". Ezra still had his Grey and it had a tag with an internet address on it. I thought that was odd since the internet wasn't very popular when they came out. Dad and Ezra were watching a movie preview and it said 'shake it' and I thought 'they better not say 'like a Polaroid picture'' and then they said ""like a Polaroid picture"" and I said ""I knew he was going to say that!"" and was annoyed at Hey Ya. I found a site of some lady who would try and guess a word (to test out psychic ability or something). She had the word she guessed and the actual word. They were all really close. One of them was her guess was 'foot' and the word was 'food'. I was then walking with a girl outside. She could control people and so was making people do funny things. The cops were coming up the road so she made this person walk out in the road and almost got hit, so they came back and she made me start yelling at them. We got sent to a building. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were working there and they were the only people there. They interrogated us, but it was in the room in which you first enter the building. Jared got us to write down what had happened and Jensen did our fingerprints. The other girl finished first and it was my turn to get fingerprinted. Jensen called me over and I felt nervous. I asked if I just had to sit down and he said yeah. It was at a small table which was against the wall of that room, with one seat on either side. He did my prints, although it was only 3 fingers from one hand and two fingers from the other. Then we were having 'dinner', and I had two sandwiches except they looked like a CBA. We had a glass of yellow wine each. I dipped my finger in it and tasted it. It was sort of warm and I asked if could have water, saying I don't even drink coke and I was thinking of saying I don't even drink orange juice but couldn't be bothered. He convinced me to drink the wine, so I did. I was worried it was pee at one point. Then there was someone else there, I think, and they were worried that I was going to sneak off. Some real cops came and Jared told me to run now and I shrugged and kept eating. The person worried about me leaving mentioned they had cameras (so they would notice me leaving). Jensen and I finished the wine at the same time. He flirted with me a lot. A while later I needed to pee. I walked out of the building by myself and went to the toilet somewhere. I came back though. Jensen went to take a shower. I started exploring the place and I walked past the shower. It was open and he was facing away but he was naked, and I looked away and kept walking. There was a shelf with games and books on it and I recognized most of it from when I was younger. Jared and a lady joined me and I was going through the stuff going 'I remember this!' and excitedly looking at the stuff. Jensen came out, with a towel around him and asked what was happening. The others and I joked we were ignoring him and said ""let's go play Monopoly"". I then got a blood nose and when I turned around it splattered all over Jensen's towel. We started laughing. Jensen and I were laughing quite hard and I couldn't stop. I thought it may be because of the wine. There was a section with the recordings from the cameras and they were in video tape covers. One of them had 'Rose Red' written on it. I remembered misspelling Jared's name once as 'Jared Pinalecki'. I then woke up and I was in the passenger seat of a car. It was running and I was alone. It was daytime. I locked the doors. I had some of my dreams that I'd written down and I had a book where I was giving people character profiles. One of them said 'Guitar -- Dmitri' and I thought it was about Nathan Kohler. This guy in a grey shirt walked past the driver's window. I couldn't see his head though as it went higher than the roof. A little while later, he came back and started trying to open the driver's door. I still couldn't see his face. Although it was locked, it opened a little and I tried to pull it closed again. I was thinking I should start the car up and drive away."
"2655"	"(2009-02-10 (18)) I was at home. I woke up at 9am and called Mom to pick me up. She said she was busy and would get me soon. At one point, Valerie had come over. Farrah was talking to me in my room. I remember hearing a boy talking and thinking it was Jamison. I called at 7pm, as I was still there and she said she was out and I asked if Darren could get me. A few minutes later he came and got me. We were then at Mom's old house and I went to my room. My bunk was on the opposite side of the room and there were blow up dolls on it. I shared the bed with someone else. I then went to a Science Museum like place. It also had animals. They were able to leave their 'cages' and wander around. The rooms were huge and the doors were just frames, so you just walked through to each room. I was with Calvin, but he was sometimes Ezra. We were inside, at the entrance. I was taking photos of the animals. There was a fox like thing and I pet it through the cage. There was a cage with a rhino, although I don't even think it was a rhino, it was small. It came out of the cage and I jumped onto the reception desk (the cage was about a meter in front of it). The desk was higher than the rhino. The lady behind the desk complained as I had knocked some of her stuff. I got back down, but it came back and I jumped up again, knocking her stuff again. There were Sims 2 and 3 magazines on the floor. The rhino ate something off it. It started to walk around the desk and so I jumped off and snuck out of the room. Ezra was in the next room. I said the rhino was out and we frantically tried to find somewhere to hide. There was an 'exhibit' on the wall, which had a section in the shape of a door painted black. People would run/walk into it and it would look like they had disappeared. We ran into that, as I thought it would have a room behind it and the rhino thing wouldn't even see it. But, we ended up sitting in a plastic red tube with an opening. As the rhino would see us, we got out of it. There was another wall thing next to it and I 'opened' it but it was just this sparkly, colourful display. I thought that'd attract him so we went into the next room. It led back out near the entrance and I could see the rhino, which was now a big lizard-y thing (a dinosaur?) and was skulking around the desk still. There were two glass doors a few meters away (quite far from the lizard thing though). Ezra and I crept over to it, keeping ourselves low and opened the door. We ran down the sets of steps and continued running. Then I was with Calvin again and as I ran across the road we hailed a taxi, which was yellow. He talked to the driver through the window, about to give her the money and I started getting in the back seat. She told me to close the door and get out. Then she shouted at me ""Don't you know who I am?!"" and took the money and drove off. She was famous or something and she was known to just take money off people and drive off (that was how she worked). Then I looked over at the city and the 'rhino' was now a huge monster and was stomping around. I was thinking 'Cloverfield!'. We started running down the street, along with lots of others. Only a few cars were on the road. The city, though, was actually really far away."
"2656"	"(2009-02-11 (18)) I was at home. Dad was locking the back door. I was locking up the front door and some teenage boys were hanging around out the front. I closed the wood door quietly and Dad told me not to put the chain on yet incase they heard it. I suggested we put the aircon on so that the curtains would stick to the windows and therefore block the view. He said it would attract them. Then I had my own house thing. It was like glass all around. I was outside and it was night and I asked Dad to walk me to it. The door was open and the light was on inside. It had been trashed. Dad said that it smelled. It was just a big lounge room; I don't remember seeing any other rooms. There were yellow bags and towels that had stains on them. It looked like someone had had a party. I asked him to help clean. It had a sliding door and I pushed them together and put Blu-Tak in the middle of them to hold them together. People kept coming and I kept shooing them away. Calvin came and I let him in. I was cold and I touched his neck for some reason and it was warm. Mom came later. Samantha came as well and I let her in. We ended up getting a security guard, who was Anastasia. The house/room ended up full of people. It was now a shop. There was a food shop to the left side of the entrance; the rest of the shop was just a walkway I think. I was telling people they had to leave. There was a scary Native man and I said ""Excuse me sir, you have to leave, no-one's allowed here"". This girl walked out of a checkout and as she walked through the scanner things, it beeped and she quickly showed the person behind the counter something inside her bag and then hid it back in there. I went over and asked what it was and she wouldn't tell me. I grabbed it and opened it and she called out for help. I said ""it's my store!"". It was a heart rate monitor and someone else came for a closer look and she snatched it from me and swallowed it. I was thinking that I swallowed 'In a Big Country' once. I saw someone walking as if they'd just entered the shop. It looked like Rodney so I called out ""Rodney!"". He turned around and I told him to leave and he said ""Why do we have to leave and how'd you know my name?"". I said ""I know your brother [Eugene] "", he said ""Pants off"" and I looked at him strangely and then asked ""Did you say pants off?"" and he said ""Yeah, everyone knows him with his pants off"". I laughed and said ""No, I don't know him with his pants off""."
"2657"	"(2009-02-13 (18)) I was at some meeting thing and we had made food. This lady had some chicken thing and it looked really nice and I told her that. Later, I couldn't find my iPod and I realized I'd left it in her bag. I went to her house and broke in with someone else. I wanted a game off her computer so I plugged in the iPod to transfer it but I had trouble finding it. She came home and I got my friend to stall her. She left again though and I just left after that, without the game."
"2658"	"(2009-02-13 (18)) Ezra and I shared a computer, at the same time though. I was playing Runescape and left the computer for a second. When I came back he was also playing Runescape in a different window. We played with the windows side by side. I was annoyed at this setup because I couldn't listen to music. I could hear the faint sound of cats meowing and I thought it was Kiki. Mom and others sent a list of cats they had sold and points they had gotten for each one and also an intelligence rating. Mom's intelligence rating was high and it said that because of the rating it was, she could own three cats (which was supposed to be a high amount). Tabby cats got no points."
"2659"	"(2009-02-14 (18)) I was at the cinema and I saw a movie and when it finished I called Mom to get me and she said she was on her way. I was then waiting outside the cinema for Mom (although sometimes it was a school).  There was a very orange cat on the opposite side of the road. This guy came and stepped on its head, squishing it. I got upset, angry and scared. I climbed up this scaffolding thing (others were sitting around on it too) to get away. I sat there for a while but then I didn't know how to get down and I asked this girl near me. She said to just jump. I jumped down and then waited for Mom. In the movie, I think, I was walking in a forest. I think sometimes it was someone else and in the movie, sometimes it was me in real life. I was yelling to someone and they shouted back from a distance. In the background I could hear breathing. I found a clearing. This girl had a friend (a loner she had befriended) who wandered off into the bush all the time. There had been a nuclear bomb or something and I can't remember properly, but I think the loner had slipped and hit her head and this had turned her into a werewolf. There was a baby and I said ""ugly baby"". Mom said ""Yeah that is an ugly baby"". I was thinking I'd never heard her call a baby ugly. In the distance, I could see the city burning."
"2660"	"(2009-02-14 (18)) I went to 'Subway' with Mom. I was going to get a soup but Mom decided to get me a pie. Mom said ""that boy came over sometime"" and I saw Eugene sitting a few tables away staring over his shoulder at me. He was with Bradley, Jeremiah and others. I said I knew them from school. I was wearing my new brown shirt and Eugene was wearing the same one. The pie had almost 40 grams of fat in it and I said I wasn't going to eat it, but then I took a few bites. I got my phone out and put it on silent and changed the settings so I could take some sneaky pictures of Eugene. He had some facial hair now, but it was pretty hot. They then left, but Jeremiah and Mom got into an argument. I ended up going with Eugene and we went in his car with his father driving. We stopped somewhere and Eugene looked around at us, stared at me for a second and I went to get my phone ready again. Then we kept going and we went to his house. His father Abraham said we were welcome here and I could see a park just up the road. I pretended not to know where we were. I was thinking this was the best idea I'd ever had (going with Eugene instead of Mom). We were standing outside but then we were like, underneath the road but could see through it and Eugene was doing something to it (can't read my writing). I again tried to take a photo. Then there was a movie and it had Eugene dressed up as a lumberjack standing next to a good-looking fireman guy, and it was a test for women (most picked the fireman)."
"2661"	"(2009-02-15 (18)) I went to University. I went with a couple who were really chatty. One of them was going to work in a different country. Dad sent me a text with names of songs and told me to act confident. My class was math and it was like the introduction. We had a male teacher and he gave me a problem, but I had no paper or books so he gave me paper. Then he began talking about Africa and how people from TV shows went there and he mentioned someone from Heroes. As we left, I think, I was with some people and Raj (The Big Bang Theory) and others were standing next to me. Raj was talking to someone and then realized he was talking with girls around. Then someone thought I liked my teacher and I was thinking 'ew, he looks like Ric Ocasek' and 'All I Wanted' was playing. I was walking to the library and I saw Darius hanging around near it. I went in and was on the second level. It was small and there were a couple of shelves with a few books on them. It was crowded with young kids and they were there for a speech. The teacher closed the door and so I opened it and left. I walked down and went to the lower level. There was a shop in there and it was huge and the section next to me was girl's clothes. I was thinking it was bigger than the K-Mart we'd been in the other day. There was another girl with me and she was like 'whoa'. I was going to take a photo of the place to show Mom but the menu on my phone was different and I didn't know what to do. I turned off the sound first and then got confused. There were lots of people. I was walking around and I was in the men's section and there was a long sleeved shirt and I touched it and it was really soft. It was $100. Then this lady discovered the girl I was with wasn't with the University and asked me if I also wasn't and I said ""I'm a student"". I walked around to the desk later and it was the lady who had caught the girl out. I said I needed to get my ID card and she took me to the computer area."
"2662"	"(2009-02-18 (18)) I was watching some G-Rated movie. I can't really remember it, but these kids lived in a big house. One of them accidentally broke a mirror or window and the person they lived with was angry. A while later the maid (or something) smashed some glass and told off the girl who had broken the glass earlier and she got in trouble for it instead of the maid. Then two people were in a room. They weren't allowed in there and someone was coming. Then I was one of them and we got into the closet and hid in there. The door of the closet started opening but when I looked out, the room was different and nobody was in there. I was thinking the movie was just a rip off of Chronicles of Narnia. There were Pokemon around. For Mewtwo to be 'free', I had to rub him against something until an extra 6hp was given to his opponent. Then I was playing a game and I said ""Is this like Super Mario Galaxy?"". I was in a shop like place and I walked into this room and there was a werewolf in a chair and he said something funny and ""my name is Fred"". There were zombies too, but they were joke-like. I had to paint stuff in the room to get to the next room. I had red and yellow paint. I got to the next room and there were three guard dogs but they were friendly. In real life, Ezra had a friend over. We picked them up from their house. We thought he wouldn't come, but he did. Mom was driving. We went to the cinema. The seats were in weird places, some facing the back of the cinema as well. It was pretty full and a big room. Calvin was sitting in a backwards seat right near where we walked in and he said to sit next to him and I said no. While we were talking, a lady (who I thought was his mother) asked why I was moving like that (I was trying to crack my back) and I said I had a ""sore back"". She said that's why I should eat Broccoli, because it was good for muscles and I said that it was my favourite vegetable. I sat down in a chair on the other side of the cinema. On the screen, Lost was playing. I only saw Sawyer and it had already started (it was actually the movie that I had been watching before) and then it said the movie we'd come to see started in 7 minutes."
"2663"	"(2009-02-19 (18)) I was in a big room on a computer. Nana was nearby. I was behind the desk facing her. She thought I was masturbating and told Dad and he was like 'Well, she's 18, why not?' etc. I kept trying to convince her that I wasn't and that I wouldn't do that, it's disgusting etc. She emailed me later apologizing for overreacting, but refused to believe I wasn't actually doing it. Later meetings were awkward."
"2664"	"(2009-02-19 (18)) I was in the car with Mom and we were driving. Darren was at her window as she drove along and I asked how he just stayed there. We went to this guy's house and there were cops across the road. The guy got in and Mom took him around the corner. I was watching Penn & Teller: Bullshit later and they were walking towards and then down a step. They walked past this guy and Teller was taller than him and I remembered that Teller was actually normal height and the guy must be pretty small. Penn still towered over Teller like normal."
"2665"	"(2009-02-19 (18)) I found a site which had photos of Westland University students. I found mine. I wondered what Brent's last name was and there were a few Brent's, so I just clicked on Brent Palmer, thinking I'd heard that somewhere before, but there was no picture for him so I gave up. I found a State University site which had photos of their students so I looked for Eugene's photo but I couldn't find it."
"2666"	"(2009-02-20 (18)) I can't remember anything else, but Teller had a weird house."
"2667"	"(2009-02-20 (18)) I was watching a movie with Ezra. A girl was waiting for a guy on the beach. It was night. She lay down to wait. She started to rub her belly button with her finger and then put her hand in her pants. She grabbed something and put it in her pants and turned over and masturbated. Then she pulled it out and it was this bit of watermelon and she called it a 'bon bon' and ate it. Then I was with some people and we were mucking around, throwing things etc. Then I was naked and holding a blanket to cover myself. Then there was something about how years ago, some guy from the sky told these people something. Then he told some guys that in the past only two women were given a wish and they wanted to get married. Then everyone was allowed to get married and there was a lot of resistance from men and it cost a lot."
"2668"	"(2009-02-21 (18)) I was somewhere and this guy was there that looked like Andy (One Tree Hill) and I asked ""are you the guy in One Tree Hill?"" and he smiled and said yeah and I said ""Andy?"" and he said yeah. A few minutes later I asked if he had been on Lost too and he confirmed it. I was then a bad guy. I later remembered he had been in Prison Break too and lots of episodes of The Outer Limits but I didn't annoy him about it. Poppa had bought Poppers a new spa. Their house was different and in like a Mexican village. They were going to put up a second floor for him. Dad was there. We were on the balcony. I told Nana it was silly because Poppers couldn't walk up the stairs. There were chickens in cages behind me."
"2669"	"(2009-02-21 (18)) Two people and I went to a park at night for a meeting. I can't remember properly but we had no money or a place to stay. This nervous guy gave me a note and then walked off. It said to not turn around and that snipers were about to execute us. I saw a red dot on one of the people I was with and I said ""get down!"" and we ran out. I had weapons so I was shooting back at them. One of the snipers died and the other was ok. I searched the dead guy and it was like Fallout 3 and I took his stuff and then killed the other guy. I told my friend to search him."
"2670"	"(2009-02-21 (18)) I was watching Lost. This actress (can't remember who) kissed this guy underwater and I thought ""that looks like Ethan (Lost)"" and it was. She said he tasted nice and he said ""I didn't think you liked the taste of cigarettes"". She thought he tasted like soap. There was an interview with the actress and she said she was shocked at how turned on by the kiss she was. Then I was somewhere else and there were room. A Nightmare on Elm Street movie was playing in one of them. I went in and Ethan was like ""try to attack me"" so we closed the door. It changed to House of 1000 Corpses and there was a party for New Years or something. Mom was there. Hancock was the only movie on TV. There was a baby on the screen and it was when they did a dance, but it was near the end [made up storyline for it] . Mom said ""it's near the end"". Then I was on an island with some others. There had been a plane crash and it was like Lost. We had locked ourselves in this big enclosed outside area, as we thought 'others' were around. There was a hole in the door and I saw an eye peering through and then went away. I said ""Did you see that eye?"". As I walked up to the door, two girls hugged and kissed. I looked through the hole and then the eye came back up to it. It was a blue eye. I asked if it was Ben (Lost) because the eye looked like it belonged to Michael Emerson. He asked if I was Izzy. I stood back in shock and we let him in. He looked and sounded like Michael Emerson, but it wasn't. Then it was a show/movie. This lady, who I think was Gwen (Torchwood), lost her son and husband in the crash. She hadn't had a chance to cry yet and then I was her and I started crying. It felt good. Then it was the movie again and Mom was watching and she was like 'pfft, she's just looking for attention'."
"2671"	"(2009-02-22 (18)) I was watching Lost. Ben, Jack and someone else were around. I think Ben had set up all these things they had to do before they could get back to the island. They went into a building and this guy they needed, got in trouble because he had some metal thing in his back and when he walked through the sensors, they had detected it. They were supposed to go and rescue some person in 84 minutes, but then another person was in trouble and they had 30 minutes to help them. A bomb was going to go off. Ben, Jack, someone else and I ran out of the city and up this hill and across this thin bridge. I asked ""Is this far enough?"" and ""Why do we have to cross this bridge instead of just running across the hill?"" Ben said that there were 'too many chances for bad options'. The bomb went off. There was a red 'bubble' over the city and then over us. We went orange. Ben said it was just a light now (instead of a bomb) because we had gotten something from the island (and so were ok). Someone showed off to this girl later that they had stopped the bomb. I was then in a comic book shop with others. The shelves were really neat. I was told to 'steal' this card but then the mother of a person I was with, ushered us out. I put my phone down on the shelf and then when we got to the exit I said I'd left my phone and ran back to get it and took the card as well. As we left the alarm sounded and the gate of the shop went down. Police were around and they had their guns out. I handed over the card and got arrested. I was waiting with a cop's daughter at a computer. They sorted out the arrest and then we walked with her. As everything was weird I asked ""Are we in Spain?"". We got to a car park. He told her to stop and he had a gun with a red bit on it, at her head. She was like 'you're not going to shoot me' and then he did. I ran and opened the door to a taxi (that was driving) but it was the opposite side of the driver (American car). He pulled a gun on me, so I let go. Then this weird carriage like car was there and this weird guy was sleeping in it. I pushed him out and driving it with my foot all the way down and it could only go a maximum of 40km/h. I was going down a dark, forest-y road. I got to a deli and then it was day. I asked the guy if I could borrow a car and I had little money. He said ok. Most of the cars there were manual but there was a van which was auto and manual. These guys came with guns and the guy and I pushed a van in their way. I ended up pushing it on top of a bad guy and he laughed and was like ""now you'll squish my hands"". I shot this other guy. The deli guy got shot and I apologized and he said it was ok. As I was walking around, most of the people at the deli were dead. There was a car, which was obviously a girl's car, which was an automatic. She was nearby, dead, and I took her pink shoes and then her car. I can't remember properly, but we went up there later and gave the car back"
"2672"	"(2009-02-22 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was watching a movie with Tom Hanks [watched You've Got Mail last night] ."
"2673"	"(2009-02-23 (18)) I can't remember much, but Dennis (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) was somewhere and he was being arrogant. There were girls around."
"2674"	"(2009-02-24 (18)) I was at 'school'. Some of my classes were with Ezra. They had light blue shirts with a giant paw print on them. Then, Mom (although she seemed different) and I found a way to go back in time. We had to like run through a field. In the middle of the field, I had to grab this rope and pull myself along the grass (I was lying down on it). It was hard to do. Then I was somewhere else, in some water. There were men there from say, the 1800's and were pirate/captain-y like. They were also in the water and they couldn't see me, but could feel me and so I had to make sure they didn't touch me. They walked near me and I went under the water. This cat was watching me. They followed the cats stare and saw me lying on the bottom of the water, but they actually saw me as a black bear. Then I was in a room, near the door. A friend of Mom's was coming over and she told me to say that I was her sister. I looked through the side of the door (where the hinges join) and saw a girl standing in the hall. She asked who I was and Mom said ""my sister"". A while later I took my clothes off to do something. Then Santiago, Mom and Darren came in and I asked Mom for a shirt. Then, I was outside somewhere. Charlie (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Liam McPoyle (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were there. We were messing around. Charlie was in some water and Liam was being creepy. Charlie was going to chase me, so I ran. I ran into this castle like place and was trying not to laugh, but I was also worried about him catching me. I tried to lock the front door but it was too hard so I ran around the corner into a hallway for the toilet. I closed the first door, but it wouldn't lock, so I ran to the next door and tried to lock it. It wouldn't lock at first, but then it did. But, it was low down and there were cubicles of toilets behind me. Someone came in and it was Liam. He looked over the top. I was fairly exhausted by this point and said ""Nooo, I need to pee!"". I couldn't stop thinking 'Rose Red!' when I saw him. I'm not sure what this was, but there was a car crash. The guy ran out to protect his girlfriend and then the car blew up. Then she saw 'herself' run to the car to save her boyfriend. They were dead, but didn't know that."
"2675"	"(2009-02-24 (18)) I was at a place looking for help with a 'school project'. It was a sheet of paper with questions about boating. One of the questions was about George Clooney's wife. Everywhere I looked, it said he was married to an Asian lady, but there were no photos of him and an Asian lady. I had joked they had taken all the answers to the questions off the net. I was near some water (the ocean I suppose) and there was a blob in the water. These guys blew it up and this guy's house was really close to the edge of where they blew it up. He had a dog as well. The house was ok though. I looked down at the water and saw this grey thing quickly swim past underneath. I said ""It's Cloverfield!"". I knew some people there, sort of. One of them was a captain. He had two daughters and brought some of his crew along. One of them was a hot blonde guy. I had built this huge boat thing. It was boat like on top of the water, but underneath it was this weird, huge area. To get onto the boat, you had to climb up this ladder, which had metal steps but was attached by a rope. The captain said it was awesome but that if the ladder hit a rock it could break. The blonde guy kept saying 'awesome' and then when we actually got onto the boat, it was a living area, and I had a huge TV in there and the blonde guy said ""Again, awesome"". I had a radio at the front and shelves on the side with black boxes, which was sea equipment. The radio had a tape in it, someone started playing it and it was a diary of mine. I stopped it and rewound it. I had told them earlier I had made it myself, but I remembered that Dad and Poppa had helped me with the rope leading to the area underneath and I mentioned this to the blonde. I had this electronic thing on the outside for people to sign in and it also kept records about the people. I added the captain's eldest daughter (she was 16) onto it. Her last time was 'Cook'. She was then making out with the blonde dude and I interrupted them so I could get a photo of her to put with her profile. I decided to put the blonde guy on there too and I said ""what's your name?"" and I couldn't understand what he said, so I asked him to spell it and he said ""O-W-A-R-E"". That was his first name; I don't remember his last name. I took a photo of him and it was blurry and looked like a black lady and I thought that was weird so I tried to take another. He said that wasn't a good idea (he now had an accent), but I did anyway. I took a quick glance at the photo and realized he was this black lady, who was evil, who he had asked me earlier to help (he was disguised as a blonde guy, I'm not sure how). I pretended not to look at it and left. He tried to follow me but then 'realized' I didn't see it. I went down the rope and everyone else was down there. I said that he wasn't who he says he is. The underground area is hard to describe. It was like underwater, but we could breathe and sometimes it wasn't underwater. We couldn't float though, we walked on the ground. It was extremely tall, and there were rows of huge shelves in a dark part of it. Near the rope, there was a machine which could show you 3D layouts of cities underwater and the rocks underwater. Anyway, blonde guy came down as the black lady. There was a darkish skinned guy down there and he was supposed to be, who the blonde guy was pretending to be (his role in the crew had been taken over by blonde guy). He wasn't as hot as the blonde guy, which disappointed me. The black lady threatened to cut the rope and I was thinking that we wouldn't last long down here. But she then ran off really fast. The youngest daughter of the captain's, I think her name was Molly, was holding a little black kitten. She was between 4-8 years old. She was running by herself trying to find somewhere to hide and kept throwing the kitten to hide it, but it came back. She hid in a hole with it eventually. The crew came and they were looking at her. The captain said something about the black lady's sister (the black lady was standing next to him, disguised as a white person) and then turned the gun on her and shot her three times. It shocked everyone, including myself. My heart was racing."
"2676"	"(2009-02-25 (18)) I was watching a movie, although it was real sometimes. It was at a carnival. Two people had died and were now ghosts. They were trying to recreate the death with someone (when it was real, this person was me). Some people came and we went into the back room to do it. There was an oven in the corner and it was on. I had to climb over it, I think, and there was no room to move and it was hot. I was then a doctor and on the street. I had a table/bed thing. I needed to do an emergency surgery. I got this little blowup black pillow and put it on the end of the bed. I told people to get ready because I had to go pee. I went into the toilet cubicle. Then I was driving with Mom and I think we got lost. I was talking to Mom and Ezra and she was telling us about a dream she had and Ezra was getting angry, shouting ""I don't care!"" and I said ""I do""."
"2677"	"(2009-02-25 (18)) Eugene and I started dating. I was really happy about this, also because he was in so many dreams of mine and they wouldn't go to 'waste'."
"2678"	"(2009-02-26 (18)) I was at school. There was an assembly in some room. I was with Calvin and Samantha and we were sitting near Daryl, but then we got moved off to the side and were a little bit closer to Eugene. This boy (around 6 years old) was on the stage reading something. He could barely read. Later, I was planning for an exam/essay for English and I needed to think of romantic comedies. I put down You've Got Mail since it was the last movie I watched but couldn't think of any other romantic comedies that I'd watched recently, thinking they were all 'science fiction and horror!'. Dad suggested Notting Hill and I said that I didn't really remember it and wanted stuff I'd watched more recently."
"2679"	"(2009-02-26 (18)) I was talking to Mom about Smallville and that sometimes it was more of a 'romance' and then it would go to 'science fiction' and back and forth. I said it was lame at the moment. Some story involved a teen black girl. The actress had recently said she was 35 and everyone was chucking a spaz saying she was too old."
"2680"	"(2009-02-27 (18)) I went to Centrelink or something with Mom. It was a HUGE building. It was very confusing to get around. Mom went off somewhere. There was a computer section and a lot of people were on them. I had to climb over some at the end and ended up on this path which was covered in old water bottles and mess from Ezra. I walked down and found the room I was supposed to go to and waited outside. A few seconds later my name was called out. I realized I'd forgotten to bring ID and I said to the lady that I'd be right back. I ran out and ran across the carpark to the car and then realized I didn't have keys. I ran back and went into the room with them. I sat down at the desk and apologized. Mary Lynn Rajskub was one of them. The first question they asked was about how her character (Chloe) from 24 affected me. I said something like she was a good character and was a good role model (I put together quite an eloquent little speech). They looked quite happy with it. At the end of the interview or whatever it was, they said I could bring in the ID later. I was thinking that I didn't want to try and get around this place again. Mary Lynn Rajskub then remembered that last week (or some recent time) I had met her and had a photo taken. She had a copy of the photo, and I had almost been cut out of it (some random had taken the photo). She said I could use that. There was now a new shortcut to leave the place. The path that had been messy was now clear, but had lots of ants and cockroaches. I had to walk through it and climb over the computers again to find Mom. I told Mom that you could now just 'click on the place on the map' and you could instantly teleport there. We left through the shortcut. Later, we were going for a drive and Ezra was coming. Mom told me to sit in the back so he could sit in the front and I said no and sat in the front."
"2681"	"(2009-02-28 (18)) I was at a shop with Mom. I was bored. I saw Dad and Ezra there. There was a men's jumper that I liked so I tried it on but if fit strange. Then I was at a train station. There were lots of little platforms, instead of one big one. They were quite small and I was on one and I almost fell onto the track. I went on another and a train was coming towards me and it looked like it was just going to hit me. Then they were planes. There was a plane crash in there. I had been on it. We discovered quickly that some people were turning into zombies. Someone I knew (a family member) was a zombie. I don't remember who it was. I ended up by myself driving a car. It was American style. I decided to find Eugene. I went to his house and there was a dog out the front. It barked at me. I knocked and Eugene and his father Abraham answered. His father was black and Eugene was a bit darker which I thought was weird because I hadn't noticed before. I said there had been an accident at 'Caircock' airport or something and that there were zombies. I said ""Have you seen 28 Days Later? They're like that but on ecstasy!"". I had heard the ecstasy thing in a movie tagline before. They called someone who told them it wasn't true. Somehow I convinced them to come with me. We went somewhere and there were lots of people I had to pick up. Eugene's father Abraham got killed and ran after the car as a zombie. The people I had picked up wanted to stop at a post office thing on the street. I stopped and they got out and zombies were coming so I took off and left them there. There was lots of traffic on the road and I think I was just driving over it. I looked behind and saw that driving over had killed people in the cars and they were now all scattered around, hurt and bloody. I went to a big shop. We were trying to hide from the zombies. We went into a clothes shop and there were lots of cubicles, but they were low. I hid in one closest to the wall and Eugene was in the one next to me. We had to crouch right down so we didn't stick over the top. The worst zombie we'd seen so far was this young girl who could think, but when she talked it just came out as gibberish. She looked over at Eugene, then me and we stayed still and she left. We waited a while and then I looked over at the door, then under the door and then looked up at the door and her face was peering over at me and I screamed ""Bahhh!"" and I attacked her with something and ran out of the cubicle. Her face looked all cut up and weird. I looked for an axe but there weren't any. There was a capsule on the wall, with a ladder in it, leading up. I thought about climbing up but it looked too much of a tight fit. I looked for a fire safety thing. I found fire blankets but no extinguisher. I found a blowtorch lighter thing and I threatened her with it. I then lit her shirt on fire, but she just pinched it and put it out. I tried again and she did it again. I managed to get her in the corner. The walls were lined with clothes and there were also two round clothes racks near her, so I lit them on fire. Then this black cop guy came and saved her and I was like 'what are you doing?!'. But I figured at least I was ok."
"2682"	"(2009-03-01 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I were going across the country. I had organized to see the Dylan Moran thing there as he was not coming to my town. It was happening the same night we were to arrive. The show was starting in ten minutes but we hadn't left yet (it only took a few minutes to get there by plane). Dad said he didn't want to drive me there. I realized I didn't have my ticket. Dad got angry and I said I rushed while I was packing. We got to our destination and to the hotel. It was like a motel though and all the doors were accessed from an outside balcony. Dad had picked the room on the edge but we had to open this gate to get to that side of the balcony and it opened up weird on the edge and made it hard to get in. Ezra and I complained about it. There were three bedrooms, all straight after each other with no doors, but there were curtains (you walk into hotel room, then first bedroom, walk through then the second bedroom etc). One was at the very back of the room with one bed, then the middle had two single beds and the closest one had one single bed. The blankets were red. I lay down on one of beds in the middle room. Ezra said he wanted that room and I said that he could sleep in the other bed, but this was my room. I then remembered about the Dylan Moran thing and it was 30 minutes past the beginning. I got my clothes and went to get dressed and I couldn't find any rooms with doors anywhere so I went to the toilet. I flushed the toilet and it started pouring out water and I said to Dad ""the toilet prolapsed"". I found a receipt for my ticket and it had a barcode on it, so it was ok. We went out and then realized Dad didn't have a car here. We looked for a bus and I said I had no idea how to use the bus, except to go to University to ""I can't remember... Leach Highway?"". Then an hour had passed. I was then with Mom in the car. We were driving down the street and it was night. I saw a big statue of Green Man on top of a pub. I said ""Green Man!"" and Mom laughed and I explained that a character (Charlie) in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia dressed up in that. I looked at my receipt and realized it started at 8.30, sometimes it was 8, and it wasn't time for it yet. Also, it was the 30th of whatever month it was. We drove past a theatre with posters for Dylan Moran on it."
"2683"	"(2009-03-02 (18)) I was with a friend who did stuff on the radio sometimes. He was trying to pick up girls. He was talking to this girl for a bit. She was quite pretty and nice. He was walking to a bedroom and saw two 'hot' women on a bed in another room so he decided to go to them. He pretended he was with the radio and they became interested in him. The nice girl came in and saw them and was upset. She talked to some guy later and I told him she was interested and gave him her number. I said ""that's her [something] number if she teleports to France,"" and he said ""why France?"". Later, it was night. I was at a computer shop with Ezra. He wanted to steal something and was using a quote from The Big Bang Theory and he said he had watched the last episode. We got to the counter but I kept laughing. Then we were spies or something and we were with a guy. We were sitting down and listening to something. He had his arm around me and I rested my head on his arm. I overheard a conversation, which sounded Arabic, and realized that the people were waiting near our car to kill us. We were thinking that we'd have to walk away and that it was far. It was spooky and dark outside. There were stairs leading down underground where our cars were."
"2684"	"(2009-03-02 (18)) I was walking outside on the street behind North Midvale. There were lots of little kids behind me. The street was a lot wider. This kid who was younger than the others walked out onto the road and a car was coming and I grabbed her. Then a big, brown oil truck thing pulled up. The driver left. A female cop came and I was now with some other people. She wasn't wearing a uniform. The cop told us that we had to go in. There were bits moving inside everywhere. She said we had to tip the truck to move it so everything would click together. We refused. Charlie Day was there too. Mom was there as well but she was different. There were some photos on the wall; one was of Mom and Rob McElhenney and the other of me and Charlie Day. I was near the door and I leaned on it and there was a knock. I said it was ""the driver"". He said we were supposed to tip it, so some of us did. We made it go to one side and the furniture started clicking together. Then we turned it another way. Charlie was sitting on a lounge reading something and I called out to him and he realized what we were doing and was surprised. As we tipped down near him, I ruffled his hair and laughed."
"2685"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I was at a school. I don't know why I was there but I was bored and I discovered that a combination of pickles, these long sleeping pills and something else caused you to see ""koalas in trees"". So I took one. I text Mom to ask how much 'paste' there was. I felt tired. I saw Elijah there."
"2686"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I woke up and I was at home. I was thinking I would call to leave as it wasn't my home and then I thought 'What am I thinking; I've been here 15 years?"" Someone said there was a guy called Ethan Coatzee and then said he was ""Preston Garfield"". I saw a shadow on the front door and I got up to run and said ""Get out of my house"". There was a person there and I unlocked the door and ran next door. This guy opened the door and let me in. There were quite a few people scattered around. There were some people at a table and I explained that people had taken over. He said ""nice place your father's got"" and I said ""That's what I thought"". Then it was a game. Ezra was playing too. We had to find clues. There were steps outside and this guy was going down and disappearing. We got this thing at the end, which led to three other things. We got others to do them but the white shard was right [that's what it says, have no idea what it means] . Then it was a movie and Mom was there. This girl got pregnant. She told her mother and she told her to get an abortion by going on the train tracks. Then the train tracks had a special area for people who wanted abortions or to commit suicide. You had to hold on to something and it would electrocute you. I think she was telling her mother she had decided to kill the guy and it was her first time."
"2687"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I was on the oval near North Midvale, and there were two small concrete slabs (maybe 3m2) near the other side, close to the road. I remembered there had been a small shack on one of them and we had written stuff on the outside. Mom said she didn't remember. Someone said they should put ""useful, like a gym"". I took the bus to university and it dropped me off right outside where I needed to go. There was a very long line nearby. There was also a policeman around. I walked in and found the class. It was totally different and I discovered I was actually doing three subjects, included Communications 2. I went to my class. I had an Asian lady as a teacher. The task was we had to put drawings up on the board. She also mentioned something about zombies and when you get given something to find and then you put them all together? It reminded me of the shack. I got given a 'secret' task. Two guys in the class were gay and were touching and kissing each other. This other guy told them to stop because it was 'disgusting'. I told them to shut up and everyone gasped. They were shocked and asked why. I said ""leave them alone, who cares? If it were two girls who'd be like 'yeah, fully sick',"". They confirmed this. I'm not sure what happened next, but I ended up in a building and this guy who I didn't get along with was there. He ended up raping me although I didn't remember it. Some guy had shoved something up my butt and I could only eat lobster because it wouldn't make me poo. I was then back at school. I hadn't told anyone who had done it yet. I was in a room with him again and he tried to rape me again and I attacked him. Ezra was there too and he helped me. We managed to hurt him and he was lying on the floor, barely able to move. I found a big dildo in the room and was going to shove it up his butt. Then Evelyn was in there and I tried to get her to do it while I held the curtains shut. Her sister came soon after. Charlene was then there too and she was trying to look outside and kept pulling the curtains open and I was like 'Charlene, no!'. We pretended we were just playing. I said someone had attacked me and told them to go away. Then I was in a forest and it was a game? There was a small clearing with three cars. Jensen Ackles was there too. This lady took us through and there was an underwater section too. It got very deep and there were scary and spiky fish down there. We got to the very bottom and there was a hatch so it was easier. We went out through it and we were in an area very similar to the place with the cars. She trapped us there. We tore the net on the hatch open and followed her. We went into a house and into the kitchen. The lady had her back turned and was reading out her history. One of us stabbed her and asked if that was in there and she said no. We managed to leave. There were some videos of that rape guy doing things to people. I was worried he was going to release the rape video of me. I was on the net at some point and there were questions that had been answered by some guy, who I thought was the rape guy. There was a question about piercings to which he answered he had none and I thought 'yay', but I discovered it was Daryl, not rape guy. I did a quiz too and the first question was about 'favourite alcoholic drink' and I put ""I only like water"". Something said to put a fruity drink down. Some person was trying to burn down my room at university. I think there was a song playing and I said it was from ""nineteen ninety... something"", also thinking it was probably the original version. There was some show from the 90's and there was a guy called Charlie who had something to do with me wanting a dog and calling it Charlie. Then I realized it was Charlie Day. He was young and looked weird without his facial hair."
"2688"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I was walking with 'friends'. We went to the Midvale Leisure centre and it was open for another half hour. We went in and went in the pool. I went in with my phone. I got out when I realized but it was still ok. I was telling the guy that worked there that I'd been stabbed in the shoulder and was going to use the gym to help it."
"2689"	"(2009-03-03 (18)) I'm not sure how it started but I was with Sam and Dean (both Supernatural). We were following clues. We went to a hospital and were looking for a room and I said ""it better not be room 217"". It was 180 something. I took this little thing off the bed in there. I heard the heart rate machine thingy beep and then flatline. We ran to the other room. We discovered that some guy and Penny (The Big Bang Theory) were related. This lady nurse said she called the cops on us. I said we'd have to run. So, we ran to a forest-y area. Dean was slowly walking down the path and Sam was a little further down. I started running down the path. The cops called out to me that I was only allowed out for now, but that I had to go back to jail (I had been let out to help them catch Sam and Dean, but I just agreed so I could stay with them). I started to run faster and I had this net-like bag and I would throw it in front of me, then run and pick it up and throw it again (to avoid carrying it around). Sam had then gotten somewhere else and I caught up with him. There was a shiny white van and we got in. We laughed and he started driving. A cop van came towards us (from the side) and we saw it crash behind us. I asked where Dean was and Sam was like ""Who's Dean?"" and then I turned into a demon, and I was watching it in third person. Sam was telling the demon it was supposed to possess him and the demon said no, it was meant to take over me."
"2690"	"(2009-03-04 (18)) I had some MSN messages from Ezra asking some questions but the computer kept lagging majorly. I told him finally, that it was lagging and he told me to meet him at the zoo. He was on a small canoe boat thing with an animal. I had to buy a ticket to get a boat over to him. You had to drive it yourself. I think there was a train? I got back and had to show the lady the ticket. I was holding Gizmo and had to hand her over first to get the ticket out. I went back over to Ezra. Later, I parked outside of Mom's and called her to pick us up. On the radio they played some old song. Ezra mentioned something else and liking old music like Midnight Oil and they played some song which was the song ""from From Dusk Till Dawn"" or so we said. Mom was sound asleep. My notes aren't very detailed and I don't remember any of this next stuff. She forgot which way to go. There were two lanes to choose from and she chose the wrong one? There were escalators that were sideways. We had to lie down. There were some old ladies. There was a bakery thing with lemon meringue pie. This guy let me taste it to see if I liked it."
"2691"	"(2009-03-04 (18)) I was on an island or on the beach. I'm not sure of the details. The leader guy killed some people and he kept some people that he liked. He picked three of us, me, a girl and a guy to be some volleyball players. There were only three players on each team and we were playing against girls. He was making us do this so that we got used to it and could beat everyone. The guy was Peter Krause, and his 'skill level' was 10 and ours was like 1.08. He said he'd gone running on rocks in the water. This guy made fun of his deep voice and I said that I did the same thing while watching Six Feet Under."
"2692"	"(2009-03-05 (18)) I was in a classroom, on the left side near the front, and in front of Brent and Ishaan. They were talking and then Ishaan called out to me. They asked if I'd be happy with flowers as a present (as in, would females like it). I said ""Well, I wouldn't', because I'd like something useful,"" and they asked 'like what?'. I said ""a DVD or a new computer..."" and Brent asked ""what kind of DVD?"" and I said science fiction (and the like) and then Brent said ""You're pretty cool"". Later, Classmate-F-03 came in and she and Brent were quite touchy-feely. They had drawn some pictures. The teacher was called Mr Drive or something. The class ended and it was a long way to get to the bus. There was a small building and we had to climb through this hole to get to the bus. I had my shoes off and so put them on. Brent was not too far back in the line away from me. I went through the hole and Ms Pascal was there. She wouldn't let us out the quick way. I was then at school and Calvin was there. He was doing chemistry and he got 88% on a test. His wrong answers were the same ones that I got wrong, but we had different answers (I thought he had copied me at first). Then I was somewhere and GTA 3 was on the TV and Ezra was with me. I remembered playing it years ago. Also, there was this game that I played where you walk into this room and there were two doors on the left and then I noticed this black latch in the right corner of the front wall. Then a third door appeared and I laughed, remembering that Darren had said ""shadow behind the third door"", except I thought he said something else rather than shadow. In the game, you got a rare 'fire' animal or something. [The night before I was talking about dreams with Darren and he said ""watch out for the shadow behind the third door"" or something, to see if it would influence my dream] ."
"2693"	"(2009-03-06 (18)) I had a gay friend over. There was some site which had some gay bashing thing on there. I was angry about it and showing my friend. Some of the stuff said they wanted them to 'burn on the stake' etc. There was something about Queer as Folk and I saw Ted and I was like ""Ted!""."
"2694"	"(2009-03-06 (18)) I was at university in Communications. I was in my normal spot and Preston was sitting a desk away (in the one near the wall). I had another class after but I had to go on the bus. I tagged on and sat at the back. Brent, Preston and someone else came on and sat together in the row next to me. The next class was also a Comms class. There was a sign-in thing which mentioned why we were doing this course for a ""higher TER"". Lillian was in the class and so was Preston. He sat down in one of the first seats and I sat in my usual seat. Also, I hadn't seen Preston in this class before."
"2695"	"(2009-03-07 (18)) Ezra called Mom saying someone kept leaving 'rapish' on his desk. We suggested the cat was bringing chicken in. Then I asked if he was on My City (Facebook application). He was. I had added a chemist to his and he had new stuff to add. I went home at one point. There were maggots everywhere. I was on the floor in my room and there were baby maggots on there. I went to the kitchen and got fly spray and used it on the sink and the floor. I called Mom. I was then at Cat Haven, or something. There were kittens in a cage. I was cuddling them. One was black and fluff and there was a cute Rag doll looking one. There were also puppies and birds. Mom and Ezra were around. This building had metal pipes for the roof (cube area). I had to water the metal so it turned brown. Then we used it before it got hot, but it didn't stay cool long enough. I signed in at the Cat Haven. This girl told me to stop texting and I said I was trying to get my Mom to pick me up. I asked her what grade she was in and she said something weird. I said I had graduated and mentioned I was in university now. She laughed. I don't know why. I asked where she went and she said something that I don't remember. Mom text me saying she was ages away, but would be picking up Amelia then getting me. I walked across this field and there was a hill. This guy with ""gay [something] "" was there. There was a game where people keep 'sexing'. This guy told his friend he was gay and he was like ""You're not gay, I'm not gay"". But he did say he would engage in anal sex with him. This was the last episode of a show? I decided to download it."
"2696"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) There was some chocolate and it made this guy giggle when you ate it. I went to university later where I had to show my ID card, but it wasn't enough ID. I went back and got some stuff that the girl showed me. Mom got a new cat. I was on the net and I found this huge site on Daniel Cerny, especially on Eli, but the character was called ""Eherence Eli Porter"". The nickname of the character was ""Ehe"" (pronounced E-hee). It said he hated Children of the Corn 3 and liked producing them and mentioned his first movie. Then it was something else and there was something about his third (also his latest) movie which was in Japanese."
"2697"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) Dad had episodes of shows and issues of The Walking Dead. I was transferring them over and reading The Walking Dead. It was in colour and I couldn't remember when it changed to colour. The kid had been killed off a while ago too. It changed between reality and the comic for a while, and then it was real. The characters were walking outside. One had an electronic thing which could tell them how many zombies were in the place. The zombies were sort of smart -- they had basic speech and thinking. I was annoyed at this saying that I could deal with zombies talking, but not thinking (as in, they weren't proper zombies). We went to a school and there were a few in there so we walked away. Then chickens came running out. This girl in the group decided to leave and told me and then left. This guy noticed a zombie around the corner but it was too late and it got her. There were lots of zombie kids but they were all calm ones and didn't bother us, even though we were sitting next to them. A dog bit my foot gently, and I was now infected but I hadn't turned yet. Then we were driving and one of the people had a house. I said we should go to the country and he said it was in the country, but it wasn't. We parked the car a few houses away and we climbed over the fences to get to the front of the house (all the houses were surrounded with fences). They tried to open the house. There was a park across the street and zombies were walking down towards us (they hadn't noticed us). I was keeping an eye on them but then they saw us and came up to the fence. Others then came. They called us 'wolves'. They had already sent a 'message' to others and I wondered if we could make it to the car, but there were some hanging around it. There was a young girl who had been with us and she was now a zombie. We got caught. They took us to a desert because we were 'wolves'. I tried to burn one of them with a piece of glass (tried to use it as a magnifying glass). A train came past and I jumped on but I kept getting pushed off and then it took off without me."
"2698"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) For university, I had been set up to live somewhere. I was at Nana's and there were six of us. I got the lounge room (now bare and a different shape). The other rooms being used were the dining room/other lounge and I think Nana's room. This other girl was in the other lounge room. Preston was sent to the dining room. Quinton (from math) was with me. I redecorated the room for myself but then remembered I was sharing. We had a small TV. My bed went to the edge of the bottom of the stairs and I couldn't think of how to move it to get it out of the way. Then I was at 'home'. My room was different and fairly empty. Someone came in with a baby and put it in a cot that was in my room. The room also had a door to the outside. I finished playing this game and I told Mom to get the baby out or I'd throw it out. I put all of the baby's stuff in the hall. We were going somewhere I think."
"2699"	"(2009-03-08 (18)) I think this one continued from the zombie dream. There were zombies. I could only do a certain number of steps and actions every day. Normally I didn't stray very far from the house we stayed at, but I did today. I was at the gate of the city (or wherever) and there were police there. I was on a bike and was riding away from zombies, who were also on bikes. I yelled to them that I was normal and the zombies began shooting at the cops. In the distraction, I got past. I tried to steal a car, so I had a faster mode of transport. I didn't know the controls and this guy said I was going ""-69 miles per hour"" and then I rammed him into another car and he died (accidental, I was still working out the controls). I found this girl and she said she would show me how to drive a car. I was a guy at the moment and I thought she liked me. I was almost out of energy/steps and she was staying in a clear plastic square. She got in and it was hard to fit through the entrance and was squishy inside. She jokingly said ""lick my feet"" (my head was at her feet). Then other people were around outside. I got out and went into another 'building'. They had some drug and you breathed it in and everything went slow. I didn't realize but we were all painting while inhaling. I left to go somewhere safer. I found a guy who looked like Colin Mochrie with a couple of cars next to a tree, which was next to the road. I asked him if he knew anywhere to go and he said I could sleep in his Ute. I slept and later, zombies came and were trying to get in the Ute. They had a midget and were trying to fit him through a gap in the window. I woke up and went out the other door and ran. I met up with Dad and Ezra. I found some 'active potions' which you could drink and they would give you more steps. I drank some. Then, Mom, Preston, a girl and others were there too. Ezra said he'd like to ""fuck"" the girl. I was shocked at the language and the content but was just like 'ok...'. He asked Preston what he thought and he said he was going to read the news and sleep tonight. I found a big shop and it was full of people. There were lots of storeys and they got darker as we went up. I kept drinking the potions while walking. There was a gate thing we had to go through and we had to put coins in there, then walk through. It gave my coins back. Coins also worked as potions but not as well as the one I was using. I was giving $1 and $2 to some and 50c to others. We got to the top storey which was pitch black. It was a gaming level. I used the light on my phone to find my way around. There was a room with bunk beds. Everyone went off though and went to random places. The girl came though and said I had to sleep on the top bunk. There was a toilet close by and there were very small bunk beds in the bath."
"2700"	"(2009-03-09 (18)) I was at school and was in class by myself. There was a competition and Samantha, Cedric, a quiet girl, me and someone else were in it. We had to throw cards onto these mats and match them. You would be given a ticket to the concert. I missed and the only match I got was for some girl group and that was my only concert option. There was a band there that I actually liked. Someone started singing Standing in the Shadows of Love. Then it was time for the hard math class and Jeremiah and the others came in. I heard Eugene coming. He was wearing a white singlet thing, which was dirty. I remembered he was doing MIT as well. I saw that he was wearing a ruby ring and thought 'Nooo! Eugene isn't perfect!'. I went outside and called Mom. It looked like the front of her house outside. Mr Gutenberg locked the door, but then I went back in. We then stood outside as a group and Eugene was standing with Jeremiah. I called Mom again and she answered and I could hear lots of sirens. I told her it was humid and I looked up at the sky and saw smoke. I looked lower and saw some forests in the distance and could see the flames of a fire and then they suddenly started moving very fast (like that video of the Victoria fires). I started freaking out and I ran inside (to Mom's) and grabbed my dream journals and got in the car with Eugene, who then drove away. He was then Mom and I complained that I didn't get my diaries or my external hard drives. I said ""I don't want it to be like Victoria!"". We were then back home I think. There was a shop across the road and it was on fire. It got put out and that was the end of it -- we had just missed it. I packed up a box with my dream journals and stuff and wrote on it ""incase Harper dies"". In the distance there was more fire and a mushroom like cloud. There was a show and a nuclear war happened. Then it was a movie? There was a place where all females went to make them obedient and with no personality. Dan Aykroyd was in it and he got one. She had a large lip and a guy stopped her at the scan. There was a room and there was a midget, who was a bad guy. He started shooting at the girl, who was then me. I hid under a desk."
"2701"	"(2009-03-09 (18)) I think this continued on. There were more fires. Ezra was at Mom's and was doing something to keep the house cool and wet which would prevent it for a while. We left, but he stayed. Eventually he came to us and said he couldn't handle it anymore. It had gotten to 72°C. We went back and the house didn't look too badly burnt. We were surrounded by smoke and it was hard to see. Darren said that my computer wasn't too bad and I said 'yeah, it's only the most important thing in my life'. I said 'Imagine if it had been Mom that died, that's what it's like for me'. I went to my room and the wall near my window was burnt. Half of my computer had melted and one of my externals was totally melted. The computer was still working though and it was still running, except there was a small strip across the top of the screen which was just black. I went into Ezra's room, which was finished and it hadn't been burnt at all. Then there was this white kitten and it kept lighting the front lawn on fire. I kept putting them out and eventually caught it. Then I was at home and Ezra was setting fires there. Simba ran past, on fire, and I poured water on him and it wasn't enough to put the fire out and so I got more. Where the water had gone, was now invisible. Ezra and Dad decided to put these two kittens, including the white one, and a duck toy in the dryer to kill them because they were lighting fires. I was trying to convince them not to because it was mean. I felt bad so I took them out of the dryer. I was then at a park, going for my walk. There was a huge fenced area, with some fence missing in places so you could walk through. I was walking around that with Mom. I put the kitten in a cage and left it at the start of it. This girl challenged me to a race. She was extremely fit and was far ahead of me. I went through the first opening in the fence and ran through the middle. She went through another and got ahead of me again. I was worried she was going to let the kitten escape, and she got to the box before I did. She picked it up, but put it in another cage."
"2702"	"(2009-03-09 (18)) There was some young kid at a table. Her mother and father were sitting there too, I think with others. Her mother asked her something and something about 'what she loved' and then asked her something else, to which she replied 'you', and her mother thought the daughter was saying she loved her most. But, she actually meant her father. He was molesting her. I think she enjoyed it? When she was a teenager, they were still 'close'."
"2703"	"(2009-03-10 (18)) My toy box was in the games room. I was going through it and I found a folder of Pokemon cards. I was going through them and there were lots of empty spaces. I remember seeing Eevee and there was one called 'Croteas', instead of Vaporeon. Some of the cards were shiny. There were a few plastic sheets that were thicker and of better quality than the others. I showed Mom and asked her if we can get more. I was going to ask Ezra if wanted to collect them again. There was some show that someone was watching and I had a quick look and saw Kiefer Sutherland, and it was showing him looking up. I said ""Hey, it's Jack!""."
"2704"	"(2009-03-11 (18)) I was playing this game and I was a spy/detective in it. The first thing you did was choose a husband and something else. I chose the first guy I saw, but he was really ugly and had blue eyes. The role of the guy was to take the kids to school? Everyone there was weird and had a 'handler'. There was a mini game with items and one of them was a cigarette and I took up smoking. They had a strange flavour and it felt weird and it was hard to breathe. I can't read my notes, but there's something about a robot which had another robot in it. The weight was like 94.5kg. There were Staffy's and toy plates? There were stupid places like a wall? I quit going to the Cat Haven and was annoyed that I wouldn't have a chance to develop anything with Preston (that's where I'd met him)."
"2705"	"(2009-03-11 (18)) I was at school/university. I finished math and went outside, in the rain, to walk to the bus stop. I then remembered I had Communications after lunch. I called Mom to get me so we could straighten my hair again. Dad picked me up. Darren was somewhere. I was going to have a shower, and then straighten but then realized it would take up too much time. Also, I heard a song on the radio that was by The Angels. It was really catchy and had 'January' in the title."
"2706"	"(2009-03-12 (18)) I was at school. Eugene was there. The teacher asked him who he thought liked him. Calvin was near me and said it was going to be me. They told him to write it on a piece of paper and if it was right he'd get $5. I figured he'd put down me as well and left out of annoyance. I came back and some time later I saw a $5 note on a piece of folded up paper. I opened it and it said 'Jasmine' and I was wondering who the hell Jasmine was."
"2707"	"(2009-03-12 (18)) Ezra was staying at Mom's. First, I was at home I think (maybe not). I was on the computer looking for 'disturbing movies'. There was some Asian guy and a girl too and they were pretty fluent in English. She asked what 'film' was and I said ""Same as movie"". There was a site with a list of movies. There was a movie that was short and it said people pooped in other peoples butts and so I thought I'd look for it. I found Part 1 and 3 on Youtube. I watched part 1 and it was lame. I figured they must've taken the good stuff off. I was telling Dad about it and we downloaded some movies. Then, I was back at Mom's. I was going to bed and Ezra decided he wanted to watch TV loudly. I said I can't sleep with that on. I complained because I had to get up at 6am. He refused to turn it down. Mom was on the phone trying to help. Darren was trying to convince him too. Cuddles was sitting on their bed. He had to get up at 4am. In anger, I punched the wall between my room and Ezra's. I found a soft spot but it didn't break. Ezra said if Mom couldn't sleep through it, then he'd know it was too loud. I said ""She sleeps through Darren's alarm every morning! It wakes me up all the time"". Soon after, we settled the argument and all went to bed."
"2708"	"(2009-03-13 (18)) It was the day before Ivan's funeral. There was a thing on and Mom and Darren were going and I said I wasn't. When they were about to leave I changed my mind. I was trying to find something that was ok to wear. I went out the front and Mom and Darren took off without me. I got in my car and followed them and was driving really badly, mostly on purpose. They stopped and decided to take me. It was near the sea, on a big boardwalk thing. There were a few rows of chairs. We sat in them and these people were talking about him. This girl was sitting next to me and I was talking to her about stuff. I think she was Regina. I was telling her about how I'd used my last name as a name for something and some other naming method which was quite spiffy. Later, she got famous and stole my ideas. Her last name was 'Damn'. I complained about it. We were still at the boardwalk thing. I left to go to the toilet. I was walking back and there was a confusing path. I walked down the wrong one and then had to walk back down it to get back to the boardwalk. Everyone was walking down a jetty to a submarine thing. I ran to get there before it left. There were no barriers on the thin jetty and I almost fell into the water. I managed to get in. I felt sick and we were moving. They explained there were holes in the control room, so that if there was a leak, a corresponding hole would spurt out water so they'd know where the leak was."
"2709"	"(2009-03-13 (18)) Calvin and I found this video of a girl, who had a huge dildo. It was like the size of a person. They shoved it in her butt and she was fine. We were extremely shocked and confused at it."
"2710"	"(2009-03-13 (18)) I was out the front of Mom's. We were sitting in the car. Mom started crying. A lady came and gave us a long stone, which was bumpy and was to be used as a tombstone for Ivan. It had 'Knepper and Padalecki' on the top and I thought it had something to do with Robert Knepper playing Freddy Krueger and Jared Padalecki being in Friday the 13th. I said ""Robert Knepper for the win!"". Later, I was near the sea. It was very murky and green. I was with others and we were talking to this girl in the water. I asked her about some episodes of Lost to find out where she was up to. I asked ""the one with the taxi driver?"" and she wasn't sure and I asked ""the one with Bill?"". I was actually talking about the episode of 24 when Bill got killed. She went to say whether she had seen it or not, which was somewhat suspenseful and then suddenly she got taken under the water. We laughed and then ran up the path to get away. Some skinny, murky green tentacles were flailing about. Then it was Jack and Sawyer from Lost. They went opposite ways to save themselves. Sawyer was then sitting on a playground with Juliet and was upset that Jack had left him to die. Jack was lying in a slide (it was enclosed). It was full of leaves and insects and things and he was talking to these two green snakes, about how depressed he was about Sawyer. They had a red bit on each of them, one said ""1st"" and the other ""2nd"". It meant they were the 1st and 2nd most poisonous snakes. He then heard Sawyer talking and slowly crawled out of the slide wondering why he was in there with the snakes."
"2711"	"(2009-03-15 (18)) There was a machine and people had to put rubbish on the platforms -- it rotated down to where it got dealt with. We had to leave a free platform between each one. Rob McElhenney was a worker there. Suddenly, a lot of chocolate came through and we were taking heaps off to keep for ourselves. We then heard police sirens. We discovered someone had stolen the chocolates, so we started taking the chocolates out of our pockets and putting them back on the machine. The rubbish was no longer getting off. The boss, who was a lady, said that the bottom machine must've broken. We went down and there was liquid. Rob and I had to go through it. He started talking to himself and acting odd. We got locked out the front of the place and I saw a dude with a balaclava getting out of a car. I went out the back and jumped over a fence, but they got me. I had my school books out and they made me put them all away. I put the pens in my pockets."
"2712"	"(2009-03-15 (18)) I was playing with a small Shiba Inu and I was calling it Charlie. Dmitri had a dog and I was actually playing with an imaginary dog. I said I was practicing. His dog was a Chow Chow, but it didn't look like one. I said the Shiba's come from the same place as the Chow Chow's, but his was from somewhere else."
"2713"	"(2009-03-15 (18)) I was at a video shop with Mom. She wanted some movies but we didn't have an account. We asked if we could get one and they said yes. All the movies she wanted were lame ones. She asked if Bad Boys was any good and I said I didn't remember it, but Bad Boys 2 was funny."
"2714"	"(2009-03-16 (18)) I was on the net. Uncle Vic had an email and a site which we had. I found a site that I had signed up with and had added a Preston Garfield. There was a picture and it looked like him so I figured I got it right. I was looking at the other pictures. His profile mentioned Hitman and Watchmen. It said he lived in Subiaco. I then had a 'flash' of if we had met years ago and everything would've been 'better'. Mom decided she and Darren were going to go out and she asked me if that was ok. I complained because I wanted to ""shoot some 24"". She said that I just watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I think it was playing, or there was a picture of it, with Dee and I was like 'ugh I hate her'."
"2715"	"(2009-03-17 (18)) I was at the shop with Mom. I was looking for some chocolate and I found this interesting bar which was all curled around. There was a game (I can't read what I wrote next to it, but it looks like ( [something] to see'). You had to search the area for a male and a female (could be between 1-something in a pair?). One lot I got was '14'. Then you did something with them but I don't remember. I discovered Dmitri played it and left like 10 messages. He joked about it later. I found a message he had written to someone saying he had applied for some police job. A photo of him showed him with a little ring on his little finger. I decided not to write any more? There was a dog in a cage."
"2716"	"(2009-03-18 (18)) I signed up as being a fan of a show. Also Darren was on the news. I was watching a Penn & Teller: Bullshit episode and Darren watched it too. I pointed to Teller and he was like 'what the fuck?'. On that fan thing, Ishaan had a post, something about Supernatural. Someone got a 'lawful' email from Jensen Ackles and someone sent it to Mom's email. I was trying not to read it. I managed not to for a while. I downloaded some shows."
"2717"	"(2009-03-18 (18)) My computer had been screwy for a while. It ended up getting smashed. It was mixed in with a pile of sand and other bits of stuff. I was going through and picking out important stuff -- files etc. I went somewhere and had a lame mobile phone. I text Mom to get me a new computer. She said ok. I called her and said I needed to be picked up. She said no and to not leave yet. I then realized I was outside of Cat Haven. I explained to her I quit. I was then at Nana's and I was showing her my phone, which was big and a weird shape. It had a tiny screen."
"2718"	"(2009-03-19 (18)) I can't remember properly, but Mom was upset about her father. We went somewhere, along with Ezra. He said he was glad he knew us and I said ""I'm not glad I know Ezra. Can I get him erased from my mind?"" There was a movie and this girl had a guy friend who died when he was young. There was a picture of him and he had exploded? He was actually ok though."
"2719"	"(2009-03-20 (18)) I was with Charlie Day? I think he and I were in a place and then he went away for a bit. Someone said a friend was waiting for me and a girl. There were clothes on a rack. There were lots of these black dresses and black pants and white shirts. Then someone was coming and they forced me into a room. I was naked. I couldn't bring any clothes in as this laser thing would detect them and make them disappear. I was really annoyed."
"2720"	"(2009-03-20 (18)) I was at university in Comms. The class was different and was bigger. We were told to write down our most recent dream. I wrote down one from '14 February' and it was long. It had a bit with James Spader. We didn't have to put our names on it and then we chucked them into a pile. It was quite a big pile. I was going through and I found some dreams in there written on these cool cardboard cards. I was with someone who I was friendly with and I wondered where to get the cards from and whose they were. We were near the front of the class and someone said ""Izzy"". I turned and it was Preston, who was sitting at the desk closest to us with another guy. He asked if I was looking for the person who wrote that dream and I said yeah. He asked why and I said ""Coz I want some of those cards"". He said it was him. The dreams on them were long and I figured he must record his dreams. I didn't ask him though. He told me they were from ""Cook"" and that he had gotten them 3 years ago. I asked the name of the shop again and he repeated ""Cook"". I was reading through them (there were two) and both mentioned me. Later, I was gathering all the dreams to keep. Also there were some survey things in there. One had 'best female friend' and the answer was 'Izzy'. It was Evelyn's. I wondered why she had me down there since we hadn't spoken in a year. There was a girl in the class called Sahara and she was Asian. Her survey had me as 'best plan'. Later, we were in this prison looking thing. It was inside and we were in the middle of a room. There were cells and balconies on the floor above. I was standing near Sahara, who was talking to Classmate-F-09. She said something about me and Classmate-F-09 screwed up her face in disgust. I was like 'Huh? What are you talking about? What did you say about me?' etc. No-one would tell me, then the people who believed I was innocent (most of them) were in the middle of this room, while the others walked around the outside (there were little walls around it). One of them was a black girl. Luciano and Quinton went out and Luciano distracted the outside people while Quinton and another person searched the cells. I was then searching and found a tape. It had the 'truth' about me on it. We played it and it had Christina (Ugly Betty) speaking. They called her Callie though. Calvin was also here at some point and Classmate-M-04 had said ""I'm dangerous""."
"2721"	"(2009-03-21 (18)) I can't really remember, but there was a mention of Chris Barrie and I was like 'I love Chris Barrie!'."
"2722"	"(2009-03-21 (18)) Mom dropped me off at the train station. I had gotten a letter from the school saying that I had photos to pick from last year. I told Mom to try and get them. It was inside a building. I hadn't been to this part of it before. I went down an escalator. This lady gave me a plastic folder and it had the photos in it. There was one of me, Calvin and others, but my hair was all in my face. I quickly flicked through to see if there were any of Eugene, but I didn't find any. I put it in my bag and jumped onto a train. It was two storeys. I climbed up and this guy was standing over two seats and he had no underpants on (just a shirt) and his balls were showing. There were lots of retards on the train. I asked the driver what the next stop was and she said ""Peleigh"" (I think. It started with P or B, and ended in 'eigh' -- prounced 'ee'). I looked on the map thing and the stop was miles away and it wasn't stopping at any stops in between. I called Mom to tell her. I asked if I should jump off and she said ""Nah"" but I jumped up as she said it. I forgot to grab my water though and it was now dark. It was a long walk back and Mom wouldn't get me. I started walking down a path on the street. There was a car parked in a driveway and some dodgy guys were sitting in it. This little thing started running towards me and it was a cute, fluffy little dog. It barked. I followed the train tracks and ended up at a restaurant which it went through (or past?). It was very big and fancy and I walked in at the bottom floor, but it also had an upstairs area. There was a parrot which would say ""Charlie, can I take your order!"" and some other variants. This was some in-joke which the patrons understood. I walked through and was chewing bubblegum. I was on the phone to Mom and went outside. I had a wobbly tooth. The gum got stuck on it, so I tried to pull it off with my fingers and my tooth came out. I said to Mom ""My tooth fell out!"". I said it must've been a baby tooth. I was walking on a wall and saw Spaceman on a roof, or something. I then realized it actually was Spaceman and saw ""It is Spaceman!"". There was a long drop between me and him, and so I just kept walking. I got down to walk around back to the tracks. There were lots of other obstacles. One was like a white water rafting thing, but as a slide. There were two sets of tracks going down it. I had to climb up, fighting the water and watching out for trains. So I walked around again (to walk around made it take a lot longer). I went to a chemist and bought something. Then I was watching a movie, I think. This girl was in the water, upside down. A shark was just beneath her, and presumably, thought something was wrong. She stayed still and then it started raining and the shark left. I think, eventually, I got back to civilization. I was looking through the photos and saw photos of Valerie and Ariana at my graduation. I didn't remember them being there and then I realized that ""they were there for Farrah!"". Dad asked which chemist I had gone to. I checked the bag and it said ""Auto Express"". There was also something before with Ezra."
"2723"	"(2009-03-21 (18)) I was at a funeral, but I don't know who for. I was with friends and people I knew. Then Gramps had died and we were at his funeral. I couldn't remember where he had been for all the years though. We were standing outside and Granny was crying. I was supposed to be the one pushing the coffin in (that was what happened, someone would just give it a push and it would fall into this thing). Afterwards, some others and I went to a room. There were seats and they were all layered (like steps). This teacher lady was talking. She had her young daughter (say, four years old?) who had blonde hair drawing in the front row. The teacher had brown hair. She asked if we thought only the important subjects should get taught at schools. All the people who agreed stayed. We all moved into the middle so it would look like more people were there. Evelyn left. Brent and Luciano were there and I was sitting between them. Brent's arm was in my way and I pushed it and he looked angry and pulled it away. I then felt embarrassed. The teacher started handing out pictures and things of musicians. I saw Beatles stuff and got excited. There was a John Lennon magazine? She then gave me and someone a heap of Curly Wurly's, a trolley and money and led us to a huge shop. Dad was at a funeral. I was then in a liquor store and Dad came in. I had been asked to buy this bottle, but as I didn't have ID, I asked Dad to get it ""for Mom and Darren"". Also, the teacher lady had some funeral as well. We were walking off and were all drunk. I felt light-headed and was having trouble keeping my balance. We went into this big empty house (there was a lot of us) and people started just falling asleep on the floor."
"2724"	"(2009-03-22 (18)) I was in the car with Mom. It was night and it was windy and rainy. We parked outside of North Midvale as there was an ATM on the other side of the road (it was right at the corner before that bush thing). Mom went out to it and I locked the doors and it was really creepy. She finally came back but there were some dodgy people nearby. She got in and we quickly locked the doors again. We both then imagined all this stuff that could happen."
"2725"	"(2009-03-22 (18)) I was in class, I think it was Comms. The teacher was pairing us up, but letting some people choose. The teacher asked Calvin who he'd like to pair up with, asking ""Lucia?"" and Calvin said ""No, I want to work with [someone whose name started with 'S'] "". I was near Preston and Brent, and Preston went this guy who was near him. I figured Brent and I would pair up but then he moved away and I don't know what happened. Then there was an excursion? Some buses got hijacked, but ours was ok and we got off. Mom picked me up. I called Calvin and he was still at the school. As we left, I saw Eugene on the other side of the road with his hair in a ponytail and he looked like a girl. One of the bus drivers had gotten stabbed in the stomach and his name was Thomas. Then there was a house and these creepy people lived in it. One of them was Uncle Fester [Addam's Family, but not one of the actors, just some random guy] and he was sleepy? This thing chased me and there was a special way to go to get rid of it. I had to press this button and do some other things. The guy followed me and he was like made out of seaweed. The last thing I had to do was to move one of two wires to the switch and I couldn't remember which one. I asked the seaweed dude and he showed me and then I did it."
"2726"	"(2009-03-23 (18)) I was at Northtown. There were three video shops. I went down there with Mom one night and now there was only one. It was the smallest one and had been moved a while back ""from Miss Maud's"". There were posters of DVD's and I said they were all ""killer clown movies"". Mom returned some movies for me. I was watching Buffy. Buffy was a vampire or someone else, I can't really remember. They were good though and were remembering back to their past."
"2727"	"(2009-03-25 (18)) Some others and I went somewhere out in nowhere. We were standing around outside. This girl had joined us. She was helpful but I didn't trust her. Some Native guys came and they threatened us and joked about how we'd get escape ""get in the car and drive away"". The car they referred to was rusty and didn't work. Someone then said ""then the nightmare ends"" and everyone realized I was daydreaming. They took us into a building. The girl left and started to cross a road and they shot her. Inside, I was writing dreams into my book. Some guys came in and they were like ""hey, what's up"" and seemed friendly. I was going to ask them if it was ok if they let me write all my dreams in before they killed me, but the guy gave me a huge amount of paper. It was a magazine about new inventions and stuff. There was a section about some plant and I can't remember what it did, but they realized what it was and got nervous. I pretended not to notice and realized they were growing it. I thought maybe they would leave us alive. The girl who got shot was now alive and was with them. Out the back somewhere were some cute kittens. Mom was there? Simba was also there and was trying to mate with Gizmo. I was watching something later and James Marsters was in it, and it showed how much makeup was used to make his cheeks look so sunken for Buffy. I was thinking that that was how I saw him, as Spike, rather than his other characters. Ezra bought a cigarette off a friend to try them 'again'."
"2728"	"(2009-03-26 (18)) Ezra and I were out the back somewhere. We needed to go through this cage thing but there were dogs in it. One of them had red eyes and kept growling. I leapt onto this cement block and Ezra got onto this ledge that was attached to the fence (wire fence around the back). A dog got out and tried to attack us. Ezra slid along to the other fence to where I was. We kept going back and forth, putting legs up so the dog couldn't reach us. We managed to get to where we needed to be. Then I was watching Big Brother UK. I recognized the house, but it was sort of different. I got to the Cat Haven and then decided I didn't want to do it anymore. I called Mom to get me."
"2729"	"(2009-03-26 (18)) I had to go to some weird guy's house to straighten my hair. He was like senile and today it was causing the hair straightener to be too dangerous to use. I was going to call Mom and tell her to get me a new one. Dad was around somewhere. I couldn't remember where this guy lived. Someone was taking oranges from a basket, to use for baked beans on toast? Dad wouldn't tell me where the guy lived. I was watching Skins. Sid was in class and he had this way to wake himself up from vivid daydreams. This girl took her math book to the teacher and said she did all the questions and she had told her to do and there were no problems. Sid said ""Yeah I heard you loud enough; you're not the only person alive"". He asked the teacher if she'd noticed he was failing (and why not help him instead). She basically said there was no hope for him. Also before some time, I was in communications. I got 54% in my essay, which was like 25 marks, but I did pass. Ms Ingram was there."
"2730"	"(2009-03-27 (18)) I think Ezra and I went for a walk and we went to this guy's house. Ezra knew him. Ezra or someone stayed there. They complained about it there and said the rooster always woke them up and a shadow came through the window. They told the guy we were going to the shop and were taking the chickens in the car. We kept putting chickens in, I think there were nine. We started going and then we were walking. It was dark. This dodgy black dude was singing. We didn't want to walk past him so we ran back. We drove the car back down, the car was black I think. Then I think there were lots of people walking like zombies towards the house, including the guy from before. We ran in and I told Ezra to treat them like zombies. We barricaded the basement, but there were windows which were above ground. They were actually vampires. I went to the basement and was gathering weapons, saws and sharp things and things that would come in handy, such as a chisel. I put the smaller things in my pocket and went up the top. I'm not sure what started the attacks off. I killed quite a few. The guy who owned the house, I think was a vampire. Then it was Darren and Mom. He was a vampire and was going to kill us all. Mom asked if she could go somewhere with Ezra and she would come back and he said no angrily. The house looked like Nana's. I got the saw and walked to the dining room (from the lounge room, where the computer is). Mom and Darren were sitting at the table, eating dinner. Darren was at the end of the table, facing the kitchen and Mom was on the side with her back facing the other lounge room. I went to the back of Darren and whacked his neck with the saw. It didn't cut through and I kept hacking at it. It wouldn't go all the way through and was still attached. Mom like 'what have you done? What if he isn't a vampire/can be cured?' etc. Then he lifted his head up and looked back and me and I said ""Oh yeah, it's the heart"", he laughed and made fun of me. I tried to stab him in the heart but it wouldn't go through. I was trying from the back of him and cried out ""where's the heart?!"". Before, Cuddles was rolling on the table. When Ezra and I were walking around she kept following us. We didn't have money? I think Darren died then. Mom was then at the front door with one of the Pokemon games and I was talking to Ezra, asking ""who wants it?"". It was a GameBoy game though and she had this other old game. I said ""I have that already too, oh, no I don't,"". I let Ezra have it. We closed the blinds in Nana's room and the lounge room. Then there was this guy in Nana's room, and I think he was a vampire. Nana went in to talk and it turned out she was in on all of the vampire stuff. There were some people out the back and they didn't know about all the vampires. They were still trying to get in. This guy and this girl were married. He was now a vampire though (he was the guy from before) and was changing. The girl came in and his face was half vampire. She started kissing him and they had sex. This was all on a video and he bit her, because she wanted it. Later, this guy stole the sex tape, which was on a reel, and played it . The guy and the girl were on the floor, naked under a blanket (in the video). They turned it on and showed him (the guy who had had sex with her, didn't remember it). He jumped onto her and bit her. There was a game before, where there were different genres of games -- math games, cooking games etc. When you got certain percentages on games on a certain level you unlocked something. One of them was 25% on the cooking game and 25% on something else and that unlocked this James Spader, Sims 3 character or something. I was annoyed because I didn't like the cooking games."
"2731"	"(2009-03-27 (18)) I was at university and I was on the computers. My old 15"" monitor was there. Brent was like 'what the hell is that?' at the monitor. I explained it was mine but I had a new 22"" now. I was sitting next to Preston and I felt uncomfortable. Then I was at a place and I went into this room and there were all these Asian kids in there from Beijing. They got sent over because something was happening over there. There were toys and blocks everywhere. There was a bed, which I sat on and there was a chicken thing on there. There was also some game, where you collect food, clues etc and match DNA and find the 'killer' or whatever they were. The 'killer' in one I did was the victim."
"2732"	"(2009-03-28 (18)) I can't remember properly, but there were zombies. It had only just happened. I was with Mom and told her we had to find somewhere secure to stay and she was like 'nah I want to do something else'. We went to this building which she suggested we go to. It was packed with people. The zombies got in and everyone started running and screaming. I ran up this ramp, which led into this room where you had to jump across beds to other beds. I did so to get to this bed near the wall (far away, less likely for the zombies to get there). Everyone was impressed at how I got there. The beds were very high up (like 3 storeys or so). I got down and some guys took it while I was gone. I left there to find a new spot. I complained to Mom to trust me because I knew about zombies. I had a baseball bat and was whacking them when they attacked. She went to take a car and I said 'no, you don't take a car at the beginning of a zombie attack, maybe in two weeks'."
"2733"	"(2009-03-28 (18)) I went out to this club, or something. On the way back, I was on the train. I was sitting in the aisle seat, next to this girl who was listening to her iPod. I heard her singing a new song that Liam Sullivan did. Then a while later she was singing Day Man (from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and I was like 'Hey, I love that show!'. We talked for a bit and she asked what my name was, I said ""Izzy"" and she said ""full name?"" and I said ""Izzy Conell, with one 'N',"". She had a laptop and went to Facebook and added me. She came back to dads with me. As we walked up the driveway, the curb had 'Day Man' written on it. My room was clean and I said ""ignore the poo under my chair, if any is there"". There was, so I got a tissue and picked it up. It was fresh. I explained I couldn't smell. She got bored. She decided to leave and I said that we should go back to Mom's, as it's more interesting there. I tried calling Mom but I got no answer. We started walking up the hill, and at the top it was different. Her car was parked up there. Some Native teenagers got in it. I was behind her, so I started walking towards some houses, instead of with her in case there was trouble. She told them to get out and they did and came towards her. Their father, or something, came too and they took her into an alley. I walked to a house and knocked on the door and said ""call the police!"". The guy inside asked why and I said it was an ""8"" (dream coding). He just kept asking what was happening. I started running back home. One of the bad guys saw me and started chasing me. I tried to call Dad, but he didn't answer. I called Ezra and I said ""the police are coming"" and he said ""ok"" and hung up before I could say anything. I kept trying to call back but no-one would answer. I got to dads and went inside, and the guy left. Dad then tried to start the car up outside. He complained because all of a sudden the episodes he had of Grey's Anatomy wouldn't work. The last episode he had watched had a guy called Pharaoh, and I asked ""the one with Dustin Hoffman?"" and he said he watched that one ages ago. I said I was way behind."
"2734"	"(2009-03-29 (18)) There were races. I always won. This other girl, who was like my enemy, was annoyed about it. There was a big competition. We got to the place, which was in a big gym. Two girls hadn't come. I had a text from my enemy earlier, saying if you aim for 7th place, you would get a trophy. There were train tracks running through the gym. My mouth tasted like strong peppermint? I ignored it. A train came and I was told to get on it, so I did, which later, I realized the girl had tricked me so she could win. I didn't recognize the people on the train, and I asked about my teacher and I didn't know her name. She looked like Jenny Calendar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). There was an earring phone. I called her and I said I'd been tricked to get a train. She I lost and I said 'yeah I noticed'. I said ""races are about athletic ability and they cheated!"". I got off the phone and called Mom to get me. She didn't want to drive that far. I found a train downtown, that skipped the Riverwalk and went straight to High Bridge (which in this case was after downtown going back home). I got on it and called Mom, she was breathing heavily and she told me to be quiet and I thought 'is she having sex?' and hung up. I got on a bus that was full of Asians. I had a text from the enemy girl and I was really angry. I told Ezra later and he said that it sucked. Ezra got a new DS and he showed Dad. The old one was really big and clunky. There was something about Clayton and Asians making stuff and slaves."
"2735"	"(2009-03-29 (18)) I was with Mom at an underground train station at night. Some water was trickling in and she told me about a similar time with her and Dad. Then we were in the street and the train came past home. The train was just a single, open carriage, like a mine cart and people kept going past. Mom rang this bell, which they said was ""in case of a flood"". I got given a new timetable for the next trimester. It was lame, as I had some classes starting at 6.35am, and weird and long breaks in between. The times were all weird, like 9.08am, and 12.05pm etc. I got on the train and I was daydreaming. At 'Kelmscott' I realized I was miles away. I called Mom to get me and she started rambling and I told her to shut up. I got out and it looked like Northlands. There was a pet shop and there was a cute dog in there on the floor. There were more in cages."
"2736"	"(2009-03-30 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was either living with a girl or living in an apartment near her. She had a really hot boyfriend and they had been living together for like 5 years (it might be 8, it's hard to read). He proposed to her and he had some special family ring, so the marriage would last double the time. It was plastic and green. For some reason, I put it on. It was very hard plastic and I couldn't bend my fingers and it felt like it would snap if I tried to bend harder. I was then with Nana and she wanted to look. I handed it to the guy and I said that I couldn't wear it, 'it doesn't fit, my fingers are too fat' etc.  Then the guy and I were actually having an affair. He or the girl decided to break up. Ezra and I were at the shop and got bored. We made a mess in the store? There was a call for us about Mom waiting for us out the front of the store. Ezra had music on his phone. I was going through it, and it showed all the artists sitting around a table. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jared Padalecki were two of them. There were two others who had guest starred on Supernatural. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was wearing the same jewelry and clothes that he was wearing in P.S I Love You. He was talking and laughing with Jared. I went to play Jeffrey's music, but it just played Round and Round. He had two songs on Youtube and I was listening to them, but it didn't sound like him. He was a ""rock fan"". I was reading the FAQ for Comic-Con and there was a question about whether Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were going to be coming and it pretty much said that neither of them was coming."
"2737"	"(2009-03-31 (18)) There was a new season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It had good ratings and there was something about Danny Devito joining. It was season three though. I found a download for it and I was watching it. It had a laugh track though and it wasn't that funny. I used a fake account to complain about some DVD's. I was talking to Ezra and I checked my post and there were lots of replies. I checked my quiz and 40 people had taken it now. I was then sleeping and Darren's alarm went off, but it was in my room. I took it and chucked it on their bed and woke him up. I was then out somewhere, walking, I think. There was a house on fire, which was across the road. There was some other smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Someone was setting a house on fire over there. Dad and I tried to get home and it was confusing to get back. There was a busy road with a tunnel underneath."
"2738"	"(2009-04-01 (18)) I was at Mom's. She said the cops were going to come past and so she would take me away. As we were driving out, we passed a police car. Later, Darren took some guys car. It was white and just a normal car, but he was going to do it up. I was out the front, and this guy and his friends came to the door. I saw them walking away after Darren spoke to them. Later, Darren was out the front working on it. He took the back plate off and replaced it with a new one. The guys drove past and Darren realized the old plate was still up (started with UXM). I took it off. I emptied out the back of the car, so it wasn't obvious that it was their car. Six months later, it now looked like a hearse. I was inside the house, and it looked like it was orange. The guy came back to check it. He said to Darren that six months later, it was on sale for $5000, and it was $250? He was suspicious of Darren. I was with Dad and Ezra later in the van. On the radio, Well Respected Man was playing. I was singing along and told Ezra it was in the last episode of Supernatural. Then we were in a bus. Samantha was there too. Dad changed the station and it was playing AC/DC."
"2739"	"(2009-04-01 (18)) I was at Nana's. She was expecting the cops to come over. The cops did come over. This girl had her back showing, and she entered the house?"
"2740"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I was at home, playing Sims 3. It had no lag, and the effects were ok but a little blocky on the edges. I played it for a few minutes and then I called Mom, as I was waiting to go back there. In the kitchen, Ezra needed to plug something in. I can't understand what I've written, but it looks like it says Mom's computer, my computer and two others in the car (?) outside and 2 of 4 on something. He wanted to take out Mom's computer. I asked why not one of the other ones. He unplugged one, and it started smoking, so he took it out. He then unplugged his 'Counterstrike LAN' and this other thing and the smoke stopped."
"2741"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I was watching Penn & Teller. Teller was talking and I thought he sounded weird."
"2742"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I'm not sure how it started, but I was with Buffy, Willow and Xander (all from Buffy the Vampire Slayer). We used Twitter to find out stuff about Sims 3. We did something and then decided to go on this roller coaster thing. I was next to Xander, and he said that we were ""too close. If anyone asks if were dating, pretend we're not"". I said ok and then laughed and then thought 'pretend...?' and I realized I liked him. There was a dark tunnel and trains and buses were passing by on the opposite side. Then I was outside during the day, at a cemetery looking place. There was a rat in the kitchen. This person said ""we're boring rich people, not fun rich people"". This inspector guy was asking about the rat."
"2743"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) I'm not sure how this one started either, but Willow, Xander (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and I were outside in the street running from people. There were crowds everywhere which we had to run through. He took a car and was going ""20 km/h over the limit"". We drove slowly past the cops, who were preoccupied anyway. Then we were walking. We went into this building and we went to leave (and it was just Xander and I now), but we saw people running down the street and were near the entrance, so we had to find another way out. There was a small gap where a window should be, which I could fit through. We left through there. We were then at some house/cabin thing in a forest. I got a phone call and it was from some dude asking me to steal a gun back. I said no and that I thought it was wrong. He kept going on about it so I said that I'd do it. We went back to this room and there were lots of people. They congratulated me because it was the right answer. Buffy decided to go out with Xander. The next day, they were both wearing glasses. I was in a library; they saw each other and waved. Cordelia and Buffy were wearing the exact same outfit. Cordelia saw what Buffy was wearing, some kind of skirt and a ""pie shirt"". I was at university, but it was different. I was in the computer room which was huge and like a library on the second floor. I needed to know a room number and asked Classmate-F-14, who gave me the number. I checked the door and it was a 5 digit number. I went back to the computer, and Lillian was on it. I pulled the chair out, aggressively, but then I realized she was only sitting there temporarily. There was a photo of me naked on the computer. Mom and I were then at some vacation? We were at a cabin and Ezra fell asleep. I was going for a walk and there was a woman with a dog. She asked if I'd seen her dog. I had seen her before. I said no and to look behind something that was in a front lawn. I asked what kind of dog and she said ""Alaskan Malamute"" and I said they were cute. There was a park and around it was a building. There were two patches of grass. There was water in it -- something about a game? There was a 'The Making of' and [something I can't read] slows for walk. Ezra, Mom and I were supposed to go for a walk. This girl was playing with her dog."
"2744"	"(2009-04-03 (18)) Dad and I were at the shops, going up an escalator. We went to a small shop. There were DVD's, and as we looked back at them, we both leaned back on the shelf. They had Hancock and another DVD with Will Smith in an action pose, holding a saber. There was a girl in the aisle and we had to squeeze past. I couldn't so I went around the long way, angrily. We went back to the escalators, the same ones we'd gone up, but to leave we had to go up them again. We started walking up the down escalators at first. This black teenage girl was sweeping the floors and singing."
"2745"	"(2009-04-04 (18)) I had a dog, which I'd had for four years. I went to walk it and it wouldn't go. I had to bring it to the vet. There was a show Darren was watching and it had Kenny Hotz in it, and it was some biography thing."
"2746"	"(2009-04-04 (18)) I was in a car. We passed some train tracks and there were piles of rocks. We stopped at the lights and I helped moving the rocks (I was strong, and I can't remember why, but I was thinking I was like Superman). There were shoes too and we were chucking them in a pile. We went to this house, which was mansion like. There were two sets of stairs leading up. I went to a bedroom and I thought someone else was here, and I asked ""cupboard?"" I was then with Chuck and Sarah (both from Chuck). I told Chuck to run. This girl came out and attacked me. I started fighting her and was trying to protect Chuck."
"2747"	"(2009-04-04 (18)) We were in a car with Mom on the freeway. We passed a car and Dad was in the back reading. Nana and Poppa were in the front. I wound down the window to say hello. We met up somewhere. I was then 'driving' without a car though. It involved me lying on the ground. Nana was trying to teach me. I was putting Pokemon into groups of three, and if it was in a group of 3, it didn't need something (cooking, it looks like). The way they were teaching me using cooking analogies and I had no idea what they were talking about. Mom went to see a friend. Her friend looked just like Lauren Ambrose. She said she was going to buy a bar with her boyfriend. Mom said we'd be asked to go drinking. Some time before, I called 'Perf ID' to get a proof of age card but it would take weeks to get. Later, I was at a shop. I wandered off by myself. Three people were nearby talking about fat and they stopped saying to be quiet because there was a fat person nearby (me). I turned around and said 'that was subtle'. One of them was a fat guy. I said ""at least I'm not fat and ugly like you"" and he said ""stop talking to yourself"". There were clothes shops and clothes racks everywhere. Some of the shop wasn't built yet. I went to a shop with Mom, and then I wandered off again. There was a jewelry section which was really big and full of people. I tried to run through. I went to this other shop which had lots of DVD's. I saw A Few Good Men, and on the cover were Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Spader. I went to pick it up, but this other girl did first. She was like 'I want to see this' and I said ""he's barely in it"", and then said 'both of them, actually'. She was like 'why should I trust you?'. There were other James Spader movies. She wanted them. Then it was Christian Bale we were discussing and his movies were there -- American Psycho, The Machinist and a version of The Shining. I recommended those to get. Then it was back to James Spader. Mom came and I said 'that was so funny' and she asked ""Did you used to have a crush on James Spader?"" and I said ""No!"". She said when I was younger, I had picked a movie off the shelf, and it had been Sex, Lies and Videotape. I was like 'I love that movie!'. There was a shop which had photos of me and Ezra when we were younger. In one, I had lots of jewelry and I was like 'ew, I don't remember that, what was I thinking?'."
"2748"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) I was at Mom's. Ezra and I were doing some computer thing with two of his mates; it was a puzzle game thing. It was hard, and Ezra kept shaking me and distracting me and I got a bad score. I went to dads and he did the game too? My thumbs were hurting, and I tried again and still failed. Ezra was watching channel V on TV. I was trying to fix the cord at the back of the TV. Then all these maggots showed all down the screen. I looked at the back of the TV and there was a big pile of maggots there. Dad grabbed a handful of them and chased me with them. I ran into my room, which was clean. He threw them at me. Tigger had kittens and they were on my bed. I was wondering how she had any, since she was sterilized. There was a cute orange and white one. There were some under a blanket in the cupboard. Tinkerbell had kittens too. There was a Smudgy looking one and a big one. There were some puppies too and they were quite cute."
"2749"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) I think I had an apartment. There was a dodgy dude. I can't remember, but I recorded this small video of me and this girl talking. From it, I discovered she was having an affair. Later, I went back and the video had been altered. The dodgy dude had a coat and he was following me. I ran. I ran into some toilets, and there were lots of cubicles. I hid in the corner with a knife. He came in ages later and looked in every cubicle and then saw me in the corner. Then it went all black. This happened again and I was with someone, a girl I think. I hid. Someone said someone was coming. There was a small window in the toilet. I heard someone say ""Basil"" who was a big blonde dude. I decided to run. All these people were crowded around (there weren't that many). It was at university. There was an upstairs parking lot. I 'wished' for my car and when I turned around, it was there. I couldn't drive it very well and kept driving all over the curbs and I was going over the speed limit. I didn't know how to get out of the carpark. I went down the stairs and there was a McDonald's queue. There was a new ramp and I went back to leave."
"2750"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) There was a Royal Show thing. Ezra was sitting on Mom's lap. I was going on rides. There was this floaty thing in the air, and you go on it and float and fly around on it. One turn was 55c. I can't remember it properly now. This lady ran it and she explained it to me, so I tried it."
"2751"	"(2009-04-05 (18)) I was at university, which was different. The classrooms were much bigger. It was Wednesday and everyone had an extra class. Mine was a second language one, but I didn't know what the language was. The class was very full. We had no teacher. The guy in front of me started calling out ""Jello?"" and other fat names. They threw some stuff back and I presumed it was aimed at me, so I ignored them. The guy next to me had this crossbow thing with pasta. They aimed it at me, so I snapped off a piece and whacked his face with it. He got angry and then everyone was throwing stuff at me and attacking me. I ran out. I had gotten hurt between my fingers and it was bleeding. As I left, the side of the class was open. I hit a few people on the way out. I found a teacher and told her what happened. I was in her classroom and I saw her last name was Amundson, but it wasn't actually her. There was a lady in the hall teaching a second language using a drawing on the wall. It was of grass, bush and sky. She told them to work out of you cross the park, will the light be darker or lighter. As I walked back past the classroom, I slapped the girls sitting on the side and then pulled their hair back, hard. I told this teacher that I wasn't going back to that class. I went back and she was telling them off, but it was a different class. I couldn't find my bag and this guy at the front of the class found it and gave it back. I went to the next class, which was math. Preston and Regina were there. They were in the second row, sitting at each end of the row (Regina was closest to the entrance). There was a spare desk next to each of them. Preston smiled as I walked in. I went to the third row and this girl in the fourth said ""you can totally sit next to me"" and I realized she was a girl from the other class. I said 'I don't think so' and went and sat next to Regina. I told her what happened but she didn't seem too interested. She asked me what other subject I got. She said it was a ""blank slate"". The teacher was male and I knew him and was thinking he was my English teacher or something. He looked like Larry Moss from 24. I remembered my math teacher was a female, and was Ms Kuo. I decided I wasn't going to stay for Communications after this. I text Mom to tell her."
"2752"	"(2009-04-07 (18)) I was at a school. Something was happening today that caused some people to get a fever. Oz and Giles (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) would be affected because they were both werewolves. It was temporary and their heart rates got too high and then they would turn. I was watching Giles. He was sweating and about to turn, so I chained him to a desk. This other person we had was chained to the wall. I got on top of this magnet block and climbed up this high cabinet. Then I was by myself. He got free and was just a big dog. It jumped about the room and tried to get at me. It got close a few times and I had to swing my legs around. He got to the door and was about to leave, but then he paused and came back to me. He wouldn't leave. Eventually, he must've because I left. I went back to Giles but there was another one coming on. We were going to the next room but we realized we had to go somewhere else. Xander and Cordelia walked past saying stuff about a big dog (they didn't know about the werewolves). We gathered everyone and ran out. This surfer dude was around and we said ""Can we borrow your car?"" and he said ""Sure!"" happily. It was an old Ute. I got in the back and Scarlett and Mariyam were there. Then there was a boy next to me and he unwrapped a lollipop. I said ""that's my lollipop"" and kept trying to convince him to give it. As we were leaving, someone mentioned Giles in a boat with bags, and they had put a guy with him and I said sarcastically, ""yeah, don't worry about Jake Gyllenhaal or anything!"". There was a big cow in the street. Dad was then in the car."
"2753"	"(2009-04-07 (18)) I was at home with Mom. It was different though. She told me to turn off the lights, then to do something else. I was annoyed. I turned the lights off and there was a noise out the back? There was a dude who looked like Mark Wahlberg in Fear. He was a thief too? He was trying to kill us."
"2754"	"(2009-04-07 (18)) I was at the train station, which was different. I was getting picked up inside. I saw Eugene's car. I can't remember, but we followed them. Also, there was some dude who got something had photos. He, or I, needed to ask his mother how she wanted to get them. We followed them. I was then outside what looked like Mom's house. Eugene's father Abraham was there. His mother was there too and she was skinny and looked young. The other side of the road was just grass. Nana was there and I sat with her. Eugene called her Nana and asked about Poppa. He asked me something and we started talking. I asked ""what are you doing this year?"" and he said ""Engineering"", then he paused and asked if I'd gotten in trouble for all the school I missed this year, saying he'd seen me at the train station ""100 times"".  I said that I took the train to university. He mentioned he had an older sister called Trish. Somewhere else, his mother was on the ground having a seizure. There was some game I played earlier. There was a Keike family, which I thought was based on Preston's family."
"2755"	"(2009-04-08 (18)) I was doing math, doing sequences. Doing them enabled me to solve crimes on this game that was like Sleuth."
"2756"	"(2009-04-09 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was in some building with some others. There was this thing, which had this wood bottom and then a net around the outside. There were lots of these on top of each other.  You could sit in them or whatever. Someone opened this door and all these insects came rushing in, they were dangerous. We all started running. There were lots of halls and such. To get on the net thing, you had to pull yourself up on a rope to get to the higher ones, and then use the wood to pull yourself up higher. I got to the top level and there were three people in it, so I went to the one below it. Other people were stomping on the insects and trying to kill them. Finally they were all gone. But then another door got opened and there were more of them."
"2757"	"(2009-04-09 (18)) I was out the front of Mom's, but it was different. Uncle Gabriel came over to help with the building. There were lots of little things going on, rather than just the wall. One of the things was a 'bomb shelter'. He told Mom it would take at least 3 hours to cover it. There was a ramp of sand. Uncle Gabriel asked me something but I couldn't hear him and we were both like 'huh?'. There were puppies in the sand, and I can't remember how, but one of the puppies came alive and I gave it a pat."
"2758"	"(2009-04-09 (18)) I was in a building. There were people in chairs. We had to get into them to imprint something. Xander (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and someone else from Buffy the Vampire Slayer were there. Ezra was there and I was talking to him about some games. The person next to Xander got up, so I sat there -- it was squishy. Faith talked to me later and told me to tell Xander how I felt."
"2759"	"(2009-04-10 (18)) There was a family reunion thing. It took place on a 'ghost ship'. I went alone. Abigail was there and I asked her to call Mom and Ezra and ask them again to come. There were lots of people there. I was in a room where there were people I knew, along with others. Buffy, Willow and Xander (all from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were there. We had to take our clothes off to cover ourselves with stuff. There was meat, newspaper etc. We rubbed on this slime and put it on. None of my stuff would stick on. We were all nervous about taking our clothes off. I only had my pants off though. I put on lots of this glue but all the stuff still just fell off. I went into this bedroom, which was pretty cool looking although there were no beds. It was given to Ezra. I got a less cool one. I had no laptop and said I had to get it."
"2760"	"(2009-04-10 (18)) I was at university. Our speech was actually a play that we had to do in front of the whole school. We were in large groups. I asked our teacher how we were supposed to remember all the lines and she said that we would. Ezra was in the audience. Afterwards, we were given the day off. I was going to ask if she meant we could go home, or we still had to stay there. She said ""Are you going to ask me something? Shut up"". I walked out and called Mom and she said she was busy seeing a heap of people. I said I was let out early and she said it was too bad. I went to the bus stop, crossed the road and the bus was right there. There was a car coming towards me in the wrong lane. I got onto the bus, sat down and then went and tagged on. I didn't know the route though. When it was close to where I needed to go, I got off. I ended up at a shop. There were two Targets in it. I got to the door to leave, and it was all dark. I was with someone else (a girl) and we were trying to get away from someone. We went out to the carpark. We found the girl's car. This other girl was chasing us and she got in, so we ran. We went to this other car and the key worked. We got in and locked the doors. The seat was low down. I put it up and then started to drive. It was hard to see. The lights were red, but I couldn't stop in time and I drove through as it turned green. I think I went back to a bus stop."
"2761"	"(2009-04-11 (18)) I was at some building. At the entrance, there was an escalator which went down to the carpark. The carpark was confusing. I was walking with Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and I think we were dating. We were walking through and there were other people in these robes, but I think they were aliens. They had this dark space where the face should be. We went into this section and there were lots of other people too. We had to fill these 'holds', which were big cubicle like sections. The first two were full and Angel and I went into the third one. Someone else I knew was also in that one. Ezra was in the first one. They started giving random people guns and I realized they were going to make them shoot people. I was sitting on the floor and I got up and went and sat closely next to Angel. I remembered that we had had an argument not too long ago. Farrah came in to our hold, holding a gun, saying she knew who she wanted to kill and aimed at me, so I closed my eyes and she shot. She had shot the person next to me. I said to Angel ""we have to escape!"" and we ran out. I was thinking I had to get Ezra out. I was then by myself and I opened a door which led into an underground carpark. It was pitch black and was really scary. I heard a muffled cough, which freaked me out, and I moved quietly out. I ended up at the entrance. It was night, and there was an alarm light. There were people trying to break in. They got in and I threw something at them and then ran. Some chased me down the road. This guy stopped his car and told them to leave me alone. He said he'd help me. I didn't trust him though. His car was old and a manual. I said I'd walk with him and he agreed. We went down the road and this other guy's car was stopped and there was a loud high pitched noise, which I thought was a radio signal. This other car stopped and there were these white tiger things walking around. They chased us and we ran. We went up a park like thing and then they were gone. We got to a road and I asked ""which way is Midvale?"". We started walking down one way and then we were back at the place I was before. There was a section where they made burgers (giant sized). Then the guy who had helped me was, or at least looked like, Robert Downey Jr. and we hid in a burger (separately). I called Mom to tell her to meet me there. We left and she was behind this car dressed as a penguin. This was something to do with Robert Downey Jr. and 'The Whole of the Moon'."
"2762"	"(2009-04-11 (18)) Farrah and her 'mother', Jill, came over to see us [instead of Uncle Vic, which was happening in real life] . Jill looked like a blonde actress, but I can't remember who she is. Anyway, they had this small cute puppy. We were standing near a road, and it kept running out onto the road and I kept grabbing it back. They said it was a Jack Russell cross. We were then at some wildlife place. I recognized it. It was made of wood, the floors and the walls, and the rest was caged (it was up high too). I walked into this section I remembered going into with Dad at the Gold Coast. I realized there were lots of snakes in there wrapped around the poles. I walked away but got caught on something. A green snake opened up its mouth and I called Mom to help. It jumped at me and I grabbed it and threw it away. I could see a dude on the ground below talking to a group of people and he had a baby owl. It looked like a puppy and was extremely cute. Farrah was talking about a dream she had where ""we were human and these two killer queens..."". I thought of 'Killer Queen' and I said ""like the Queen song?!"". I think someone wanted to get an owl now."
"2763"	"(2009-04-13 (18)) Ezra, Mom, Clayton, some others and I went to this basketball court, which was near this round booth which the cops used. There was a cage with a dog and if you set the alarm off, it was allowed out. We were playing on the court and the alarm went off, so we ran. We got split up. I was walking around the streets with Mom. There were lots of people standing around in groups. There was also a Chow Chow around somewhere and it was tiny. I was thinking that they were too small and that I had to look at other dog breeds."
"2764"	"(2009-04-14 (18)) I can't remember much, but Spike and Buffy (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were hanging out. She was teasing him because he had gotten scared of a scary movie and he was saying it wasn't a big deal."
"2765"	"(2009-04-15 (18)) I can't remember the beginning but I was with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and someone else in a house (or something). I asked what time it was and someone said it was 4 in the morning. We opened the door and it looked more like 4pm. It was cloudy though. I think I was a vampire too. I had pants on and we grabbed a jacket to hold over us and we ran out. Spike ripped a branch off a bush with leaves to hold in front of his face to protect it. We went to this shop. It was really confusing to get there from where we were. I had to jump into this little thing, which was like an elevator. It was like a waist-high tray, which you stood in and had to control it yourself. It was hard to control, and would tilt and could go upside down. I wasn't very good at it and had to keep holding on to the ropes and going up really high, when I needed to go down, etc. This lady was waiting and got impatient and made it go back to her. Eventually I got into the shop. I was in the aisle with the chocolates but they all had expired years ago. I was looking at the Chomps, Kinder Surprises etc. Spike asked me for them, and then we were sneaking them into girls' bags. He told me earlier he was in love with Buffy. He was talking about it, but it seemed like he actually liked me. There was a competition thing which a bunch of girls had entered by filling out forms. There was a guy with a gun and he shot this dog and it fell over in a dead heap. A policeman captured him. I was lying on my back on the ground and Spike came on top of me and we started making out. Later, or maybe before, Mom had met this guy who could go invisible but he couldn't remember who he was. He came over. Ezra heard some people planning on robbing Poppa and he was going to try and infiltrate the group. I was at home. There were two dogs there. One was at the bottom of the pool. One of them was called Adam. There was also some guy who had made this path, and some tiles had fish patterns on them. Certain ones would break if you stepped on them and would crumble away."
"2766"	"(2009-04-16 (18)) There was a game, which was like Sleuth, but you could walk around to places. There was a playground and I went in and it was sort of dirty and gross. Ezra and his friends were talking in a private room and I was in the playground, which had a section above the room."
"2767"	"(2009-04-16 (18)) I met up with some old friend of mine and we started hanging out quite a bit. A cat appeared, which I recognized, and they tried to get rid of it. It kept coming back and they decided to just keep it. I can't remember what happened, but I killed my friend. I attacked her and pulled her face off, etc. I left and then sent her a message to ask what she was doing, to try and cover it up. Then it wasn't me. The person, who had killed her, was having vivid nightmares that she thought were real. Then it was some weird day where people turned into whatever they were thinking about at a certain point in time. This fat lady that I knew was talking to me. She said she had just had sex with this young guy, who was called Brad (he looked like a surfer)."
"2768"	"(2009-04-17 (18)) I was in a house with some others. There was a dinosaur outside and I had to get onto the roof to get away. I was jumping from roof to roof. I jumped to one, and missed and was hanging on to the ledge. I then swung into a kitchen. We then lived in that house which was in the country. We got this kitten but it still in an egg (which was how they came). I had to look after it. It was nearly ready to hatch, and I put it under the tap to soften the egg, but not too much, although I thought I might've left it under there for too long. It looked chicken-y. I put it in a cup and then took it out. Its eyes opened and started to hatch. It was then a normal sized kitten and it was orange. Mom said if we were going to be getting a new cat, this would be it. Darren then came back. They called it Ray, but hadn't decided on what to name it. I was playing with it and it fell asleep. It liked me and Mom noticed and said to Darren, that they would get him one later (it was originally supposed to be for him). Then he was another guy and he was trying to bond with it, Ezra tried too, but it still liked me. I was on the computer and Mom came in and said that Aaron (who was some teenage guy) said that I could stay over to try out some computer. I downloaded some program which did some blood sampling thing, toxicity levels and other stuff."
"2769"	"(2009-04-18 (18)) I did a scratchie and won $2250. I was reading about Dylan Moran on the net. I found some pictures from something I did. I was in them, but I can't read what it says next. I showed it to Mom. I went to this place in the woods and got this cabin in the woods. I was with Eugene, who was my boyfriend, but sometimes he was/looked like Robert Knepper. This guy there was creepy looking and looked a bit like Robert Knepper. I can't remember what happened for most days, but we suspected the leader guy of being dodgy. I 'remembered' having sex with Eugene near this river. It was actually a movie sometimes and that happened in the movie and I was imagining it, very vividly. Anyway, one night I decided I wanted to have sex with him. The lights in the cabin weren't working, but one little light came on. I was on the floor doing something, when Eugene came in. He lied down in the bed and was talking to me, while turning off the lights outside. I took my clothes off and went over to the bed and climbed on top of him. We kissed and then I realized the lights were on outside and someone was watching us. I got up and covered myself with a shirt. Eugene then found a camera under the cupboard and we realized they had been spying on us. I put my clothes on. We were packing up to leave. Earlier, I was going through a video camera that Dad had. There was a video of Mom on the toilet, pooping. I also found some video of Eugene and I having sex, but he didn't film it."
"2770"	"(2009-04-19 (18)) I was watching Lost. They had finished up at the DHARMA initiative. They were getting flashes again. Kate and Ben are the only two who I remember. Then I was getting flashes, along with a few others. This girl and I went to this train station thing to wait for another person. From the future, there had been a girl with curly blonde hair. We were trying to look out for her because she was a bad guy. I saw her and we had to ask her to hold onto this brown board of wood. We knew she would betray us, but had to get her to do it. We got onto a train. There were mirrors on the sides, which showed 'reality' -- the food had maggots and such. The bad girl left. We then were at a house and it was night. We had to leave. We went out the door and it was pitch black outside. I saw (bad) people hiding in the bushes and such on the other side of the road. We carefully crawled out and went behind bushes instead of going near the road, and made it to the back of the house. Then the girl I was with was Anya (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and she was talking about jobs she wanted -- including an ambulance driver. We saw a group of people and I assumed they were religious singing people. We went over and this girl who looked just like Anya hugged her and it was her mother (she didn't know, as she had taken over a body). Her mother asked her where Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was as he had been her boyfriend. Then I was at a library/book shop and it reminded me of Planet Video. Ms Ingram was there. She was trying to help me find handouts for my speech. We decided on a poster of Watchmen. I wanted this 'real' one which had Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the corner, but I could only find cartoon ones. There was a real one but it only had Jeffrey Dean Morgan on it. Part of my speech mentioned Lisa from The Simpsons and Ms Ingram showed me some Bart and Homer pictures. There were some South Park pictures which were 3D-ish and smoothed out. There was something that had Cartman talking and I couldn't work out if it was his real voice or not."
"2771"	"(2009-04-20 (18)) I can't remember this dream properly, as it was all over the place. I was on MSN talking to Ezra. I was friend with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). There was this rooftop looking place, but it wasn't a rooftop, where there was a moving block that came from the ground and was what Spike used to get into his underground area and back up. I remembered back to when I was young and watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Spike had hung out here all the time. I laughed and told him about him sitting 'cool' and with a skeleton on top of a coffin. People kept resurrecting family members. I remembered walking around the block and how almost every girl had watched some movie. I don't remember what it was and I was telling Ezra about it."
"2772"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) There was a spaceship and it reminded me of Battlestar Galactica. Something happened and the first 13 floors got flooded. I was on the 13th floor and this girl and guy told me that they were teleporting away to a planet and would come back for us. The timer had already started and they disappeared. I went to tell others."
"2773"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) Mom and I went to a friend's who was selling puppies. They weren't anything special and she was trying to force us to buy one. She put them in the back of the car and we said we liked it? Darren was there too. I was saying that I didn't want to get a dog I didn't really like."
"2774"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) I was at a restaurant with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Dad, I think. Spike was eating a bloody piece of meat. I think I was a slayer. This girl came and we started fighting. She held Spike at the wall, holding a stake at his chest and I told her not to do it and ripped her off him and told him to run. She had others with her. I ran out into a big shop. I ran into the stairwell and bolted down. I think Samantha was the girl? Someone was eating a hamburger on the stairs (I was above them, looking down). I ran out onto a floor and hide under the escalator. They were looking for me. She turned off this fountain they had inside. I then ran the other way. There were no shops with anything I could use as a weapon. I ran into a wedding shop. She followed me and we fought again. I asked if I could finish writing in some dreams before she killed me and she agreed. I text Calvin, saying ""weps and camera. 20 mins, bush behind bride shop. Bring like 20 people"". Outside, there was a bush/forest thing. I ran out the back door and hundreds of people were coming through the bush -- all the people Calvin had gathered. I ran in the direction they were heading. I got there and thanked Calvin. I realized I didn't have my phone and I went back and found it. There were teachers from last year there. Eugene's car pulled in too."
"2775"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) I can't remember properly, but Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Ezra, Dad, others and I were outside, during the day. I realized this and I asked Spike why he was in the sun. We were on the way to Nana's. He started to burn so we walked in the shade. There were two paths to take, one which had bush covering and therefore totally shaded from the sun and the other was a long way around and not shaded. I said we should take the bush path for Spike but they ignored me and went the other way, so I went up the bush path. I got there first. I went into the backyard and walked towards the kitchen. I saw a giraffe in there. Nana said ""Oh there's a giraffe in the kitchen"", like it was normal and I said ""Yeah... because that happens every day,"". Dad came next. Inside, there were photos on the fridge. One had two Jared Padalecki's, with a guy and a fire in the background. Spike and I were also in it, hidden behind the others talking to each other. I was like 'oh I remember two Sam's'. Ezra was like ""good times""."
"2776"	"(2009-04-21 (18)) Ezra came into my room, which was different. I had a TV as a monitor and wallpaper on the edges of my wall. I had piles of stuff and he started doing stuff and I was telling him off and explaining why. I complained to Mom about it and she just told me to shut up. Ezra got angry and started throwing stuff and was like crying angrily and was about to slam my door and I stopped him. He squirted me with choc milk and I went into his room and did the same. I was trying to tidy my room and he came in and helped to do something on the computer. I went onto Facebook and somehow found two accounts called Matthew Clark, but his name was actually Preston Casey? I was going through his photos and I was going to get them but Ezra was watching me. I had posted something on there before, so I deleted it. Some guy said ""42"" and then I (or someone) said ""oh, by 80"" and saying that some other model was better than what he had. My webcam was called ""Izaela"" and I said ""No I call it Vera"". Then it was Adam Baldwin on the computer and he said ""Yeah, coz everything's so much easier if it's called Izaela""."
"2777"	"(2009-04-22 (18)) Mom made me go into the shop and we got this weird shaped key, we had $10, but it was $20 so I went to Mom. I then decided I didn't want it and got the money back. Mom was babysitting Amelia. It was stormy looking outside. She said it was going to storm badly and she was going for a drive. I went along anyway and Ezra sat in the back. It said it was 4.40, which meant we were late. We ended up at Darren's parents, but they were all different and I didn't recognize anyone at the table. I started feeling weird. They all wanted to hold hands. I said I didn't want to join in, saying ""I'm not doing any stupid religious stuff"". Darren started crying before because his mother was sick with cancer, I think I ended up attacking Mom; I dug my nails into her. Everyone got confused. I left, still feeling odd. Everyone was ignoring me and staring at me. I was then walking with a group, including Giles (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), in a grassy area. The rest were teenagers and had to do something to stop them from getting up to no good. We were walking down a path, Giles no longer with us, so I called out and he came. I think he was angry with me. There was a pool table and he was playing pool and won. He cheated I think. Ezra was on a computer and he was watching a Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) montage. Darren said the music used was ""cute"" and fit the montage.  Then he said ""Ew, he has a freckle on his face!""."
"2778"	"(2009-04-22 (18)) I had some mail and it was my proof of age card. The envelope was big and was full of other stuff. The photo on the card was stupid. My mouth was open, but it had three mini photos and my main photo was me on a 3/4 angle with the front of my face over the top. I called Mom to complain but I couldn't get through. I tried to call the DPI but I kept getting disconnected. I went for my walk with Ezra. We went across the road and there was a lemur. I called out ""There's a lemur eating Ezra's head!"". It tried to get me, so we ran. It was bouncing around. I was then watching something. There was a boy and he opened the door and there was a creepy scarecrow and I screamed."
"2779"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There was a second Buffy. I can't remember how she was around, but she was like the Buffy-bot. Spike was with her and angry with it because it was annoying. They were doing a strong spell and Dawn was doing it, which I thought was strange. Tara was with her. She stopped for a second and then there were two Tara's and they were doing the same thing. I was looking for Buffy stuff to download for Sims 2. There was lots of Spike stuff, but I also found Buffy outfits and a Spike Sim. There was a forum post and people replied with numbers, one of them was ""167th!"" etc. They were making a list of people who Spike had 'slept with'."
"2780"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I don't know where we were, but Raquel and I were far away (like a few hours drive). The train only came every 1-2 hours. There was one coming in a few minutes but she decided to catch a ride back instead. There was a big truck thing and a fat dude was driving. We asked if he was going into town and he asked where we were going and we replied ""Centerville"". We had to sit in the back. Raquel jumped out after about one minute. I told him to stop and I tried to go after her but I had to run through some sand and it was hard to run. She pulled up with a Ute and I got in. We then tried to get on the freeway, but ended up at a factory place. There was lots of smoke and we had to drive through it, so we wound up the windows. It started coming through the aircon (which didn't work). I said that I got lost here once with Mom. I was then out of the car hanging around outside the factory. There was a box of kittens and they were really cute. Someone called my name and it was Ezra and he was moving sand?"
"2781"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I was watching a movie like Scary Movie. The guy with the mask was on the phone to a girl at the start and mentioned killing a ""skirt"" and then told her to ""look out the window"" and her boyfriend was tied to a chair wearing girls' clothes. The next day at school, he was actually gay and acting very flamboyant and snapping his fingers. He was Indian-ish. He had become friends with this guy and he went up to his friends and put his arm around them, and snapped his fingers and left. His friends were all confused about it."
"2782"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I was with Nana. We were going to Michael Palin's house. We were walking up to it and the house was big (mansion-like). It had a big driveway with a bit of garden. I was telling Nana that I had deja vu. We were going to meet him on the oval. There was a fake battle going on and there were people in costume. We went inside and he was with this lady secretary called ""Ms Fichtner"". His kitchen was big and had a dining table spreading over two rooms. There was a big bowl of bowl of big bananas. The room was very glassy (lots of windows etc). Then Nana was Raquel. There was a shop section in his house. There was a food section on the outside of a clothes shop. It had desserts on it and Raquel eating them. I had a few bites, but I was full. She ate a lot and when they were finished they put new ones there."
"2783"	"(2009-04-23 (18)) I can't remember what show, but it was X-Files like and then Mulder and Scully were in a hangar warehouse thing talking."
"2784"	"(2009-04-24 (18)) I was with a guy friend and we were in bed. It was then Xander and Willow (both Buffy the Vampire Slayer). She asked ""did we sleep together?"". Then I was somewhere else on a bed with others and there was a photo of Mariyam at a party and she had her pants off and had a guy's penis in her mouth. We were all like 'ew!'. Tigger was at Mom's on my bed, and then went under it. Ezra was reading off a file and Jayson's photo was next and I realized it was my PowerPoint presentation. I got it off him and put it under my bed. Then I was with Chuck (Chuck) in a carpark. We liked each other but I think I was like in Sarah's position, but then I was just a normal person. Sarah was there too and she had something in her head that let her scan licence plates. I was on the net and looking at Yvonne Strahovski and Zachary Levi's profiles on Flixter or something. I tried to download the latest episode (it was up to season 3), but I accidentally downloaded a season 1 episode and then one from season 2. Then Darren had his own house and we went over there. He had a sister called Astrid. It was night. I joked to Mom ""What a lovely name"". They told me to be quiet. There was a monster? It had a sharp jagged claw thing. I managed to cut its arm off. It stabbed Darren, but he was ok. We were then in a carpark again and it was lying dead on the ground. The police came; one of them was a young guy. They asked us what we were up to, 'drinking' etc (they were suspicious of us). Ezra was with us. I said ""Yeah we're out drinking with a 15 year old"". The cop grabbed Ezra's hand and was questioning him about not having a job since he was old enough etc. Then, I can't remember properly, but I was in a game? There were zombie things and I ran into a room and I had to do stuff to get to the next room. There was a hole in the wall and I opened a latch and this octopus/squid thing was in there. I pulled out the tentacles and then I had to punch it in the head. I then had to reach in and grab its eyeballs. I did so. I put the eyeballs in the door slot and went to the next room. I was in a hall with tools on the walls. I grabbed a hammer and a chisel. I walked through to the next room and Yvonne Strahovski was there. We had to do excavation type digging and I had grabbed the right tools. I told the girl next to me I did this in robotics. Then I was with Chuck and Sarah and we had to take the elevator to the top floor and to the roof of this building. There were 11 floors. I got in and an Asian dude got in too. It passed the 11th floor and I got off with him. I don't know what I did, but I was then coming back down the road and there was a plane on the freeway (this was on the roof?). This lady pointed me in the direction of the door. I got in the elevator and this guy came and I tried to close the door before he got in, but he got in. I thought he was dodgy. He pressed the button for the first floor. He got off there and I was now 'Chuck' and had no intersect. He got off but I went to the floor below because I couldn't be bothered running down the stairs. I ran outside and there were dodgy cars. There was a bomb thing but I didn't know where to go. I ran and hid behind bushes out the front of the shop. There was lots of gunfire and I was now Ellie and she cried ""Chuck!"" (quietly)."
"2785"	"(2009-04-25 (18)) I got a game for something. I got a Pokemon game and a doctor game thing. I was playing the Pokemon game and I had to heal three types of Pokemon but you also got other animals coming in that needed healing. You could then use them on a farm. Ezra was there too. The Pokemon came through yellow, blue or pink, and they just looked like flippers. The setting was in like a portable hospital (it was like a caravan). I told Ezra what to do and said to use something -- you had lots of choices. We shoved it in (the needle or whatever) and it died. We then were following the steps off a guide and it was all working. Then we were in the ground because we had to plant a tree. Someone played a joke on me? I was then at a school. I was in class and Ms Ingram asked who liked to work alone. I put my hand up, as did Preston, but then he also put his hand up for working in a group. I had an argument with this guy on the oval and I called him a 'tard'. He started calling me fat and ugly and I said ""at least I'm not retarded"". He got angry and was like 'what did you say?!'. I was far away from class and started walking across the oval to go home. I realized I forgot my shoes and walked back. I went back to the class and three guys were chucking shoes onto the roof (there were lots of shoes). I realized I had 'three' of my shoes. They had also stolen something else (Freddo's, etc). As I took them off him, they were on my face again (that's what it looks like, it might not be 'on'). I had a fight with him and after that he was friendly towards me. He played soccer. Later, I was at Mom's, which was totally different and in a different area. It was night and very dark. My computer was outside. It was on the edge of a hill, which I walked up with this old lady and Mom, Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and Dad were there, outside another house. Poppa started trying to have sex with Nana and pushed her on the floor. They were joking about it, and then Uncle Wilbur went on her and Poppa and his 'boss'. Everyone was laughing and joining in while I stood in shock. I just got what I went there to get and walked back. There were some people with a cute kitten and I said it looked like their old one and then they killed it. It came back though. They kept killing it but it just kept coming back."
"2786"	"(2009-04-26 (18)) I complained to Darren that Ezra's carpet was better than mine. They were going to be doing something to mine, so we decided to change it. We were getting paper and rubbing off the floor to put carpet down. There was a layer of 'carpet balls' and they were small. I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They were in a caravan. Buffy was upset with everyone for not noticing her, then she invisible. She left and time passed (it was only a while for her). She went to a house and there was a guy who looked like ""James Spader or Jimmi Simpson"" (that's what I thought). He was young (in his 20's). She wasn't invisible at the moment and she was inside. She passed a mirror and he had no reflection, so she staked him. She went to leave and then he said that it wasn't going to stop him. Then the cops were at the door. He went out and so did Buffy. He walked out into the sunlight and was ok. She went to the Magic Box, but it was closed down. It was only a small shop on the corner of a street. There were puppies and kittens left inside (it had been a pet shop). She went inside. She was now invisible again, but this old lady came and could see her. She told her to do some stuff and then she went all senile and said ""you have milk with your milk!"" and got angry. Buffy left and she was now me. It was starting to get dark and vampires started coming out. I was staking them and got in a car. The old lady said ""you'll never get your licence!"". I was running the vampires down and there were groups of them at every turn. A teenage guy was at a skate park thing and there were long jumps. His 'friend' asked him if he'd ever done some cool trick and he said yeah, but was obviously lying. They were near a school, which I ran into. We were then all running around in the stairwell and using this broken bit of wood as a stake and some vampires didn't 'dust'. There were lots of different sets of stairs and it was really confusing. The vampires would bite people and they would turn straight away and keep biting, so they just kept increasing and there were heaps. Cordelia was there and was like 'what is going on? Zombies?'. I wasn't very scared of them and was going straight into them and staking them. I was then hiding out in the stairs with a few people. The vampires called everyone down and a small group and I went up this set of stairs, quietly. We got to the top and it was just a small balcony at the top of the gym (where everyone was), and no way to get off. There was a huge crowd down there. The only way to get off was to go straight into them. So, we leapt off onto this mat, which fell into them and some people fell off. We staked some and then the mat bounced back up and the next one fell into another group of vampires and we lost some more of the group. We tried to get to the next one but they got us. There were only three of us still human. They put us up against the wall and asking if we wanted to be turned or just killed. There was a video shop right outside the gym. Some guys came in and the vampires saw them and were like 'tasty snack'. One of the guys then turned around with a gun pointed at them and he was Colin Farrell and I was like 'oh no, Colin Farrell!'. I was thinking 'please don't let Colin Farrell save the day'. They were shooting and I was trying to work out how to escape. Then I was in a cinema with Dad and we were watching some Colin Farrell movie. I hadn't actually watched it and it ended, and everyone stood up and applauded it and were crying. I was annoyed, thinking that I'd wished I'd watched it."
"2787"	"(2009-04-26 (18)) I was in a car with Mom, Darren and Ezra. Ezra was using my iPod because I had a heap of songs from this new R&B singer guy that I didn't like. Two Princes came on the radio and Darren was like 'Oh my God, I love this song!'. We dropped Ezra off. Darren had a shirt that Dad had. Then it was like a dream I've had before and no-one could touch anyone. I was with Eugene and a guy and a girl. There were zombie things too. There weren't many though. We went to this shed building. It had lots of floors and every one was the same and empty. It swayed too. The floors were just big rooms. We picked a floor and we lied down to sleep. Eugene and I slept next to each other, as we always did, and wore gloves and were completely covered in case we touched. This lady and son had something to do with it and they wanted to start it up again (it was like on a farm and it produced something?). They saw us and gave us food and it was weird and squishy and in balls. They gave us fruit too (lots of fruit). The guy was weird looking but I thought he looked a little like Michael Palin. Eugene and I never said we liked each other, but we and everyone else knew we did. One day I somehow fell off a cliff and he grabbed my hand and pulled me up. We looked at each other and realized we were ok and then we started making out."
"2788"	"(2009-04-27 (18)) I called Ezra to ask him something and I was on my way home. I was then outside (it was different) and there was a party in there. There were people on my computer, which was right next to a window with no curtain. I tapped on the window and they ignored me. I stormed in, angrily, and said ""Get off my computer!"". They were people from school last year. They were actually not on my computer and Ezra was. He quickly got off and I pulled the desk behind it away (they had been sitting at a desk where my computer usually was) and I put my computer back. They complained about having to move. I went on Facebook and I had a message and it was from Duane. Silas was in my suggested friends list."
"2789"	"(2009-04-27 (18)) I was at Mom's, which was different. I was talking to her about PETA and saying that there was a Penn & Teller: Bullshit episode about them and that I thought they were evil. A group of them came over but they were like carpenters and were showing us different things we could do around the garden. We weren't interested and then this guy was like 'I'll get them with this one!' and Mom decided to go with it. This singer climbed up on a railing at his concert and then jumped into the crowd. They caught him but he was bleeding. Mom and I helped carry him away. This lady was trapped outside? I said ""Darren's gay"" because he was there. Someone was being distant towards me. I told Mom that someone had made a name by themselves by pretending they were male because ""no-one reads female writers"". There was an episode of Heroes and we (?) were in a safe and we used phones and ice to block others?"
"2790"	"(2009-04-28 (18)) I was taking another IB course somewhere else incase I failed at Westland. Ezra was doing it too. Ms Myzshka was on the teacher list. The class was big.  The first assignment was a speech and we had to introduce ourselves. It was Wednesday and I was missing out on the MUPC to be there. I decided to leave. I text Mom but then went to Westland by myself. I was one hour early so I decided to skip it altogether."
"2791"	"(2009-05-01 (18)) Mom took me to something and I decided I didn't want to go in. I waited in the car. This guy who looked like Ezra came over and opened the door and attacked Mom. He had a brick and was hitting her with it. I said at least he's not holding it down, or something, and then he did. He was really hurting her and I tried to get him off."
"2792"	"(2009-05-01 (18)) I discovered some bombs, I think. I pushed them away and closed a gate. Some kids, others and I lied down and covered ourselves and it went off. Then it was a desert place. There were a few houses and a few things in the sand to stay in. There weren't many people left, no electricity etc. I was trying to work out with someone what we were going to do with everyone. There weren't many male children, and they were mostly black. I can't remember what happened but this girl and I were in an airplane thing and the guy started to take off. The girl was Judy Reyes sometimes. I peeked over the top and he was going to commit suicide by flying into the mountains. He stopped to take a break. We got out and we ended up in a carpark. We ran behind a building and took a car. We saw his car coming back (it was a red sporty looking car). We drove at full speed away from him. I was then running and was in a building at Westland. I was going up and down stairs and ended up in the library and I didn't know where to go."
"2793"	"(2009-05-01 (18)) I pulled off my thumbnail, which was quite long and there was a short one underneath, which confused me. They both easily peeled off. I tried to put the long one back on, but it felt like I had two nails on there. I showed Mom. Ezra and I were then in water and there was a bit where you hold onto swings and then you are shot forward, and there was a long 'obstacle' course in the water."
"2794"	"(2009-05-02 (18)) I was at Nana's, which was different. There was a big room full of beds. Outside that room was a shop thing. The aisles had horror posters, puzzles etc. There was a Child's Play one and a haunted house one. It spoke to me (it had an audio thing). I went to bed. It was dark in there as people were already sleeping. Nana and Poppa were in a bed. Dad and Ezra were in another. I said to Ezra later that instead of building one big bedroom, I should've them and a shop separately. We were clearing out movies. We had heaps missing including The Langoliers and The Happening and others. I found Ezra and he said he didn't take them, so I was looking for Dad to ask him. I went into a computer shop to look for him. I left and realized I needed to go back (we owned it and Dad had stuff there?). I was walking outside and I saw Turk (Scrubs) walking below. I yelled out ""Turk!"" but he didn't hear me, so I went closer to this fence and yelled again and he heard me. I told him to tell them to close the shop; he smiled in acknowledgment and ran back."
"2795"	"(2009-05-03 (18)) There was another season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it was season 9. Her mother was a bot, and I think Buffy was too. Her sister was a baby. Spike was over. All these robots came and, like vampires, had to be invited in, but they had some way around it. I was then Buffy and I was shooting them and giving weapons to others. One then got out this clock thing which we knew was dangerous and so activated this thing we had and ran and got sent into another world. We were at a school and Buffy was sitting at a table in a grassy section talking to a friend about slaying. Someone there fixed our device so we had more control over where we went with the device. In that world, people could change their names whenever they wanted. In the next world, her mother was still alive, but she wasn't. I was watching Smallville and Clark and his girlfriend, who was Mena Suvari, were going to have sex. He was lying naked on the bed and I thought that was odd for Smallville to have full frontal nudity. Lana was in the room too and she was a bot and was naked and lying on the ground."
"2796"	"(2009-05-04 (18)) I can't remember properly, but this guy and his mother lived in a fancy house at a shopping center, as they had shop things there. One day he saw someone who was vampire like and he stabbed them in the heart. He told people about it and they thought he was crazy. Soon after, there were lots at his door and he was stabbing them all with sharp things and then he found his mother and asked if all the doors and windows were locked. She said they were. They closed the blinds and snuck along under the windows. They looked out a window and they could see the entrance of the store (the store was circular). There were some vampires lining up. They went out another entrance and they turned around and started coming at him. He managed to kill all of them. Then they got back up and it had been set up by his mother to show him that there were no vampires. It now had been an episode of a show and I had thought it was a good idea. Jasper and Fatso were back and they were all at Ezra's room."
"2797"	"(2009-05-04 (18)) A submarine had gone missing? Some others and I went to investigate. It was connected strangely and I picked up the top bit out of the water and there was a little section where you sit to control it. I emptied the water out of it and pulled it to the surface. I got in and there was a guy talking on the intercom, but he was speaking a different language. It had then been a movie and he was Jean Reno. He had a daughter on there too. I discovered the submarine was full of zombies or vampires and so got out. It had started sinking again and it was hard to get out. I had to swim back to the top. Eugene was part of the group and we had a kid and two puppies (they were all with us). A bunch of vampires came towards us, but it was day time. There were these hard plastic arrows on the ground and we stabbed them with them. We got rid of that lot and kept moving. There was a section of the place (it was school like) that was messy and there had obviously been a big fight there. There was a giant arrow and I said ""ooh, can I have this?"" and someone said ""They'll get you before you pick it up and turn it around to them"". We were then given darts to get them with. More came and I had extremely good accuracy, getting them directly in the heart. I missed a few though and kept stabbing them until they were gone. Some ran towards us at one point and I had an arrow and a dart and held them out and killed them. We put our son, plus this guy's daughter whose name was Kara and our puppies on a roof to keep them safe. The kids were around 5 years old. Also, one of the puppies was called Mikey. We walked into this section with dorms and a classroom with stairs leading down. I was worried about the kids. There were vampires scattered around, just wandering around and dopey looking."
"2798"	"(2009-05-05 (18)) I was at dads. I think Granny was over, or we were there earlier and she gave us microwaved chips for food. Ezra ate some, but it was gross and I didn't want to eat it. I called Mom and she told me to text her because she couldn't talk. She said she was looking after Amelia. I wanted to go back to her place to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Later, Ezra and I were crossing the street and Ben (Lost) walked past behind us and I was like 'Ben is awesome!' and Ezra was like 'meh'."
"2799"	"(2009-05-06 (18)) I was at home. Ezra was having a party and there were lots of teenagers there. I was secretly going out with Neil Flynn and he was there too. He was a bit Janitor-like (Scrubs). Ezra and I were in the pool but I wasn't putting my head underwater. This guy was in a costume with a creepy mask and it gave me chills and freaked me out. There was a tall, pale guy but Neil was still heaps taller. Some girls, Neil and I left and we ended up at another party. There were some people sitting on the lounge, including Neil. I sat on front of him and he was subtly touching me with his foot. Also, Ezra was saying that he thought he was gay and Mom was like 'no, you're not gay'. We all left again and Lindsay Lohan was with us now. There wasn't enough room in the car. Lindsay was usually the driver, I think, but she moved into the back to sit on someone's lap. I didn't know where Neil was and I said ""Where's Janitor? We can't leave without Janitor"". But then he was in the driver's seat. I couldn't see over his head because he was so tall (I was behind the driver). While driving, he asked ""Izzy, can you hand me some of those handwipes?"" and I asked ""KFC ones?"".  There were a few scattered on the floor. I picked one up and handed it over and he gently held and stroked my fingers as he took it. I fell back in my seat, really happy and thinking that no-one in the car knew or saw it. I don't know where we went then, but it was possibly Mom's. It was different though. I was on the bed, and Neil was on the computer which was against the wall next to the bed. He was looking at pipes and stuff -- because he was a janitor? I had found my dream books earlier, which had been in a cupboard at home. There weren't any 96 page ones and they were small. I was going through them and mentioned a recent dream. Neil asked ""was I in it?"" and I said ""yep"". He said something about the room and I said ""it's got a lock on the door"". I started putting away stuff on the bed. I was watching Scrubs and Todd said ""Yep, everyone's a fart"". Then, Neil's character was called Todd and I thought it was odd that I never noticed there were two Todd's. Some time before, I showed Mom some books. This girl came into the room and said ""sucks he's not interested in me"" and I responded ""I don't care"". Mom was watching Supernatural. It was the end of season 2 or a TV movie. There was a weird cloudy thing in the sky. There was a guy with a dog and a car. I was watching episode 2 and was making fun of Dean's face. I was thinking that now Mom would now who Sam and Dean are."
"2800"	"(2009-05-06 (18)) There was a shop attached to where we lived. A family was moving into this section we used to play in sometimes. It was going to be a kid's bedroom (a very big one). There was a Subway right across from it. There was a young guy there and Mom thought he was hot and was being flirty with him. Mom and Darren said they were going for a drive, so I came. We got there and got out of the car and they put on masks to cover their eyes and black jumpers. I asked what they were doing and they said they were breaking in to get files off a computer. I waited in a room with a Chihuahua. It was looking at me and trying to nip our feet, so I started talking to it aggressively to let it now I was the boss. It went away and put its head down. Tigger and Gizmo were then there too."
"2801"	"(2009-05-06 (18)) I was at Nana's. There was a girl talking to a guy to get a movie part in the dining room. He told her to take her clothes off and I told her not too. Later, we were out the back and I can't remember but he got something and was trying to attack me with it. I got this ""triple fly swat"" and hit him with it. We ended up on the ground and to save him another whack, I hit his eye and it turned white and he was then blind. I was like ""I'm sorry!"". But he got up with his weapon and I ran in and told Nana to lock the doors. I asked for the car keys so we could try and leave."
"2802"	"(2009-05-07 (18)) I was at home. There was a door in the kitchen leading out the back but it had been blocked for years. Tinkerbell and Tigger were outside and I let them in. I went to my room and it was clean, but still a bit messy. My shutters were open and so all the light was natural light. There were pillows and cushions on the floor as well as a giant slug. The latest episodes of House and Lie to Me were out. This girl dropped something in a bin and Jennifer Morrison got it, I think it was drugs. Later, she was with Chase (House) and she was giggly. House found it in the bin."
"2803"	"(2009-05-07 (18)) I remembered this movie, but I couldn't remember its name. I had remembered about it because I found paintings of it on my computer and the stuff had happened to me. It was Asian like. I was walking with guys from Prison Break and Michael Scofield was walking next to me. I was thinking how T-Bag and Bellick were the most dreamt about from Prison Break. Anyway, I think the movie had Bellick in it and Willem Defoe. I found it on the net, but I now can't remember what it was called but it was from 2000. I went to a shop where I had first found the movie. In the movie, there were people in cars and there was a spooky thing happening outside. One scene had a car in the water and there were electric wires sparking in it. At the shop, I found a little shop -- the aisles were squishy and they all leant on each other. There was a squeaky thing. There was a girl with downs syndrome and she kept doing a kick in the air. I got out and I had a call from Darren saying that Mom had left town, which meant she was borrowing a car off Poppa. I asked if he could pick me up -- I was at Meadowbrook. He was on a motorbike. I was going through my phone and I had Eugene's number and I accidentally dialed it, but quickly hung up."
"2804"	"(2009-05-08 (18)) I was telling Ezra about the last episode of Lie to Me, the one with the prison, while I was eating. Mom was making pudding in the oven and it had peas and corn in it too, to make it warmer. Then I was half watching/half living it. There was a prison. There were 5/10 people left that knew something. Two of them were supposedly in there. One was called Claire and she had a kid in there who had been killed (I think) and hidden in a vending machine. There was a room and I got dragged in there by a bad guy. The room was full of 'good' prisoners. The guards came in and all the prisoners killed them. I knew which people knew the thing. I said, to a bad guy, 'I'd like to say I'd last 50 years [of torture] , but I wouldn't last one year' and that I didn't know anything. I was offered a comfortable room. Scrubs was on TV and Carla knew a patient's illness, but was waiting for Elliot to get it. The Janitor was somewhere too, and someone proposed to Elliot. Then there was a game and it was Left 4 Dead like and I had a computer team. We had guns so were shooting the zombies. Then we hid in a big bathroom (it was really big, like the size of the kitchen and lounge room or bigger). It was full of zombies and there was a witch one (from Left 4 Dead) and it screamed at me and I shot it. I kept opening the door and shooting whatever was there.  Then two of the computer team came. Dylan Moran was in there too and he got bit. I shot him in the groin/stomach area. He was confused about it and I told him he was going to turn. He was upset. His hand had been shot on the side and it was bloody and gross. I sat down next to him and ran my fingers through his hair, thinking I'd always wanted to do that. My gun was on the ground and I saw him tense up so I moved it away. My phone rang and it was a black team-mate (a computer player). He asked ""Where are you?"", I replied ""Uh... bathroom"". He hung up. It was time for a herd. We got given an extra gun, mine was heavy. I put my back up against the wall and put Dylan Moran in the corner so if he turned I could shoot him. Then Jack and Ben (both from Lost) had been in a fight and Ben had died, but he knew who the last person was (of those people that knew something) and so brought him back. Ben was visibly happy and Jack warned him about these 'fairy' things. One of them, if you got bit, there was no coming back. Then he was saying Turk (Scrubs) didn't want to know. Ben was cheery and then he got hit in the back with a paste from the fairy thing and I was thinking 'no, they can't kill him twice'. Also, I did end up having to shoot Dylan Moran. I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Mac was with two guys. I was like ""Who's the other one? Charlie! Duh, my favourite!"". Mac was working in a pizza place or something."
"2805"	"(2009-05-08 (18)) I was invited to a party. I went with Mom, Ezra, Dad and Nana to check out the place. The people there were really friendly and had glasses of a chocolate drink. I had a taste and it was really nice. I liked Coke too. They left and then Ezra and I were left there. Ezra was then a friend of mine. They told us to stay in a room and they took our phones. Eventually, some guys were playing poker in a room next to us, but downstairs. They were smoking and drinking and laughing like they were going to do something bad. My friend was now Zach Braff and we were joking around and he accidentally grabbed my butt. I said ""why'd you do that?"" and he said ""I don't know, I didn't think ahead"". I'm not sure how long after, but a girl started screaming and they tried to get in our room. I tried to keep the door closed. Outside the room, they had babies and puppies and were dropping them off the balcony (an inside balcony). I tried to call out to one of them and they laughed and it was really evil sounding. They were raping girls. We kept trying to escape but it was impossible. It then reset to just before Mom and co left. I let them leave again. The same stuff happened, but I got my phone back and tried to call the police. I said I didn't remember the street name and it was written on the fridge, but I said it was in Dianella. Then the person on the phone started talking weird and I realized it was one of the bad guys. I realized my phone had been modified. I tried to send a message on Facebook, via my phone. By the way, when it reset, Ezra and I remembered everything but no-one else did. It reset again and this time I got my phone back before it got modified, but they gave me my friend's phone and my phone to them. My friend was now Calvin. I text Mom the address and told her to get me now. This time we managed to escape and Calvin, others and I ran into a shop area and all the bad guys were chasing us. It was night. Some of us got caught. A few of us also hid in a bush but some got up and they saw us. A few of us (including myself) ran into a tunnel, which were train tunnels but they were like sewer tunnels. We just ran blindly down the tracks and tunnels and up and down sets of stairs. I called Mom and one of them answered. I couldn't outrun them so I tried to hide under a set of stairs. Then a head was next to me and he said ""hello"" in a deep voice, which scared me. It reset again (to before Mom and co left) and I said ""let's go now"". Dad was in a Ute and I was standing outside waiting to get in. The sky was cloudy and evil. I was telling Dad about what kept happening and he said they had to lay off the 'scary' stories."
"2806"	"(2009-05-08 (18)) This was similar to the dream before. We were being held at a house. I went to the toilet and there were no walls. Then there were vampires and so we were staking them. There was a couple having sex standing up in some clothes racks. I walked in on them and said ""carry on"" and left. There were two dodgy guys starting to walk towards them -- they were vampires. This girl, who was part of the bad guys, seemed to not like the bad guy side. We said we needed something and mouthed for her to say to let us out. She had Turk (Scrubs) in like, a cage. He had blonde hair. I said to get his hair cut. We left, but had to dress up in 50's school clothes and we had to participate in a sports game."
"2807"	"(2009-05-09 (18)) I was in a shop. I can't remember properly, but the Janitor (Scrubs) had this grape like thing and I had to plant them (it was like in the game, Wandering Willows). There was another plant too. Some didn't work out though. Oz and Willow (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were there. Some of the plants started working and she was getting hopeful."
"2808"	"(2009-05-09 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I think it was the future. I went into a classroom and everyone was very emotionless and I thought it was like The Invasion (saw a glimpse of it on TV last night). I copied them and this guy was next to me and he was also playing along. A teacher was keeping an eye on us. They gave us work to do. They realized the guy was faking and then they were suspicious of me as well. If you killed them, they would regenerate in a chair. If you got them at the start, and pulled off their head that would be the end (they were sort of Cylon like). I stabbed the teacher and they regenerated in a chair at the front of the class and I pulled their head off and eventually they disappeared. A girl at the front of the class said something so I threw a chair at her. They were all left. There was an episode of Red Dwarf and Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was in it. I was reading about the actress and she was born in 1944 and I was telling Mom said she was 50 in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I was shocked."
"2809"	"(2009-05-09 (18)) I can't remember properly, but it was like, the end of the world. We were all packed on trains. They would stop now and then. There were also different trains and they would look for certain people, etc. Anyway, I was with JD (Scrubs). At one stop, we found a room and had sex. It looked like my room and we were in the dark and I was on top. It was weird, because I remember all of it. Later, I found out I was pregnant. Elliot (Scrubs) was also looking for JD because she wanted a baby, but I think when she found out about us, she just went looking for anyone. I think if you were pregnant you either had privileges or didn't have to do something. Sometimes trains would get close and you could jump to a new one. We did and ended up at a cinema. I was then with Calvin and they had this really fast rollercoaster and we got in the back of it and then quickly let go. There was a room with a stage and people were dancing. I was with Elliot now. The president, who was Laura Roslin (Battlestar Galactica) was there. A big ball of smoke came in through a vent at the top of the wall behind the stage. It then spread out we all lied down. Roslin tried to redo the dance, some dancers slipped off etc (because of the smoke). I said to Elliot that she was an idiot and then she was like ""hey, I'm the president!"". She then worked it out and a bunch of us were still lying on the floor. I was listening to my iPod and I took one earphone out to listen to her speak. She said that no-one was listening and I put my hand up and said ""I'm listening!"". We left there and I was then with Dad, Ezra, Poppa and Poppers and we were walking outside. We had to pick up ""Quincy from England"" and Mom from home. I asked ""Are we still in America?"". We found this pub/saloon thing. We went upstairs and there were two muffins. Poppers then wanted some Coke. Dad gave him a warm glass (without any Coke). I was carrying heaps of stuff and got stuck on the stairs and no-one would help."
"2810"	"(2009-05-10 (18)) There was a new season of Scrubs. The Janitor said ""I'm Dr. Matthews"", but he was actually talking to Dr. Matthews. Then he realized who he was talking to. I don't know where we were but had a list of certain personalities he did and when. One of them was an Australian cop and said ""Badge!"" (or at least, it looks like badge, it's hard to read). He also talked about kangaroos. He named his tools and his mop didn't work now? I looked at his family tree and he had a son called Eugene. It had a weird layout and it said he was called ""Eugene 2nd Eugene"". I started fixing it up. Ezra was there too. Mom said it was offensive without having been asked to fix it. Turk (Scrubs) was somewhere."
"2811"	"(2009-05-10 (18)) I had a new timetable for MUPC and I was doing German, French and Home Ec. It was a lame timetable though, and on Wednesday I had class from 8.30am. On Thursday I had class at 7pm. I was going to change my subjects. I showed Mom."
"2812"	"(2009-05-11 (18)) I had two rooms at Mom's, which was different. One was a temporary room with my computer. I woke up and Mom and Darren said someone had broken in last night, but had only taken unimportant stuff. They got extra locks for the back door. We had bush behind us and Abigail lived nearby and we suspected it was her. She came over. Also, this guy on a motorbike was a kid when we met, and we met again, but he was now my age, in the bush."
"2813"	"(2009-05-11 (18)) I was in a shop and running from robots or something. As I ran, I stopped at the aisles to grab stuff, Pokemon cards mainly. I grabbed red packets instead of blue. Ezra was getting them too, but blue ones. We fought off the robots. Then I was having a race with Dee, Mac and Charlie (all from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia). I got lost because I went the long way, so they counted it as a win."
"2814"	"(2009-05-12 (18)) I was at school and had a math test. We had a relief teacher and he was in the seat next to me (the class was different). He had the role with our results and my new mark was 46/56. I put in my calculator and it was 92% and I was thinking it was lame. Some time before, Jeremiah and someone were talking and I said I was top of my math class. Josephine had made something and we had to watch it -- her, Thuy and someone were running through the bush and there were weird angles of Thuy holding a tree. There was a board and people had written their Runescape names and I wrote mine. I think I was level 72. I got invited to a party. People were talking about me. Dad, although he wasn't at first, took me to a nightclub thing because he wanted me to ask people for dreams. I refused and left. I can't remember properly, but I was walking with Dad around mountains. There was music playing and it was an Erasure song. Some lady had a sandwich and said ""I don't know about you, but peanut butter makes everything go away"". The mountains were white and foggy. There was a sign about trout and semen -- to dodge it? Christa Miller was around (or on TV) and I said ""Ugh, she sounds so annoying now"". There were timeline pictures of her. Darren was a werewolf? He had almost killed a girl he hated, but remembered something and left her, but crushed her car."
"2815"	"(2009-05-13 (18)) Mom and Darren bought some stuff for an experiment I needed to do for school. There was other lame stuff ""to pass the time"". I can't remember properly or read my notes well but me and some friends pulled up like four 'beds (which had two [something] each)' or something on the road. Mom was there? There was an ambulance and we needed to go park and so we moved two into the carpark. Then I had socks on and I was with Alejandro and someone else. We had to go somewhere. I walked around wet patches and went to put on my shoes and one had a big nut or acorn in it and I cried out ""Ow. Ow!"". Zach Braff was there. I left with Mom and she was doing a dental course thing and you got points. There was a 'History of Russia' thing and something about Anton Yelchin and I said ""He's Russian right?"". We didn't know any of the questions. Alejandro and I were ahead of the group -- we had to climb up steps and step on the right answer. We were at a high one and we ran out of time. We were asked something and I someone said ""yellow- red"" and someone else (I can't remember if it was me, or someone else) said ""It was yellow or red"". We dropped down the other side; the others would go back around. We ended up in a cafe thing and someone mentioned his 'wife' and said it was actually a lie. Zach Braff then came in, exhausted. Also, I had had a kid but I didn't know when and I wondered why I counted myself as a virgin."
"2816"	"(2009-05-13 (18)) Mom was going for a drive. We were looking for keys and then the front door was locked and she was about to leave. We left and went past dads. I went in, but I fell asleep and Mom called me and said ""I'm waiting for you"". I went out and Ezra was in the front seat. I complained because he was there last time. I went to the mailbox and I heard the door slam open and Dad came out of the house. Ezra's report was in there. There were also chocolates and stuff. I ate a chewy thing and it got stuck to my teeth and really hurt. I was on my computer earlier and I had changed my desktop to a different Scrubs one. I went back on it but it was different. I couldn't find the picture again anywhere. Then I was infected or something and I was locked in the cage and my feet were shackled. I had a toilet and a bed. Then I was someone else and was seeing someone who wasn't really there, but they 'were' and I was helping them. They were an actor, I think, but I can't remember who. There were coffee beans and he dreamt about them? Everything was still and he and I were walking through. I told him to imagine stuff happening -- kids playing with skipping ropes and the like. I then told him to imagine finding what he was looking for. These people had folders and the coffee beans were in it."
"2817"	"(2009-05-15 (18)) Eugene and I had been together for years, or so I thought. He was in bed lying on his back and I got in next to him and put my arm around him. We were talking and laughing. I was at a shop and it was like a huge Big W. I had a trolley and to get in there were these doors that would open and close continuously and I tried to get through it with the trolley, but it kept getting caught. Then I got to the counter and I had to pay to get in. Eugene was around the other side and he didn't have to pay and so he gave me $2 so I could get in. We saw Dad and so ran, laughing, down an aisle to hide and into a freezer. It was big and warehouse like and cold. He went over to the wall to get juice. I thought I heard someone coming and I didn't want to get in trouble so Eugene told me to go. I went through this other door which went into the same section of the shop. I saw a guy who I thought was Dad at the door to the shop and so I ducked. When I looked back up, he saw me and was actually a cop. I could see him motioning for others to get me and they called me the 'juice thief'."
"2818"	"(2009-05-16 (18)) Mom went off to someone's house and Ezra and I were stuck in the car. He decided to have a go driving and was going over the speed limit. He turned corners wide and wouldn't stop in time at lights, which I thought was the 'same thing as me'. He stopped and I said I'd drive now because it was safer. I pulled out of a driveway then turned the car. I was going up the street, fast and wouldn't brake. I turned left and then took the next right, and then I couldn't brake or control the car and it crashed into a house into the lounge room. This lady came out yelling at me. I said the brake didn't work. The window was smashed and there were two kids inside the room. I went inside and she yelled at me still and I yelled ""It's not as if I went out tonight thinking 'Oh, I might go crash into a house',"". Ezra traded lawyer details and ours was on a poster with contact information and his name was Christopher Leeley, or something. There were pictures of him too. We left and the brakes weren't working well and there was a screeching noise. We found Mom and she was with a dude who had milk."
"2819"	"(2009-05-16 (18)) Raquel and I were in a shop. We would walk past people and say stuff. I saw Charlie Day and said ""you're looking hot today"". I went to the toilet and was doing a poo. Classmate-F-04 from math came in and I laughed and said to leave and then I heard a plop from the poo. Anyway, I got covered in poo somehow and Raquel and I went under this shower and she was naked and a bit fat. People were watching but we just kept jumping around and laughing."
"2820"	"(2009-05-16 (18)) I was at a shop looking for posters of The Beatles and Monty Python, etc. I couldn't find any. Ezra and Emery were there too. I did find some Beatles bags but they were lame. Mom was also there. Ezra said that Dad had put all the Pokemon clothes together. He had a cool one. Only one of the rest sort of fit, but it was too tight and was green with a Pikachu on it. We were then at a house. Nana was there. She asked if I wanted something and I said that I didn't know what it was and she took out ice-cream tubs (like in the shops). There was pink and blue stuff and then white as well. She reached her hand into it and handed me some of the blue (it was light blue). I took some off with my finger and ate it and it was nice. Then there was green, which was nicer. She gave me an icypole thing but it was attached to seven others and they had to be eaten in order and the green one was third. Nana said to not eat more than one. I went to Ezra and Emery and they took the first two. A young James Spader was in a room. Dad and I were outside and had to climb up this big vertical net thing. When we got to the top we didn't know how to get over. I went through a hole and then Dad did. I don't know what happened then. Dad had a site and the address had INXS [something] and then a slash. I couldn't remember it and Dad was annoyed. My site had a background of space and stars and I had dreams on it. They were in a firey colour and it was hard to read. Dad complained about it. I said I was going to go to a list of dream characters and he was nervous about it. The page wasn't there though and he said he didn't want to see 'boys' there."
"2821"	"(2009-05-17 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were in the car on the way to university. The car was fire truck like. They made sandwiches and I didn't know where mine was. It was outside, on the windscreen, but I couldn't reach it. Then it was Dad instead of Mom. There was also a muffin with 50g of fat in it, but I ate it anyway. It started pouring down. The front of the university had big glass weird angled things and the rain would just slide off. They dropped me off somewhere and I got lost. I wandered into an arcade and my teacher was there. Then there was a lockdown.  I was also with a guy from class and he was quite hot. It was then a game and we had to shoot something out of a hole. There was a boat and you had to get two rocks onto it and it would take you back. I decided to leave. It was now like a big shop. There were lots of something I can't read (looks like straps). The hot guy, someone else and I were in a room. The hot guy started singing and I joined in. I then realized it was 'What's Going On' and since I hate it, I stopped, wondering how I even knew the words. The song had a mention of Morgan Freeman. There was a change room with toilets. Every cubicle was open and scattered with clothes. There was someone in one. There was a girl smoking and being rude. I left and she followed me. I went back to the room with the hot guy and I saw the girl still around so I locked the doors. She banged on it and wanted to get in. I needed to put my bra on and some pants as they had my SmartRider in them. I couldn't find them. I was now with a girl friend. I told her to make sure the webcams were turned off. I got changed and then I was some hated girl in a TV show. My friend used to be a main character that did drugs and alcohol and had problems with anorexia etc. She came back once before and helped someone. She had light blue hair. Anyway, she planned a way for me to leave. She got a heap of people to run out in different directions and so people would follow and allow me to walk from the school to the train station. Daryl was one of them. I got to a path leading up a hill and Turk and Carla (both from Scrubs) were digging up dead bodies. A girl said ""say thank you"" and the person she was talking to said ""thanks baby"". I went to a restaurant thing and I decided to get a job application. Then the 'bad' girl saw me. I ran and ended up on a beach. The girl friend came and grabbed her hands. I ran up a wood thing. I can't read what happened, but she did something to her and threw her shouting, but she was dead. Also before, some girl did websites and a girl was upset because she stopped doing them?"
"2822"	"(2009-05-17 (18)) This guy had a dream book that started in the 1930's, though he wasn't that old. A bird was in the book and had stayed in a nest in there for a long time. Darren took it out and then I realized and he put it back in. It then got out on its own and I told the guy. He came to look and it was gone. We then found it out the back of home. It was now a kitten and it fell in the pool. I dropped my iPod and jumped in. At The End had been playing, but now it was loud. I grabbed the kitten and tried to bring it to the surface, but I fell forward and so did the kitten. Then there was another kitten so I grabbed that one too and put them both on the ground. I realized my iPod speakers were in the water and was making a fizzle noise. I told Mom we needed to get new ones. We went to the shop with $50. We got two eggs for something (it was medicine). They had the old dream books I used to use, so I got seven of them."
"2823"	"(2009-05-18 (18)) Ezra and Mom were going to be checking out a Technical College thing. Mom had to go look after a shop and juggle lots of different tasks. I was talking to Ezra and asked what he was watching. He was watching The Fugitive and I said, excitedly, ""Transit cop! Neil Flynn- I mean Janitor! Yay!"" and left. I was saying Janitor like JD does as I walked out. I went to Mom to remind her about the Technical College thing and she yelled at me, but then left. I was watching Scrubs and JD and Kim were in bed and she was pregnant and cuddling JD from behind."
"2824"	"(2009-05-18 (18)) I woke up and saw a gate out the back was open (the house was different). Darren had three dogs and I didn't know what their names were. I had to put a chain on one of them. Later I asked Mom what their names were, they were Sam, Samson and Smith, and the first and last were girls. I was friends with a lesbian. For some reason we were lying in bed and she was naked. I can't really remember what was going on, but she was rubbing herself against me and I was kissing her bum/back area and bit in. Mom came in. She started calling me a lesbian and I shouted ""I'm not a lesbian!""."
"2825"	"(2009-05-18 (18)) I was at a new 'president's' like, welcoming ceremony. I was holding on to a flying fox thing and I think I was making a speech. I went to get some food and there were no plates left. Mom and Granma were there and she was going to get me a plate but then changed her mind. I went to get a plate, but then saw someone else's one that was clean-ish and got a piece of chicken. Someone said to smell it and it was a weird colour. It tasted funny."
"2826"	"(2009-05-19 (18)) I was watching Arrested Development. There was something called, what looks like, 'railpots'. Someone asked ""What are they anyway? They're never around when you need them?"". And something that looks like 'boat in the water, out of the water'. There was laughing. I was talking to George Bluth and he didn't know what railpot was. Eugene had sold the rights to Mr Banana Grabber and Gob was selling them again and it was in boxes of stuff. Eugene was telling him that he couldn't. There were two Asians and Eugene said he wanted food as a trade. I remember Tobias was around as well."
"2827"	"(2009-05-19 (18)) It was Battlestar Galactica like. There was a ship and it wouldn't let me on -- it had to get to know you first and it wanted me to have experienced something 'horrible'. I was made to do labour work. I was on platforms that were floating on a liquid. I had to pull up rocks from the liquid. I fell in and I saw something scary and got out. Raquel was in a kids section. Robert Downey Jr. was there and we were friendly and we were all talking to Mom and Dad. He was talking about an ex of his and he said that she said, putting on a French accent, ""If you love music, then I hate music!"". Ezra was around somewhere too and he was pulling down people's pants. Later, Ezra and I were doing stuff to get citizens on MyCity."
"2828"	"(2009-05-19 (18)) Ezra and I drove off from Mom. We went to the shop and Ezra wouldn't let me drive. Later, I was somewhere in Brookland. I went to a bus stop and waited. I saw this Native lady, who I recognized, and she told me to go to the other side, which I was going to anyway. She said to say hello to Mom and I asked her what her name was and she said 'Ateena'. The map on the bus stop was hard to understand. The bus came and I asked the driver ""Miss?"", but it was a guy and I asked if the bus went to Princess Rd and he said it did. We drove around the other side of this rollercoaster, which was abandoned, and then went down all these random side streets. I was confused so I got off at a weird place. I text Mom to get me. George Bluth (Arrested Development) was on a walk and I said ""what about Lucille?"" but she was there too. I had no shoes and so I couldn't walk back home."
"2829"	"(2009-05-20 (18)) I was watching Arrested Development. Tobias was talking to George Eugene about girl/boyfriends."
"2830"	"(2009-05-20 (18)) People were complaining about Michael Cera being in the Arrested Development movie because he wasn't going to do it originally."
"2831"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) Dad whispered something and he had a secret about something. Mom was going to admit that she knew. I was at a shop, which was in Northtown but the layout was screwed up. Mom, Ezra and I went to the pet shop. There were lots of kittens. We had to walk around a long way to get back. We were going to get food."
"2832"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) I had Sims 3 and was playing it."
"2833"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) I was at work. Someone found a head in a pipe. I cleaned out the pipe one day and found two more. I hit an emergency button but not 'worry'. Later, I went to check if I had calls in the office. I said to Ezra that I found two heads and he said he'd call back. There was a guy called Roy Wyatt. Gob (Arrested Development) was on a motorbike and I said ""you should wear thicker pants"". He laughed and then he took off altogether? I picked him up, and I can't read the rest of what I said. Then I went inside."
"2834"	"(2009-05-21 (18)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. I saw a Ute with rubbish on the back and Tobias (Arrested Development) was on it. I said ""I'm Ms Featherbottom, would you like a banger in the mouth? Oh, I meant sausages!"" and laughed. We were then at a shop and I was with Dad. I had a puzzle book. My teeth were hurting and started falling out. We left and were in a red convertible. I looked behind us to check if anyone was following us. Then, Jeremy Northam and this guy were talking at the shop. It was a movie and it showed Jeremy going to war and they would meet after he got back each time and they would chat on a bench. The last time they met, they had aged quite a bit. One day, Jeremy didn't return. But, then the guy saw him and a girl, explaining that he faked his death because people were after him. They got a mission and they had to pick up some stuff from a letterbox. I was with them. We pulled up on the other side of the road from the place (it was night). It was like an apartment block. Jeremy went out to the letterbox out the front of. A light went out in a top apartment. He opened the letterbox to check it and then someone shot at him. He ran back to the car. We drove off and pulled into a lady's house, who was a doctor. As they walked up to the house, I was watching a movie again and it was called 1, 2, 3 Life. I said ""I always thought it was Fight Club"". Brad Pitt was in it. We got inside and turned off the lights. We heard a car driving fast past the house. Jeremy had been shot and the doctor went with him to help him. The rest of us hung out in the dining room (which was part of the room where you first enter the house). The lights outside could be change from switches inside and would change the patterns of the lights. I stupidly played with it. I heard a car drive past and quickly turned them off. It came back past and then screeched to a stop. We all went quiet and listened. We heard people get out and I ran to the back of the house to warn the lady. The blinds on the windows were mostly open and so we were all hiding under them and next to stuff. I kept moving. Two of the guys, including the guy from before, were hiding behind the table in the dining room. I joined them, but then I ran back and I saw the bathroom and that it had no windows. The bath was like a bunk bed and took up all of the room. There were blankets and stuff in it; I figured that must've been where the lady had been keeping Jeremy. Then the bad guys were coming through the windows. I ran into a room, where a guy was coming through the window backwards. I grabbed him and from behind, put my arm around his throat until he went limp, then I got a knife out of my pocket (or wherever I was keeping it) and stabbed him in the chest. I took his gun. Two guys were coming down the hall and I pointed the guy's gun at them, then the people said ""now"" and the rest started coming in through the windows. I shut the door of the room, which was a sliding door, and hoped they would go for the others. I opened it and they were still there. I couldn't reload the gun so I ran into them and one shot the other one accidentally. I got the knife and was stabbing his hand and I shook the other one off to get his gun."
"2835"	"(2009-05-22 (18)) Harlan had asked for help on something, but he hadn't left a 'comment' and I was unable to reply. I caught up with him and told him what he needed to know. I was at a place with computers. First, there was a competition for Sims 3 and people were running up to win a race for it. A team with the fat person won. Anyway, Ezra was on a computer playing a game. Classmate-M-06 was there drawing on people's [something I can't read] . There were people from last year and Ezra mentioned Eugene. He was the top player of the game. I was telling Mom about it later. I had a candle in a bag? It was like a cigarette? It was slowly burning away until it was just [something I can't read] . There were kittens outside and Mom and I brought them inside because it was raining."
"2836"	"(2009-05-22 (18)) I was getting in the car and two people we didn't like were there. The Winchesters (Supernatural) had a little sister. I didn't like her. She was with us, in the backseat between Ezra and I. Dad was driving and Dean (Supernatural) was in the passenger seat. Up ahead, at the lights, there were people washing car windows. There was a scantily clad woman with big boobs. Dean and Dad both commented, Dean said ""She has a nice... pencil"". She came to the window and she and Dad flirted. She said that not many good-looking, funny, single guys around. There was a pause and then Dad asked for her number and she gave it to him. Then we were at Nana's. She was there. The inside was different. There was a warehouse and they had copies of my chair there, but they went back more and were recliners. Poppa was in there. I left the warehouse and it was near where the water tank was, at the top of the path next to the fish pond. There was a duck on the bridge. It followed my movements, so I ran, screaming, up and closed the gate. Nana got it and I ran inside."
"2837"	"(2009-05-23 (18)) I was in a car with Nana and Poppa. They were going to drop me off at Mom's, but it was confusing to get there and they kept missing the turn. We stopped the car and were going to walk. I crossed the road, but then decided they needed to drive a bit closer. But, as I walked I bumped into Mom."
"2838"	"(2009-05-23 (18)) My boyfriend, who was Eugene, suggested I finish school early so I could go to the movies with him, but to not tell Mom about it. I agreed. I was then with Farrah. We found a shop so we went in. There was a Timezone, which was packed. There was a Science Museum like place. There was a dark room, and there was a corner where you would fall over. At the door you got shot out by a burst of air. I was with Eugene now too. We waited outside another building, and then there was gas. This guy opened the building which was a big room full of single desks which had paper and pens on each. The instructor said to draw your last dream or a pedophile. He said we would have to present it in front of the class. He handed out paper and mine had my name on it and I wondered how he knew it was me. Then Farrah didn't know how to do something on Microsoft Excel (we were now on computers). She wanted to superscript a single word inside a cell."
"2839"	"(2009-05-24 (18)) Mom was watching a movie and I went out and it was Beetlejuice. It was in French and so I changed the language for her. Later, Ezra said her phone kept ringing and it was loud. He was with a baby, as in, he had to sleep in the same room as it. On the TV, it said 'Will Arnett' and there was an Arrested Development advertisement, which he, Portia de Rossi and Michael Cera were in. Will Arnett and Michael Cera were supposed to be more like 'father and son' in the movie (or whatever). We went for a drive. Ezra got a call from Roland, who said he was at a rave or something and he went to the toilet and was 'pooping' and thought of Ezra. There were two cars in front of us, the drivers of which were obviously drunk. There was a set of lights up the road. One of the cars slid out and went into a ditch. Then there was a bridge near us and the other one went over the edge. We stared in shock and it was slow motion and then a crash and it flipped and was totally owned. I was happy about seeing this because it was exciting. Then the cops were there and I was thinking of what I rate it. Mom asked ""what should we rate it?"" and I was thinking a 4/5 because of the bridge."
"2840"	"(2009-05-24 (18)) I did a third course at the MUPC called House. It was run by House (House) and there weren't many people in the class. He told us what was in the exam, but didn't know when the exam was. He told us what books to study so I thought about going to the library to get them. Emma Watson was in the class and had taken a file thinking it would be helpful. They were building plans. His journal was on the desk. There were weird jokes written in it. He thought it was Calvin who had taken the file, but someone had noted that it was Emma. There was a note about me and my dream book, but he didn't know what it was. There was a photo of me when I was younger. There was another photo of Ezra and Ariana on a cow print chair. I was telling Mom about it later."
"2841"	"(2009-05-25 (18)) I was at a shop, or a shop-like place. Laura Roslin (Battlestar Galactica) was there and she was the president. I was friends with her. I was paranoid about some work of mine, for Communications, and went to ask her if she could copy it and put a presidential stamp on it so it was known that it was mine, but she said she couldn't."
"2842"	"(2009-05-25 (18)) The Sims 3 teasers were offline at the moment. There was a game that Ezra and I played where you play tennis in a jail-like setting. It always reminded me of Bellick (Prison Break). I was at home and I needed to change my shirt but had nothing that fit (it was all my old clothes). Someone in the family was over with a kid and someone was pregnant. Mom said that her pregnancy test was negative."
"2843"	"(2009-05-26 (18)) I was at Mom's and my room was a bit different. I had my computer and this other thing positioned around my bed so the light was away from it when I slept. Dad and Ezra were there. I emptied all these little bits for a puzzle thing onto the floor. Ezra was on my computer and started watching Gossip Girl. I glanced over to see Chuck. I decided I didn't want to watch it and needed to go to bed because of an exam I had in the morning. Dad ordered a pizza. I can't read what it says next, but it looks like 'squeaky times', then ""sorry""."
"2844"	"(2009-05-27 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was walking home past Midvale shops (like through the carpark and down the road behind the church). There was a girl with short, curly hair who was often there. She followed me, which creeped me out, so I called Mom to get me, she agreed to reluctantly. She took me to a party and the girl was there. She wanted to talk to me and I ran. It says something about a theft play and something. We got out and took her in with others? Calvin was with her. There was a theatre. Ezra was there. There was a video of Yuckfou, supposedly, giving a speech. The videos were all [something I can't read] and stuff to make. Something was level 88 on Runescape."
"2845"	"(2009-05-27 (18)) I was watching Prison Break. Bellick and someone -- a prisoner guy who no-one liked -- did a poo and then it was implied that they put something up his bum. It was Battlestar Galactica like."
"2846"	"(2009-05-27 (18)) Nathaniel was in my room, which was different. He was acting shy-like. I asked him what was going on, but I don't know what he said. I can't remember what else happened."
"2847"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) I had a hotel room. I went to it. There was an elevator (that was four sided). It was hard to get one though. There was a place on the stairs if you wanted to complain. Dan Aykroyd came with a bald head. We were told that if we saw famous people, to not go up to them saying ""I loved you in..."" Then I was on a lounge with some people I knew and a teacher. This guy started singing a song which was from Scrubs, and it was perfect for the situation we were in. The teacher also reminded me of Perry (Scrubs) and I was laughing. He asked ""what's that from?"" and I answered ""Scrubs"". Someone said that everyone was excited? Also, some time before I was watching Battlestar Galactica and Lee and Gaius were talking."
"2848"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) I was in a carpark. I needed to pee. This lady was there. I saw a little kitten and I grabbed it and put it in the car, which I went into to pee. I was going to bring the kitten into the pet shop, but it ran out of the car. Fido was running around. I chased the kitten and Fido was too. I tried to stop Fido and he ran into the shop and before I could do anything, he ate it in one bite. I was like 'noo!' and shocked and upset. I went to the toilet, which had dodgy doors. I did a poo and I heard it hit the water. I got up and the toilet wouldn't flush."
"2849"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) I was on another planet, and I assumed it was a Cylon planet. It was abandoned looking and I was there with some others. There was a building that was falling apart. There was a weird language written on the walls. I went over to this park bench. Helo and Athena (both Battlestar Galactica) were there. I liked Helo. Athena had these bits of tree and was folding them in half and then using this thing to cut in the middle of them. She stopped as she and Helo were mucking around. They went off to have sex, so I took over. I looked over to where they went and they were lying naked with a blanket on the grass."
"2850"	"(2009-05-28 (18)) Ezra mentioned liking 'Lloyd'. I said ""which Lloyd?"" and he said from Entourage. I was like 'I didn't know you watched Entourage'."
"2851"	"(2009-05-29 (18)) I was reading about the Arrested Development movie. Michael Cera had said he wasn't going to do it, presumably because he thought he could do better. I was like ""how can you do better than Arrested Development? It's the third best show ever... and that's pushing it"" (as in, the top 3 are all so good, it's hard to make them lower than the other). There weren't any comments from David Cross at all. There was a character called Gaius. I was talking to this guy (I was me, but different) because I wanted to get into some film group. He mentioned something and I said that ""I'm not wanting to sound like Battlestar Galactica"" but he refused. Someone said something and shot all others (it's hard to read). There was a list of high rated TV shows and Felicity was on there with a picture of Keri Russell. The show worked like, she would write in her diary and there was a voiceover and that was pretty much it."
"2852"	"(2009-05-29 (18)) I realized that it was the 8 June and so I was going to get The Sims 3. I was on the computer and on some site which had Eugene's profile on it. It said he liked The Sims 3 (I had been on here before, and it used to say Sims 2). Mom was babysitting Amelia. There was a pub and another shop next to each other. I had somehow transferred a problem to the pub and something in there started hissing and someone tricked a bum (can't read it properly). Also, someone asked me to get something out of their car and I asked if their car was the ""fat brown thing?"". But then I was supposed to go to the daycare because their son had it. I went over and was getting the thing they wanted out of the son's pants. His name was Devon. I was then outside a shop and I was thinking it was Midvale shops. A lady got off a motorbike and had a gun. I pretended not to notice and walked to the street. I walked across with some other people. Nicolas was in the crowd and saw me and started running, saying to get away from him. I ran after him and called out ""Oi! Nicolas!"". I looked behind me and I saw someone on the bike coming after me. I went down a path which was on a hill, and then there was a loop. I tried to call Mom but I couldn't, so I text her instead. Then I was lying on my stomach, pulling myself along these pipes and it was a tight fit between them. There were lots of others behind me and they complained about me going slow. When I got to the end, there were copies of Sims 3 on USB's (there were four of them). They were a weird shape. I checked one of them, but it wasn't on it. The second one had Sims 3 and the first season of Angel. I used my iPod to transfer them over."
"2853"	"(2009-05-30 (18)) I went into the bathroom at home. I had had a bath earlier and there was still water in it. My gloves were on the edge. One fell in and I got it out and was wringing it, but the water never seemed to stop coming out of it. I was going to Bali alone. Nana and Poppa suggested a hotel for me. It was cheap and just across the road from the airport, but was supposed to be really good."
"2854"	"(2009-05-31 (18)) There were heaps of seasons of Battlestar Galactica. Roslin found out she was a Cylon (one of the final five). They took her down to a planet, on a train without telling her. She was upset. Ezra was watching an episode and there was a black guy on the outside of something that I can't read (it looks like it starts with an 's'). I asked ""Is that Sam Anders?"" and then it had a picture of him. He had a ball with shapes on it and it was gold and was like a quidditch ball (the little flying thingy). Also, I had done something with some people. We were in a building and there was a TV and Eugene was there. He was listening to AC/DC and watching nature documentaries and I said ""you're like my Mom"". Calvin was there too. It looks like it says 'at the end', but it says there was a photo of us and a cutout and Eugene wasn't in it. I was watching 24. Jack and Aaron were climbing up a hill and they needed to warn people about something."
"2855"	"(2009-06-01 (18)) There was a sports thing on. I flew to America and back, but for some reason the ticket made me go back to America. The airport was different. The people at the counter were in water. I asked for the flight home. Mom and Ezra were there and it was now a sports thing for Ezra. There was an assembly thing, but I decided it would be packed and boring and so Mom and I left. Ezra was made to stay. Then I was by myself and I had 'made' stuff, like a ship and something else and a bathroom, but I hadn't set anything, for it to function or whatever. I was then in water, which was inside a building, and it was sometimes a computer game. Then Mom was with me. It was really dark because I hadn't made it properly. I kept going under and it was like neverending so I had trouble getting back up. At some point I was on a computer playing Runescape. Eugene was on the computer next to me (which was facing me) and I stared at him for a bit, thinking he was hot and then went back to my game. We both started humming the same song. Gaius (Battlestar Galactica) had something to do with my game. Tyrol (Battlestar Galactica) said he was ""born as a different renegade in 1909 in their [something I can't read, it looks like 'right [or night] train much' city, Oogle""."
"2856"	"(2009-06-02 (18)) It was raining, or at least was cold. I was going to university and Mom was driving me. I got in the car, then it was raining. I decided I didn't want to go when we got there, but I went in. I got to the line for class and decided not to go in and this guy said to count me in with the dead, which was a term used for those who just decided not to go. I saw Ms Ingram in the class. She saw me and pulled me aside. There was a huge book of notes and it had notes for every subject and also the exam results. I waited outside in the carpark and Mom and Ezra were across the road at a deli. They picked me up. I got 61% for communications and for math it said ""11-12"", which was a bad rating. My rank was 195/250."
"2857"	"(2009-06-02 (18)) David and Keith (both Six Feet Under) rented a motel because he got one of ""the last ten tickets"" to a show. The motel was stingy. Then it was Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and a girl he liked. It also changed to Laura Roslin and Bill Adama (Battlestar Galactica). But then she was actually someone else and everyone had had their memories wiped. She was no longer interested in him. Then it was Eugene and I. The room had a little TV in it and there was a video player on the other side of the room (the door was in the middle of the room, the bed was on the left side, TV in front of it on the right and the video player straight ahead). I was unplugging the video player because there was a red light on it, which would annoy me and was closing the window. We got in bed and he turned off the TV. It was a double bed, but it was more like a single and we had to snuggle up. I think other people were then in the other rooms, Calvin was one of them. Eugene and I were having sex and Ezra came in, but we didn't realize at first."
"2858"	"(2009-06-03 (18)) There was a new quest on Runescape and I needed to have watched Quarantine and I was annoyed because I didn't want to watch a remake. I was making pots (?) while I was there and my inventory was full. Ruth (Six Feet Under) asked me for help with something."
"2859"	"(2009-06-03 (18)) I was talking to Ezra about the new quest on Runescape. He commented on there being so many more people. He said he found stuff of Emery's and said ""yay FRIEND"". Since we saw Star Trek, he had been calling me ""Sulu"", who had been played by Simon Pegg. I said ""it might be funny if I was a guy and bared some resemblance, but I don't look like Simon Pegg"". Ezra made a 'uh heh' noise and said ""yeah you do"". I insisted I didn't and ""it's more of a compliment than an insult"" and he was like ""Oh you think Simon Pegg's hot then"" and I said ""no but he is more attractive than ugly"". Ezra said he couldn't stand him and I said ""I love Simon Pegg; he's one of my favourite comedians"". We had fish and chips and I grabbed a heap and asked if he was using the tomato sauce, which he wasn't, and went to eat at the table."
"2860"	"(2009-06-03 (18)) I was watching Angels and Demons [I haven't seen it yet] . It was an early cam, but it was a good copy. It started off with teenagers (sometimes the movie was real). One of the guys liked this girl (who was me sometimes) and I liked him too. We were at a shop and Silas and Ezra were there and put beanies on their heads. I can't remember what the joke was. Anyway, we were in a car and some trees were on fire? Then it was a movie again. The Chief from Grey's Anatomy was the president. There was a flashback which showed a group getting ready. At first, it looked like they were bad guys, except for me and they tied me up. There was a really cute puppy. Then I was in water and they saved me and then a light went on and the 'cops' were all around me (in a circle) and fired their guns. Then there was a flashback and we were in a house or something. I was with my guy friend from before and a girl. It looks like it says [mag had he after] , but I don't know what it's supposed to say. Anyway, he was wearing a jumper that was an expensive brand. I was wearing the jumper Mom made me. There was a fire and the guy was joking and grabbed me saying ""hold me!"". We were then at a place where the bad guys were. He tried to pretend he was one of them, but they were suspicious. Then in real life, I told Mom what I was watching and that it was funny. Ezra was there. She was watching The Da Vinci Code and I said that the first one sucked and I wondered where Tom Hanks came into the second one. There was a video that Jayson made, although he was Silas sometimes. It was a funny version of what happened with me and the bad guys."
"2861"	"(2009-06-04 (18)) I was at a pet shop. There was an open area with little dogs and it had flaps. Later I was at school or something. There was a room with a bed and a bedside table and my dreams were on it. Preston was there and he read one and so I moved them. Seamus was on a computer playing Runescape. He had pretty good levels. I left and went on another computer and talked to him on Runescape. Ezra was on too. I got distracted and logged off. Seamus asked me to lunch and so I went. As I went to leave he called it a date and I said that ""it wasn't a date, it was food"". He insisted it was a date and asked me to meet him in the cafe again. I walked off. Later I left class. There was an upstairs section -- which was where the cafe was. But from where I came from, I had to walk a fair way to the stairs. I could climb this frame and go through a hole, which I had done before. I tried now, but I couldn't do it. There were stairs on it, but on the roof of it, upside down. I went the long way and past the cafe to see if he was there. He wasn't. Then I heard him call to me and called me over. I shook my head and walked away. Then there were demons, but they were nice. One said that someone was in the ""rear view mirror"" -- it was Seamus, disguised. I was then in a cinema and something was playing and it said ""Harpo"" and I said ""Marx! Please be Duck Soup!"" But it was something I hadn't heard of. I went through a door in a hall and a girl came out of the toilets that had the male symbol on the door. A bunch of girls saw and laughed. I went further down the hall and I was back at the pet shop. There were some people there and they were turning back and forth between humans and dogs. They went a bit crazy with light (or it could be night, but I think it's light). One of them was Boomer (Battlestar Galactica). Her boyfriend had been in the car with her when she changed and she had grabbed his hair and ripped off his skin. Seamus was also one of them and Rico (Six Feet Under). He was sometimes Seamus. I was trying to help them. I went outside and got in the car with Mom and Ezra. They were coming towards the shop still and I told them to stop. I got out and went over to ""see my least favourite person"", who was Seamus, and he was standing outside the shop."
"2862"	"(2009-06-05 (18)) I was outside. There was a game thing. Ezra was there and you had to jump from these high poles, which had a flat round thing on top. They would get further and further apart. Then it was Calvin and he was with a girl. I ran to swing off a rope thing to get on and Calvin grabbed onto us and I said 'you want [something that looks like last] ' but he did and we fell straight away. I said it took 'ten years and some amount of months off' and he said '140 weeks'. I was then on a bus thing with Nana. She asked the girl in front of me to put her chair back and it hit my leg. I was playing Pokemon on my DS."
"2863"	"(2009-06-05 (18)) I can't remember properly but there was a machine in the walls of this place. Someone had to unplug this thing and plug in something else. There was a robot thing and he had to avoid people who worked there. He was at the last one and he (it was me now) got Cuddles to distract the robot and he threw this thing to make her go to it. It was in a hall. Then I was at this place and this lady had a house which was up high. I was on it and there was a section with an edge. There was a fridge and the house moved, and as I was trying to get around the fridge was moving too and I said ""ah! This is too hard!"". Dad came back to get me -- he had taken Ezra earlier. We went to a place with a rollercoaster and I thought it was a ghost train at first. The max weight was 50kg, and said 39-50. A lady explained why."
"2864"	"(2009-06-06 (18)) I got my results back from the MUPC. My mark for communications was 60% and I had gotten the top math score, which was 98% or so. Classmate-M-11 was second. I went through the marks and they had crossed a right one and I couldn't work out the real percentage. Nana was there."
"2865"	"(2009-06-06 (18)) I was watching Battlestar Galactica. The ship was different and was actually like a planet, where the main action happened in this building and there was an outside area with a pool. Gizmo was there and I was trying to get food and water organized for her but the room I was in was on a slope. I saw an explosion in the distance and got down. The window smashed, along with other things. Starbuck and a guy went into this room to have sex and Adama walked in on them. I went looking for Roslin. She was on a balcony outside; oblivious to what happened (it had affected the whole ship). I opened the door and she asked what happened. There were gates, like for the SmartRider, but they were all closed. I remembered another way to go. The bad guys came and were going to shoot us, but there was another explosion and we got away. I would see fire in the sky and we would duck down. I said to stay away from the windows. I saw another and said ""get away from the windows!"" and ran around a corner to get away. There was a loud explosion and I looked around the corner and called ""Laura!"". Her arm was a bit burnt. In the control room, Adama and Starbuck were talking. When the camera was on Starbuck, her nose was sometimes painted red and with lipstick to match. They were joking about Adama walking in on her. There was a flashback of these two Asian nerds in a small ship in space. They saw a fireball and they were like 'what's that, what should we do' etc. They flew off and said to warn Gaeta. They also had this virtual game, which had a sex option. In real life, we got the game, which was really cool and there was a virtual world option, but it said it had to be registered to use it and we had an illegal copy. But I then found these squishy packets that had different virtual things to play, ie one of them had 'give guy a massage' and one had 'cute boy helps you'. There were pictures of Freddy Krueger (Nightmare on Elm Street) in the Foxtel guide."
"2866"	"(2009-06-07 (18)) There was a Kenny vs. Spenny movie. First, Spenny and I went for a walk and we went down the street next to North Midvale Primary School. It was night and dark and spooky. He was with his kid (or someone else's). I said it was dangerous and he said he had a 'scythe'. This black guy walked past us and I could only see his clothes because of the contrasting darkness. Then, Kenny, someone else and I were running away from Spenny, or all of us were running away from someone. We ran into a toilet. The three of us went into a room with the toilets and closed the door. I tried to lock it and it was a switch lock (like on the front door), but I couldn't get it in time and he burst in. They were yelling and then Spenny reached into his pocket and this guy fired his gun and killed him. The guy said ""he was reaching for a gun"". Kenny checked Spenny's pockets and there was a pack of chewing gum. He said ""a tic-tac? You shot him because of a tic-tac?!"" Kenny was like 'he's my best friend!'. Then there was a second one (like that was the first way the scene was shot), which was what had actually happened. There were teenagers talking in a room. One said ""that was how we were originally going to shoot it"" or they were going to bring in a twin of Spenny to keep in, but it wouldn't have worked."
"2867"	"(2009-06-07 (18)) I woke up to people talking and Amelia crying. I tried to get back to sleep for an hour with no luck. I got up and closed the hallway door and yelled at them to shut up. This girl was there and was Quincy's girlfriend. Darren was there. I managed to get to sleep, but I woke up again from a movie. Samantha posted a comment on Facebook about how there was a bridge which had her name on it. I checked the time and it was 3am when I went to bed. Everyone was asleep, but later on Ezra was out there. On Battlestar Galactica, Helo's last name was Penikett. Boomer was in the episode too. This girl got pregnant but the guy was pregnant and they shot him because he wasn't human. I needed to do five things but I couldn't work out the fifth (I was a medical person). I pretended it was done. I said to a girl that Helo's name was actually Penikett."
"2868"	"(2009-06-08 (18)) I was at a house and I had a different family. I had three brothers called Tom, Aaron and David. I went to ask my 'mother' for something and this guy was naked in her room, so I kept walking. I went to hide and went in Tom's bed. He was naked and threw the blanket over him. His bed was next to a balcony (an inside balcony). Because of this, we would often see a naked girl up there as he would bring random ones over. I asked why he didn't have anyone over this time and he said it was in order to hide me (because if there was a girl there, no-one would think to look for me... that doesn't seem to make sense now). Later, someone misunderstood what happened and broke up with him. I tried to explain it. Then I was playing a game where I had to catch the bus and trains at certain times to level up. Later, a few of us were in a classroom. The teacher asked for a volunteer, and I knew it was going to be me and I hated doing it. The girl next to me volunteered but he made me do it. I had to make 3 (the number was a random number between 1-4) sandwiches. Dmitri was in the class and finished his sandwiches. The teacher told me to get them finished by the end of this week -- it was Thursday. I decided to leave. I went to text Mom, but at lunch, the teacher was in the room and I couldn't. There was another teacher and they were playing Runescape. He was riding a bike and it was slow because his agility level was only 21. I said that I'd been playing for five years."
"2869"	"(2009-06-08 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were in the car and had to pull up on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and it was night. There was a car in front of us. Then there was another car crossing the road. I saw the licence plate was 8ZE-963 and I realized it was Eugene's car. It turned out his father Abraham was in it and his name was like Meluson and he was dead? I'm not sure what happened but we were then walking. I had no shoes, only those socks I have with the little doopy things underneath. It was day and the ground was hot. Then we were using rollerblades and were going really fast down the road. We went into a shop and were getting chocolates. I got a Lite Mars Bar. I heard two people talking about a robbery, and I realized they thought we were going to steal. Ezra said ""figures"", referencing the fact that we weren't dressed in expensive clothes in this posh area. We went to the checkout and left. There was a cat outside that kept hissing at everyone. There was a girl and two days after her birthday something had happened. The lid on my water bottle was gross and I was going to take a lid off of someone else's that was on a table outside, but I then realized that was disgusting. There was a forest across the road. Police and other people were scattered around. There were a lot of cop cars. I went over and then they all came back to one place. Then some others and I were running through it and everyone chased us. I climbed up a tree and the people walked past looking for us. I got down and started running again. Then Eugene was with us and he was my boyfriend, I think. He told me to keep running one way, across the road, and then there was more forest which was thicker. I kept running and I got separated from him. After running through some forest on the other side, there was a field and then there was a hill a while away with some woody forest path. Then there was a UFO and it got too close and caught on the power lines and crashed into the ground. I yelled at everyone to run back and it exploded. Then it was like a Government tape I was watching and had end of Cloverfield like writing on it. I turned it off. Then it was a movie and for the sequel they wanted me to return, though I was supposed to have died. Eugene had survived and was upset about me having died. In the first movie, at the beginning there was a jetty with boats in the water. I can't read the next bit [something about countries] , but it then says that the land wasn't ok to live on. There weren't many in the first one but in the sequel there were more of them. There was a female president, or at least, I assumed she was the president."
"2870"	"(2009-06-08 (18)) I was with Calvin, Silas, Elijah and Theodore somewhere. We had been chased through a forest along with heaps of others. We got to some shops and exchanged $10 for a ""$5 note and coins"". Calls were $8.70 but I didn't have enough money and I had no credit. We went to a bus stop and waited. The sign was on the ground. I asked if it went to Midvale and Silas said it did. I said I didn't know how to catch a bus and he laughed at me and I said that I could take the train and bus to university but I didn't know how to take it anywhere else. We saw the bus coming. I got my wallet out and the front of my SmartRider had come off (it was just blank and white). I thought that was odd, but it still worked. Calvin went to the back of the bus and it was a big bus. I went with him. Everyone else sat in random places. Sawyer (Lost) was on a chair that had wheels next to the row of seats in front of us. He kept slipping and had to hold on. I accidentally nudged his foot. There was some silence and I was trying not to laugh."
"2871"	"(2009-06-09 (18)) I was at Nana's. I can't remember properly but there were girl and they would ask us questions in different ways. This girl asked me if I had drawing equipment and beans. I said ""Beans? What do I need beans for?"". I can't read the next few sentences, it seems like she asked me if I needed something that sort of looks like 'coins' and I said something that looks like ""said I inks"" and something about movies. We then chatted. Nana asked if I wanted to see how much weight she had lost and said she was ""late"", which had something to do with weight. I was then on a bus and I got off at a house I thought was Nana's, the bus started to leave and I realized it wasn't. I ran to catch up with it and I managed to get him to stop. I told the guy and then said that I left my bag. He said he couldn't wait and I asked when the next one was and he said ""five minutes"". I got my bag and then I was at some school in a place that I can't read but kind of looks like 'Piranha' (whatever it says is an actual suburb, but I can't remember or read it). It was stingy. It was a place for all the poor or troubled teenagers. As I was leaving I hid my phone. There were some people fighting. Silas and Theodore were there. I ended up missing the next bus. I waited at the bus stop with others. A different kind of bus came and it was squishy. I asked the driver if it went to Newtown or Midvale. He said no and I asked what the closest stop was and he said he didn't know but there was a place I could go to ask and it closed at 9pm. It was 8.20. He said he would take me there. It got close to 9 and he said we wouldn't make it. I text Mom. Someone at the back of the bus got up and Tiana sat down a seat away from me. I asked the girl next to her to move, thinking I would sit next to her and [something I can't read] went back. Dmitri came on the bus. I got back to Nana's and I had ""three meows"" from Dmitri, which were like a message or something."
"2872"	"(2009-06-11 (18)) I was at a shop. It was small and Mom and I were in an aisle that was close to one wall. It was a really tight fit and we could barely move. There was a door on this wall that led to another shop. I complained to Mom about the size. Then, Calvin had to hand out ice-creams to these people on an oval. I was with him. They were playing a game. Michael Trucco was there and the game was called Pyramid and I said that was weird since he played Pyramid Ball in Battlestar Galactica (he was actually a character though). There was a mud flavoured ice-cream."
"2873"	"(2009-06-12 (18)) I was at dads on my computer. I had gone back to play Sims 3 but hadn't yet. I had been there for hours but hadn't bothered. I went to the lounge room and played the Wii. Then I was watching music videos. The first one they played was the one I wanted. I can't remember what it was but it was hard rock and the band's name was two words consisting of two letters each but was sometimes called 'TOC'. I was going to call Mom soon. I had the music down low so Dad didn't get annoyed."
"2874"	"(2009-06-13 (18)) I was watching a movie. A spy lady had been married to this low-life guy. He went after her kid and her love interest (unknowingly). She came to the place he was holding them. Also, there was some special knife. This guy got stabbed and fell into some water and died, but he got back up. The spy lady came and shot them. I was with some people there. There was a big gate and I went to go around and she shot this other dude. I asked ""why didn't I hear your gun click?"" and she said ""no-one can"" and I said ""Oh yeah a silencer, duh!"". I told her new boyfriend she was married to him. I went inside and the guy said something, like ""think I've seen this before"". The bad dude tried to run me off the road."
"2875"	"(2009-06-13 (18)) I was inside some place and there was fairy floss and it was like a blanket. Farrah and Ariana were there. They asked for some and I said ""sure"". There were some others and everyone just took a bit off. Ariana was very polite. Ezra was there too with a fairy floss blanket. He did something mean so I ruined something for him. Then I was with Mom and we were driving past Midvale shops and she was driving fast and was all over the road. She had a packet of drugs and was licking the inside of it. Once she had enough she drove normally again. This girl kept popping up on the street and it scared me because she was everywhere. There was also this guy who hopped across the road like a rabbit."
"2876"	"(2009-06-13 (18)) I was watching Quantum Leap. It was Sliders-ish. I was in Scott Bakula's world and he decided he wanted to check ours' out. We ended up in a shop at the top of an escalator, which had those little things you walk through, with the metal and it clicks. He said ""there are kids working!"". Then we were in a forest and were trying to do this thing to get back to his world. There was a symbol on the ground and we put water on it. His hands were on mine and he said he didn't think it was going to work, but then we realized the symbol was gone and we were in his world. Then it was like The A-Team. Dirk Benedict was standing next to a wire fence and I snuck up and grabbed his shoulder. I was thinking that maybe I should I go to Comic-Con. Then creatures and people that Scott Bakula had come across in his travels were there (as in, ones he had killed or stopped). They started attacking us and then it was a quest on Runescape. I was about to fight the boss monster which was a dragon, but I got scared and teleported away. As I ran through the forest, things attacked me. I didn't know where the closest bank was."
"2877"	"(2009-06-14 (18)) Mom, Ezra, Amelia and I were staying at dads. When it was dinner time, she hadn't made me anything so I had a Vegemite sandwich and complained to her. In the morning, she came into my room with Fug and I said to get out of my room. I went on my computer and it was in a different place (the house was now totally different) I was reading the IMDb forum for Jim Sturgess and looking at pictures. Someone said about him, ""nice cleft and asylum"". I was also playing Fusion Effect, which was different. People came in and I saw Silas and Seamus. They had a camera. They were talking and laughing and I turned off my monitor so they couldn't see what I was doing. They wanted to get a photo taken with me. I was like 'I just woke up!'. They showed me their MySpace page and they had been getting pictures taken with everyone from school. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt. I went against the wall and Silas was next to me. He sort of put his arms around me in a hug and I was like 'what the hell, don't touch me!'. Seamus stood a bit in front. He mentioned that on MySpace, photos of me and my photos had lots of negative ratings, so I went on later and put lots of thumbs up on them to make them positive. I was talking to Calvin later and he was now where we were. There was a video with this weird aquatic creature, they called it a jellyfish. It had a weird mouth. I said I would've kicked it in the head. I was saying how when survival guides, and the like, tell you to do certain things, that it's never your first thought. Then there was a lizard and it was chasing me. I ran and closed this door to trap it, but the door didn't close all the way (it was like a sliding door, but with the folds in it) so I ran, squealing. It kept following us. We all jumped up on stuff, I jumped onto a desk. It came to me and hung around the bottom of the desk. I jumped off, because it would like copy you, so I was trying to act out ""jump off a cliff"", so it would die. I tripped and was on my back and it ran towards my face and then I woke up."
"2878"	"(2009-06-15 (18)) I was at a Dylan Moran thing. The place was small and the seats were lame (there weren't many, not layered and squished). He was on the side in a room, which was like where the people sit outside of a recording booth. He did music stuff sometimes. He was doing one now and all these people came up on the stage, including Eminem, Alejandro and other celebrities. People left for a break and I got up and sat on a seat in the middle. Audriana came and sat next to me and was talking to me. She said ""Life is really hard right now. I'm doing George Clooney and Alejandro,"". I said ""What?!"" in shock. She giggled and said they would say ""silly things"" to her and then she paused and said ""You're kind of retarded"", I said ""not really"". I presumed she said this because she was just joking, but I get the feeling she was telling the truth. Poppers wanted to steal from some company and blame it on Uncle Vic. Mom made me keep an eye on him while I was at University. She had a big file full of important files and timetables. My timetable for this trimester was in there and Ezra started at the Technical College this week too. I had nothing on Tuesday and Monday went from 9.30-11.30 and was 'science'. We were then in the car and we drove into a shop, which was half outside (like there were bits of roof missing, sort of market-like). We didn't know how to drive out. I was with Mom, Ezra and Dad. We had to walk up these stairs. We had cakes from Nana and Poppa and we were supposed to give them back, but we had forgotten so gave them back now. We were allowed to take some for ourselves, so I took some and ate a couple."
"2879"	"(2009-06-16 (18)) I was on the computer and it was yesterday. I was on IMDb and there was a guy called 'random_guy'. In his reviews, he mentioned having seen 3309 movies. I had caught 10-15 minutes of this movie earlier. I can't really remember it, but something fell from the sky. It was a baby and it was raised by these wise Asian guys. I said it would've been better if it had been more suspenseful, mainly complaining about the music. I was then watching South Park and Kyle and Cartman were playing the piano and were in sync and sounded good. I went to comment on it, but then couldn't be bothered. I realized it was nearly 2am and I had to get 6am. I went to the kitchen and was filling my water bottle up. I said to Mom ""you need to do my hair"" and she said it was already done and then I remembered. I got another water bottle and went to go to bed."
"2880"	"(2009-06-17 (18)) We had moved house, I think. There was a Sims 3 thing which recorded the number of times the songs were listened to [note: I found the site LastFM a couple days ago, which records the number of plays and I am currently obsessed with it] . Africa by Toto had a high number of plays. On the radio they said they were going to play 'rock' and they played Toto. It was a song I didn't know but then it changed to Don't Fear the Reaper and I was singing it. Mom and Darren were asleep on the lounge. I woke her and said I was going to bed. Also, some guy had found a sewing machine in the backyard of Mom's and because they hadn't 'claimed' it and he was going to take it. A friend of Mom's came over and Mom was going to get her to take it for now. I was then at dads and he was in the kitchen throwing out food, but it wasn't him? The fridge was where the old fridge used to be. I heard Mittens meow and she was outside. She jumped up onto the window sill. Tigger jumped up too. There was another cat which was orange, brown and white and was ugly-ish. It looked a bit like a dog."
"2881"	"(2009-06-18 (18)) I was at a school. I was with Autumn and Evelyn. I went off with Autumn and she was being all religious-y and good. I went into a classroom and went to do something and I realized the teacher was in the class (a lady) and I moved and sat on some chairs at the back of the class. They were close to two filing cabinets and other stuff. I moved to the front to fight? I pushed a desk and it hit a desk with a coffee on it. I did something that I can't read and then moved. The teacher complained and I said something back to her and we left. Our class was somewhere with Mr Reilly. Then we were inside the class and it was shop-like. I had 'broken' a chair and threw it. I was with Calvin and he was watching. Mr Reilly said the chair broke all the time and it was hard to hear him. He came to me and Autumn and asked what school we went to and we said ""university"". He said to not feel bad if we were the worst because we'd do better at something else. Her name was Jordan or something and my name rhymed with it. I said that I never noticed that before. There was a group of people for the Westland thing. There were two girls called Eevee and a black girl. There was a house and this lady was doing a tour. She said to ""look at the ceiling and the fireplace"". We went upstairs. Then it was a movie/TV show. Kenny Hotz didn't want people to know he was poor and from a poor area. Someone told these guys and they said to not worry about it. Then it showed Kenny like 'ok...'. But they came after him and these other bad guys. Then these guys took over the house. I was outside with Ezra. I forgot the names of the characters in some show and I said ""why do I have to remember so many names?"" and I mentioned Jack from Lost. There was a party in a house. There was a caterpillar on my foot and I called it a ""moo cow caterpillar"". I got to the front door and I was worried it was something gross so I flicked it into a plant pot."
"2882"	"(2009-06-19 (18)) I was watching Battlestar Galactica. Adama was in Caprica and cheated on Roslin with a teenage girl in a car. He fell asleep and Roslin came and saw the girl coming out of the car. He was dead and she was crying. I was watching it with someone else and I was thinking 'why do they have to kill off my favourite character just as I start to like him?'. Then he twitched and came back to life and they hugged. I was on the net and I found a video of this guy called Yan, though sometimes it was a longer name that started with 'D'. He was Russian or Swedish or something. They were all short videos. Either I found out from the videos, or this email he sent me, that I had actually written them and sent them to him. The last one was done in April 2008. I didn't remember anything about them at all. The emails were in his language although he spoke English fine. I had already done plot summaries for the last few; one of them was about a girl getting raped. We lived at this different house. Dmitri also lived there. His hair was orange and spiky. I was in my room and Michael Trucco was over, I think he was a relative. He had a kid called Melody and she was trying to get into my room and crying. I 'lifted' the door off the hinges and put it down and it wouldn't fit in. Mom told me off. There was an advertisement for Yan. He thought the handwriting that the stories were written in was his, but I showed him that it was mine, but I don't know where. I was playing Sims 2 and one of the Caliente twins had babies. Also on the Sims 2, a Dmitri Sim and a Mackenzie Sim got together autonomously. Because of this I didn't know whether to marry my Sim Self to a townie that I liked or to Dmitri but then I remembered that I didn't even like Dmitri anymore. I got back from somewhere and I forgot where my room was. It was the ""one with the pretty green door"". Dmitri's door was green too and was two doors down from my room. I walked into my door. Ezra was there too."
"2883"	"(2009-06-20 (18)) There was a movie out that I wanted to see. Dakota Fanning had written and starred in it, but it looked cool. Mom wouldn't go to the cinema. I went to university and got to the normal place I go and I had a bag of stuff, so I went to a safe, which was in the middle of a path and I put my stuff in there. I then went to the lab, but it was actually a room with grey patches on the wall. Mr Epstein was there. By putting your face up to the patches you could see a dream in 3D, or a thought or whatever. Ezra was there too. Then the images were like 'real'. I went into one and it was my dream. The Rock, Ezra and I were in a house. I saw this huge slug under this thing and it had like, two heads. The Rock went to get it and then there was a spider on his ""bum"" and he stabbed it. The slug crawled up him and then there was a huge rock monster outside. People were running around screaming everywhere, but it was after me and Ezra. It would open its mouth and roar and punch its fist down and we would run. We got into a car and The Rock wanted to get in but it would fully break? He got in and told me to drive through the oval -- there were kids on the oval and he said it would eat them and get distracted so we could get away. So I drove through. I got out of mine and then I went to Ezra's one. He tried to kill me because he thought that he was in mine and I said it wasn't true because mine was lame and in a dark cave. In Ezra's, he had made a village with a friend. Then he stopped and I said to check mine out. Then there was another dream thing. I got into a car on a hill and Buffy's mother (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) got into the passenger seat and Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) came to my window and said ""I'll drive"" and then we 'combined'. This was a thing that came from a wish she made. It was then reality again and the movie I wanted to see was like my dream with the rock monster. Mom was now ordering tickets but they were saying that it was full. There was one in some place called Maykeby (or Maykelou or something, I can't read it), which was really expensive. The reviews for the movie were all really good. Then we were in like a cinema. This guy was there, who was the lead singer of a hard rock band that I liked. At first, he sounded like Phil Collins. Anyway, he told them off and then he and some others put sand everywhere (on the walls, windows etc) and then threw snacks everywhere for us to get. I was checking the fat content but they were all too high. Also, I don't know when it happened, but I was in bed and my phone vibrated and I had a text from Dad saying like, 'nub' and it was 1pm. I got up annoyed that I had slept so late. I was looking the mirror and I punched my self in the face, with my right hand which hurt and then my left hand, which barely did a thing."
"2884"	"(2009-06-22 (18)) I woke up and Gizmo was on top of me. I rolled over and something vibrated. It was my hot water bottle. I threw it out of the bed and wondered why they vibrated. Later I was getting my Dream book ready for publishing, with the correct formatting etc [Note: I was on Lulu last night] . Some of the formatting didn't match up properly. I had big headphones that were really soft and comfortable. I put them on and they were really tight fitting, and 'clapped' right over my ears. I thought it was cool that I could listen to music more often. I was reading about Grey's Anatomy. Some lady said that someone on it needed eye surgery because she had googly eyes, but it was a set up. Izzie (Grey's Anatomy) worked on the surgery but then she was George (Grey's Anatomy). I was then outside undercover. I was sitting at a bench with Calvin and Liesl. I asked Calvin if he got to do his exam and said that we did but didn't get a timetable. I asked if ""she"" did exams and he said 'no why?', then I can't read what it says. I saw Evelyn not far away and we tried not to laugh and I told him about this book (?) which was now a game and I said it used two random pictures and said whether they were good together or not and Evelyn got Darius. Then I saw Eugene there. He was near Evelyn and was looking for something."
"2885"	"(2009-06-23 (18)) I can't remember properly, but I was out with Mom in the car. It was almost time to go to the train station but I wasn't dressed properly. We went to dads and he was there. I got dressed and there was a new pack of underwear so I changed into a pair. My timetable was dodgy for the day -- I had a spare hour between each hour of class. There was a sport thing too that was a high energy boxing like thing. I needed my lab coat from Mom's but it was now like 8.21am and I started at 8.30am. I think it was some time before, but I was going to bed. Tigger was in the lounge room so Ezra left the door open (they were sleeping in the same room)."
"2886"	"(2009-06-24 (18)) I was walking home with a girl. Some guys came up and were on the grass and I said ""get off my property"". They went after my friend and I ran next door. An old guy answered and I explained what was happening, but then the guys came over. While they were over there I ran home and inside."
"2887"	"(2009-06-24 (18)) I was at university and we were doing an experiment. There was a pretty blue solution. Raquel was there. The next experiment involved noodles. I was then walking down a street and some guys were saying something. Someone asked something about ""Audrey"". Someone said that I'd been having sex with her and I was like '...what?'. I got home and went into my room. There was a girl in my bed and my computer was not there. I asked Dad why there was a girl in my room and everyone was saying that I should know since I'd been sleeping with her. I had never seen her before."
"2888"	"(2009-06-25 (18)) Ezra did something at Westland University too. His teachers were the ones I had last year. I was in math and it was weird? I took the same train and bus but I didn't get off. He looked behind and said he would try and look closer? This part is hard to read but it looks like it says that I (?) said ""you'll remember the truck (?) all by yourself?"" Then something that looks like 'moochy l'. I was looking for a desk at this place. But, wherever the desk was the space had to come with it, so I was trying to find one with a good amount of space. I found one and I pressed a button to try it, there was a huge computer and an old mouse, but it said physical contact was needed. I went to this room to touch the guy and he said to stop and then put his hands up. My hands were sweaty and he was 40-60? He took my hand and said ""ooh, that'll do"". I thought that was kind of creepy, but ignored it. We went back to the computer and he said clothes came with it. He gave them to me and he went to lock the door. I put the shirt on over my shirt but it fit well. He said ""these are the sleeves"" and they looked strait-jacket like and I decided to leave. There was a door behind me leading outside. Then it was a movie or something. This person was saying that they should let him rape them. Mr Garrison (South Park) had died instead? Someone said ""But Lisa wasn't so lucky"" and they were talking about The Simpsons. Whoever it was climbed up this wooden frame, and at the top was the guy's room. There was a singer guy and he was at a concert on stage. He ripped his clothes off and a fake penis fell off. I can't remember who I thought it was but it said Dancing in the Dark, but it was Cover Me and I realized it was Bruce Springsteen. Jeremiah was also over earlier and said something that I can't read."
"2889"	"(2009-06-25 (18)) Dad got a house in Bali. I was showing Mom pictures of expensive furniture. I was then at university but it was like, 1am. Ezra asked why it was so late and I said something about studying and he said ""why are you always at [something I can't read] then?"". The place that I normally did something (I can't read what it says, but it looks like it starts with an 'f') was actually close to home. I was then back home and the wall out the front had been moved out and into a 'hangman' (like, a wooden model of a hangman game). I asked Darren why and he said ""you don't know what a hangman is?"". They were where the grass used to be and were ugly. I was then inside and I needed to go to bed soon because I had to wake up at 6am. I was singing A Glass of Champagne. Then people kept making noises and coming into my room while I tried to sleep. A friend of Dad's was like a dominatrix and had a photo of this girl he scammed and threw it into a big bin. I was then in the car with Mom and Ezra. She was singing and I told her to shut up. She was like 'I have a good singing voice' and I said 'yeah that's why I complain every time'. Then it was night/early morning. I took a bus and got off, then took another one and I kept doing that for some reason. I also started taking trains. I pressed the button (on the bus) and I got dropped off at a $8 a night hotel/motel. I text Mom to get me. I was reading about Spongebob Squarepants because there were questions about it for something. Mr Krab was called 'Increased [something I don't remember] . He also took up some violin thing called a ventillion, or something."
"2890"	"(2009-06-25 (18)) I was at Mom's, which was different. The front room had windows at the front and no curtains. I can't remember why, but people weren't supposed to know that I was there. I saw ""Officer Barbrady"" coming, but it was actually Bellick (Prison Break). I ran out the back and hid behind something. After he left, a bunch of people found out that I was alive or whatever. Granma was one of these people. She brought a bag which had another bag on it under the shoulder and another going out to the stomach. The backyard was big and farm like. Then we were out somewhere and Granma was acting weird and we realized she was drunk. She was driving me and Mom. We saw police up ahead at a booze bus, but they let us through and we were like 'lucky!'. Then I was watching a movie with Kevin Spacey. I had written down the ending before watching it to see if I was right. I was and I was telling Dad it was easy to guess. Then it was like the sequel or something. Robert Downey Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were in it. Jeffrey was a bad guy and in his Watchmen outfit. He was on the phone at a desk (it was like in the movies, where it's a dark room with a lamp on, on the desk) and talking to the 'good guy' and I thought 'damn his voice is hot'. Robert Downey Jr. was wearing a cool coat and I said to Mom that I wanted a coat like that. He was running down a street. Someone's mother, who looked like Judith Light, was at her work in a big building. She was in a big meeting room with ladies all around the table. There was a scream and it went in slow motion and it exploded. At the end of the movie, it showed Robert's character getting a job and sorting everything out. I said that I liked how it sorted all that out at the end, to get ready for the next movie. I think it was a Batman movie, and I was glad that it didn't suck as much as The Dark Knight."
"2891"	"(2009-06-26 (18)) A guy had written Twilight. He decided he loved Alice so everyone thought he was going to bring her back to life in the next book [note: she didn't die in the book] . I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Buffy and Giles were acting weird and they leant in to kiss and someone entered the room and they backed off. I remembered in the last episode they had made out. The others left and Giles was locking the front door and closing the curtains and then Spike was there. He said ""Buffy"" and he thought something was going on. People were complaining about not knowing what Spike could do (without the chip)."
"2892"	"(2009-06-27 (18)) I was at home. I was with Farrah and Ezra had Roland over. Dad was home. Every time we went into my room something was different and it was spooky. There was a piece of paper (like paper from a magazine) which was an application for a concert. It said ""Michael Cain"" and I figured it meant Michael Caine and said it was spelt wrong. One of the times I went into my room there was a new sheet on my bed but when I tried to show someone it was gone. The bed was in the middle of the room, coming out from the wall. Stuff moved around, like the lights etc. I was at the window and Farrah was doing something that I can't read but says that she slowed down for something. Also, Farrah was sometimes Tara from True Blood. Another time she found an old notebook of mine and it had the original copy of the magazine application and we showed Dad. Then I went to Brookland High to do something before going to university. It was a Friday by the way. I went to a room at the back of the school, where the psychologist was, who was a lady but was sometimes a guy. While I was waiting I was talking about a dream I'd had. She asked if it any religious stuff and I said no and told her to not mention religion. A while later I checked the time and it was 11.30 and I was like 'flip, I missed it' and text Mom to get me. Then the psych was a guy. His mates came and he said 'another [something] dream'. I saw Mom's car and took off. She yelled at me for not telling her sooner. Ezra and Roland were in the back. Then it was just me and Mom. We heard a siren and it meant there was a storm coming. There were clouds in the sky but were far away."
"2893"	"(2009-06-27 (18)) I was in veterinary science. We were getting essays back and I got 99% on mine, which was obviously an A. The teacher told us to not tell each other our scores yet. I was sort of friends with this girl who got a B. Her name was either Chloe or Barbara -- there were two girls but I couldn't remember who was who. Then there was a storm outside. There was water in class, which was supposed to be there. The teacher told us to go to the middle of it. Outside it was dark and stormy and there were waves (there was water right outside the classroom too). The girls and I swam to the front but kept getting flung back. There was some event thing on. I was then in some place with Dad, Mom and others. There was mail on the table and it said ""James R. Spader"" and I said ""Ooh, can I open James Spader's mail?"" but it was already open. There was heaps of stuff chucked in other envelopes with Beatles stamps. There was other Beatles stuff and I said to Mom that I 'must've changed my mind' (referring to the fact that it was a dream, and I changed the mail). Then I joined in with the event. It was my third time but because I was still too 'young' I had to go with a partner. My partner was a guy. I had to go in a floaty ring and then try to attach something behind me as part of our task. I was just outside this building on like a patio, without the roof bit. Then our task was to wear these suits, which were a dark grey and were metal like and there were zips at the front and back. There were strips of metal on the feet and it was heavy. There was a big container of fruit (the bottom was like the big freezers at the shops with the cold foods and it had clear plastic walls on top, and a space where you could reach in or whatever). We had to eat the fruit and the weight would be recorded from the strips on our feet. The fruit tasted funny. I had a strawberry and a licorice bar (which was disgusting, as they are). The blue one was the only one with licorice in the middle? The guy went with his friend and took off his suit and was eating the fruit. I said that it only counted it with the suit on. I went inside and there were computers. For the next task you had to listen to music. The most listened to song had less than 60 plays. It was 'If I Was' and I said ""Oh Midge Ure!"". There were lots of songs with 27 plays. I started to listen and then I saw A Glass of Champagne and I was excited. It also had 27 plays or so all by one guy. I found him and went to where he was and then I had the song stuck in my head so was singing the robot-like bit ""glass of champagne""."
"2894"	"(2009-06-28 (18)) I was at the train station. I think I was at Westland. It was different. I had to get a ticket from a machine near the tracks. They were called food stamps though. The train was coming in two minutes. I tried to get to it but this lady pushed in and the train came and she got on but me and this old guy were left behind. I ran to it and tried to open the door but I couldn't get it open far enough. The next one was in ten minutes. When it was close to one minute, it said 30 minutes. People were running around on the tracks. The trains were really fast. This girl and guy ran into a nook and the train just missed them. I was on a platform and it moved and this train started flying towards me (it went around though). I said that ""I almost peed my pants!"". Eventually, I was on a train but I missed Centerville. I called Mom and said that I missed it and to pick me up from the next station instead. I can't remember what happened then, but then I was at a shop. These people were wearing different coloured clothes in pairs. This guy and his daughter were blowing the shop up. He was with his daughter when she blew up, but he left just before she did. I was trying to run away from them, but they chased me. I ran into this blown up bit. A part of it was pitch black and I came across a dead body. They forgot about me later and went off to explode so I ran out. Then it was a show or something. There was a shoe shop. This guy came and he was like ""shoes are shiny"" and this girl flirted with him. He tried on some shoes and then ran. We were nearby. Ezra was in some water but came back and said that 'you get to be more brave' etc. Then it was dark and night time. I called Mom to get me and I had tried calling her all day and she kept saying she would come, but never did. I went down a path and it was spooky. This guy got up and started coming my way, so I went back. Later I went down it again but gave up. As I was going down, Mom had actually come to the place but had left after getting sick of waiting for me. I called her again and she said she couldn't be bothered. I told her she could've called ""Dad or Darren or someone else!"". The next time I called her, she said she wasn't feeling well and wasn't home."
"2895"	"(2009-06-29 (18)) I can't remember properly, but David Tennant as the Doctor (Doctor Who) was in the past when there was no electricity, etc. There was a monster and it was coming and he discovered a way to teleport this building with these gems. He managed to do it at the last second. In the new place, this lady had gotten squashed by the monster as it was moving and so was now dead. There was more but I can't remember it now."
"2896"	"(2009-06-29 (18)) I woke up and it was 1.30pm or something and my alarm hadn't gone off. I complained to Mom about not waking me up. I checked my alarm on my phone and it said couldn't go off today for some reason."
"2897"	"(2009-06-29 (18)) Aunt Sally, except it wasn't, wanted to do a dream experiment. She had to pick between me and Ezra and chose me, since I know stuff about dreams. Chef (South Park) was going to go to sleep and then I had to come in later and check whether he was dreaming. It was early in the morning and I was really tired. I said that REM doesn't start until 1-2 hours after falling asleep and she said that she thought it was more like 3-5 hours. I said to look it up then. We got on a computer and it said 3-10-250 hours. I said ""who sleeps for 250 hours?"". I went in and his eyes opened and then he pretended to be asleep. I told her he was pretending. Then she was Nana. We went outside and it was day now. There was a cage near the fence edge, which was near a road. She was going to put a bed in it for me. I said ""can't I just sleep inside, like on the lounge?"" and she said ok. I went to the back door of her house and people came from the garage. Ezra was asleep on the ground and he woke up and curled into a ball with a weird expression. Nana went to go in and they grabbed her. I ran to the sliding doors going to the lounge room and got in, but the guy had a gun and I only had a screwdriver and so I gave myself up and went out. Ezra and I ended up getting into a fight with them and they were all pointing guns at each other and we realized they were fake. Then we were walking outside and I was wearing bunny legs."
"2898"	"(2009-06-30 (18)) I was in the lounge watching TV. Mom and Darren were talking and then started looking for something. I asked what they were looking for and they said a spider. Darren said to keep our hands on our throats as they were poisonous. I looked for a bit and then went back to my room. My left leg was a bit numb. I went to my computer and was playing a new song I'd found. It was then Homeward Bound and then Electricity."
"2899"	"(2009-06-30 (18)) I was on the computer. I was having problems with something and the only solution I could find was for an operating system I'd never heard of. Daryl and Dmitri had both posted on the post saying that ""Windows, Mac, Host and Moses should have fixes"" or at least for the first three. They were all operating systems by the way."
"2900"	"(2009-06-30 (18)) I was in a car with Dad and we went under this bridge. There was a little plane, a van and two cars in a crash. One was upside down and there was no glass on the road and no people around, but we could hear sirens on the way. Dad said ""I bet that [name of guy] guy is like 'what the fuck happened'?"". We wondered if the plane crashed and then the others crashed. I was then somewhere else on the computer and I had downloaded about 2gb."
"2901"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) I was on the train which was different. I can't remember properly, but there were different ways to get to places. I was at home out the back. Kiki was out there with kittens and some were black. There was a little black one that was really cute. One day it was gone, but I came back later and saw it. Kiki let me walk past her."
"2902"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) I was in a car with Mom. We drove down the road and there were guys on the road selling smokes from another country, which were heaps stronger than normal smokes. We were at the lights. Police came down the road. Mom waited without indicating. When the cops were gone she went to the guys and bought some. It was like marijuana or something. I was then somewhere else and I had a list of stuff to watch or listen to. It mentioned Michael Palin's Himalaya's and Electric Light Orchestra and comparing it to some new stuff I'd never heard of. There was something about Blue Oyster Cult, but it wasn't actually them. I was then at a shop and got some noodles. It had 'stirfry' and had these yuck carrot bits. There was a cake with 40.3g of fat in a small slice. Mom made a cake too that was full of fat."
"2903"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) Ezra was on the computer and I was watching him install game. Mom was there too, I think. I kept calling it True Blood, and it was actually a True Blood game."
"2904"	"(2009-07-01 (18)) I can't remember the beginning, but Dad, a young boy, Darren, Mom and I were at this pool thing. I don't remember what happened there. Anyway, we were driving down a road and there were lots of really different sections of scenery. There was a lake thing with a chair ride that was old and faded. There were other rides there. There was a field with these tall purple flowers. They were creepy and I said they looked like they were from ""lollipop land"". There was a small section of water that was beach like (over sand). It was a very light blue. I said it was kind of pretty. We then ended up at this hotel and it had a big pool. I said it was 'luxurious', although it was actually kind of cheap looking. They we were in there and Mom was waiting for Darren, ""in case he's dead""? She tried calling him. No-one else was here, by the way. There was a plate that had biscuits in the shape of us with bacon and other stuff in them. I took a bit of one then a lady and Darren were at the table in there. Then it was Dad there with the lady. They were acting weird and they said he'd eaten breakfast. They gave us food and said to eat. I asked what it was and they wouldn't tell me so I chucked it back on the plate and said ""I'm done"" and walked off. I went into a room which had a big garden. Dad and the lady came in and she was angry at me ad Dad kept her off. He said, in this deep booming voice, ""I am Sing Tha, son of Urie"" or something. Then he said ""I am God"". I was like 'yeah right, ok'. He said he was looking for ""Eve"" who was a lady who had married into our family."
"2905"	"(2009-07-02 (18)) There was a quiz game show thing. Celebrities were on it and so was I. There was now me, Natalie Portman (or looked like her), who was the champ from 2001, and a singer guy whose name started with 'M'.  Natalie Portman had 9 points. There were two groups and one had 42,000 and my group had 41,000 (I only had 10 points and I thought that there was something not right). The questions were like quotes and producers of movies and stuff and was hard. Mom said we couldn't leave now and so Ezra and I were now tied for the same prize. I can't read what I wrote but it looks like it says she had 'picked us to go to [something starting with a u] ?'. The prizes were left over birthday presents. One had Payton on it. On Facebook, there was a guy called ""Thalky"", which I thought must be Preston Garfield's real name."
"2906"	"(2009-07-03 (18)) I was at my first lesson of chemistry which I only had on Tuesdays in the lab. It was in a different place. I got into a mixed group. There was a guy teacher and he was pretty lame. He yelled at me for not having my safety glasses and I yelled back that it didn't say to get any. He told this guy with long hair to tie it up. Later, we had started and then he told me and this girl that we needed to tie our hair up. I said no and he went off at me, mentioning the glasses again, and that I was just standing around. I yelled back and started to cry and grabbed my stuff and left. I was walking quickly down the corridors outside (the place was different) and I saw Regina. She said hello and that she didn't get into the course she wanted and had to do another unit. I wiped my tears away and said ""what, you have to dance on stage or something?"". She said that Samantha was showing her around and left. I came back later with Dad and it was either Wednesday or Thursday. I had to go back to chemistry though. I saw Ms Ingram and Ms Kuo. Ms Ingram gave me a skirt and said to try it on and this guy told me not to worry about it. I got to class and the group from chemistry saw me and they were annoyed and trying not to smirk. I asked for my results. Some time later, Calvin and some other people were playing a game. Silas was in a cave? Calvin had peed down there and told Silas that. He didn't believe him and I said it was true and he realized it was and vomited. There was a show, which was in book form too. It was romance and the guy looked like Michael Emerson and the girl thought he was ""cute""."
"2907"	"(2009-07-03 (18)) I was watching a movie, which was The Hangover, but not. I think Michael Cera was in it. There were two guys and one of them cheated on his wife or girlfriend with Heather Graham's character? She went to his wife/girlfriend and said she had some STI and the wife was like ""and...?"" and then realized that he had slept with her. Then the two guys and a girl were in a bed and there was a knock on the window. They were all naked. One opened it and it was his wife. She said something, but I can't read what I wrote, and I thought that she thought that he was gay. Then she realized Heather Graham was naked. I laughed because I hadn't noticed. She held her shirt up and the guy told her off for being naked. I mentioned the movie, Moon, to Ezra. He said he wanted to see it and asked if I could download it. I said that I didn't think it was out until November. I asked why he was interested since it was a ""sci-fi drama"". He said he didn't know. I was thinking 'Sam Rockwell, yay'."
"2908"	"(2009-07-04 (18)) I was on the train. I saw a girl and guy who were from One Tree Hill on there (not real ones). I sat in a seat a few seats in front of them. Hilarie Burton sat down next to me and I commented that lots of people from One Tree Hill were on here. We talked for a bit. I can't remember properly, but I was then in a car with Mom meeting someone in a carpark. We had like $1 million in the car in cash, all in $100 notes. We had no bags or shoes and packed all our stuff up in a towel. The police checked out the car. There were some notes sticking out and we gave it to the cops, laughing ""we keep finding these [letters?] "". We ended up at this house which was far away. Then it was a movie or show and this black guy and this kid were in it. They looked alike and I thought it was good casting. They left the wife behind to go there and the kid wasn't happy he had to leave again. Hilarie was then there with me and was sitting on a bed and there was stuff all over the floor and the bed."
"2909"	"(2009-07-05 (18)) My teeth were falling out and I ended up with like 3 (they had fallen out like this before). I went to the doctor. I had to get a ticket like when you get meat from a shop. I grabbed two and later this girl got there and I gave it to her -- the tickets were in the 50's, but it was now up to the 130's. I don't know what happened there but I was then at a shop. Mom had a raffle on. There were 10 slices of cake to win. She won a piece and she let me pull out some of the winners. I closed my eyes and it said ""Scratched"" and I was like 'who the hell is that?' but it was Santiago. He came and got cake."
"2910"	"(2009-07-05 (18)) I think there was a monster. I was outside somewhere, jumping on the roof and walls to get away. Then it was Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). She got to the 'end' and they were going to kill her but she walked away. Then she was shown images of her friends and family on fire so she went back and sacrificed herself."
"2911"	"(2009-07-06 (18)) I went back to dads. I was talking to him and he had lots of mail on the table. One had my name on it and I went to open it and he came back in. He said they were other offers and he mentioned the new apartment. I said ""what apartment?"" and he said 'the new one' and I was thinking 'finally he tells me'. He said that when he owned it, he was going to ask to take Tigger. Later, I was playing World of Warcraft and I was in a scary area (because it was full of high level monsters). There were spiders and tornado things and they kept attacking me. I was looking for something for a quest. Later, I went on a train and was at university walking to the bus stop. I walked over a zebra crossing and there was a car near, and my knee was hurt and I tried to run. I went through the tunnel under the road, which was different and you could see the traffic. There was a bus coming with the next lot of traffic but was held up. I ran to the bus stop. There was a guy there and he got on too. I sat at the front of the bus, which had seats facing to the middle of the bus. There was a couple next to me, to the right. I went to check my phone and it wasn't in my pocket. I grabbed the guy's sleeve/arm and he was like 'what the hell are you doing?'. It was in his hand and I took it and put in the opposite pocket. I said that ""I'm lucky I'm paranoid and check my pocket every few seconds"". The girl said something that made it seem like they were going to hold us up. I held up this paint scraper thing to the guy's throat and told the bus driver to stop. I was going to get off, but it was dark, so instead I told the girl to get off. She was angry, but she got off. Then I asked the driver to take me home and he did. I text Mom to get me from somewhere else. Then it was something else and whoever had held the paint scraper to the guy had slipped and killed him. But it was now a girl's body and they kept her in a room. This guy kept seeing her like 'balloons' with sand and empty with a pole inside her. She would 'talk' to him. Then it was South Park. Cartman looked after her body, which was kept in a room like a bathroom. There was a knock at the door and Butters peaked under the door and he came in with Stan and Kenny. Cartman locked them in (he was sick of looking after the body). The girl's last name reminded me of ""a movie with Dustin Hoffman"". I was then looking in a book with Mom, reading about the 'movie'. I said ""I feel like watching a spy movie"". My iPod had a bunch of songs on it which I had been listening to that I hadn't heard before and I had four of them left to listen to. I went into a shop or something with Calvin and I was choosing music for something. One of the most listened to songs which had 707 plays and was by The Tavares, but I didn't know the song. OMD were playing and this teacher said ""ooh OMD"" and I said ""Yay OMD! My second favourite band!"", they asked ""What's your first?"" and I said ""The Beatles obviously"". She was like 'no-one likes The Beatles' and I was like 'what the flip, are you serious?'. I mentioned that I listened to the 60's and 80's and had started with the 60's. She said 'oh that makes sense then'. I said that I had Petula Clark in my playlist at the moment though and starting singing 'Downtown' in my head."
"2912"	"(2009-07-07 (18)) We found three litters of kittens. There was a weird looking one but it was still cute. I was at university, which was different and I found a magpie with a broken leg so I told a bunch of teachers and they told me to sort it out since I cared so much. Later, there was like a storm and it had been getting worse. Today had been quite bad. I was at dads and it was very windy. I went into the bathroom and the bath and the shower were covered in this orange liquid, which was seeping onto the floor too. It was because the top of the roof was melting and it was coming through the bottom of the window too. It meant that the house had only a few days left, but then the rest of the 'glue' came off and came out faster through the window so we only had two hours or so. Mom and Ezra started packing stuff up. I was trying to keep Tigger and Mittens out of the room."
"2913"	"(2009-07-08 (18)) There was this holiday thing on for something for school. There was a place which did 'enactments' and you could give them details and they would make it like that for you to experience. Raquel was going to it and since it was booked out, the school made up one with a similar place. We were at a shop; I remember seeing Calvin and Eugene there. There were lots of clothes racks. They said that it was going to be like a prison and the guards were like 'aliens' and looked rhino like. There were lots of toy packets, with guns, walkie talkies etc lying about. They said they were going to get this room organized by tomorrow and get rid of the clothes racks and put debris and the like in. I asked if the walkie talkies worked and they said they did. I opened a packet and gave one to Calvin and the others to the people behind me (the packet had four in it). It was like an iPod and I put it in my shoe. We were then all lining up and went through this door and we were told to kneel. I was excited and trying not to smile. They were calling people out to answer questions, one was ""are there eight questions"", the girl said ""yes"" and she was wrong and was sent off somewhere. I was telling Mom about it later. I was at home and Abigail and Brogan were in the kitchen. I didn't know why they were there."
"2914"	"(2009-07-08 (18)) I was at the train station. The next train was in ten minutes. There were buses which went downtown. There was a bus that looked like it was the 98, but then it was 96. I asked the driver (an oldish lady) and she said it was the 98. The bus had heaps of old people on it. I tagged on and I sat at the front. I can't remember properly, but there was a crash over this hill. There were two buses and some cars. We were out and I was trying to slow cars coming down the hill, there was a huge line of them. Some of the crash vehicles looked like they were going to explode, so someone said to take this other bus and find help. This other guy got in to drive. This other guy and I raced to get there first. There were people on the bus and I got on and saw there was blood on the seat. Everyone on the bus and blood on their heads and were dead. I picked up a hammer and I thought the guy who came on with me had done it. I hit him and chucked him off the bus. Then I realized it was the guy driving and I hit him but he didn't fall and I kept hitting him but he just seemed drowsy. I don't know what happened. Later, I found a rubber finger in my room and I asked Ezra ""What the flip is this?""."
"2915"	"(2009-07-08 (18)) I was outside a shop. There was a grassy area, but I don't remember a carpark. There was a lady a bit in front of me. There was also a tank or something. It was aiming at her and we both ran and I wondered if it was actually aiming at me or her, but then we realized it was me and she ran off. I was trying to run away from it and it started beeping along with a timer. Then it exploded. Then it was like a second me? It had something to do with Jude Law who was suspected of being involved with this Italian pizza place. This cop went and was asking them questions. I snuck in and heard Jude Law talking to this guy about 'getting it taking care of'. It was then a TV show and the cop was Tony Hale and his character's name was Hale or something. My character was called Izzy, but I was trying to think of a cool last name. For some reason I wanted it starting with a 'T', though I thought of Pritchard, and thought 'no, because it's obviously from Eugene' and Winter. I thought Travers, but I thought it was from a Sims 2 legacy I read and that it was kind of gay."
"2916"	"(2009-07-09 (18)) I was in a car with Mom and Ezra. It was late at night and we stopped at the deli on Arkana road. She told us to lock the doors but she locked it with a key. I had to go to dads for a bit for some reason. She came back to the car then couldn't find her ""migraine medicine"" and said the guy who served her 'must've kept it in his hands' but then she found it. Some girls had asked for a donation and one of us said ""I'm just here to get [something I can't read] "" We went to dads and waited. He came home and got changed and was walking around in a towel. I asked why I was here (he had asked me) but he didn't clarify. It was 10.30 and I said I needed to go to bed because I had to get up early for university tomorrow. Mittens was on World of Warcraft and was a human warrior with the same professions as me. I then felt like playing. Then this girl had made this blue and green Sim for Sims 3 and I was trying to decide on colours for [something I can't read] outside and then I felt like playing Sims 3."
"2917"	"(2009-07-10 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was doing a quest and slaying something like a boar. I think I was in a new area and then I went through a portal. I wandered into this humanoid camp and this dude, who was like the leader, had 610hp and started coming after me. I had what I needed to get, and ran. I looked back after a while and he was still coming. I ran for ages but he kept following me."
"2918"	"(2009-07-10 (18)) I think we were at Midvale shops and it was late at night. Mom and I were sitting in the car. She had a packet of drugs and kept sniffing it. She drove somewhere off road. This young black kid came up to the car and asked for something. We locked the doors and he called us racist. She kept driving and sniffing and I was worried we were going to crash."
"2919"	"(2009-07-11 (18)) I was playing a game with Calvin, except it was real. I think it was World of Warcraft. We got to this city with this other person. We had to sleep on this small platform in the air and it had a barrier on one edge, but you could fall off the sides."
"2920"	"(2009-07-11 (18)) I had a new timetable for university. I had nothing on Tuesday and Monday, but I had classes on the weekend. Lots of them went until late. I complained about it. We went to Nana's and they had gotten rid of the middle fish pond and had had just kept the pond there (all the plants and the gazebo area were gone). She said they were getting rid of the other one, but were waiting to see if frogs were in there. She was grabbing fish with the net. I showed Dad my timetable. We went to this shop. There was a retard guy and he kept making this weird 'blklbll' sound and Dad and I were trying not to laugh. He kept following us, which was creepy. Then I took a train to the train station, but I missed the bus because the one I had been on had missed my stop, but Mom came straight there."
"2921"	"(2009-07-12 (18)) I was at dads and he finally mentioned the new apartment to me and I said ""what new place?"" and he told me. I found out from Mom that he could back out and that he wasn't took keen anymore. I asked Dad why he wouldn't tell me, what if I wanted to move back etc."
"2922"	"(2009-07-12 (18)) I met this girl and we were sort of friends. We were in some fancy area. We went to this place and these two girls were there. When my friend left they asked why we were friends because ""you're not very pretty"". I said ""neither are you"" and proceeded to make a very well-spoken speech about how ""looks aren't going to inhibit me from whatever I want to do, unless I wanted to be a model"" and that in the future when I was making lots of money, they would be working in a checkout."
"2923"	"(2009-07-12 (18)) I was at home, but then we were going somewhere. Mom and Ezra were in the front of the car and Roland and I were in the back. We were passing Dog Swamp shops and I was thirsty and my water bottle was almost empty, though it had been full when we left. Roland said someone should play Runescape and I said I was going to earlier, but had played World of Warcraft instead. We got to the train station and were waiting for a bus. Roland was wearing a black shirt that said 'Rainbow' in red and I realized it was the band. The bus came and it was the 451 and I then realized we needed to take a train. Mom wouldn't listen to me, and then she did. She went to the toilet to check herself in the mirror. Ezra tried to draw on my face with a red texta."
"2924"	"(2009-07-13 (18)) I was dating this Indonesian (or so I think) guy, and I was pregnant but I had cheated on him with this other Asian guy [note: watched paternity tests on Maury Povich last night] . Sometimes I was Ezra and he said he didn't want his kid around the Indonesian's sister, who was younger and was like 4 years old. Then I was meeting his parents? But then, I was with another lot of parents and I introduced the other guy I was with as my boyfriend, who was called Rupesh [note: watched Torchwood the other day] . Then I was somewhere else and I was actually going out with Eugene. We were at a shop looking at fans and he was getting one similar to one that I had, though I was thinking it was pointless since we were always in the same bed. There were chairs there. I was watching him at one point and I was thinking like, that I was lucky and he was hot. I went to touch him and then pulled my hand away. Then I was at some other place and everyone had found out that I'd been sleeping with the other guys. Eugene was upset and went to this other room. I was upset about Eugene and fell into a heap, then the second Asian guy, who was now Felipe from chemistry, got this ring and was trying to propose to me and I cried and told him to go away and hit him with this tray. Later, I was playing World of Warcraft and killing these red spiders and usually there were birds there, but they weren't now because it was a different season. Eugene sent me a message over the game asking me what I was doing, then sent back saying oops, he forgot (that he was angry at me, I guessed)."
"2925"	"(2009-07-14 (18)) I can't remember properly but I was playing World of Warcraft. Mom was telling me how something tasted ""like a turkey sac"" and it was a drink. I said I never had it and she said she was going to make some and I said that I wanted to have a sip."
"2926"	"(2009-07-15 (18)) I was at Mom's. There were cops at the door and Mom was telling me to be quiet. I went to my room. Darren was using the lawnmower outside. My room was different and was lower than the ground outside and when I looked through the window I could see the grassed area clearly, but looking up. There was stuff all over the floor and I realized they were spider webs. They were everywhere and there were lots of little black spider eggs on my bed. I told Mom and she just kept telling me to be quiet. I got a tissue and fly spray and I had to squish them all because they would bite otherwise. I got a few and they would squirt out purple juice. Little Willy was playing. I went back to my room later and it was different. My computer was on and my bed was long (?). I yelled at Mom. I was then walking with Dad, Ezra and Mom to go somewhere. Dad mentioned his new place and I said ""what new place?"". He said ""the apartment"" and I said 'I thought you would've talked to me about me, what if I wanted to move back' etc. He said it was to avoid tax or something. We went to a petrol station and this cop talked to Mom and she thought I called them. Then Dad took me to this place called Connections, which I thought was a restaurant. I remembered people saying that it had a strict dress code and I said that I wasn't going to get in. Michael Cera was at the other end of the place with a friend, who was underage. They said something, but I can't read what it says apart from a small section which says ""dress as a girl"". They left. Michael Cera came back with a fancy towel thing and chains and jewelry on his neck. He was then with Ezra and this other guy with a towel around him. The guy checking ID's and such was watching them and so they decided to go in together. The guy let me in without checking my ID. I thought it was weird. There was a young girl with Calvin and they turned her away. Inside there were arcade games everywhere. There were tarot card ones, Pokemon ones, slots etc. When time ran out, the screen showed a cabin and everyone would get in and a bear would come. There was a drawing on an air hockey table, which included a tall gargoyle? Someone had to write ""be a [something that looks like writer] "", but it wasn't neat writing."
"2927"	"(2009-07-15 (18)) I was talking to some girl about music and movies (etc). They mentioned a song by someone and they pointed to a picture of them, but then it was weird they like, kissed me, but it was the picture. I was like 'what the hell?!'. The picture was of Sam Rockwell. They said to check out a song called ""Touch Light"" or something. I said ""I like him as an actor, so I'll check it out""."
"2928"	"(2009-07-15 (18)) I had stayed at dads. Mom and I were driving back home late at night. I noticed that this lot of woods was burnt and I realized there had been a huge fire. I was like ""Oh my God, oh my God!"". We saw that Mom's house was fine and I was like 'thank God, I didn't want to have to lose the only other thing I care about [my computer] ' and I thought about Tigger. It was really dark and once we got out of the car, it was pitch black. We heard a noise across the road. I ran up to the door quietly, and we could hear someone coming. I told Mom to get the keys and open the door. This guy came and I threw a plant pot at him. It was a small cactus, but it was heavy. I got a container with water and he snuck past me and I poured it over him and smashed him over the head with it. He fell and I got a broomstick pole and stabbed him in the eye, the ear, then whacked him and stabbed him in the chest (he was now dead). Then I went inside to go back to my computer."
"2929"	"(2009-07-17 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft, although sometimes it was my test. There was a movie or something and there was a guy with two kids. One of them was a 5/6 year old boy with a French accent. I thought it didn't sound real. They were in the car driving. They went to some place and they wandered off. Then I was with Dad and Ezra. The material my pants were made out of made Ezra sneeze and he was telling me to take them off and take them far away. I went inside somewhere and people from Arrested Development were there. Alia Shawkat screamed. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman were also there. Jason Bateman came over to where I was to a camera and video player thing. I was recording. I went outside for [something I can't read, but it looks like pant) and something about a deer. Then the French people were chasing a cat [something I can't read, looks like 'go missing'] . There was some insect on this thing and he said it meant this girl had taken Mom and I for a drive? Something screwed the road up and it made us ""drift"" and slide all over the road. There was a guy with Pokemon cards. I thought about buying some. I managed to get to the 'end' -- it was World of Warcraft again. There was a Pokemon like Celebi. I went up a hill. I had to fight it to get this girl back."
"2930"	"(2009-07-18 (18)) I was staying somewhere and so was Eugene. We had been there for a few days and we were sort of friendly. I was packing up, as I was leaving, and Nips are Getting Bigger was playing, and then Don't Tell Me Now. Eugene was playfully kicking things at me. He handed me a pair of socks and our fingers touched. Then we were at Nana's and they were locking up the door to the hallway and the dining room. I had to go into the hall, then go to the dining room and lock it, but it didn't lock and the alarm went off. Mom and Darren were outside on the rocks. I asked for help and they were like 'we don't know what to do'. There was this waterfall slide which I went down but I didn't take a big enough breath. Calvin was in the water. I was then on World of Warcraft. Eugene was alliance and Calvin was a gnome. We were on a quest or something and we had to go to the 'reproductive system' (doing it in Human Biology at the moment), from the stomach to the female parts. Dennis and Charlie (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were wearing robes. Charlie was a small gnome. They fit in, but Dennis stood out a bit. Once a year for a 'week', Dennis slowed down and it only lasted like five minutes though and then he was back to normal again. I was trying to remember who were best friends, whether it was Dennis and Charlie or Charlie and Mac (in real life)."
"2931"	"(2009-07-18 (18)) Ezra and I went to this place at university, which was different. It was this hairdressing section which was huge. They had a little shop there too. I was going to buy snacks. There were huge shelves and I was looking at magazines on them, looking at the hair styles. There was a picture of Catherine Zeta-Jones. I was then at home. Ezra was in his room on a computer and I was in my room on the laptop. My roller shutters were open. I can't remember what was going on, but some people were being dodgy. I walked back to my room and I saw a dark dude walking towards the house. I called Mom and told her to come now. I said we were hungry and I squealed that someone was coming. I went to tell Ezra. I went back to my room and he was in the house. I ran to the family room and I was trying to find weapons. Then there were three white guys and a black guy. I stabbed the black guy in the head (there's something else written here that I can't read). I got a lighter and set one of them on fire in the bathroom. I closed the door. They tried to get the door and I hit them with a wrench or something. They stopped the fire and were ok. I got them outside and they came through the window, it showed us at the bathroom door and they stretched (like that episode in The X-Files). I thought it was gay. It took a long time too. Some time before, one of the guys went into a cupboard thing. He opened the door and sunlight came in and he burned. I was thinking 'why not do the Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) thing and put something over you'. He was actually on the roof of a building. He went to the edge and jumped. His skin was red and burnt. He landed on his feet on the ground and was ok. Then he went to the hairdresser place because there was a girl there he liked and she let him in do something. There's something I can't read and then someone said ""Damn it! Sam and Dean!"" and I think 'what would they do in Supernatural?'"
"2932"	"(2009-07-19 (18)) I was at the train station, which was different. I got distracted and the train left. The next one came and I had to tag on at the front of it, but I forgot my bag. I put it on my back and the doors were closing, but I managed to slip in. It was like a bus inside. I took a photo of this black guy, who I knew, because he had been in a dream. The next thing is hard to read but it looks like it says that everyone stopped (or got on, I'm not sure) at a mountain and they hugged and greeted this model. I was then at home. Mom and Darren were there and I asked them something that I can't read. Darren said 'oh I'd probably evaporate'. I was worried about cops? Then I was back on the train, which was now like a tram. This guy started talking to me, so I stopped my iPod. I still couldn't hear him properly, and I had to keep asking him to repeat it. My ears the unblocked and he repeated what he said which was like 'storm draft' or something. I asked what it meant and it was something to do with people fighting in the war. I said ""who the hell would do that?"" but then they were getting everyone off the train because no-one had volunteered, they were taking all of us. Mom was in now charge, although it wasn't her. I asked her why she picked me. Ezra was also there. There was an airborne disease and they gave us the vaccine and I said something I can't read and 'it's only temporary'. Outside it was snowy. We passed this sign saying 'Obsession' and then I felt tired. Everyone fell asleep. When I woke up it had only been like two seconds. Ezra and I escaped and started running. There were lots of mountains and things. The road was foggy and there were lots of cars, so we waited and then continued running. I had a quest on World of Warcraft to hand in nearby, so I went and did that. Then we were a young brother and sister. They wanted to go home and sleep so they could 'play at the beach' tomorrow. I said 'with the seaweed' and I said that I hated the beach because ""you get sand in your pants and attacked by seaweed"" and also mentioned sunburn and that I hadn't been to the beach in ten years. They then hid in a house in a cupboard and fell asleep. When they woke up, the doors of the cupboard opened and these alien/insect hands reached out to the girl and she screamed. Then it showed the kids and they had been transformed into them (it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, when you go to sleep and you turn into them, except they actually transformed into an alien). I was thinking that the vaccine was a waste of time. Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was now the leader. Sometimes it wasn't, but she was very serious and this guy spoke through a shield. Then it was a movie with Kristen Stewart. The reviews said it was ok but it mentioned 'Cullen'. It also had something to do with ""Brave New World by Aldous Huxley""."
"2933"	"(2009-07-19 (18)) This dream seemed to carry on from the last one. I was on the run from some people. I had to go back to the place where they were. I got inside but then this girl saw me and she went to tell the leader. I was then with Dad. I went into the stairwell and ran up. I got out at a balcony thing and there was a guy working on there. I ran across and went into this other stairwell place and ran down. I had a gun and I shot this girl in the head. I ran out of the building and there were people outside and I was trapped. They were getting people onto a bus. I saw a lady getting into a car across the road and I ran towards her. I pulled her out and drove off. It was then like a motorbike and then a mount on World of Warcraft. I went far away and through a bush and then there were houses, but I kept going even further. I ended up in this new neighbourhood, with houses, but no people lived there yet. There were two guys looking at houses. I think I helped them with money for a house. I ended up getting a house and changed my name to Izzy Lynch (referencing David Lynch). I 'still' did veterinary science. One day, which was the 16 July, I had planned to meet Dad. I was listening to Save Your Kisses For Me. Then it was the day to meet Dad. I didn't remember anything since the 6 July. I talked to my teacher and I had missed heaps of work. I said I didn't remember anything. I then went to see Dad and there was a turtle. Dad was saying that they looked younger as they aged and I said ""Hey Mr Turtle!"". At some point Mom and I were in a car and it looks like it says 'the sun was hitting' (or possibly gun, or something else) back slightly. Then it was a movie and this girl was now an old lady in a bed. They sent her back to her time. Then it was a sequel. I can't remember it properly, but this boy was in a baby seat. This guy got him out. He got a pair of scissors and cut the kids throat. Then it was in a room and the kid was lying dead on the floor covered in blood. His sister and mother came in and I think he killed the girl and I was like 'ook...'. I was telling Dad that the sequel was cool too."
"2934"	"(2009-07-20 (18)) Someone in a van took me to dads house, but it wasn't (it looked like it, but I didn't recognize it) and gave me an envelope to give to this person and they told me to say ""Hello I'm Sam and I need to retract this envelope from you"". The person was Jared Padalecki, although I didn't recognize him. I opened it and there was a charge of $2 and a cancel of a credit card. He was going to email them to find out who they were. Mom had a small car. It was squishy and they also had to sell a heap of their stuff?"
"2935"	"(2009-07-21 (18)) I was at university in Communications and I had Ms Ingram as my teacher again. I saw Evelyn in the class and we sat together. I had been away yesterday and was copying her notes. I also had to do a before and after picture and my ex was one? This girl was upset because her parents wouldn't let her watch TV or anything. I can't read what it says properly, but it says we dreamt about something. I also was talking about movies at one point and I said that ""I hate happy endings"". Someone asked me about Lord of the Rings and I said that I liked the first two and they asked what Gollum's name was and I said ""Frodo, I mean Gollum"". At the end of the lesson, I still had more to do but finished it at home later. The next day the teacher complained because I hadn't signed it and they couldn't accept the work and was saying that I didn't work hard enough. I got upset and angry and said ""Screw you!"" and left. I picked up a bin and threw it and it hit two cars. This guy who owned one of the cars came after me trying to bash me. I ran. I think it says the guy was driving my car and the seat was far over. Then I was leaving the university. I had to take this other car and it reminded me of Stuck in the Middle With You. I got in the car and locked the door and then there was a person at my window with a gun and said ""Say hello to my little friend!"". I drove off. I text Mom saying that I was on my way and Ezra replied saying he didn't know what she was doing. I drove back to my car? I ended up in a room which had an elevator at the front and there were other people there. The elevator kept moving and didn't have some sides so that it would match up with other rooms. Some people were using it to slide out, but we were too worried as it moved fast. It started breaking through walls and it made a crack sound and then the dream went weird. 'It' was teaching me things. There were dots on a world map and it would 'fly' to them and explain different things. There was a 'forensic science' and a 'geography' one. There was something about the tide and it caused the sea to produce corn (on the cob). It showed lots of corn lying on the beach. I threw one. The voice went silent. I was then on a street and there was a milk carton on there so I grabbed it. The voice said ""a rurie is a thing and a Grurie is a thing you really like"". I saw something come flying down the street and it looked like the Grurie from a dream I had ages ago. I freaked out and splashed milk on it as it flew past. It came up with a notice like on World of Warcraft, saying that I had a request. It came back and it went to drink the milk and I said it poisonous and something about where it was from and traps? It left and I was telling Ezra later and I said that the dream I'd had was the freakiest thing and scarred me for years. I assumed the guy from the car was the Grurie in disguise."
"2936"	"(2009-07-21 (18)) I was driving with Mom. I was talking and then asked where we were going and she said 'you know where' and I said that I didn't. She was going to Dad's new place. We went in and he had moved in already and it was different from the pictures. Dad asked me how I liked it and I was like 'eh'. I asked where I was supposed to put all my stuff and he started going on about how I could ""ship it back to the US"". Mom had some pencils which had recordings from some young boy called Christopher who had played with snow. I cried and yelled at Dad saying 'what about my stuff, what if I want to live here' etc and that I loved the old house. I saw Tigger and gave her a pat. Mittens was in a cupboard in the kitchen. Ezra said that he liked the new place. I realized I was late for school and said to hurry, but nobody did so I didn't bother going."
"2937"	"(2009-07-22 (18)) I was at home and it was different. I was playing Sims 3 or a similar game, and the babies died of starvation and were skinny and creepy. There was also a movie playing, which I had seen before and had Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It was called 'Me and You' or something. His nose got broken and it looked weird. When I went to bed, I put a Nurofen and a drug tablet that I took in a sealed bag. The next morning, Mom saw it and tried to look, but I took it and hid it. Her and Darren then started looking everywhere for it. I went out the back, jumped a small fence (there was a small sand strip and then a big fence). I buried it in a small hole. She then drove me to university and dropped me off at this shop, which was connected to the train station. There were jetties and water, and it was hard to drive across the water. I went into the shop and it was hard to find the train station. I ended up finding a black room which had a curtain you had to walk through. There was a girl and we sat together in this cinema. They were going to play a movie which I'd seen. Then it was Bruno. The train would take 96 minutes to get wherever I was going. I asked the driver if he could stop. He did at the lights (the train was on the road). There were a few bus stops, but I didn't recognize any of the numbers and had no idea where to go. I called Mom and started crying that I was late for class now (it was Wednesday by the way). I managed to get back home. I had decided to take the drug to university to get rid of it. I took it out of the hole and put it in some water. I had some soap/meat flashcards and they got wet and erased. Mom saw me and was curious about what I was doing. I was then out the front and she started going through my bag and pulled out a lot of Lite Mars Bar wrappers. I got angry and upset and yelled at her. The next door neighbour was running by and stopped and looked in the window and I said ""who the hell are you?"" and he laughed. I had the drug in my green jumper. She said she would call the police to search me when I got to the train station. It fell out of my jumper and I stepped on it and I said that I put Nurofen in the bags and when I woke up it was still Nurofen. I took it and threw it in the bin. I can't read the next bit but then it says that I didn't want to be accused."
"2938"	"(2009-07-23 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was in the water and killing stuff for some paper, I had 4/6. There was a player named Eugene and he was a low level. It turned out it was actually Eugene. On Facebook he had been helping someone from last year fix their computer. I thought the way he was explaining stuff was cute. He left notes at the bottom of this lake (on Warcraft). I went down and read them and they said 'Izzy, stop reading/following me' etc. One said ""I know that you love me..."" and ""give up"" etc. I crossed the love out and put 'hate' and did similar things with the others. Then Cuddles, Simba and Gizmo were in the water and I killed them and they respawned. Eugene and I ended up talking and hanging out for the rest of the day. Someone made these cake things. They were filled with cream and covered with chocolate, but the cream was actually on the outside. They were nice. Steve Buscemi was at Nana's. I gave him a cake and when I came back later he had killed himself, after finishing a movie. Anyway, I made a Murloc sound at Eugene and he laughed and did it back. Then we were at school and we took the same class. One of them was in a pool. I was asking him questions about Warcraft, he was level 17, but he had started again. He asked me how I got home and I said that I took the train and he came with me. I didn't know what the people there were talking about and left. I went to the shop. Mom told me to get something and then she got it. I was complaining to Nana about the new house. Nana had a box of blocks that I used to like. I saw Poppers, Granny and Aunt Sally outside. Uncle Wilbur said someone didn't want to see me. I was then outside walking up to the back door and Johnny Depp was walking past and I said ""hello"" and he said ""Hi Izzy"" and I asked ""How are you?"" and he said ""Good, how are you?"" and I said ""Sensational"". As I was walking up the ramp, he said ""Bye Izzy""."
"2939"	"(2009-07-24 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. Some Horde guy owned this Alliance guy in an elevator thing. I think I was swimming on there for a bit too."
"2940"	"(2009-07-25 (18)) I was watching a movie. A boy and his parents were at their house. They looked out the window to see a huge dinosaur/monster in the distance. The husband was a scientist or something, so he sent his son and wife away and said to contact some guy if they needed to. They ran, but didn't take their car as they thought it would ""be easier to see"". The monster was just flattening buildings. Then I was there and as I ran, I looked back and saw it flatten their house and I told the wife. They ran into an underground section of a building. There were a few others there and it was pitch black. They ran upstairs and I followed and said we should stay underground. We ran up a few floors and it was a shop, and it was circular, the shops were around the outer edge and the middle just had escalators and the like. I repeated that we should go back underground and then there was a scream and it was in the building. There were some elevators, but they only fit 1-2 people in them and they were a cylindrical tube and teleported. They were also randomly distributed. I was with Farrah and Charlene and we were trying to find one. We ran into a small shop and we all managed to get in. It started shaking (as the monster was coming closer) and then we were teleported up a few floors. We ran and got to the top floor. There was a room and it had a TV, shelves, lounges and piles of books. Calvin was there now, along with quite a few others. I said that we had to find somewhere to hide. I took a window off and there was a small balcony going right around the room. There was stuff piled up in front of the windows, enough for us to sit behind. I was telling them to sit behind those areas and to be quick and to not move when they got there. They didn't really listen to me and some were painting this small wood section of the wall black, from white. Then we realized the monster was coming and everyone got into place. One girl was in some oxygen thing and was floating in the fish tank. Calvin was lying on this wood railing that was joined to the balcony and dipped down a little and I said that it was a good idea and I went on there too, but then I realized I couldn't see the room now and it was uncomfortable but it was too late to move. I thought I was going to fall. Then the monster came and it stuck its head out of the window and it didn't see us, but kept looking back out. I realized it must be able to smell us."
"2941"	"(2009-07-25 (18)) Ezra and I got a kitten each. His was weird and was a girl. We could put them in this water and they would be ok. I was trying to think of a name for mine. I thought of Dean, but remembered that's what I wanted to call my dog, then David to reference David Lynch and Michael C. Hall's character in Six Feet Under, and Darren to reference John Lennon but couldn't use that since we already had a Darren in the house."
"2942"	"(2009-07-26 (18)) We got into the car and Mom and Darren were in the front with Ezra in the middle of them and Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were in the back with me. Darren called my phone and I'm Henry VIII started playing. I complained about being squished in the back. Also, at some point we went to pet shop and it was late. We knocked on the window and they let us in. They had ugly dogs. We were asking for help with some weird pet. Later, I was at a party with Jensen. We left (it was late and dark) and we both fell over on the path. He told me to go ahead to the car. I walked down the path and there were some others too, but then I was by myself. It was spooky. There was a fence right next to the path and I looked over it and I saw Jensen getting taken into an ambulance. I went to the carpark and I somehow got into a fight with this guy. He got into his car and I pretended my car was a different car and he slammed into it and then parked to get out. I got into my car, quickly put the keys in the ignition and reversed out. He realized and reversed back out. He missed me and I drove part, driving fast and crazy to get away from him. I got home (or somewhere). We had a shop and I saw that it was messy. I unlocked it and there was a note from the guy and a cake with powder/flour to make it messy."
"2943"	"(2009-07-26 (18)) I can't remember properly, but it was like the movie 'They Live'. This lady with short black hair was on TV and her name was Anita Noo. They were taking aliens everywhere. Her voice kept going alien like. She was saying stuff like 'pretend', 'don't answer to your home (?)' and something about the number 31076. They said they were coming tomorrow and insisting that we couldn't live without them."
"2944"	"(2009-07-27 (18)) Eugene and I were friends. He was on a computer next to me. We were talking on MSN. His number was in my phone, but it was at the bottom. Calvin was looking through it and found it and laughed."
"2945"	"(2009-07-27 (18)) I was standing in the dining room at Mom's, watching TV. The second Twilight movie was on, and we watched it for an hour, but all they did was sing and it had nothing to do with Twilight. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were in it. But then Kristen Stewart was Leighton Meester but she looked really gross and Mom and Darren said that she was really ugly. I realized that it was a preview. I was telling Mom that the books were addictive, but the movies suck. Dad picked Ezra up to go somewhere. It was raining and really late. In the morning, Mom took me to university as she was taking Ezra to something up that way. She dropped me off at the train station and said she would get me in a second. Then it was World of Warcraft and I was waiting at the edge of the platform. This level 10 called [what looks like Thedd, but it's messy] was getting attacked by Murlocs and crabs. I killed them. It was nearly time for my class to start, so I called Mom and she said something I can't read, but it was on Facebook and there was something about a movie and I assumed it was a bug. My car was now there and I drove it to the other side and hit the wall. The guy next to me gave me the key to his car and took mine. I tried to get in the back. I think it says 'quick fingers'. I was then at Nana's at the table and there was a $10 Royal Show thing. There was something about long hair and a joke about something I can't read."
"2946"	"(2009-07-29 (18)) I was playing Scrabble with Mom and Ezra. Ezra had his turn and got 75 points, but then I looked at what he did and he had done a word connecting other words, but half of the words he had made weren't actually words. I kept having too many letters in my rack. Some band came on that I liked and they started with a 'T', but I couldn't remember who they were. It took like 1-2 hours to get to the place we were going to."
"2947"	"(2009-07-29 (18)) I was in Human Bio, but it was different. Felipe was in front of me and Aliyah was next to me. I was in the third row (there were five rows). At the end of the class, Felipe said he wanted to ask Aliyah to a dance but couldn't afford a dancer. Then he said instead of asking the 'pretty girls', he should ask the ugly ones. I thought 'here we go' and he said ""Hello"", obviously pretending to ask me (and he was being mean, not joking). We got given a new experiment, at first it was already filled out but then it was new. I started going on about everyone being shallow, but he just walked off. Aliyah waited for me in the hall outside and we walked together. She went into a room and then two people were talking. She went behind this bookshelf (which was sticking out in the middle of the room, and there was a hidden space behind it). She sat in this thing in front of the wall and there was a hole behind it. It was small and she went through it as a shortcut out. There was no way I could fit, so I left and went out the front door (the place was like a mansion). There were thin wires all over the lawn (which was huge) and so I was jumping over them. Then there was garden bed and I crawled through it to the path. I realized I had forgotten my shoes. I had to cross the road for the bus and I was thinking I should call Mom to get me."
"2948"	"(2009-07-29 (18)) I was at university. It was Tuesday and I had chemistry but I forgot my lab coat. I was annoyed about it. I needed to get changed and wandered into a building, which was like a house. There was a young girl in there and she had a Furby and I was like 'I remember when they first came out'. We chatted for a bit and then I left. I went into my class, but it was full of random students. Then I needed to go to the toilet and someone showed me where one was. There was a huge queue, which had girls and boys, but then there was a fork where it separated into separate toilets. I finally got in and it was a huge room with toilets everywhere and no cubicles. There was a cubicle one but it had a weird spray of water about head level. Some boys came in and attacked this girl. They threatened me and I was like 'what the hell, I don't even know who you are'. They tried to attack me and I tried to punch but it was slow and difficult."
"2949"	"(2009-07-30 (18)) I was at university in class talking to Jakob and some others about our marks, hopeful TER and failing last year. Later, I was talking to Samantha and she was in the last year of her course. I asked her how many hours a week she did and she said she did 15 yesterday and I was like 'what?!'. I complained saying that it takes me an hour to get there and that I have to get up at 6am when I start at 8.30, which was three times a week and that if I had a 15 hour day, I wouldn't get home until like 1.30am. I was then in a room and there was a riddle on the board -- the waiter had [something I can't read, looks like 'moar'] and we figured it meant a plate. I was then watching Thank God You're Here and Hamish Blake and some guy were on a bush walk and they stroked this horse's penis to find out where they were, which everyone found funny. A friend of Mom's had written her a letter saying that was praying for me to do well. He was at war or something."
"2950"	"(2009-07-30 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft, but it was real. I can't remember properly, but I was in village, hiding behind walls and trying to find a way past (I had to run in between buildings to leave). I realized that I was friendly with them and neutral with some others, so I just walked in. I went into a house and a dog started to growl, so I got a broom, which had a long, yellow feathered end and a short pole. I don't know what happened, but I was then in a forest running."
"2951"	"(2009-07-31 (18)) I was at the old house in my room. Cuddles, Gizmo and some other cats kept coming into my room, then Ezra's. I went into his room and he had all these old shirts in a rack from Brookland and they all had a patch of bright colour on them, there was a blue one and a green one (that I remember). I took one off to look at it and then put it back on. Ezra woke up and I said that a cat had knocked it down."
"2952"	"(2009-08-01 (18)) Autumn joined the MUPC. We were in human biology together. People were complaining about Ms Edmundson being a bad teacher. I was talking to Autumn as we were leaving and I asked how she got here and she came on this huge truck thing with like a water tank and wheels like a tank. It would suck stuff closer to it. I said that I took the bus, but she offered to drive me back. I was unsure about the truck, but agreed anyway. I text Mom to say I was getting a ride. We also discussed failing last year."
"2953"	"(2009-08-01 (18)) I was with Eugene and he was wanted by the cops. I can't remember what happened but they saw us and chased us. As we ran, we were holding hands. He tried to boost me a few times, but mostly we ran at the same speed. He said we should split up at one point and meet up at another, but I misunderstood and split up now. He ran through a corridor and I kept going on the other side and I could see him through a sheet of glass between us. We ran into a cinema and sat down. I said we shouldn't sit together, but it was too late to move. A cop came in. I had lipstick so I put some on so that I would look different but because I didn't know how to use it I was worried I would get it on my face. The cop was asking people questions. She sat behind us and started asking me stuff. I spoke in a girly voice (softer, higher pitch) and she asked if I liked ""Platinum in Lancaster"". I was like ""what's that?"", but it actually had something to do with whatever Eugene was involved in. It had something to do with getting possessed. At the end of the questions she gave me a chocolate. There was a True Blood ad with a dog in the kitchen at it ate some Pez. I was like 'I'm sick of seeing this show and what does Pez have to do with anything?'. I said this because I wanted the cop to think that I hated vampires. Someone said that someone was putting dead bodies in the Pez (in reply to what it had to do with True Blood). Then there was a fire announcement and we were told to leave. I got up and Eugene wanted us to separate (as they were looking for a couple), but I said that the cop lady already thinks we're together and we'd probably look more suspicious if we were apart. We put an arm around each other. I was a little bit taller than him. There were two exits and people were crowded around each of them. We left and then realized nobody else was outside and it was a trap for us. It was pitch black outside and we quietly moved to the edge. Some cops came out and were asking each other where we were and they started searching for us but said they couldn't see anything and to bring a torch. They came back and were shining the torch around, they turned around and as the light hit Eugene, he ran (it was only him, I had already run off). They caught him though. I was hiding in a garden. I got up and ran. Some cops were searching nearby and saw me and started chasing me. I ran around a corner and there was a lady with a red car, and she was doing something in the boot. Her son (maybe five years old) was tied up like a cocoon to the top of the boot. I jumped in the boot and was like 'please ssh, I won't hurt you'. She started to cry (she was sobbing and there were tears). The cops asked her where I was and she said I ran ""up there"" and pointed up the street. When they were gone I got out and I asked if she could drive me somewhere and she agreed. I lied down in the back of the car and said if anyone asked, I was her daughter. There were police lights coming up behind us and I said to keep going and then pull over. She opened the boot for some reason and the cop saw the kid and told her to get out. I figured they would take her, so I took off with the car."
"2954"	"(2009-08-02 (18)) Darren went to some place that was like a party but it was brothel like. He had sex with this young girl, who someone said later was only 10. He got worried and tried to find out some information, but then it looked like she was only 8. He tried to talk to her and she cried and acted like he did something wrong. Later, I was at this place which had lots of storeys. It was just a square building with water in the middle and ramps around the edge. There was a party or something going on. There was music playing and I heard Talking Loud and Clear playing. There was a room to the side which was like a classroom. Andy McCluskey was in there at the front sitting by himself. There had been some voting thing for bands and people had voted for their favourite songs and the bands for each were tallied. Andy won with 1003 votes. No-one clapped or did anything, so I clapped and said ""Well screw all of you!"" and Andy was like ""thanks"". There was this huge eel like monster in the water. It had tentacles that were like 15 feet long and they were flat. I managed to tie two of them up around a pillar."
"2955"	"(2009-08-02 (18)) We were at Mom's old house, which was totally different. We still had all our stuff there but had only just moved back in. It had like 4 storeys and only had stuff on one side (it was nothing in the middle, stairs on the edge and then a big platform at the back). The roof had a bit you could sit on. My mobile phone was really old and was the size of an old video camera. This lady was checking through it. Mom showed me some undies with Mewtwo on them. Ezra said ""I'm 22"" and that ""we're too old for that"". At the Hop was playing and I was tapping my leg along to it."
"2956"	"(2009-08-03 (18)) I was at the shop with Mom. We went there for something but then something I can't read but looks like 'tram' turned green. Something I can't read, but looks like 'CH quest for bar for blue' and something about $45. Some guy asked ""why"" and I said ""because we want blue check thingies"". This guy with a motorbike smashed something. We left and Mom's car was getting broken into. I called to Mom but then we realized it was the wrong car. It was night. We couldn't remember where we parked and there was another entrance at the shop (it was at Midvale). This car followed us as we walked around the carpark to the other entrance. This girl got out with a gun and we just kept walking. Mom unlocked the doors. The lady shot and took Mom, but I got in the car and drove off. I yelled out to this girl to call the police. I drove up the road where they were rebuilding the bar and then I went back. The people were leaving and Mom was walking alone and her hair was messy and started walking down the street. Later, there was some big building with lots of others and it was like a movie or something. This guy there had a French name but his real name was Jake Oriente. He was standing next to me and I thought that he liked me. He put his arm around me. Then it was a movie and everyone there took their clothes off, me included. This kid got an erection (like 8 years old or so) and this other guy bent him over and started having sex with him and complained about his poo. Everyone watched in disgust. This other movie that Jake was in, these girls saw maggots everywhere and spoke weird. Then they would start to bleed and then they would die."
"2957"	"(2009-08-04 (18)) Ezra, Dad and I were staying at Nana's. There were photos there from something where Samantha, Calvin and Silas had come back there after something. One of them we were sitting at a table and we looked like we were 4-5 years old, though we were actually 12. Anyway, Ezra and Dad had gone outside and I decided to check the time and it was 1.43am. It was still light outside and they were at the back door and came in. We were annoyed that Nana and that were going to wake up soon and wake us (from the kettle etc). Later I was at Mom's and Ezra had a heap of friends over. They were playing games such as soccer. They threw the ball to Ezra and he kicked it. I remember seeing Leroy and Brantley there. I went to bed early. When I woke up it was 11.26am. It only showed 'J' which was a code for 11. I was annoyed because I had missed my lab and I woke Mom, who was sleeping outside and she just fell back asleep. She got up when I asked when we were leaving for the awards ceremony. There was a scoreboard and I had 7 points in a bunch of stuff because they were using me as a placeholder or something. There was a song in my playlist that was like 'Boy name Cry'."
"2958"	"(2009-08-05 (18)) I was watching Entourage and this thin secretary lady was standing between Ari's legs. Mom came in and I explained the situation because he wasn't cheating. Vince was also talking to some people. In real life, Clark Kent (Smallville), Ezra and I were friends. There was this living 'virus' thing which looked like a seahorse. It could talk, or something. Ezra was really smart and did these calculations of how potato, wheat etc production would increase with the virus. There were pictures of it too. The virus was hanging out in the water. These people were after Clark. I wondered where Lex and Tess (both from Smallville) were and then I remembered that Lex was gone and Tess was dead. The people found us at the lake thing where the virus was and they were looking for it. I jumped into the water before they saw us to try and catch it but I had to come up for air. It wanted to bite me -- which would make you into an autotroph. They got Clark with it or something else and he couldn't use his powers for a few minutes. I don't know what happened but then Clark and I were on a bus. Chloe (Smallville) was also there at one point and she said ""shit"" and I was shocked that they allowed swearing. The bus was full of people. I'm not sure what was happening, but I realized that the bad guys were after us. I told the bus driver what to do to get away and he did it straight away. He stopped because the bus in front of us stopped. People got off and I did and there were dead bodies piled up like hay. The door on the bus closed, due to powers that the bad guys had. I tried to get back on, and the bad people were coming back but I couldn't open the doors. Clark ripped the doors open and helped me on, then fixed the doors. We drove off and there were two other buses, one with good guys and the other with bad guys. I think there was a mutation. I got off the bus again at one point and was walking ahead to test the ground -- it was in a forest. I saw the bad guys' bus coming and I told the bus driver to go. I jumped on and held on from the outside, while it drove on and then I got in. He decided to use this whistle thing and I held on tight, but then he used this 'tear gas' and something else. The tear gas was supposed to put them to sleep and I can't remember about the other thing. I ran off the bus so I wouldn't get affected and Clark chased after me. We started feeling sleepy and all the buses had stopped (we had been driving through a school). We ended up collapsing. There was a short video of people in a house, they were mutants and only ate 'PMZ'. We woke up and went back to the bus but they wouldn't let us on because we had mutated, but they had mutated too. They let us on when they realized but they were still suspicious of us."
"2959"	"(2009-08-06 (18)) Some friend of Mom's was having a party. There was food, such as steak and noodles. I was hungry and Ezra was there and he wanted food too. I was playing a game, which was like Sims 2, but was an RPG. We were in groups and ours accidentally caused a nuclear war/explosion. There was this small safe which Rick (The Walking Dead comic) had got it for us to use, but had misjudged the size. We hid in this nuclear safe building so that we would survive. We were looking for a bank. There were zombies around too. I think we got captured at one point. Turtle and Vince (both from Entourage) and someone else went to see some people, but they were bad and chased them. I was somewhere else and they came after me and this girl I was with. I took a car, but my friend got taken. I was driving fast and fell into a lake while turning a corner. I didn't know which button to press (it was now a game), but I managed to get out and then got on a bike and rode fast down the path and I got back. Then I was back to Turtle and Vince. They were on this ramp thing that was high up and Turtle fell and then left (he was on a mount that was like a hippo). They started to follow, but then Vince stopped them and was speaking Spanish and tried to hypnotize them. He managed to calm them and pushed them off into the water. We got captured again. I was thirsty and this girl took me to a deli to look for water cartons but there was no water. This black lady zombie came in and pointed at me -- they knew who we were because they had pictures of us. These zombies came in but let us out. It was a trap and the bad guys took the girl and I drove off. There were also traps, one was these strands off cotton attached to this electricity thing and it would shock you. We all then got through. We found somewhere to stay. The girl came back and I said ""didn't you turn bad?"" and she said she was normal again. This other girl said ""oh, it's the Janitor"", and I thought she meant the Janitor from Scrubs, but it wasn't. We ended up with Eugene, Bradley and Darius. There was a video and they were made to strip. Eugene had really bony hips. He was also wearing this ring on his second finger and I was thinking 'damn it!'. They had no bites. This sporty guy was there. There was something about water contamination and salt (it's hard to read). There were Youtube videos on how to make clean water. There was also a video of young boys in a bath and I was like ""pedo vids!""."
"2960"	"(2009-08-07 (18)) I was on a bus at the university and it was waiting for people to get on. Calvin came on first and was covered in spider webs because of something that he was doing. Alejandro was also there and had to speak another language. He put his bag on the top shelf (shelves were in the bus, like on planes). My class was huge. The girl sitting next to me was Matilda. Classmate-F-20 came in and she was jumping around and did a spin and fell and people laughed. There was an interview thing on TV with Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Mom was admiring him and I was like 'yay there's information on John Winchester' and 'yay Winchester'. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were in the audience and he called them his family (jokingly)."
"2961"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) We were staying somewhere. Santiago had this expensive place. He was in a spa full of girls. He was acting weird and we thought he was going to rape some people."
"2962"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) I had gotten a job at some place and moved to a better one. This guy I was friends with moved to mine and it showed him talking to a guy behind the counter about getting a job."
"2963"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was fighting some monsters and needed a group. I was then in a shop with Mom. There were costumes there. Mom and I bought some chocolate and it was all melting. The girl behind the counter told us to go back and do something I can't read. There were pieces of paper with stuff written on them. We took them back and the girl had something to do with a special quest on World of Warcraft."
"2964"	"(2009-08-08 (18)) Some kid was acting odd and I think he was sexually abused. This other kid was acting similar. I was talking to their father with some people. I think he was a doctor. We bashed him? The police were called and the place got set on fire. They got out us out."
"2965"	"(2009-08-09 (18)) I was at home. Mom and Ezra came and Nana and Poppa crashed into a pillar in the garage. There was a box of gnomes and Ezra said it was something to do with Sims 2. The newspaper said that Eric from True Blood had ""just arrived in town"" and I thought I might go. On IMDb, someone was saying that he was hot but 'George Clooney is hoter' and suggested some black woman or Reese Witherspoon as a replacement of Sookie (True Blood). We saw Transformers 3 at the cinema. The first 40 minutes were really good and only had Shia LaBeouf doing stuff (nothing to do with robots), then Megan Fox came along and I was like 'great now it will suck'. It was night in the movie and there were bits in the Earth, that were like a raised dome made of glass and all the robots were under the Earth and were planning to come back. There was a friendly one who was now under evil control. It was started stomping around and they were bigger than normal. In the cinema, most of us ended up upside down on the chair, hanging on to them. Then it stopped. It was really awesome and it was from like a strong air for effect. I went to the toilet and bought a ticket to some gay girl movie. I couldn't get back into our cinema because I had to get the ticket off Dad. When I got in the car, my hair was messy."
"2966"	"(2009-08-10 (18)) I was watching True Blood. Sookie and Bill (who was a werewolf), were sometimes me and Eugene. We went to this patch of forest. There were some trees, flowers and a lake and it was a pretty place. This cop was there. We had a picnic blanket and we started making out on it and then had sex. I told someone that he was very violent sometimes (because he was a werewolf). Sookie was in trouble at one point and Eric came to save her -- it was during the day. I was in the car later and there was a fire. I was then in a deli and they had Lite Mars Bars for 90c. I put money in this box and started eating one. I told the guy behind the counter. I realized I left my wallet but was standing next to it but my money was gone. I asked the guy about it angrily and tipped some coins out and he insisted there was no money in it, but had taken the coins. Then some people came in and we suspected they were going to do something. They had taken my money, which was $300 and these guns that I had."
"2967"	"(2009-08-11 (18)) I had a magazine and it had a scratchie or a competition thing with it. I checked if it was a winner. I had three 8's which won me $10. I told Mom about it. Then I realized I got something else and wondered if it would still count -- it did."
"2968"	"(2009-08-12 (18)) I was watching Burn Notice. Eugene used to be a rebel and his mother asked him about his favourite item which was some telescope, because it was good for ""picking up chicks"". It showed his first meeting with Fiona. It was night and they were outside. He was on all fours and she was licking his bum and saying like ""Oh Eugene"". This other girl was at his feet making out with someone."
"2969"	"(2009-08-12 (18)) I was at a train station. I tried to tag on and something went wrong and then I didn't know whether I tagged on before or if it had worked. I asked a policeman to scan it but nothing showed up. I think it says I posted it on a forum. The train station was huge and inside. There were heaps of shops and escalators. There was a message on the forum and some girl said she was bisexual and for ages she had [done something I can't read] and that it might be the reason for something. There was a group for a plan or something but I can't read what it says. This screen said ""John Wonchomber"" but it meant Dean Winchester (Supernatural). My tag off hadn't worked. I told Mom and Darren later. I also went to university for a few hours. I was at a shop which was actually a house? I was looking for a door. Outside it was rainy looking, but hot."
"2970"	"(2009-08-12 (18)) There were zombies or like zombies, vampires and stuff or something. At first it was Torchwood. I ran to this place that was on fire. It was night. It was near a body of water.  Owen and Jack had been in the building. Owen was dead. Jack got back up. I saw something floating in the water and I thought it was Ianto. I went over and then it got up and it was this freaky pink fish thing and it started chasing me. Jack started running too and he dived in the water, so it would chase him, and I ran around. I ran through the gates to exit the property, and there were more of them outside. One was yellow. We both ran through. I don't know what happened. Then Dad, Ezra and I found this pizza shop. We were going to stay in the fridge. I had parked my car up at the front door so the passenger side was at the door. I saw people coming and I locked the door of the car and moved out. They tried to get in. We ran out the back. It was farm like. There had been a horse. Someone killed it for fun and I think there had been other people with us before but they had died. I jumped the fence and ran along the side of the road. There were a few cars. At one point, I was with Dad and someone else, I think, and it was night. Some areas were pitch black (we were outside). Some guy told us not to go on the path. We ran through this grass area which had some trees and bushes. I saw a path in the distance and there was a girl and two guys on there (it was lit up). They pushed people onto the ground and the guys would put something through their head. The girl suddenly started listening carefully and we fell to the ground so she didn't see us, but she heard us. We started to run and we jumped over this small ledge and there was a creature like Gollum (Lord of the Rings) near a campfire. She came looking for us and we hide under the ledge. This girl saw my toe sticking out and helped us."
"2971"	"(2009-08-13 (18)) I was watching a movie with Robert Downey Jr in it. First, we had gone to some restaurant thing. I was wearing my normal clothes which usually wouldn't be allowed in because they were too casual, but I was let in anyway. Mom and I were at the shop later, where the restaurant was. I couldn't get into it without at least jeans. I needed to get shoes too. Only one shop was open and it only sold girls clothes. We grabbed a pair of black sneakers and we had a look at jeans and Mom said they were gay. We tried to get into a bigger shop. Then it was the movie again. I can't remember it properly, but Robert Downey Jr had been taken by this woman. He had escaped. Then I was talking in a stairwell and I remembered them mentioning an echo and I found them. I told Mom about him going for dinner with his ""wife and son"", who were both different and his son was like 3 years old."
"2972"	"(2009-08-13 (18)) I don't remember how, but Classmate-M-16, Jakob, Leilani, Verity and I were carpooling. Classmate-M-16 was driving. It seemed to be taking a while to get there and I thought the train would be quicker. We got on the freeway and Classmate-M-16 started smoking and when he threw it out, it flew back in and I squealed. It was the day before the human biology test [which is today] and Verity mentioned that she sucked on the chemistry test and I said 'yeah but you were on holidays for two weeks'. A song came on the radio that I liked and Jakob, Classmate-M-16 and I sung along a little. Another song came on that was Feels Like the First Time and it sounded like Foreigner [note that I haven't heard the song before, but it was quite vivid] . It sounded like a cross between I Want to Know What Love Is and Hot Blooded. There was an ad that mentioned yoghurt and this guy was copying Michael Westen's (Burn Notice) voice and there was a Burn Notice competition about the yoghurt. I laughed. We got to university and we were waiting outside the class (which was different). I said I should've studied and Classmate-M-16 was like ""Izzy!"", which I took as 'you will do well anyway'. Jakob asked when I finished for the year and I said ""I'm doing the same units as you man!"". I went into class and Mr Epstein was in there and he said that calculators were allowed in the human bio exam as long as they didn't ""take up time"". Then he told us to start the test. The first question was about before a game starts and ""opposal adversary into solute silver"" and something about resolution. I put my hand up to say it was wrong."
"2973"	"(2009-08-14 (18)) I was at university in math. Ms Hayward was my teacher and she decided to make the rest of the course English and writing and drawing skills. We had to write paragraphs on how we felt about things. Then she drew a picture on the board and we had to guess who it was and draw it ourselves. The person had blonde hair and a green jumper but it was this Arab guy in the class called Peter. Later, I was at Nana's. Ezra had been there for like two weeks and hadn't showered at all. He was wearing a big blue shirt and there were patches of sweat and cockroach babies were flying around him. Dad came up and I was going back with him now and Mom was going to pick Ezra up tomorrow. Nana had food for us."
"2974"	"(2009-08-14 (18)) I was in a forest and it was like Lost. I was with some others and we wandered off. There were cabins. I went into one and someone walked past and we freaked out and ran. I got a message somehow to go to this place. I went but then it was like university and there was a huge lecture theatre and awards thing. At the bottom, Raquel and two girls were there. We sat on the floor but then Raquel found chairs for me and her."
"2975"	"(2009-08-15 (18)) I was at Nana's and she told me that she was going to Granma's for lunch ""tomorrow"". I said I wasn't and said that she didn't remember what food I didn't eat, as examples I used pumpkin and the salty gravy she made. I had a pedometer that said something I can't read. 24 was on the TV, then it was Heroes and there were lots of episodes on in a row up to episode 30. Robert Downey Jr was in the last few episodes. He was also in a music video with some girls. There was an Iron Man 2 thing and I said ""oh, I've managed to not think about it for like 5 hours!"". Also, I was watching a movie with Dad and Ezra and they asked for a big screen. There was something about Sin City 2. I was in a building where they got everything ready for the movie (Iron Man 2). I pressed a button and then it was part of the movie and I was disguised as Robert Downey Jr. This lady came and she talked to me and gave me an ID to use. The name was 'Rupert Sphincter' and there was information about 'him' too and he had a wife. This bad guy took it before I could read it all and asked me what my full name was. A friend of mine took it back. We went for a walk and I saw a cat. I was about to squeal ""Gizmo!"" but realized that would give it away and just said ""a cat"" instead and I gave it a pat. I was then at Nana's again and we watched this gay game show. Then it was Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Anya, character I didn't like and Willow were talking. Someone complained about cushions and Willow kept saying ""Oh I hate cushions"" and everyone else was like 'they're cool'."
"2976"	"(2009-08-15 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were in an outside area, like a park, but there was a path and everything else was bushy. We were at a table. We were meeting some bad guys. It was Tricia Helfer. There was good waiting for us and I was eating some. Another time we were waiting, we had a food fight and when she came there was no food left for her. Sometimes it was a guy that came. I gave them some of my cake. Another time, Mom told me to go chill for a bit. I had a skateboard/bike thing and a rode it up the path, up a hill. I was thinking maybe there was a car waiting (incase we tried to escape) but there wasn't, so I left, but then I saw one coming. It started coming down the path and trying to run me over. I got back to the table and Mom realized what was happening. We ended up in a car with me and Mom in the front and Tricia Helfer driving. I thought she was going to jump out and I told Mom to be ready to close the door if she did and then she did. I was driving the car and then handed it over to Mom and we were getting chased through the traffic. Then me, Ezra and Jayson ended up on a bus. It was really old and full and had compartments with doors inside. We pressed the button to get off at the next stop but it went past it. I yelled out ""excuse me, you missed our stop!"". He missed the next one too and said that he was picking up 'Cassandra'. We got to a house and it was Alia Shawkat but she was older and pretty. We got off at Northtown and I text Mom to meet us at ""Brumby's"". We waited near the bottle shop. There were pictures on a wall of us and one's of Darius and Eugene. Mom said that Dad's house needed to be vacated."
"2977"	"(2009-08-16 (18)) I was staying at some house which was near a huge forest with skinny trees. I went down to the beach (through the forest). Some guy had made this chart where if someone preferred 'choice A', they would always choose 'choice B'. There were pictures of females and I was picking the most attractive one out of each lot and they mostly corresponded to the chart. Anyway, I ended up walking/swimming down the beach and was near a cemetery. It was far away from the house. I was walking back and I had no signal on my phone so I couldn't call Mom to get me. I finally got back and Darren said there was ham, but they both called it something else at first and I laughed. There was a really tall building and lights from it reflected into the water to the sky and it looked pretty. I told Ezra that Mom called Supernatural stupid and said that it was the ""first episode of season 2 when they had the car crash and the Reaper is trying to rape Dean and their father dies"". He was like 'aw now I feel like watching it'. I was talking to Alejandro at one point and he was talking about his passport expiring and I said I applied for one and that the furthest I'd been was the other side of the country. I was thinking that I should get him to fill out the information for the witness thing. He was talking in another language."
"2978"	"(2009-08-17 (18)) These people were all writing a story. They were in a shop and it showed the path of writing. It all ended up with what looks like 'TeOkde' which meant people needed something and they'd die. I told Mom and Darren."
"2979"	"(2009-08-17 (18)) There were these photos from a holiday with Dad and others. There was one with us on this floating ledge. I was there later and I saw this guy over there and he was floating and then I realized it was Michael Shanks' character from Burn Notice and he called out 'how'd you get a caravan?' and there was something about a time traveler. I called out something but I forgot his name and trailed off with ""your mother"". Mom made fun of it. Some time later the photo of the floating ledge looked fake and I said ""it was quite photoshopped""."
"2980"	"(2009-08-19 (18)) Dad and I were in the car. He was picking up a friend. He came out exactly on time. I was watching Burn Notice and Michael and Fiona had a fight and she had some necklace that one gave the other to say that they would never be apart. She had thrown it in the ocean and she was looking for it. The 'camera' showed it in the water behind her, drifting away. As she was walking away she saw it and I was like 'pfft lame'. Eugene and I were then at 'university' and Michael (Burn Notice) had been captured and was being tortured. They said they were getting a ""shrew to give you a heart transplant"". They put it on his chest and it started burrowing in. We were trying to save him. There were some Arrested Development posters. One had Tobias in bed with a bandage on his head and everyone standing around. One had Gob on the left of the others, laughing and one with someone patting Michael's (Arrested Development) head. Anyway, I was putting these coin like things into piles in a test tube rack looking thing. Eugene was trying to find a way of getting in. Fiona went to some old guy and this machine made her temporarily looking like him. The people there had lots of kids. Eugene was disguised as Michael Jackson. Then Fiona as the old guy was walking down the street but she was someone else and two of them were talking and this student laughed. Eugene got in and we got Michael (Burn Notice) and then we had to leave because an alarm went off. We ran, along with everyone else. Eugene said we had to get to some room to plant evidence. We got to this elevator and I said it was probably safer to take the stairs. We went into the elevator anyway and this lady had to scan your ID. Our ID's both flashed red and I said that I was here every day and she seemed to forget about it being red. We got off and walked slowly and then once we were out of sight, we started running down this hill. This black security guard started chasing us and started shooting the ground at our feet. I started slowing down and Eugene kept running, but this other guy got him and brought us back. He was talking to us and he had these weird pink tubes in his arm, which was because he used to be an alcoholic. I was thinking that I figured they were always a drug addict or alcoholic. I managed to pop this button on his gun holder, which was at the front of him. I told Eugene to grab it when he had the chance. He suddenly grabbed something from him and started running. I ran after him, saying 'what the hell are you doing, shoot him!'. But he ran to this car and got in the passenger side. I got in the drivers seat and he started it up. The belt went around the bottom of the seat and was in the way of the pedals. Stuff started exploding, this car nearby and then just decorative stuff around, like barrels and chairs. We tried to drive out and I got onto the road. I couldn't brake in time and I pulled up on the side of the road, it was also a manual car."
"2981"	"(2009-08-19 (18)) I was at the post office or something. There was a box with envelopes and I found one with my name on it, but it was just a shirt. There were two more with my name but they weren't filled yet and I was annoyed. There were some photos of me, just my head and neck but I was naked. I was wearing a necklace and I was really grossed out by it. I was then at home waiting for the delivery truck. A car drove past but it was a hearse."
"2982"	"(2009-08-20 (18)) Calvin and I were at home or something. I can't remember what we were doing but Eugene joined us. I think some time before, we were in a classroom and Eugene sat next to me and Calvin started making fun of it and I tried to shut him up and not laugh."
"2983"	"(2009-08-20 (18)) I watched a movie or something or reading facts about the 1700's. Darren said that Mom should take a cooking class and they were expensive -- like $940 a day. I was saying that in the 1700's it was $60 for cheese (like a 3cm size block). Some lady in the movie industry back then could drive and stuff and females weren't allowed back then. I found a photo of Jayson on some social networking site and I was telling Ezra, starting with ""Remember Crispy Bacon?""."
"2984"	"(2009-08-20 (18)) Dad and I went to a cinema thing to see some creepy movie. It played lots of different things, like there was another movie, then an episode of Supernatural. It went like a cartoon and these balls of light came to this guy and turned into these weird dragon things. They said that these balls of darkness near their planet were actually dragons getting bigger and they would come back in 35 days and will wipe out their sun. We were going to leave the cinema, when the creepy movie started and we sat back down. Then it was actually a stage and Steve Burns was there. He was asking people to go out and walk backwards down the hall. We went to and as we were leaving I asked Dad ""did you get the water bottle?"". We realized we were the only people and I felt stupid. Steve then met up with us and he was in different clothes. He took us up the hall and then turned a corner. I realized it was the stage and stopped but Dad didn't and kept going. He took him to the far end of the stage and was talking to him. Nana was then there too. I couldn't hear them but I heard him say ""if you let me fuck your daughter"" and they laughed and were like ""how do you know she's over 18?"" and he said ""she's got her licence right?"". Nana came out and said ""I think he likes you, you're library/biology teacher"" and I said ""it's the dude from Blues Clues!"" and she said she knew. He made Dad drink water and eat popcorn. He was encouraging him and said ""with your little cat mouth"" which was really funny and I was trying not to laugh."
"2985"	"(2009-08-21 (18)) I got ready for school but Mom took her time to leave and when she finally did it was 7pm. I said I wasn't going to go and she asked why and I said it finished ""2 hours ago"". She was like 'oh'."
"2986"	"(2009-08-21 (18)) It was today, and I was waiting at a bus stop for a bus to Centerville. Autumn was there and Tiana too. I was talking to Autumn and she mentioned Whitehall and I was thinking that maybe I should've stayed there. The bus came and stopped in the middle of the road. I ran across and tagged on, but the gate closed as I stepped on. I was wearing shorts because it was hot but I remembered I hadn't shaved and decided not to go, so I got off. I tried to use a teleport on my phone but I had to stay really still but this car was coming at me. I called Mom and I started to walk down the path. She said she was coming that way and then these two doctors and a stretcher ran into this building. The lady asked me if I could help her and I said ""with what?"" and she was like ""age, gender, problem"" and I said ok. She had a pregnant lady and I had to hold one of those air things. I had to help rearrange the room. I saw Mom outside and I waved and she came in. The lady doctor was now Ms Hayward and had a black eye. I asked how she got it and she said it was from her husband. She still needed me to help and was asking me questions about how I felt about the job I had done and I said the usual doubts 'that I didn't listen to the instructions properly, made a mistake' etc."
"2987"	"(2009-08-22 (18)) I was in chemistry and it was different. My desk was next to the teacher's desk and there was a glass sliding door. It was then a house. I went back to class after and Ms Hayward's file was open and it had the class list so I read it. It had notes at the bottom. Most of them were about me, such as ""Izzy scored 97%"", ""Izzy was away"". There was something about me getting into some 'fast track' course. I decided to take a photo of them all. I heard Mom talking to her in another room and she said that I had taken a photo of the class list and she came to check on me and I left. There was some water outside and I went into it to hide, but it was weird so I got out. I asked Mom if the water was safe. I wasn't wet when I got out. She confronted me later and I was saying I was only looking at my name. I had a score of 700/800. We argued for a while and then she told me to rewrite them all."
"2988"	"(2009-08-22 (18)) I was with some people, some of them characters from Entourage. I was with some guy who was setting up a sniper in a hotel room. I wandered out into the hall and I saw the guy next door setting up one too. There were some people in the hall. The 'bad' people came and knocked on the door. I ducked down (behind the bed, which was near the window). They came in and I got back up. We escaped or something and I only remember Turtle and they were hiding out in this place which was owned by a crazy lady. There was a small fire and it started to burn this car that Turtle liked. I turned the power off and saved it."
"2989"	"(2009-08-23 (18)) We moved into Nana's. I was in her room. One day Mom packed up all my stuff and moved in there. I got really angry about it. I complained about lack of privacy and that I have nowhere to sleep now. She was just like 'oh well'. I said it would be better if she and Darren stayed in the room in the hall because Ezra's room was near mine."
"2990"	"(2009-08-23 (18)) I was playing Super Mario. There were new levels and places in the game before that went nowhere that did now. This programmer guy had programmed Mario's fingers to climb up this tower in a certain way because that's what he did when he 'kissed a cute girl'. There was a place with lava monsters. Some guy who helped make Sims 3 had added a train in it after some guy gave him a map, which had like Australia on top of Canada and everything was all close together. It took 37 seconds to travel around the whole thing. I was then at a shop and there was a huge row of computers. They had Sims 3 on them and there were a lot of computers (thousands). Mine was the second computer. I hadn't been there for ages and there were lots more people. Thuy had the first computer. My Sim was called Ruby Harper. Thuy's was called Cane Nathan (first name and second name, can't remember the last name). The guys next to me were Arab and wanted me to swap seats with some guy to make it less squishy. Thuy said ""I want to sit next to one person!"" and laughed."
"2991"	"(2009-08-24 (18)) I was watching something about South Park and Trey Parker mentioned liking Journey and Don't Stop Believing was playing."
"2992"	"(2009-08-24 (18)) I needed to bring my birth certificate and some stuff to school for something. I told Dad about it. I got there and went to the 'gym'. I asked ""is Mr Billings here?"" and they said ""no"". I was then at home and something was on next that I said to Ezra I might watch. Something came on which had these nails but had a drip of fake blood on them. There was an insect that was huge and had this yellow and black end on it. I told Ezra it was a bee but he didn't care and I realized it couldn't be a bee. I can't remember it properly but some and others and I went into this dodgy place to save some friends. There were desks set up outside like a classroom. I had to crawl past and then there was like an entrance. There were kids guarding it. I grabbed a metal pole with a pentagon shape. They pretended to feel threatened and I hit them. This guy got an axe but I hit him with the pole. We got caught then I think. I was then in a room with this guy and a bad guy and lady. The guy said he didn't have to 'fix?' the room. They let us go. I said it was like Marlon Brando and he said he saw some guy and I said it was Marlon Brando (I don't remember it now, so I have no idea what I was talking about). I think I got out and went back with a girl. We crawled past the desks again and now there were old people. We got to the fence surrounding it and realized that we got caught and allowed to leave so that we would come back. My friend accidentally told this old lady and they realized we had escaped and so I said we had a girl on the inside. Someone was called William."
"2993"	"(2009-08-26 (18)) My room kept getting broken into. One time I had this bottle of pills. I went back to my room and it was messy and they were gone. I had a torch and I flashed it in Mom's room and Ezra's room and it was really dim, but then when I went to my room it was bright. I discovered my window was moved and Dad said he would fix it. One of the times I looked out my window and saw 3-4 Native women were in my car. I called out to Dad. He went out and scared them off with three small naked boys. I ended up with two women and three guys coming through my window into my room. I got this knife and Ezra was helping me. I was stabbing them in the back through the heart while they came through. My first weapon didn't do anything on this one guy. Each person that came through was harder to kill. Then I was outside and this woman came. I stabbed her and she fell to the ground and I walked away. I saw her breathing and I went back. She was on her stomach and I stabbed her again and started slicing back and forth into her back, but she kept talking and laughing and I started getting really angry and annoyed. She was actually a demon or something. Anyway, one day I was on the bus and I was ready to get off and I was holding the button in my hand. Leilani was on there but we hadn't met before, she asked what stop I was getting off at and I said ""Barlow way"". I saw the street sign and hit the button. It was actually Princess Road though. I walked across to the park with Leilani. There was snow on there and water with ducks in it. There were polar bears and a seal and others too. There were lots of people walking along the path. Bradley was amongst them. I got to Mom's which was different and there were actually two houses and they were like huts. One was mine. It was empty except for my desk (which was dark brown and completely different). Dad was in the shed fixing my window. I told him I needed insulation on it to keep the light out. He was flirting with Leilani. I poked him in the belly with my foot. Then I was eating some food and Leilani said ""Does Jakob know?"" and I asked ""What? Who's Jakob?"" and then I realized she meant Jakob Healy and she was like 'that you're on a diet and there's a baby' -- Mom had Amelia over."
"2994"	"(2009-08-26 (18)) I was watching something and there were two best friends in a house. They were young and the guy asked the girl ""can you kiss me?"". [Note: I watched the first three episodes of Dawson's Creek last night] ."
"2995"	"(2009-08-27 (18)) There was a killer. Me and someone else were running from it, but there were two of them (they were the same, but they were each a half). It was able to run really fast and just glided along in a straight line and turned really quickly. We ran into a police station and tried to tell them there was a killer, but they just sort of wrote us off and told us to leave. It was coming, so we ran out. We ran into a toilet and locked the doors and hid. It was coming through one entrance so we left through the other. It was night and there were a few buildings. The killer was like a shadow. It ran into a building and killed everyone in there in a few seconds. Then it was from its point of view and it was actually a girl who was looking for her body which was in the sea. One half of it took off and called the other 'Amy'. This lady was at the top of this tall building. She got a call from someone saying they were here and she sobbed and jumped off the edge to kill herself. This was already planned if they came. They caught us and put us in a cage."
"2996"	"(2009-08-27 (18)) I was pregnant and close to giving birth. I was at a hospital and I was thinking back to the beginning where they took ""15mL"" of the father's blood (don't remember who it was) to give to the baby. Then it was Peyton (One Tree Hill) and I wondered if she was pregnant because the actress was pregnant in real life."
"2997"	"(2009-08-28 (18)) I was at university and Eugene and Autumn were doing the MUPC. I wondered why Eugene was there. The teacher was saying that those who did well were offered an earlier exam. I said to Michael (on accident) that it was lame and he said it was probably like it was going to be on the ""14th instead of the 18th"". We were doing some math revision and I didn't remember any of it. There was an episode of Supernatural. This lady was in a house in the lounge room and her son was watching TV on the floor. Behind her the lounge moved. She looked and nothing happened but then it moved again and she asked her kid if the lounge had just moved and he said ""apparently so"". The TV moved too and she ran. It was night. She ran to a crime scene and asked Autumn (Supernatural) for a lawyer. I can't read the next bit but there's something to do with a Sakata chip."
"2998"	"(2009-08-28 (18)) I was watching a movie. This guy went to this crashed plane to check for survivors. It was a rescue/emergency plane. The patient was totally dead and he discovered the pilot was too. I was there now and he gave me this video camera to work out how to get to some place. We walked along a path next to this cliff (not high). We ended up at some water with a rope hanging down off this high jetty. He climbed up easily, but I couldn't climb it. He easily pulled me up. We walked along the jetty and had to jump back in the water to get to the shore. I jumped in but got sucked all the way to the bottom (it was far). I started swimming up, but it was hard and I almost ran out of air, but got out. There was like a village nearby but there were no signs of life. I think we went into this building and everything was weird -- stuff was upside down or moving sideways. There were these different coloured blobs and different sections of the place had different gravity. We tried to get past without being touched. Ezra was there now. We got out of there but the blobs started chasing us. We were then running through Nana's house and down the hall and out the door. We ran to the park and the guy gave me a push so I would go faster and he told me to go there and wait. Ezra ran with me and there was a garage thing. We got into a car. The guy came and got in. Some bits of blob started growing out of the guy's ear and then it was a movie and there were lots of guys in the car. A guy cut the blob off because it wouldn't let them drive. Then they drove off. They got onto a street back in that village and there were lots of cars all parked along the road. We accidentally made stuff come to life and we ran into a shop. There were lots of other people in there. We and some kids had to hide under clothes racks. There was nowhere for me to hide so I went under this high bed near the front door and covered myself with this white sheet. The blobs were now aliens and I was thinking that the CGI was bad. Some girl fell in love with this black alien and when people complained about it she accused everyone of being racist. Then I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Jen were on a bed. She was a virgin and wanted to have sex and Dawson said that the first time should be ""with someone you love or at least... like a little"". They got into bed but didn't do anything. I was reading a magazine that had a 'where they are now'. I remember seeing Aidan Gillen and Alan Rickman there."
"2999"	"(2009-08-28 (18)) First it was a movie with Ben Mendelsohn, but then it was me, two guys and a girl. We went to this place which had been taken over by aliens and it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. We went there to infiltrate. We were welcomed by this lady and taken to a building with lots of storeys. We were all taken to separate floors, which I was annoyed about because I wanted either a friend or this guy I liked with me. There was a lady at the desk and the place was full of people. It was also dark as there were no lights. She gave me this thing that was a little bit bigger than a computer mouse to hold. It also went over the top of my hand and she started it up and it got tighter and then there was a little prick, which was going to alter me, but we had gone through stuff so that although we would change physically, we wouldn't be under their control mentally. I pretended to fall to the ground and sleep and they were happy that they had a human. I got up eventually and asked to visit my friend. I went to walk up the stairs and it was really dark. I saw glowing eyes and it was breathing heavily and I was like 'hello?' and it went after me -- it was a rhino. Everyone started running and I ran up the stairs and I got to a floor with a balcony outside a window. I jumped through the window and ran down the stairs. I climbed up a little tree and I thought it was going to break. The guy I liked was in a bigger tree near mine. The rhino eventually left and I got down. I found cards of everyone and the animal/thing they would turn into. It was based on either things like hair colour or shape of their face etc. Samantha had yellowish brown hair and she turned into a snake of the same colour. Dawson (Dawson's Creek) had one and his was a tree. Some of them were quite funny. I told one of my guy friends that I thought the girl had changed and was under their control."
"3000"	"(2009-08-29 (18)) I was at a cinema with Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and Ezra. Dawson accidentally tipped a pot of oil on the carpet. The lights showed where it had gone all over the stairs. Dad was really angry at Dawson about it. I said it wasn't his fault. We got cleaning supplies to clean it."
"3001"	"(2009-08-29 (18)) Some friends and I were in a building, but we were playing an online game. We had to clear the area with the mouse. Then we realized that the people had left and it was going to explode and I yelled ""duck!"" and fell to my stomach and then it exploded. I got up and everyone was ok. I was then at dads house and the fridge was in the kitchen where the breakfast bar is facing the dining room. Dad was moving out soon. I took Tigger and put her in a bag, which her sticking out over the top. I left the house and just outside there was a cat head on the ground. Ezra was there. It joined to the body and I was like 'what the hell just happened'. I can't remember it properly, but Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and his girlfriend were pregnant. He was busy somewhere and she and I were going to the hospital to get it induced. We took the bus there and she contacted Pacey (Dawson's Creek) to tell him to get there but he had forgotten. She sat in the seat in front of me next to some pregnant African woman. Sometimes it was Aliyah and she was pregnant and she said that she went to France and slept with her boyfriend. When we got there he was waiting outside though. Dawson also turned up as we walked in. His girlfriend was filling in forms to get in. Someone asked him ""what are you going to name her if it's a girl?"" and he said ""Samantha"". I said ""I'm sick of Samantha [as in the name] "" and I mentioned Samantha Mueller. Dawson looked really worried and was standing close to me. I was annoyed about the whole situation because I liked him. I was going to ask a friend of mine for their mobile numbers, thinking that I couldn't get them because in the 90's they didn't have mobiles so I couldn't get it from the show."
"3002"	"(2009-08-29 (18)) I was pregnant. I was in the car talking to Mom saying that I had been taking it easy so as not to go into early labour. I was getting a caesarian in like two weeks. Then it was time and I was at the hospital. I was asleep for it, but I remembered getting my stomach sliced open. I woke up and Mom and Austin were there. He mentioned to Mom about having an affair with me and I was like 'what the hell I never did that'. Mom said she would call Ezra. He came but then it was Jack (Dawson's Creek). He had been asleep and was the father, or so I assumed. I had given birth to a girl by the way. Ezra came with lollies. Amelia was on the floor and he was handing out lollies and reluctantly threw a lolly at her. I thought it was funny and she ate it. He threw orange snakes at her and she just kept eating them. At first she was like smiling but then she seemed to be getting worried."
"3003"	"(2009-08-30 (18)) It was a movie then it was real. I was at a house near a big window (like the room was just made of windows). A teacher and some kids came past and told me not to worry but there was a hog on the loose and I saw it standing behind them and I said ""yeah it's behind you"". I ran away from the window and it came to the window. Ezra was then there with me and we locked ourselves in the bedroom and tried to work out how to escape. We called Ms Edmundson because she knew how to get rid of it. Sometimes she was Nana. She got us out and we ran across an oval to get to this huge building which was like a motel/house/thing. It was then Dawson and Joey (both from Dawson's Creek). They got in and they had some sort of supernatural powers. Bad guys wanted to get in and they walked past people waiting for an invitation in. This girl grabbed this guy's hand and went in. Someone sprinkled cinnamon on them to get a spell off. The guy went inside and this other guy made out with an invisible girl. Two guys were also making out. Outside in a forest, Dawson and Pacey (Dawson's Creek) were talking. Pacey and Jen (Dawson's Creek) suggested having sex and Dawson took it as an insult because he couldn't go through with it. Pacey said ""I wish I waited"" and I wondered if he meant for Joey or Andie. Then I assumed he meant wet dreams and he said they were just kids. Then there was some husband and wife and one of them said ""I'm still a virgin""."
"3004"	"(2009-09-01 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek and Dawson and Joey were friendly again. I think they got back together. Someone killed a pet or a person and Pacey had blood on him. He wanted to talk to Joey and went to her but couldn't tell her. Dawson was talking to an old friend. It was then late and I was with Mom and Ezra. I realized it was only 10pm. We needed to get in Dad's house and we were saying that we should just wake him up. We went to a bed and breakfast and they joked they had ""no bed"". Dad was then there and they played a song."
"3005"	"(2009-09-01 (18)) A few days ago I watched half of this movie that had Joshua Jackson in it. Then it was today and I watched the rest of it. At the end he had turned fat and this girl had turned skinny. Everyone fell to their stomach. Some people melted because it was hot. I was watching it with Dad. There was a battle between Joshua Jackson's character (who was not him now) and Maryann (True Blood). It was in like an elevator. She did something with air and fizzy water and she said she was ""a water Pokemon"". He attacked her for a while but she was fine and attacked him and he got owned. He brought comic book characters out to help, one of them was Batman. In real life I was then at home and Joshua Jackson or his character was there. Some friends turned crazy and tried to kill us. We locked them outside and we ran next door. We knocked and they let us in. There were lots of people there all lazing about. A guy was on the phone. A friend and I picked up the other phone and were listening to his conversation. He was talking to a guy and it sounded like they were in a relationship."
"3006"	"(2009-09-02 (18)) I was at Mom's which was different. Farrah was over and she was young and weird. She went into the fridge and I closed the door. Mom and Darren were doing drugs on the table right next to her. I pulled her away so she wouldn't see and she wanted to play with my 'toys'."
"3007"	"(2009-09-02 (18)) I was at a shop and got a haircut. I left there and went to another shop and this lady told me that there was a job for a statistics person near a video shop/cinema. I had to this strange online quiz thing. There was like a bush scene and I had to press a button when certain people popped up (like a shooting range). I clicked the wrong person and I tried to restart it but it was too hard and I left. There was a black cop/security guard for the video shop and he had accused me of stealing chips before. Then there were zombies. I was with a bunch of people including Dawson, Joey and Jack (all from Dawson's Creek). I can't remember the beginning but we were in a bathroom. There was a zombie tied up. For some reason we all decided to have a smoke. Joey and I went into the shower and I took a puff of the smoke and I didn't choke or cough. The cop came and told us off and made us leave. As he told us off, the others took off into a stairwell and I followed them. I then realized they had run off because zombies were coming so I thought it was lucky that I had followed them. We were in like an underground carpark before we got to the stairwell. I was running really fast up the stairs and then I noticed that everyone had stopped and I realized there were heaps of zombies coming down the stairs. We ran through a door on that level and there was another stairwell across the room. We started running towards it and there were lots of zombies in the way. They were all doing different things, like one was doing the dance from 'Thriller' and other things from the game, Plants vs. Zombies. We started climbing up this thing on the wall. We had to move across it to get out. I was holding onto this small unstable bit hanging out of the wall. Underneath us were lots of zombies and they were reaching up to us. We complained and Jen (Dawson's Creek) got angry because she had the hardest job and she went across to the end, using up all the good spots (which fell off after being used), but I went across. I got to the end and the key was like a contact lens and I dropped it in the crowd of zombies. Dawson and Jack somehow managed to wipe out the whole room. I jumped down and it was much easier to get everything done. I was covered in blood and started wiping it on Dawson's back, which he let me do and we joked about it. He offered to someone there to join our group and said he had ""nine contacts"", such as a weapons dealer."
"3008"	"(2009-09-02 (18)) I was in a deli with Mom, Darren, Neil Flynn and others. There were quite a few people in there and lots of weird/cool stuff, such as lots of squishy things like a rat and those balls with the wiggly bits. Neil Flynn was joking around and pretending to be like Frankenstein's monster. At one point, Ezra, Dad and I were talking about Jurassic Park Dad said to Ezra that if he didn't remember it he had to see it again. I was watching a bit of it and James Van Der Beek was in it and he was talking to someone and I was thinking that I didn't remember him being in it, then the camera turned and Kerr Smith was the one talking to him and I said ""And Jack!"" and Ezra questioned me and I said ""the gay dude"". Then we were actually at a huge shop and there were also shops outside. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Robert Downey Jr. were also with us. I was also going out with Eugene and having an affair with Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Robert Downey Jr. Then Mom and I were looking for a friend of Mom's. I went into this deli which had lots of chocolate things. It had a restaurant connected to the left of it. A song was playing and I realized it was 'Theme from a Summer Place'. There were some gay guys in dresses sitting at a table. There were lots of people there. On the other side was an outside area where there was a concert or a sports game going on. I was with Mom again and I asked ""where are RDJ and JDM?"" We went into the proper shop and Mom's friend had contacted her saying she was in ""Fontaine's"", which was an extremely fancy clothes shop. We were walking towards and this lady walked towards us and said we couldn't go in because of what we were wearing. Mom walked off through this corridor and I chased after her because we weren't allowed in there -- it led into the fancy area. A security guard saw us and we got out before he came to us. Later I was doing an experiment and I poured a solution into a test tube and it turned pink. I did it three times but did it wrong every time. Mom helped me. I then realized we were using a cobalt solution which was wrong."
"3009"	"(2009-09-03 (18)) I was watching a movie and it told the same story from six (or so) different point of views. There was a bomb in the building. The first one was like The X-Files, but I only remember Scully. She was in a small office room and her and some others were questioning someone. The guy with the video camera handed it to this other guy and said ""can you see anything?"" and this other guy said ""he's got a camera"" and then he shot him. Scully saw and realized the cameras were guns. They wrestled the guy for it and he shot the 'bomb' before they grabbed him. The guy in charge came in and it was Joshua Jackson but he was young. I was thinking that he was turning up everywhere lately. Then the point of view was of a young couple. The alarm was going off and they split up and the girl started running down the stairs in a stairwell but now it was me. I ran out at the basement level and this guy was directing everyone outside. It was raining. We were standing in front of the building and there was a window on an upper floor with some people just sitting and watching. One of them was James Van Der Beek and I was like 'more people from Dawson's Creek!'. It was cold and I had shorts on and was soaked. There were people still running out and I saw Eugene and Bradley. Eugene had longer hair and he was wet too. I then thought that I was at State University. When they were 'satisfied' this bubble went over the top and covered us so we didn't get rained on. We had to sit down. I sat down near Terrence and Gavin came along and sat next to him, then this other guy came and we moved to fit him in. Then Emery came and we had to move again. Then I was at home and he was staying over. I was sitting with him and Ezra in a bedroom and he had these dildos on the bed. One was purple and Ezra hit me in the head with one. Then I was on the floor watching TV. I saw an ad for Dawson's Creek with Pacey talking to Jen. I clapped excitedly. Then there was an ad for the movie that previously played out and it had a long name."
"3010"	"(2009-09-04 (18)) I was telling Mom about Freaks and Geeks and how Lindsay was one of two female characters I liked in any TV show/movie. The second one was on another show and was also played Linda Cardellini. I had never noticed before. I think Raquel was there too."
"3011"	"(2009-09-04 (18)) Mom and I went to a shop. There was a light yellow dress and it was really gross. There were ugly jumpers. There were some flowery shirts and Mom asked why I didn't wear something more presentable, such as the flowery shirts. I said ""Do you know, every shirt you like has flowers?"" A friend of hers got a genie with unlimited wishes. There were magazines and books about Twilight nearby. Mom's friend wanted me to look in the magazines to find out how Katie Holmes' did her hair. Mom's friend spilled something and summoned the genie to clean it up. I was talking to it and said that my guess is that most people wish for the ""person they like, money and beauty"". Then I was trying to get off the train but it didn't stay open for very long. I got out and I was inside and had to walk up an escalator but I went the wrong way and had to go down and walk back again."
"3012"	"(2009-09-04 (18)) Dawson (Dawson's Creek) was worried that he wasn't going to get into college. He applied for some school and he had to write an essay about Elvis Presley. He got accepted by it but decided not to go."
"3013"	"(2009-09-05 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Joey were on a school trip and were at a small motel. They were sharing a bed with their parents. Dawson decided to sneak off and go to this pool party. Joey didn't. The teachers found out and went to look for them. Dawson's mother helped look. They were in a small room with a little pool. Later, Dawson and Joey came back there. The light was dim and Joey called it a ""dinner light"". She said she had turned some other lights down like that. Dawson's put his hands on it to turn it off and it went bright, but when he took his hands off it went dim again. It wouldn't turn off, so Joey tried it but it did the same thing. Then the room changed or something and it was really scary and felt cold and horrible. Sometimes I was there. I can't remember what happened properly but these strange things kept happening. One that I do remember was that there was a small table and two people were making out on it then we realized it was Dawson and Joey (another set) and Jen was now there and she yelled at them to make them stop. They ignored her and took their clothes off, had sex and then put their clothes on. They then aged and were now old people and the real Dawson or Joey said ""how does this night end?"" and the old Joey said to the old Dawson ""I love you"". Also, the real Dawson and Joey had a partner and they were both in the room too. Then the old couple got into bed. I was then on a drive with Mom. We got out of the car and it was night and in a suburb and everything looked weird, but it was subtle. I looked at the road and it was on a funny angle. Then I was in a pool and there was a pool toy boat. I picked it up and hit it down on the water and changed to this flat thing and then it changed again. It was creepy. Then Dad was in there. The weird stuff that had been happening everywhere had now happened in a music video, which reminded me of the suicide scene in The Rules of Attraction [note: I watched it last night] . Dad said that he thought all music videos would be understood by Ezra now. I said that that music video was the creepiest thing I'd ever seen. I realized I was naked in the pool. Creepy stuff was still happening in there. I was in that small room later and a girlfriend or something of Dawson's came in and she tried to burn some of my dreams. In one of them I had had sex with Dawson. I snatched them off her and so she set my jumper that I was wearing on fire. The fire looked weird. Jack (Dawson's Creek) was there and he helped me get it off but then she came back in and started pouring petrol over the floor and I cried and screamed at her to stop and attacked her. She was a celebrity, but I don't remember who. I can't remember how we stopped her, but we did."
"3014"	"(2009-09-05 (18)) I was in a car with Ezra. It was night. He was in the passenger seat and I was in the back behind the driver's seat. He had it driving on 'autopilot' and a turn came up and I jumped in the driver's seat and tried to steer it but it was hard and I went all over the road (we were on Wanneroo Road, just before Northlands). I saw cop lights behind us and I managed to pull over. I quickly got back in the back seat. The policeman came to the window and I explained that the autodrive was driving and it went out of control and he was like 'I understand but I still have to do something about it'. I said that we can't drive and had to get somewhere and he was like ""Oh well, that's easy"" and said that since November people without a licence couldn't use autodrive and I was like 'What I didn't know that!' He seemed like a nice guy and seemed to like me. He went to this place to get it removed and so there was no record of anything happening. Later we went to Dad's house. Jakob came too and was friends with Ezra. I looked in the cupboard for food and there were a few packets of M&M's but they had all expired in 2005. There were some lamingtons too. Ezra said he preferred movies to TV shows and I said I preferred TV shows at the moment. Jakob said he hated them but he had watched a DIY one."
"3015"	"(2009-09-06 (18)) Mark Wahlberg's character from Boogie Nights was dating this girl and her family was annoyed about it [note: I watched the first half of it last night] . It was in the olden days. Then one night they had sex. The next morning he seemed bored with her and she was with him in the kitchen. Her siblings picked up on something different and said they thought she had had sex. He said she wanted to do it again and her siblings told him that she was actually only 16 and lied about her 'papers'. He said he had to go if that was the case, but then the mother went to the daughter's room to check on her and heard sex noises. Then I was outside somewhere with Mom, Dad, Ezra and Nana. It was night and we were on the way to Dad's new place. It was really far away. He wanted a room mate. Some witch/psychic predicted Mom's future. One time she put a spell on us so we could control these car placements. Then all females had numbers on their tongues. First it was letters and mine was an 'F'. You couldn't see it unless you put a certain light on it. Then there was a video Mark Wahlberg's girlfriend from before had 23 on her tongue and he had '3' (girls now had two numbers, guys had one). These people came to kill him. I watched Dawson's Creek later."
"3016"	"(2009-09-06 (18)) I was watching a movie. It was like a documentary sometimes. This young guy (like 12) was at a shop. He ended p trying to help this teenage girl and her young brother from their father, who was violent. He went to their house and was now Heather Graham. I joked to the guy they should have sex on the 'squeaky couch'. The kids were like 'ew'. She was now the boy again. We went to leave and they got in the way. The daughter went to the father and then the kid realized it had been a set up so the father could rape him. I read the end of some book and asked someone if they had seen the movie yet and they said it wasn't out until next month. I was then at the cinema with Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and Pacey (Dawson's Creek) came."
"3017"	"(2009-09-06 (18)) Mom's house was weird. There were lots of different sets of stairs and there were no walls on the rooms. It was only temporary. Ezra's room was near mine and we heard this noise, but it was just a cat. We then ended up in an alternate universe or something. Some stuff came through with us and it had this thin black tape (it was like film from a video tape) hanging off it. This guy helped me to move my bookshelf which had come through but the piece of black film was attached to another shelf thing which had to be carried with it. I thought that if it ripped it would disappear. Some people there got suspicious of us and so I told Ezra to pull the fire alarm. A friend of mine was there and I told him to grab some of my dream books and put them somewhere safe and he did. I hid under a desk and the water started pouring down. Everyone, except a few people, ran out. Ezra and I finished moving the shelf. I mentioned the word 'movie' to someone and they didn't know what a movie was. Later, I was watching a movie that had Michelle Williams in it. At the end she got together with this guy and said ""Oh I'm a Virgo aren't I?"" and giggled and I said 'I was going to say that' (it was a reference to something that had happened earlier in the movie)."
"3018"	"(2009-09-07 (18)) Nana and Poppa cleaned our house with Fluorine. It did stuff to your teeth if it got in your mouth. I used it for a bit and then my teeth started hurting. It felt like my teeth were covered in like that crackle stuff but lots of it and it hurt really bad if I bit down. I couldn't talk properly. I rinsed my mouth with water but it was still there. Later, I was ok and I was in the back room sitting on the floor holding a small baby. It was quiet and kept staring at me. It started to pee on my arm and I threw it onto the ground. It was now a black kitten and it started running around the room and I said that the baby was like a kitten. I called it 'Lily' [note: In Dawson's Creek they had a baby called Lily] . I told Mom to close the back door, but she didn't and it ran outside. I chased it and caught it and brought it back in."
"3019"	"(2009-09-07 (18)) I started working at this takeaway place. First it was inside and one day I 'floated'. But now, everyone could float (we just sort of hovered in the air). I was saying that it happened a month after I floated. Then the place was like a wagon outside. I asked this lady where to sign in and she told me to go to the office, which was a huge shed/warehouse thing. Elijah was there along with some others that I knew. This chubby Asian lady said something weird and Elijah and I were giggling. He was kind of hot. I went to the office. There was a swamp in it with crocodiles. There was a really hot guy there whose name was Joe. I went in there, I think at some other time, and I took this book which had everyone's names. His name was Joe Jayone and he was born in 1985. I saw two school bags lying about and I realized he was a killer and I saw him throw them into the water for the crocodiles. There was like a rope and when he left, I swung past and tried to save them but I couldn't. He was coming back and I was with some friends now and we went to hide. I didn't hide in time and he saw me. Somehow I got away from there and I was now at a park at night. He had chased me there and we had a struggle for a bit and I managed to get him on the ground and I was sitting on him trying to stop him. He kissed me and then rolled me over so he was on top of me and we had sex. When it finished, Ezra came and I pushed him off me. He got arrested later. I read on a profile of him that he had killed lots of people. I was in the car with Mom and Ezra going to the movies. Mom said that it was my ""first clean fuck"". Leroy was then outside the car and he wanted to come along and he had lots of USB's. I was then watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson married this rich girl and he was on a farm and they had lots of land. The others annoyed him about it."
"3020"	"(2009-09-09 (18)) Andie (Dawson's Creek) was going up an escalator. People were stopping random people to ask questions. The first one they asked Andie, the answer was 'no'. They asked her if she had a problem with sex and she was now Joey and she said ""I've only had sex twice and used a condom twice"". They continued asking sex questions and she got annoyed and said ""Do you want to know their names so you can make sure I'm not lying -- Pacey Witter,"". I was then at a shop. They had this chocolate with mint cream and it had 14g of fat. Ezra was there. This girl said she would give me money to swear and eat one, or to kiss her and eat one. I said that ""swearing makes me feel like I'm taking my clothes off"" and James Van Der Beek was there and said ""or you can do that"" and we laughed."
"3021"	"(2009-09-09 (18)) I was watching Lost. They had a way of killing off characters -- they would show them and then it would fade out (with white). They killed off Ben and I was annoyed about it and told Ezra. I accidentally read that Kate died. Then Mom and I were in Venice or something. We were at a shop and at this little shop which sold jeans. I said ""I don't want girls ones"". This security guard guy there laughed. We didn't know how to get to the main area of Venice. There was a big body of water outside the shop. Some guy shrunk and jumped in, but it was from my point of view. He was extremely tiny and held onto a normal sized inflatable ring so he didn't sink. It took a long time to hit the water, which caused a lot of water to splash up. I was watching Dawson's Creek at one point and I realized I thought Jack was hot. I was annoyed about this and I started cutting out a picture of him to put in my presentation. I wondered whether I should update my top 10 for this month, but I didn't want James Van Der Beek to lose the top spot. Then I was watching True Blood. Some bad vampires were after Bill. Eric and some other good vampires were with him. Something had happened and they could now go out in the sun but it made them tired and like really badly sunburnt. They had been chasing them for days, walking through this rocky place. The bad vampires eventually tired and decided to sleep. The good ones coincidentally decided to do this too. Eric just 'fell' into the ground to sleep. Then somewhere else there were two graves on a hill near a house. Some girl said her boyfriend was still alive and everyone thought she was crazy/in denial but he was actually a vampire. The graves were empty underneath the top layer and then there was a wolf skin on top of some wood and then a big area for them to sleep in. I can't remember properly, but the guy wanted to get rid of the girl, I think."
"3022"	"(2009-09-10 (18)) There was some food somewhere (like a dinner or something was going on). Eugene's father Abraham was there and I was thinking that maybe I could find out what his name was. I was looking at Eugene's Facebook page. He was coming over now too and I had Dawson's Creek as my wallpaper, although I only remember seeing Dawson clearly. I thought maybe I should change it incase he saw it. We were now at Nana's. I went inside and Emery was on a lounge in the lounge room. Dad and I were going to go scuba diving or something. We were going across the water to get to the place and there were waves. This girl said that the instructor was ""really cute"". We got across and then we had to walk along next to this wall. The waves came up and so we had to hold this rail so we didn't get pulled away. We went into a restaurant. This foreign guy sat us at a table and brought us food. I was thinking that the waves were too strong so we were going to have to do it another day. We went to a school another day and Dad had gone there to talk to the principal. I was friends with him."
"3023"	"(2009-09-11 (18)) I had this vampire guy as a friend. He was young. He was saying that he was gay and he had had a crush on James Van Der Beek when he was young, but he was born in 1948. He said he wrote him letters that he didn't send and had material that was ""not repeatable"". Then it was True Blood. Bill and Sookie were in bed together. We were at Granma's house but it was different. I needed a tissue and I asked her for one and she gave me these small squares of tissue. She wasn't happy about vampires. Uncle Gabriel walked in the room as I was closing the door on the other side, but left when he realized we were going to bed. Sookie and Bill were now other people and he wouldn't suck her blood but she wanted him too. There was some jam stuff you could eat which did something to do the blood (I think it produced more). There was this new thing out where a van would park in a carpark and encourage people to exercise. There was a meeting there one day and there lots of people doing stretches. One guy there had a heart condition."
"3024"	"(2009-09-11 (18)) I was watching True Blood. The town was still crazy but it was different. There were some young kids (like under 10) giving out death sentences. They gave one to a friend of theirs, who pleaded with them but they just showed no emotion (I think they were under the control of something). Sam and Jason met up outside somewhere and it zoomed in on Sam's mouth, which was in an open smile and then he turned into a rat. Jason did too and had only acquired this power recently and was still confused about it. Then it showed them naked on lying on the ground talking to each other. Then it went to some kids and they saw something and one of them said ""ooh look at that"" and then it showed an injured pig lying at the bottom of a hill. It was making squealing noises. It was actually Maryann and I said ""Maryann got raped!"". I wondered why she wasn't in her human form."
"3025"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson was going out with some girl, but asked Jen to the prom. At first he was Pacey and the others teased him for going alone, but then he was Dawson."
"3026"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) I was watching a movie. There was a couple and they had a kid when she was 19. It was a cartoon sometimes.  There was a flashback and the guy was like 'trailer trash'. He said he hoped she was going to run off to college and she said she was but she got pregnant and didn't. She was then at a party which a guy who looked like a young Anthony Perkins, who was her 'rich' date. She left him for the poor guy. When she was older she slept with some guy and the guy and her daughter caught her."
"3027"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and I were going out. We were in this hotel/motel place and there was a small competition. There were 6 files and 4 of them were winners and you won a weekend (or so) in a spiffy room there. Pacey entered and was given a file. It was full of paper and if they all had stuff written on them then it was a winner. We lost, so he bought another one. He was then Ezra. He went to the toilet with it and then came out and said it was a winner and showed us a filled out page. I opened it to have a look and saw that the rest of it was empty, so we had lost again. He was now Pacey again. The guy running the competition was someone we knew. We asked him for another one and he gave did. Then I was at a table and Pacey and I were eating all of this pie (it was a dessert-y one cut up in slices). Then Dawson and Joey (both Dawson's Creek) were staying in the hotel room and it had a spa. Later we were somewhere else. Charlie (Dawson's Creek) could tell the future. Years ago he had said that Dawson and Jen weren't right for each other. He now had this small purple ball which predicted things. I asked him if he was the same guy who had predicted colour pictures over black and white pictures and he said he was. He got Dawson to throw the ball, which would go to 'his future'. It went to me. I was on a roof type of thing and was next to them, and when he threw it in front of him it turned around and came back to me. I kept throwing it away and it kept coming back. Then I was in some water and there was a weird looking black and white cat standing nearby. Jen came to me and said she was thinking that she and Dawson needed to break up. I asked why and she mentioned the spa in the hotel room (which had now been shared by me and Dawson). I said ""he spent more time with Turk [Scrubs] than me!"". She was relieved but still wanted to leave Dawson. She was later sitting on a ledge near the water and someone threw the ball which hit her in the back and made her fall into the water. Jen finally told Dawson she wanted to leave him. We were then in a room. I asked Charlie about his future and he said he didn't want to know but I threw the ball to find out anyway and it went to Joey who was standing outside, talking to some guy. It floated near her crutch and she tried to subtly push it away but it kept coming back. We laughed. Then she was actually standing out there with Charlie and Dawson said she would do this shoulder shrug as she walked away (which meant she was attracted to him) and she did. Then I was at Nana's. I was in the lounge room with Dad and Ezra. It was smaller. I was reading a book which had stuff about Stephen King and there was a smoking quiz. One of the questions was about why smoking was more relaxing at some point and the answer was because it meant that the bills were paid. We were watching something on TV and this woman died which looked like Kristine Sutherland and I said ""what is this, Buffy's mother?"". Dad said no it was her (one of the characters') daughter. But then it was real and Ezra wondered if they would get rid of the body now and I said, sarcastically, ""no they're going to keep her here a few more days to keep her fresh""."
"3028"	"(2009-09-12 (18)) I was going out with Eugene. We went to a cinema and were watching 'Goosebumps' movies. We left one and went into another. There was a row at the back of only four seats and a guy sitting on the end. Eugene walked past him and sat at the end and I sat next to him. I lifted the arm rest up and moved closer to him. He kissed me. I moved away worried that I would squish him and he put his hand on my thigh and asked why I moved away, so I told him. He wanted me closer so I moved back and then we watched the movie. It was already like halfway in and this girl was in a car which had just crashed into the water and she was being bothered by ghosts or something. All of a sudden it went weird and the sound was loud and lots of stuff started happening on the screen. I noticed that everyone in the cinema looked bored. The guy at the end of the row next to us was like staring at us which a creepy blank expression. I pointed out the weird behaviour to Eugene. Other people were slowly eating popcorn and no-one seemed to actually be 'there'. He said we should get out of here so we climbed over the seats in front of us (as that row was empty) and walked out. To the left of us was the hall which led to other cinemas and it was dark. We went right and we were scared and sort of panicky. There was a doorway and when we walked through that, to the left was a brick wall, so we went right, which led down a small hall to the lobby. Nobody else was around. We walked outside. Lots of buses came past. I wondered whether to call Mom to get us or to catch a bus. One bus stopped and the driver asked us if we needed help. He said he needed to find some ""woods"". He got out and I asked if he went past Centerville and he said he did. Then he asked if we knew where ""KFC airport"" was and we didn't. The bus then started going down the street (which was on a slight downward hill). The guy turned around and noticed it was gone. It turned back around and was heading right for me. I started running to get away from it. I ran down to where it had come from and went behind a parked bus but it kept turning and trying to get me, but then it stopped. Then the guy from the cinema, who was now Robert Pattinson, was there saying that I ruined his life and ""I can't live without you"" and so was going to kill me. He was throwing small sticks at me. I grabbed this thick branch and threw it at him while backing away but it just landed at his feet. He called me Sasha (but pronounced it 'Sarsha', like posh people do). Eugene was also getting bothered by some girl. She started tying him up in this net. They were in the middle of the road. I picked up this long sturdy stick to attack Robert Pattinson with, but then I saw a bus coming down the road and I pushed the girl out of the way and put the stick through a hole in the net and pulled Eugene to the side of the road and the bus just missed him."
"3029"	"(2009-09-13 (18)) I was at university and it was night. I went into this shop to leave and Matilda and some guy were in there playing with a ball (sometimes they were aliens). I went to walk out one door and Matilda said to go through this other door (which would be quicker). I said that it was always locked and so went through another one. The problem with this door is that it led out onto a long path and some steps and there were no lights. People got attacked all the time on it. I text Mom to come to the back to get me and to text me when she got there. I saw Sherilynn Fenn wave at me from a window, which I assumed meant that it was safe and so started along. I was later reading something on IMDb about Dawson's Creek and whether they thought Dawson was a good filmmaker. They gave Pacey a rating of 40% on filmmaking. There was an episode where Dawson walked in on Pacey masturbating to his own sex tape. I can't remember which girl it was though."
"3030"	"(2009-09-13 (18)) I was at Nana's. It was someone's birthday. I went to walk into the dining room and I heard a movie playing that sounded like someone masturbating. Poppa came around the corner and told me to get out of the room. I went to the lounge and there was nowhere to sit and I kept wandering back into the dining room, so I ended up just sitting on the floor of the lounge room. Uncle Wilbur came out of the dining room saying ""what the hell?"". Dad and Ezra were sitting in the lounge too. I text Mom to pick me up and then she was there. She and Dad were standing close and their hands were touching slightly. I checked my phone for a reply from her and she had sent me one a few minutes before she had arrived. I couldn't find my water bottle. I looked everywhere and I found a full cold one but then I saw my one on top of the car. It was pretty much empty. Clayton was in the front seat and I told him to get into the back."
"3031"	"(2009-09-14 (18)) I was watching a movie about a girl who was getting stalked by demons or something (like Drag Me to Hell). She thought she'd got rid of it and she got pregnant. One day it came back and it wanted her baby (she was now pregnant with another one) and she was like 'no, don't take my baby!' but it like, flew into her stomach and ripped it out. Then Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and I were looking for it. We asked a friend of ours to check for similar occurrences such as ""weather patterns"". This guy had this puzzle where you had to get rid of this imprint. He said if I did one I would get a prize and I did it. This girl was talking about 'endocrine' and I said I knew it what it meant and that I wanted to be a vet because ""I like animals. The only other things I like are movies and video games"". She said ""vets don't get paid that much"". Then I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson, Joey and Pacey were at this farm thing. Joey had a full break up with Dawson. He broke down, crying saying ""I love you, I need you, I can't live without you! Oh God!"" and fell on the ground crying. Pacey comforted him. Then these people wanted to get photos of them and Dawson walked up, like nothing had happened and said ""hey guys"". Then it was the next morning and they had all been drinking all night. Pacey joked about it, but then they found out someone had died. I wondered where Jack was. This guy told us to say something to warn him because he was going to die. He liked swearing? Then it was his wife and she collapsed from a heart attack. The guy kissed her and it resurrected her."
"3032"	"(2009-09-14 (18)) I was watching Supernatural. This girl was looking for Sam because she wanted to get a photo. I wondered where Dean was."
"3033"	"(2009-09-14 (18)) Pacey (Dawson's Creek) was with some animals. They joined a group. They drove up in some underground area with water. These other animals killed everyone they could and then we ran (me too) and we jumped underwater. I then took a bus to the shop down the road. It got $30 to get there and I had $108 on my SmartRider. The shop was different and the lady there didn't like me. I called Mom and the lady yelled at me about gambling. They had a notepad thing I wanted to get for my dreams. This other time I went there and it was night. We were in the clothes section and the lady was being nice. There was a board on the wall that mentioned Calvin and I having done something. My Little Lady was playing and I said 'I like this song!'."
"3034"	"(2009-09-15 (18)) Charlie from Fringe and a girl friend of his were in a building and there were these long poles that you attached to at one end and you could stay up high. They were both single and they ended up kissing and realized they liked each other, but then all these people came in."
"3035"	"(2009-09-15 (18)) Calvin, Ezra and I were somewhere. Muse were on stage and we were with them as they got ready and then they let us stand near the stage when they played."
"3036"	"(2009-09-15 (18)) I was in a car with Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and it was night. We were in this cornfield place and it was foggy. We were looking for proof of something and it made me do something without thinking. We got out and there was a construction site nearby. We heard a baby crying and then people came looking for the baby. I picked up some stuff and found a lady and she had been making the noises so people would find her. We went back to the cornfield and Mom said that Raquel had been in lots of advertisements lately and I said I had seen her saying something about that on Facebook. I was on my computer later and Ten O'Clock Postman only had like 60 plays."
"3037"	"(2009-09-16 (18)) Eugene and I had a baby girl. I was thinking her name was Chantelle but realized that I hated the name and thought it was Isobel, but I hated that too. Then I thought it ended with an 'a' and said ""Diana? No, that's too old"". I went to university and Eugene worked part time at night and looked after the baby. Mom also went to university and she was ready to leave. I was annoyed because I had to wait for Eugene before I could leave and I didn't want to look after the baby. Ezra told Mom that he had lots of dreams collected now."
"3038"	"(2009-09-16 (18)) Ezra and I stayed at Granny's. It was Christmas the next day. We were cleaning some dirty cutlery. The next morning she gave me a math revision package, but it was all really easy stuff. The first question had a 4x4 square and people standing on the edge of each small square and you had to work out what number went in each square depending on how many body parts were touching each one. Some had their arm, hand or something else. Some Girls was playing."
"3039"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) Dad had downloaded a bunch of educational stuff. He and Ezra were going to read it all. They started with human biology and I said ""you'll know everything I know"". Later I was at home and Ezra came into my room. I had Tigger. He pulled my door to when he left. I said 'thanks' and he looked shocked and then said something polite in return."
"3040"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at the shop getting an almond magnum out of the freezer. At first I checked the fat content of the cookies and cream one. Mom was lifting me into the freezer (I was almost all the way upside down reaching in). My shirt started falling up and there were some guys nearby and so I tried to keep it down. This guy pointed out an acid spill on the floor. We went to the lolly section and I wanted to get some. It was self serve like. I ate some of my ice-cream. When we were leaving I opened a packet of lamingtons. We went to the checkout and then it was like a game. I was in a multistory like hotel but each room had things like poker games going on. No-one was really around and there were some aliens. I kept getting chased out and kept not getting out in time. Then one of the times I got out just in time. To get out though you had to go through the proper checkout and if you didn't you had to go through those rotating metal things. I crawled along the ground and took a photo. Later Mom and I were in a car driving down Beach Road. This cop and a girl were on a motorbike and the cop was trying to make her get this ball and kick it on the grass (so she could arrest her and get a blood sample). She wouldn't do it and said she would only give information to help. The cop slowed us down and then she arrested her."
"3041"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Audrey and Pacey broke up. He went to some island/boat with a friend and he was happy that he was away from Audrey, but his friend brought her there and they were happy anyway."
"3042"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at the shops and it was night. Mom went in and this guy was being dodgy and we locked the doors. He went to the back and tried to open the door. He waited and then got in when Mom came. He told us to do stuff for him. Then it was True Blood. Bill and Sookie, though not at first, went somewhere. She didn't know he was a vampire and he was old. She worked it out though. I was then there and I was looking for a room and I found one without a bed. Jeffrey Donovan's Twitter was talking about Burn Notice and something about having a lifetime of a ""sucky career""."
"3043"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at Nana's. I was walking past the family room and I saw Marmaduke standing out the front. I went out there and some others had seen him too. We were then in a room and we were watching a movie or TV show and he was then sitting next to us, but only Poppa and I could see him. Fido came up to us. I told Ezra that it was all probably due to an ""alternate reality""."
"3044"	"(2009-09-17 (18)) I was at home but it was different. I looked out the window and the buildings looked weird. Mom and I went to look. It was night. We walked near it and there was smoke. Firemen and lots of people were crowded around. Mom asked if any help was needed and they said yes and she was like ""oh I was just kidding"" but grabbed a hose and started to help put the fire out. I had no shoes on. This guy fell asleep or something and his hose started going everywhere so I grabbed it to take control of it. Then there was a loud roar and I said ""Cloverfield!"". We ran back home. I turned back around at one point and I could see downtown and all the buildings were on fire and smoky and destroyed. We got home and I packed up my laptop to put it somewhere safe and then we left. I asked Mom why we weren't taking the car and she said it would be quicker to leave if the monster showed up. I saw downtown again and all the buildings were collapsed in a pile. There was smoke and fire still and there was a bridge half collapsed next to it. I was shocked by it. I was then in a car with Eugene and Pacey (Dawson's Creek). We drove over a bridge and I realized that downtown was now back to normal. Pacey turned around to look and we assumed it was fake. It was now day and it was cloudy. There was a helicopter flying around. He decided to find Audrey (Dawson's Creek) who was downtown. I think he made us walk and I was by myself now. Then I was in some flying vehicle. I dropped out at this ""lip island"" which I think was the center of the universe and was in the water. I dropped into the water next to it. I had my phone and SmartRider in my pocket. I dropped my SmartRider in the water and I couldn't grab it in time and it started to sink. I watched it sink and I felt that nothing could be normal again. I held onto the middle of it and started taking photos of it with my phone. The lip was now in the shape of Pacey and the photos were turning out with Joey, Dawson and others. We all went into it. It looked like Ikea or something and was kid like. It was colourful and there were other people there. There was a dopey girl and she said they would hide under the lounge. Then Pacey was back and was cooking. He saw Joey and kissed her and took her into a room."
"3045"	"(2009-09-18 (18)) I was talking to Dad. We went past a takeaway place and a lady served us and she knew him. He ordered 8 of some chicken thing. He said she got angry at him the other day and made him eat cold chicken things. I told him about this guy playing Rock Band and said that I put a link on Facebook and to go to 2.30 minutes and he said he just looked at it now. He couldn't get to it because it had been deleted or there was maintenance."
"3046"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) There was a new Quentin Tarantino movie with John Travolta and Uma Thurman. In real life, John Travolta was pregnant with Katie Holmes (like, he was the one that was pregnant). Most of the movie consisted of them on the bed, so the scenes with his belly showing were filmed after he gave birth. The dialogue was really lame. In real life there was a door or something that led to 'Hollywood'. I walked through and Katie Holmes was on a step (it was actually Britney Spears though). I said hi and she didn't say anything. She had a few kids following behind her. There were heaps of people around. I said ""what's up?"" to someone and they (or someone) said ""you seem shy"". I don't remember who, but someone said ""I don't know anything about her, but just got [invited? It's hard to read] to her house"". It was next to the entrance and I thought that Kerr Smith was supposed to live there. Then I saw him walking towards the house. He looked like he did in season 5 of Dawson's Creek. I said ""sup?"" and he gave me a high five. We were friends and had gone on holidays together. Jack, Dawson and Joey (all from Dawson's Creek) were sitting on a bench and there was a space between Dawson and Joey. I said that we (Jack/Kerr and I) weren't good enough friends for an excited high five. I put my hands up to Dawson and he grinned and did a double high five (crossing our hands over), pretending to be excited. We laughed and I was thinking that his smile was adorable. I sat between he and Joey and he jokingly moved away so I moved towards Joey and then we both moved back at the same time. There was a 'flash' of us sleeping next to each other and we were in the same position. I was then in a car with Mom and Ezra and we were talking about The Beatles and I said that I was sick of them now (from playing Rock Band). A song was playing on the radio that I didn't know and then Even the Nights Are Better was on. Mom wanted to go to Mexico to do something to do the car and we were going to drive there. I said I didn't want to go because it was a really long drive, saying ""it takes like 10 hours to get to America"". I was then at home and Darren was doing some homework about causes on the media and stuff about drinking and celebrities and things that promote 'closing'."
"3047"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) I was on my bed with a lady, Verity at the end and I was in the middle against the wall. Michelle Williams and James Van Der Beek were talking on another bed next to mine. The lady mentioned rats and Verity was like 'are those the small creatures that eat mice?"". She said ""I live in Italy and I sit on the steps"", to explain her lack of common knowledge. She asked if they could grow so big that [something I can't read, but basically really big] and I laughed and said that it was the minimum size. I looked over at Michelle and she was sitting, holding her legs up into the air and she had no pants on. I pointed it out to the person next to me and we realized her and James were both naked. Michelle saw us looking and she said ""we had sex"". Then she was sitting next to me and referred to him as Dawson and I said that's funny that you call him Dawson. There was a book about Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Joey were in a car 'years' later. They were dressed up to go to a dinner with some important people for Dawson. It was from his point of view and it said ""I'm on a date with her"". He looked over at her and thought she looked good and he was thinking 'I bet I can win this bet' and then it said he didn't. They had stopped somewhere and had sex ""twice"". It said their ""nephrons"" were in close proximity. The next page started ""after I jesm"" and that he felt relaxed. I woke up at home later. My computer was hanging off my door (which was normal). Mom was talking to Poppa and saying that she tries to keep up with events and wanted to see them. Then Nana and Poppa came into my room. I remembered my dream and they left and they wanted to go to an expensive cooking class. I was patting Spaceman."
"3048"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) Some people from university and school and I were sitting on a bench which was connected to the wall of a building. I was next to Verity who left after a while. She came back with two huge bowls of kiwi fruit. Everyone took some and started eating it. I got my phone out to take a photo of the bowl. There was a clock on the wall above us which wasn't working. I asked this foreign guy to get this tray for me which had batteries. He did and said something about his friend. There was no battery holder in the clock and I asked Verity and she said she had broken it. I sat back down and Elijah sat down next to me. Verity was then collecting confessions. I got up but came back as Elijah was writing his confession. He gave it to Verity and she wrote something down and handed me a bit of paper which said ""he really likes you"". I was then watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson was on a movie set with Todd. He was only a props guy or something. He was angry with the movie because it was taking so long and all they were doing at the moment was building a house for it. He yelled at someone and said ""fucking"" and I thought that it was odd for Dawson's Creek to have swearing. He yelled at Todd with a play on words of the movie to say that it sucked. Then he went to yell at some lower level people. I was on Facebook which was different. I had messages from Elijah and different things. The ones from Elijah were now from Selena. One of them mentioned some show that Donald Faison was on and he had left it, but then came back and then it was worse."
"3049"	"(2009-09-19 (18)) I was at Nana's. The cage outside had kittens and puppies in it. One of the puppies was really pretty and had long floppy ears. I was in the computer room and it started raining. All these people came to the door to get in from the rain. Nana let them in. I left the room. Ezra was watching a movie. I heard him say ""Alejandro"" and I went into the lounge room and he was sitting on the floor. I sat down there with one towel around my top half. They were watching a movie with some lady and I asked if it was Adaptation and it was. I said it was lame and didn't make sense. At the end, this black guy said ""PC!"" and I said ""Pacey!"". I asked Nana if I could play with the kittens. I went out and the puppies were gone. I went into the cage and it was small. Later, some people ran into the house (or someone was already there) and they turned off the power. Nana joked that we didn't have something I can't remember now, but stuff that people used to turn off power in the movies. We wondered why the power was out and then we realized it was to turn off the ""security system"". We ran into the hall to turn it back on. This agent lady went out and said Walter (Fringe) was at the gate. Peter (Fringe) was with us but I didn't know who Walter was. We saw cars coming and Peter said we should just leave, but there were people at every exit. Peter and Joey (Dawson's Creek) were in the laundry and I left. I went to go back but there was a girl outside the kitchen window with a big mouth/teeth. Outside the laundry door, Joey had earlier placed a pool, so the girl couldn't get around. We grabbed some toys and we opened the door and left. I gave the toys to Peter. We got in my car which was in the carport. My computer had a Supernatural wallpaper. I was watching Dawson's Creek, but it was actually a movie with Joshua Jackson. There was also some movie which had happened in real life, but was slightly different. This girl (who had been me) looked at him and he realized he kind of liked her (he had no wife or anything)."
"3050"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I was watching Fringe. Olivia was on a train. Sometimes it was me. This lady said something to her. Olivia showed a girl pictures of these 'aliens'. The aliens were two children with big blue eyes. They had been caught holding hands. I was helping Autumn study for the chemistry exam. We were in a toilet at a university. I was trying to get her to write formulas on her hand. She went into a cubicle and started pooping. I heard her sniffle and I coaxed her out and said we had to leave. Dan (One Tree Hill) was working at the university, but then he was Dad and we passed him as we left. We ran to class. It was 10.24, or at least 24 past something and the exam was at half past. We got to class on time and this popular girl got in trouble and the teacher said something about blowjobs. Later I was playing Guitar Hero or something and there were lots of notes for the song. I had to hold down 3 buttons at a time. There were different versions, such as one where you play as jumpers and all the notes move around. I was then watching Queer as Folk and they were talking about some girl and Tom Cruise and which they preferred. Brian said he preferred the girl and Emmett said he preferred Tom Cruise."
"3051"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I was watching a movie. This girl was friends with a guy who liked her. They were on a plane with some other guy, who started having a rant and then paused and then said ""that's my angry rant"". His name was Andrew and he had shot his father. They were at his house and he walked outside and buried his father. His house was weird. The front door was a gate outside. I locked it, but I could still jump over the bits on the side. I was then at a shop with Mom. There was a Mickey Mouse bath mat which was the same as one that we had years ago (not in real life). Ezra was with us. Then Mom and I wanted to go to the markets and it was Sunday. They were all closed though. Mom met a friend there. They hugged and kissed and gave Mom a box of Fruit Loops, but we left it on the floor because we didn't want it and some kids took it. Later we were outside a petrol station with Mom and a girl friend of hers. We were talking about birthdays and I said that ""I like to play with myself"" (as in gaming). They joked about what I said and started saying I needed to find a guy to service my needs and I said that I don't get sexual urges, ""I'm asexual"". We then were having a conversation about Dawson's Creek and she said they looked so much better in later seasons, especially James Van Der Beek. I said that I thought the opposite, saying ""Katie Holmes looked like she was sick in the beginning, like anemic and tired. Every time I saw her I was like 'geez, she looks tied', now I think 'oh look there's Joey'"". I said that Dawson had weird hair but looked better then and that Jack was fug to begin with, but then he got better, but that ""I don't even like the guy [actor] "". I said that ""Andie"" (Angie) always looked the same. I said Jen went back and forth and ""Joshua Jackson's forehead annoys me"". I was also watching Dawson's Creek at one point and Joey and Jen were in a kitchen and it kept cutting away at certain points so we couldn't tell who had slept with who. I had to write theory at a party."
"3052"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I woke up from Mom and this guy talking loudly. They said it was 7am, but it was actually 11:30. My phone said 8:40. She had been cleaning up and had chucked a heap of boxes in my room with 'my' stuff in them. I took them all back out. She was standing in a towel and was annoyed about me moving the stuff back. Ezra had bought this blow up chair with doopy things coming out and it was motorized and dangerous in races? It was blue. We went to the shop where this guy friend of Mom's used to work as he supplied us with the chairs. When we got there I asked Ezra what his name was and he said ""Silvio"". There were other people we didn't know working and they told us it was dangerous. I was sitting on it and bouncing around. We walked into some girl shop. As we left this group of girls pointed and laughed at him and he threw the chair at them. This other girl hit him and he punched her. I said ""you totally head crabbed those girls"". We went into this shop right next to the exit (around the corner from where he punched the girl). Ezra was talking to the guy about some shirt and asked if it was the 'same'. The guy was Jared Padalecki. I was going to ask him for a photo but was waiting for the right time. Ezra didn't seem to notice who he was. Supernatural was playing on a TV in the shop. Dean and Autumn were at a clothes shop and it was a new episode. I was about to ask if it was weird watching it when I got a tap on the back. It was some lady and she said her husband was going to make her eat a horn and something else and needed someone to watch and wanted me to follow her and I said hell no. She kept insisting and Jared said he'd go, but the lady said no she wanted me. I was later reading a list of Brad Pitt's favourite movies. They were mostly weird ones I hadn't heard of, but also had Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Get Real."
"3053"	"(2009-09-20 (18)) I was at a shop. I was looking for a dress to wear to some event. I was friends with Jensen Ackles and Sophia Bush. Jensen was my date or something and Sophia was helping me look for a dress. Most of the clothes were gone though. Bethany Joy Lenz had a shirt which was the same one I was wearing. It was purple with flowers. The shops were closing and I looked in this other shop but they had nothing."
"3054"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) I was watching a movie. There was a young nerdy guy in a street and I realized it was Jared Padalecki and I pointed it out to Ezra and I said something I can't read and we laughed."
"3055"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) I was in a library like room. I read Paths of Glory and the movie had George Clooney in it, but then it was Bruce Campbell. I went to class and sat at a desk and they were collecting something that I can't read. I had six and someone took some and then I had three. Some girl mentioned Gossip Girl and I followed on saying ""is retarded, yeah"" and people laughed. There was something about a pack which had effects and something about a murderer."
"3056"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) I woke up and got on Facebook. I had a message from Nana about having burnt my birthday cake and then another later because I hadn't replied. I was then in her kitchen and she saw me and I said I was just about to reply. We talked for a bit and then brought me into the dining room to give me my present. It was a chocolate maker. I had to try it a few times because the chocolates would 'age' quickly. You had to put cocoa, flour, etc into this little shape; it looked like a spade (from a card). You left it for a few seconds and then took it out and hold the short ends together, then rip them off and hold it. It turned grey and we had to chuck it out (it usually happened to the first few). My tooth was hurting so I looked in the mirror and I had teeth coming through under my teeth on both sides. I told Nana I had to leave soon because I had to study for my chemistry exam. I called Mom and a lady answered the phone. I said ""it's Izzy"" and she said ""hey... nanna?"" and I said ""daughter"" and she said oh and mentioned a crazy one (she was Mom's secretary or something) and I said not that one. She said Mom was at Uptown shop. Ezra was with me too. We left and I got a call from Dad asking about exams. We went to Mom's work, which was on the side of the street along with other shops. We went in and waited. All the workers there left alphabetically. The secretary lady saw us and she asked for an explanation because her last name was ""Wayas"" and I said Mom's was ""Wyatt, yeah!"". Then the other daughter was there and she was Michelle Trachtenberg, I said something to her. She had accidentally married some guy. We waited in the car and it was making strange noises. We ended up driving down the street and turned it onto a bridge to park. We went into the middle of like a park and this net came over us. There were a few people there and we were no longer in the car. There were little red and blue balls shooting up. It was then a TV show. I thought it was lame. Then it was a game and to get out you had to go through this hole which got smaller? People got angry when you left. Someone started doing something weird and I got a call on my phone, a picture of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson was on there (as they were calling), but I called them Kenny vs. Spenny. Rik sounded just like Richie (Bottom). He said not to do it."
"3057"	"(2009-09-21 (18)) There was a kid and Locke (Lost) and two others were after him. They wanted him for bad stuff, except for Locke. They went into a shop and the kid saw the guy in the mirror and ran out. There were trying to think where a kid would hide. They went to a daycare and found a $5 note, a pencil and a wallet. They looked at a note which was actually a picture the kid had drawn. They said it was of the 'Queen' (which was like some monster). I was playing a tutorial of some game. I was walking with others outside and it was night and we were standing in light. There were creatures around and our lights went out. We ran. We made it to this room which was like a safe room before we had a fight. We had to fill our shoes up with milk. We were wearing futuristic armour and our shoes were like high up. There was a little thing on our neck with stuff to shoot and lights. To stock up on weapons and stuff, we had to play Guitar Hero and collect stuff as they fell. Eugene was there too. He had stuffed up somehow and I was making sure he was ready. You had to chuck lights too and you could only hurt the creatures when they were in the light (they were like shadows). Mom text me saying she didn't have to work tomorrow because it wasn't going to be sunny or something."
"3058"	"(2009-09-22 (18)) I was watching Dawson's Creek. Joey was at Dawson's. She left at night. She got Dawson to ride his bike down the street (they lived in a suburb/city street) to make sure nothing happened. Then he came back to his house. This guy across the road yelled out to him and started coming towards him. Dawson ran up these steps in front of his house and locked this door behind him (it was still part of the path to his house). The guy tried to unlock it but then realized he could just walk around it (it was just a door, no fence). I was inside with Grams. The next morning she said she hadn't seen him. I went outside and he was lying on the ground with a bloody mouth. I helped him in. His nails were heavily bitten and I said ""that's adorable!"". The lady across the street was having a go at him, because the guy who had beaten up Dawson was her son and had told her that Dawson had actually beaten him up. His sister was faking it too. She yelled at us and I yelled back and said ""fuck"". Later, her son called her a slut and whore and I said that I've never even said those words and I probably haven't heard Dawson swear. I said that maybe five times in my life I'd gotten angry and she realized that her kids had lied. I got a text from Dad, and I had a new phone and the buttons only appeared when you were pressing them, but you got Foxtel on it. He said that I had won a recycling bin scholarship at State University. I was then home, or at least I assumed it was home. Ezra was watching TV with some mates. Chris Barrie was on the TV and I said ""Chris Barrie for the win!"". This guy there said he'd seen Mulholland Dr. and I said that I was cool enough to watch movies because I wanted to and ""David Lynch owns"". I argued with the guy for a bit and I said Stanley Kubrick was the best director. He said that Spielberg sucked and I said his movies are ok, but that he wasn't a good director and then he said ""Why are we arguing about movies?"" and I said ""there's only like three things worth arguing about and that's one of them"". The show with Chris Barrie was about him having travelled to some place and he had painted his face with some black stuff called 'slat'. I was studying for chemistry later and there was stuff about femur, mitosis and meiosis and tigers (but we could leave that stuff out)."
"3059"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I was playing Beatles Rock Band. There was a really hard song which was going really fast and I was playing on hard."
"3060"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I woke up and I could hear Mom giggling, like 'stop it'. Then she started moaning and saying ""don't stop moving"", and then finished off. I was grossed out by it. I turned around to go back to sleep. I had a bag with me and chipped the wall. Something had a kebab thing in it and there was mayonnaise and it was on my bed. There was a video of a Paul McCartney concert and this guy was in the audience looking bored."
"3061"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I got my chemistry exam results back and it all added up to 73%, but they hadn't done the multiple choice yet. I text Mom to tell her. I was annoyed about the low mark. I thought it may go down yet, from the multiple choice."
"3062"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) I liked some guy, but went out with someone else instead. We went to a hotel and had sex. We ended up breaking up so I could go out with the other guy and I said to him, ""there's something I should tell you, I'm not a virgin"". He was like ""what..?"" and realized I had slept with the other guy. I said I didn't plan it, it just happened. Then it was Dawson's Creek and Joey and this guy were talking in bed and she said ""you said you didn't... and I don't know what that means"". He said he didn't enjoy himself. She had recorded it and he found it. Then I was watching One Tree Hill and someone ran a restaurant and was looking for plates and went to Nathan, even though he had never gone to the restaurant. Haley was fat."
"3063"	"(2009-09-23 (18)) Granny had some underground thing with people they used to feed the poor. I saw her pouring oil and singing into the drains (it was night, in some spooky American like neighbourhood). Then Cartman (South Park) followed her and people who were sick got put on this big stone and cooked, there were about four there. Granny was there with other people. I was at a party like thing with Mom. Margarita came up to me and said something mean and I ignored it. Later there was a big cheesecake like cake and it was from KFC and had almonds. I showed it to Dad. It looked really fattening and this guy said it was $50. Hilarie Burton was actually from here, and her and some guy came back and were playing at the beach. Margarita came back to me and apologized and mentioned me having kissed Duane and said my secret was safe with her. I was now Haley (One Tree Hill) and she had a friend who could read minds. They called her and said she had dreamt that she was in a car and something bad happened. She said Nathan did that, but ignored it. She was then in a car with Jamie and they crashed into a building."
"3064"	"(2009-09-24 (18)) I was in the chemistry exam. Mr Reilly was supervising. I had done the short answers and stuff already but we all needed to do the multiple choice. I hadn't done the extended answer, so I was going to do that when he gave it back, but he had already marked that section. I had gotten 80% for short answer, 70% for calculations and nothing for the extended answer. I finished the multiple choice and Calvin handed it up for me. The teacher left the room for a second and Melodie and some others started telling the others the answers. We waited while he marked them. We were all silent and I saw Spaceman and I said ""Spaceman!"". I was going to text Mom to get me but I didn't. I got 82.5%. I had the back sheet and it looked like Eugene's, and it had a Flickr ID and I was going to check it out when I got home."
"3065"	"(2009-09-24 (18)) I was at a shop. I had a bag with some matchboxes and a big box of them and a bag with pants. I lined up at the counter. Someone was before me. Then it was 5pm and everyone left and I was like 'aw'. I walked out and the alarm went off so I chucked the matchboxes in the bin. My car was small and a baby green colour. I couldn't find it and it was dark. Mom and Ezra came and Ezra went to look in one section and Mom drove around. I went along side her but in another section. I ended up at like a construction site. I thought I saw the car a while away but there were some dodgy guys around. Some where near me too. They started chasing us. I attacked them and I think I had a pole. I got through them and went to the car. Mom was in the front seat and I thought they had killed her and I opened the door and she turned and her eye had been cut out. Her lip was bloody. She didn't know what was going on and I moved her to the back seat. I started to drive and it went backwards and I realized they had changed the controls and it went weird. I got onto the road, which was like a freeway and they were chasing us. I managed to get off and then I was somewhere else and not in the car. There were tunnels and monsters. Each tunnel was small and led to a 'cave' (like a dungeon in World of Warcraft) with the next set of monsters. Some were like spiders. I attacked them and moved on. One of them was like a lion. At first I tried to kill it but then Ezra pet it and it purred and calmed down. We got it to understand that we were on a team and we had to attack all the other stuff. Then it was a movie and Michael Rosenbaum, James Van Der Beek, Ryan Kelley [I was doing my Wiki last night] and Devon Sawa were in it. It was like Final Destination. I thought it was odd that Devon was in another one. Michael was bald still and I thought it was weird that Ryan Kelley and others from Smallville were in it. One bit was them sitting at a table in this room and Devon saw a chandelier above them and thought it was going to do something. It sparked and one of the bits fell onto the guy next to him. I was saying to myself, ""how did he die [in the first Final Destination] ? Oh, it was between movies and brick in the face"". Then some guy got a brick in his face. In the background, James Van Der Beek and his mother from Dawson's Creek were there. I said ""look at Dawson"" and he was like 'can I go home now?'"
"3066"	"(2009-09-25 (18)) I was at home and I had been studying. I got distracted and Ezra and I found extras that came with a movie. We had to plug a cord into a slot of something. I was about to go to bed and I heard someone like "" [something] thing is in the respiratory system"" and trying to break in. I went to my room and they did break in. I called out to Darren ""someone's in the respiratory system"" and he was like 'go away'. They said like ""shit!"". Darren refused to believe me and Mom encouraged him to believe me. Then he got up but the guys were long gone. I said I would never joke about that, ever. There was a movie with Kevin Kline and he and a bunch of others were like spies or something. Their names depended on where they did stuff, eg, Ms Solomon and some guy ended with ""aizal"". Some others called Beason and Eastland. Kevin liked this girl called Izzy. I was annoyed at how Americans say my name. His black friend said he should ask her out. It was The Big Chill like. Then James Van Der Beek and a friend were at a table. He liked the guy (he was gay), but he was young and I said ""what is he, 12?"". Then it was a movie and there were zombies. We were in a room and at first there was only one zombie but then there were heaps. I called the guy down and I was in like a storage section of a food shop and said to bring weapons like brooms, but he got killed. The movie was in stages and the next bit showed a zombie waking up and this young guy was going around the shop. James and a friend watched. This girl was having a smoke on a bench that his friend liked."
"3067"	"(2009-09-26 (18)) I woke up and I was in bed with Eugene and he unclipped my bra. I decided to go downtown. I started walking but forgot I had to go on the freeway. I called Mom to get me and take me there and she took like two seconds to get there. She came with Ezra and they had two cars. We had to get help from someone to get them both back. There was a movie where this girl got accused of digging out her dead grandmother and she was having an affair with some guy (she was accused by his wife). Then it was Dawson's Creek. Jen, some teacher guy and I were there. He wondered who could get into this room first. I had seen someone do it in a previous episode. Then it was just me there and Jen and Joey were in the other room. I had to get Jen out and distract her so Joey could do something. I saw Dawson and was going to ask him to do it, but he was involved in another part of the plan. I went there and said ""Can I talk to you Jen?"" and we walked outside. We walked past classrooms. I was trying to find somewhere to stand outside the view of the students. I didn't know what to talk about, but I brought her to a shelf with those water cooler bottles and asked her to help me with one. She did. We walked back, with her walking backwards but she kept looking behind her. I saw Jack with a guy hanging around. Jen started to suspect I was luring her out and I got my phone out to text Joey to get back and she thought that was what I was doing so I started smiling and she thought it was a guy I was texting and asked who it was. I saw Joey and Dawson run down the path next to us (separated by a block of classrooms). When we got back they had only just run in, laughing and Joey fell. Jen got upset and told me. I said ""I never liked you"". I said I watched the show and from the beginning I never liked her because ""you stole Dawson and I liked you for a bit in season three and four"" and when she was friends with Jack, but then she stole Dawson again. I mentioned her sleeping with every guy she met. I also mentioned Jensen Ackles and she was like ""your man"" and I thought we must've been dating. I apologized to her."
"3068"	"(2009-09-26 (18)) I was with Dawson, Jack, Joey and Jen (all from Dawson's Creek) in a dorm or something. This guy came in and said he just got tested for HIV and we should too. We decided to do it now. We got to the front of the building and realized Dawson wasn't with us. We kept going. It was night. There was a van in the middle of the carpark and it had this big gun looking needle and you had to do it yourself. Joey and Jack went first and put ice all over their arm to numb it. Jack said it would hurt like hell in the morning. I decided not to do it. Jen anxiously waited for her turn. Then I decided to do it. I got in the back of the car and asked Jack what to do. He said to make a small cut on my hand, so I tried but I couldn't get it big enough so I asked what next. He told me about the ice. Then there was this thing where Jack had written about the experience and someone had said the hard thing wasn't the pain but being tested."
"3069"	"(2009-09-26 (18)) I went to university to do something quickly. I walked out and I saw Jamison. I said ""Jamison? You take the train?"". It was dark there. I ran to the bus. They left the door open and I had to stand right near it and I almost dropped my phone. There was an elevator at the train station (and it was inside and not train station like at all) and Sineita was in it. It was clear and went sideways and fast. When I got off, I ran down the escalator to get the train. I got in, but it was a stingy carriage. It was really small, crowded and dark (there were no lights). I saw a cat jump onto the track. We stopped at Stirling, which was Belmont, and then went back to Westland. I called Mom and I had a text from Ezra about Guitar Hero and a book. Also, the train had finished at Stirling as it was a new thing because not enough people were using the stations past Stirling."
"3070"	"(2009-09-27 (18)) I was at dads. I was getting ready to go somewhere. I got there and stayed by myself. It was like a 2.5 hour drive. I was in a big room and there were no curtains (just those frilly things). I was watching a movie that was 2.5 hours in and still had 2.5 hours left. It was dark and rainy/stormy outside and I saw shadows of people. I text Dad telling him to drive here now. He sent back saying 'you scared?'. I went to this other building with some people while I waited. There was this guy there who I kind of liked. I thought people were watching us unlock the door and then we had to put this thing out so no-one could get past. Then Ezra was there and we had to do it again because we had to let him through. Then it was 4am and I text Mom to say Dad still wasn't here."
"3071"	"(2009-09-28 (18)) I woke up and my room was different. There was a lizard on the floor. I went to call someone, but accidentally took photos of it. I got a call from Ezra and I said ""you sound like a girl"" and then they said ""It's Tracey"". It was a friend of Ezra's. I was then in the lounge room and there were a bunch of us. The lizard came and we tried to scare it away but it wouldn't go. I was squealing. Ezra was playing a game and smoking."
"3072"	"(2009-09-28 (18)) I went past dads to get something. I was with Mom, Darren, Ezra, Ando (Heroes) and another friend of Ezra's. We were going to get my car too. There were drugs on the breakfast bar. We left and it was squishy in the car (Ezra, Ando and I were in the back), but we decided to go like that. I was next to Ando and his foot was touching my foot and moving up and down. I was thinking that we secretly liked each other. We got to this place and there were lots of escalators all connected that went really fast. They also turned and went straight, etc. We got to the top and I went off with Mom. It was like a market. She was looking at the clothes, which were all really small and I said ""only Asians can fit into these"". There were some mystery bags for $4.50. We got one and all it had were seven packs of cheap gloves. We met up with Ezra and he had my water bottle and there was only a little bit left. There was a cabinet with stuff for sale and one of them was a fat lady's head which was in the corner in the dark. There were some people on the ground reading. Then I worked for some people who were aliens. They took over and were rounding up random people. I had to go with them for a while. There were people dressed in costumes and had to climb up this wall. The aliens showed us all this game -- I had to work out how to get a basketball into the hoop (it was like a computer game). I did it by chance and this guy was angry with me for not using math to work it out. Then everyone was normal. I went into this computer room and saw this guy doing something on a computer and I asked what it was and he said he was looking for his soul mate. It cost 1000 credits and it went through all the people here and he said it was because he was bored and I said 'fair enough', since there was nothing else to do. I wandered off and this guy was running crazily down the hall, going down and then back. There was a hot guy on a computer in a hall that got my attention. He looked a bit like Joshua Jackson. I told him about the soul mate thing and he only had 300 credits. There was a sheet that had George Harrison on it. There was a list of the people and I saw Gavin and Terrence on there along with other people I knew. I found my name but it was my 'original' name and it started with a K (or maybe an E, it's hard to read) and my last name was Mueller."
"3073"	"(2009-09-29 (18)) I was going out with Eugene and knew Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. They were both from different comics and Jensen was Batman and Jared was Superman. I was good friends with them but I was interested in Jensen. We eventually had sex. I woke up in his bed. I saw Jared later and he knew what had happened and I was sitting with him and he said that he understood that ""you weren't overcome with the urge to screw me"" and I was like ""yeah..."" and took a drink, thinking 'not quite!'. He was angry and didn't pick up on it. I was then climbing along a wall at night. I was trying to get into a friends house. He let me in. We were going to expose something. I was discussing comics with Ezra. He and Mom were sleeping in the same room. I borrowed her phone."
"3074"	"(2009-09-29 (18)) Sylar (Heroes) was killing people for their powers again, but he was sometimes John Lithgow and sometimes me. He was in a carpark and the cops were looking for him. He grabbed a kid and walked off (to look like a parent and not get noticed). He went into a building and he knew who had what power, but couldn't do so much at once. He would use mindreading to make everyone not nice. He went into a shop and this girl said the money was in the back (to give to him when he returned someone). He went to get it and went crazy again. He cut open some snake looking thing and was trying to convince people that it didn't hurt it. There was a dog cut open and he cried saying that when he returned it he would get money for being a hero, but it was hard for him."
"3075"	"(2009-09-30 (18)) On Facebook, Dmitri had said ""Dmitri says: Alana and I just spent a few hours in a hotel room"". He had lots of comments and some were from and about Calvin and Elijah. He had also uploaded new photos and they didn't even look like him. I was at school at an assembly. I went back in time to when Gramps was alive and he was there (still at the assembly). I saw Noah Bennet (Heroes) in the crowd and I said it was weird seeing him 'normal'. I sat down with my laptop at the front next to the wall, not on the steps. I was going to get on the network and take any photos they had. There was a small TV in front of me and this girl next to me said Diesel was playing. She mentioned Sausalito Summernight and I thought she said it wrong. I said that I liked Down in the Silvermine too. It played an advertisement with Aunt Sally from years ago. I recorded it with my phone. I was then in their house and it was decorated for Christmas and looked nice. I said to Gramps that I was from ""2009. End of 2009"". He 'knew' that I was telling him the truth. I also told him that he was dead. I left the house and got picked up by Dad and Ezra. Ezra took the laptop and went with Gramps. I went with Dad. He took me to the old house. I was waiting to leave and I saw Tigger and Mittens and a black cat on the breakfast bar. They were really skinny and we were out the back. I turned the lights on and it was evening. I asked if I could feet the cats and he said he was going to ask me to. I emptied the old food into the bin and there were maggots in it. One fell on my jumper sleeve and I squealed and got it off and was like ""I'm going to be sick!"".  I cleaned a couple of bowls and then went somewhere. I came back and there was this weird creature on the floor. Ezra was there now. It was like an anteater. Ezra sprayed it with fly spray. It came towards us and I ran into Dad's old room and I was now with Dad. Ezra led it up the hall and it went into my room. It said it could put us to ""sleep"" using anything. Dad opened the door to look and I pushed him out and he fell to the ground asleep. I ran out of the room into the kitchen. I was waiting for it and trying to find some weapons."
"3076"	"(2009-09-30 (18)) I was at a convention thing. I was in a shaded part and some people from Heroes were walking past and I saw Zachary Quinto and I was like ""Sylar! Sylar!"". He stopped and took off his sunglasses and waved. Maki Oka also stopped and said hello and I said ""hi Hiro!"". Then I asked him for a photo and he said they couldn't because they were filming. He walked off, but a short time later he and James Kyson Lee came back and said they weren't filming yet. I stood between them and got a friend to take the photo and then another one. I went to this food place that looked very market-y and Asian-y and cheap like. There was lots of rice. Masi stopped the guy serving and let all the people eat for free. Hilarie Burton and someone were there. She got into a fight and was upset and angry and was living in the food place. I was then at university which was random and different. I had to go back for a bit but I couldn't remember what day it was or what class I had. I went up some steps to go to chemistry. The teacher there gave us our marks. I got 89.8%, which was a tie with this other guy and someone got 91% and another got 100%. I text Dad telling him my result. Evelyn was there and had done society and environment and got 55%. Elijah was there too. Some girls in the class were pregnant and were excused from some stuff. Then I was watching some show where this girl would appear in places randomly and so was always wearing different things, etc. Then it was me and I saw Simba at this vet place. I pet him and was then like ""is this Simba?"" and the vet guy said ""I dunno but he's bleeding to death"". I said ""Oh my God it is Simba!"". He had been taken in for problems like that. I was sad about Simba, but thought we could replace him with Tigger. Then it was the girl again. She was also bleeding. Then I was watching Heroes and Sylar turned up at some friend's house saying he would give them a 'freebie'. She flew him to the next building. Parkman was helping him with something. I ended up on a plane with Ezra. I was spying on some people for the police. Then this cop decided to crash the plane. It was bumpy and we fell out of our seats. We landed on the freeway. It had almost stopped and Ezra and I got out. We laughed because we were the first out. I realized it had all been planned."
"3077"	"(2009-10-01 (18)) Calvin and I were hanging out. He was reading some of my dreams. I had this big board and it said ""I love"" and the next bit was covered by another board. They got separated and it said ""Mr Nixon"". I grabbed them to cover it up and he was trying to look at it then Mr Nixon walked past. There was a dream about Dmitri and I was waiting for Calvin to say something, but he didn't."
"3078"	"(2009-10-01 (18)) This girl had taken a photo of her family and some famous people, including Deborah Kara Unger, in some setting. Something to do with this caused her to get an unlimited supply of drugs from Bob (Seth Rogen in Dawson's Creek). She decided to go get some, but then it was different and he was actually stalking her or something. He ended up chasing her on a bike. Then she was like his half sister or something. She went to a college or something and his full sister went there and looked exactly like her. She went to her room and locked herself in. He tried to get through the window (it was on the second floor or so). Then he was Charlie and she was Dee (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia). She was going to help him through and then she saw his sister sitting across from the window (it was like an alley just outside her window, and she was sitting on the wall across from the window). She climbed down and there were bags of alcohol, onions and bread. She climbed up with some alcohol to join her. She said she was leaving and something I can't read. Either before or after, we took a car and it was normal, but we were in America. The brakes were dodgy and it was hard to slow down. I was trying to stay on the road and drove into a shop and then through the car park and there were lots of people."
"3079"	"(2009-10-01 (18)) I had a collection of Pokemon cards. I got some rare one because Mom bought it. It was expensive and you couldn't get it any other way. Darren was annoyed about it, but eventually gave it to me. I said it evolved from Crobat."
"3080"	"(2009-10-02 (18)) I was at dads. I went out the back and Darren was wearing a towel and Mom was out there getting clothes for him hurriedly and I asked what was happening. They said Darren might have taken the wrong ""truck"" (though it was a van). We heard someone pull up and we went out to check and it had pulled up next door. I can't remember how it started but we had to get to the guy before he found us or whatever. He was killing people, I think. Darren walked up the street looking for him. My car was in the driveway. I got in the back and Dad was in the passenger seat and Ezra was in the driver's seat, but Dad was controlling it at the moment. Mom was behind the car and they were close to hitting her and I said to watch out but they kept going and ran over her. I was like 'what the hell are you doing?!'. I told Ezra to stop but they said no. We backed out into the street and she was lying on the driveway and I said to Ezra to get out of the driver's seat and he was like ""yeah right and listen to your music"". I said ""I don't care about the radio!"". He took off and I saw Darren up the street and he looked like he had been hit and I said to stop because it looked like the guy's van in a driveway, but they still refused. There were other signs of the guy but they ignored me. I was really upset and angry and I said to Dad ""after I finish packing I never want to see you again!"". There was lots of wide stuff on the roads, palm fronds etc. Dad said he'd heard about stuff happening on the radio and I said that Mom had mentioned a bad storm coming earlier. Eventually they stopped, but it was too far away for me to get back home. I went into a shop and they left. There was now an apocalypse happening. It was partly my fault, I think. I had powers, like I could generate heat from my hands. The best way was to hold a small bean bag tightly and I made flames. I was in the DVD section and I was trying out my powers. I met up with a 9 year old girl who was quite pretty and knew about what was happening. There was some lava on the ground, which was coming from behind an aisle and it was like a slug. My hand got red, but there were no flames. A mother and her young daughter came along and asked if some movie was here and I said ""no... try here again tomorrow"" and the girl smiled and her mother said ""that's the most inspiring thing I've ever heard"" and I thought 'that doesn't even make sense' and the girl hugged her. They went away. I told the girl I was with that I wish I didn't know an apocalypse was happening tomorrow. We went down a back hall and Mom was now in the all of the loading dock. We walked there but she wasn't there and I said ""I don't know if that's a good or bad thing that she's not here"". There was some show, that I think was called ""You Look Young -- 59"", or something to that effect. There was a guy with two kids and it was quite funny. He was high and the cops were outside. He sent his kids out and then they were either with or were Cartman and Kyle (both from South Park) and they were singing? Kyle stole the driver's door from a car and they left (I think)."
"3081"	"(2009-10-02 (18)) I was on a plane. This German lady asked me how to ask for tickets to see a pyramid and she said she knew how to say that she had pajamas. I saw Ms Bigwood on there. Sometimes I was with Joshua Jackson, who was young. I said jokingly, ""I hate that Pacey guy, every time I see his face I just want to vomit"". He looked at me and we started laughing. Later, I was at home and Ezra had knocked on my door but it was locked. I was getting dressed and when I was done, I said come in. I was watching Supernatural and I had it paused on Sam making a face, so I unpaused it and paused it again on Dean. No-one came in. I continued watching then I heard a scraping and he and Mom came in suddenly. I was like 'what the hell?!'. They were looking around and they implied that they were looking for proof that I was masturbating. I was like ""uh... right, can you go now I'm trying to watch Supernatural"". They kept coming into my room so I didn't leave the room. The mailbox had Nurofen and other drugs in it."
"3082"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) There was a book and a movie about some criminal. I told Nana about it and she had seen it. It was about some girl who was living in a small town after running away and she had changed her name, etc. This guy there had started getting suspicious."
"3083"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was watching Supernatural, but I can't remember it now. Then, Ezra and I were outside at night. Jared Padalecki was walking down a path and Ezra went running down there, then freaked out and went the other way. We laughed. There was a big net thing, which you could hang on (like in the army training). I was hanging from it and it was hurting my fingers, so I had to keep getting off. Jensen Ackles was on there with Jared. I was then at a shop with Mom and Ezra. We were at the checkout and she asked ""want anything else?"" and I said ""just my other stuff"". There was a small hole to exit the shop and I realized we wouldn't fit."
"3084"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was at the library at university but it was different and was very neat. I bought a blanket because the toilet had scanners and it was to cover you up with. Everyone in the library was talking about sex. I got the lady to scan something to check and I said it was my first day and she was confused. I left and was looking for my car then I remembered that I take the train. I ran across to the road and there were buses going both ways (on the same lane). I ran for a bit then walked up to the bus stop. There were two buses but they were both full and this guy and I got left out. The bus stop was actually like a bus 'port'. This girl and I started talking and we got on a bus and then we were like 'what bus did we just get on?'. It took us downtown. It was busy and weird. We didn't know where to go. There were food places and she yelled at me because she was hungry. There was an empty pizza packet. To get to the different 'levels' (they all went to different places) you had to go down these weird stairs. There was a rail and then a swirly thing. It was quite high. The girl almost fell and I grabbed her hand, but it slipped and she swung out to stop and she grabbed the rail and climbed down and I said ""I saved your life!"". I grabbed the top of the stairs and let it fall and it dropped me gently to the ground. We still didn't know where to go. We went into a dark hall with more halls leading to places, and there were colourful signs saying ""60's"", ""70's"" and ""80's"". I ran down the 80's one and into the platform. It was colourful and said FancyFire everywhere. I then realized I had no pants on and ran back to the stairs (where they had fallen off) and put them on and got my phone and asked Mom what train station I should get off at. She said Stirling and I said that I meant on a different route. There was lots of yellow in the platform. I was taking photos with my phone. I was then dressed in a yellow bird-like outfit. I found blocks of chocolate and it had three different flavours in one block. Two of them were made of ""boxed flowers"". They tasted odd. Sam (Supernatural) was there and he said he almost died getting them and I joked ""Thanks Sam for dying!"""
"3085"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was watching an episode of some show. This guy had like hundreds of clones of himself, at all different ages. He was about 40 years old. He was a professor and extremely smart. His younger ones were also really smart. This guy thought that he was dodgy and quit his job at a school. The principal, who was black, gave the other guy a job and then this girl found out. She was then Joey (Dawson's Creek). She brought kids over to this house to catch him out. He blew up his house. There was a fountain nearby and this blue guy had a hide-out underneath it. The guy was going to send off some clones to breed to see if the intelligence was passed on."
"3086"	"(2009-10-03 (18)) I was watching Fringe. Peter knew he had died and was trying to explain to his mother. He said that his favourite memory from childhood was actually Doug (Dawson's Creek) and was saying that Walter knew about it. Walter had red and black bits to show how there were two paths for everything."
"3087"	"(2009-10-04 (18)) I was watching the Supernatural auditions. They said that ""originally, Dean was a character with flaws"". Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were both there and they both had goatees, a moustache and long hair. They both wanted to read for the same character and Jared suggested they do both and then swap."
"3088"	"(2009-10-04 (18)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a petrol station. I got out of the car and some petrol spilled out. I went in to get something. There were pets and there were some really cute puppies and kittens and some weird ones (with big eyes). I was like 'there's so many pets, we should go looking for a puppy'."
"3089"	"(2009-10-05 (18)) I was with some lady in a car. She text her boyfriend for sex and then she ran off with him. I went into a house, which was dads old house. It was still furnished, etc. I went to my room and it was dusty."
"3090"	"(2009-10-05 (18)) I was watching an old episode of Supernatural. It was night. Sam ran down a path into a group of black ghosts and he screamed like 'wah!' and ran the other way. Ezra and I were talking about it later. He showed me an episode where the setting 'changed'. I said it was funny that I could read the plot for something and then picture it in my head. Ezra and I said it was the screenwriters fault for the setting change. We were then walking towards a building. The path lit up and was flashing and I said it was morse code. This guy in a car was playing drums and I started doing drumming motions in the air and was thinking that I needed to play Guitar Hero. I went up some stairs to get water from my room. It was pitch black so I used my phone light to see."
"3091"	"(2009-10-05 (18)) I was at home trying to sleep. I closed and locked my door. I managed to fall asleep but woke up like 5 minutes later. Layla was sitting in my chair doing stuff and I said 'get out of my room!' and I slapped her back and pushed her out of my room, asking ""how did you get in here anyway?"". I ate a Mars Bar and then went back to sleep. Later, I had this little ball, which was like the TARDIS; if you opened it, it was bigger inside. I can't remember properly, but I went to the future. The other me didn't like me. She was with a group and they did something but I was never clear what. I was then in a car with some people and this cop friend of mine was driving and he stopped this guy who was walking down the street with a trolley, because he was pushing it the wrong way. I was then at a shop with Eugene, who was my boyfriend. We walked into this area and I had my arm around him and we switched so that we were holding hands. There was a book place getting set up. We had a dog with us. I asked if the shop was Myers and it was. We went into the shop that was actually open and we were walking around. I lost my phone and found it on the floor. We went to this section with beds and then we split up. I walked past this couple who were on a bed and he was masturbating her and she was making a movie of it. I was like 'ok...' and continued along. I left the shop and went to my cop friend. He said ""all you guys went in with 2 and only 1 of you came out alone"". He made us go in to look for Eugene. Then we rang his phone and we heard it ringing in the elevator shaft. Then it was Jared Padalecki down there and he was a bit younger. He was in a section under the elevator chained up. He was trying to break this weak bit of wire above him to get his phone (he was directly under the elevator). He had been captured by aliens. He broke a water pipe to get water. He was let out and he was talking to me about it. He said something about pregnancy and I said ""what did they do to you?!"" and he was like 'oh none of that, just ""scrambled my brains"",'. He said they carefully watched him while he ate. We had encountered these aliens before."
"3092"	"(2009-10-06 (18)) There was this hot guy who I think I was dating. Tony Soprano (The Soprano's) was his best friend. He thought he was alive, but they told him he was dead and he realized. But then they were in a motel room. Tony was under the bed with a slit throat and then he came back to life. We kept telling the guy that he was dead for a while. Then I was in a big pool that had like, beds on the side. It was fancy. He sat next to me and I told him Tony was dead. I was crying and he did too. I leant on his arm. Mom mentioned something about 'strawberry corn field'."
"3093"	"(2009-10-06 (18)) I was going down a street to get somewhere. I went up a hill, which was sandy and there was a car coming and there was a scooter in the way. The car was then a motorbike and I moved the scooter out the way. The guys who owned it came out of some place talking to each other. I left and went into a building. They followed. I kept scaring them down the stairs, but they finally came all the way. One of them was really smart and they were all fairly ok people. Someone asked why I wasn't dating any of them and was like 'they're small!'. One of them was called George. He pat this blind puppy's paw. I got the dog and I asked, ""how do you do it again? George?"". He was talking on MSN. Two guy friends were sharing a house thing (like a flat). There was a gay couple across the road. They got into an argument outside because the gay couple because there was no fence. They were saying that they couldn't raise ""our baby""."
"3094"	"(2009-10-06 (18)) This guy was asked on a date. He was then Pacey (Dawson's Creek). She left him and Joey (Dawson's Creek) was hanging out with him, lying on a bed and said ""why didn't you ask me?"" and he was like ""now I'm on a date with you""."
"3095"	"(2009-10-07 (18)) I was at Nana's. Aunt Sally was over. Sometimes it was Smallville. Clark, Chloe, Ezra and I were messing about. Then something was after us. Chloe and I got into an elevator but it was dodgy. It opened and we jumped out just in time. We hid in a bathroom and waited for someone to come in and scare us. We walked out and then it was real life again. Bryson, Nathaniel and Braden were in the family room. I walked in there because I thought Nana was in there. Bryson was on the computer. There was bubblegum all over the floor. I asked Nathaniel why and he said it was easier and I said to put it on the chair because there was 'less taste of carpet'. I helped them find something and they gave me something and I said ""Thank you for this lovely piece of bread"". It had icing sugar all around the outside of it. I tasted it and it was weird but edible. Aunt Sally had a baby. Suddenly it appeared in front of me and I (?) started chucking coins. Nana said she found my Goosebumps shirt and gave me a packet of Goosebumps stuff. I told her that when I was packing up my stuff I found my Let it Be shirt. I was then in bed trying to sleep. Eugene was next to me and we had a baby boy called Adam. I was thinking that it was weird and that I felt weird. Then people were trying to find something about the IRS or something. I showed them what it looked like online and where they were. There was an accident across the street and we had fake ID's and got in. There was a girl slumped over the computer and this guy said he found that she had fallen from a higher floor. There were lots of people there watching. I was watching The Soprano's later and Tony lost his memory or was confused. Adriana was in FlashForward and this guy was with her called Silvio who she was having an affair with. He eventually killed her in 'Chapter 2'. They were sitting on a rooftop, which was made of glass and was possibly a green house. He was swinging on this thing because he knew he wasn't going to die and she said they had to end the affair."
"3096"	"(2009-10-07 (18)) Eugene and I were out somewhere. We went on a bus and decided to go to England. There was a taxi near the door and all these other people had stopped. We went backwards for a bit. The airport was like a train station but it was inside. The bus drove right in. There were people everywhere. We didn't know where to go. We went into the stairwell and there were lots of doors and more stairs. There was a group of people in there who were on an excursion or something and they were going into a room. We found the place finally. There was a lady at the desk and she asked for our passports. I still didn't have one and I gave her Uncle Wilbur's one. We had a few bags with us. I had Grey with me. I was thinking about backing out, but I wasn't going to."
"3097"	"(2009-10-08 (18)) I had this little thing which I held onto in water and it would go really fast. Sometimes it looked like an iPod. Dad and I had to share a bed somewhere. He was moving and I realized he was masturbating and he finished and then realized I was awake. Later I was at a restaurant. There was a girl called Izzy Riss and she was a real 'goody-goody'. Then the next day I saw her at some place with a rock group and she was acting wild and she didn't recognize me. Then it changed to college band and she told me she could manipulate the environment. I had a scratchie and won $200 on it."
"3098"	"(2009-10-09 (18)) I was at dads. Some stuff was still there, including my computer. I started watching Supernatural and I told Ezra later it was a funny episode. I watched The Big Bang Theory too. John Noble was in a previous episode with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Jared was like a Goth in the episode and I read on a forum, ""Jared paints his nails black"". Dad was at the door and Mom told him to go away but then realized who it was and I let him in. I was about to play Guitar Hero. I asked Dad if he wanted The Big Bang Theory and he said he would download it later."
"3099"	"(2009-10-09 (18)) I went to near Dad's new place. There was a toilet and it was like a seat on a bus and I decided not to go. There was a huge lump of pipes. I started to climb down and I realized I needed to be up (it was on the edge of a platform and went a few meters down). It was pushing me down though. My hands got sore. Some guy who had been in it had blisters. Some guys helped me out. I wanted to contact Mom but nothing was in my pockets. Later, she had a laptop with a webcam. The cops were watching her for illegal downloading. Sometimes it was a show and it was about a lady and her son, who was Shia LaBeouf. There was a game that Dmitri played and he made his name ""LaurenIsAHag"" as a joke and I hit him. Ezra laughed. There was a second movie and they had changed stuff and threatened to close the game and he changed it something else."
"3100"	"(2009-10-10 (18)) I met Jensen Ackles and had sex with him. It was then a gay guy who had had sex with him and Jensen was in a restaurant/cafe. The gay guy walked past and Jensen saw him through the window and stopped him. The gay guy was annoyed. Jensen came out and the guy said ""you fucked me"" but said he didn't want anything to do with him. Then I was watching a video tape of a school. There was lots of tall graffiti on the wall of the gym. Ezra, Mom and Dad were there. Mom took me to Dad's old place and I was out the back with Dad. The house was different though I didn't notice. Some stuff was still there. Nana and Poppa were there. They said to go out the front and put this poster in the bin. There was a door next to the garage doors. Dad yelled at Ezra for some reason. There was a kitten and a puppy on the poster. Nana pulled out a cord and the put it back in and it shocked her. I discovered that Dad had decided to keep the place. I was happy about it. Mittens and Tigger were back there and I pat them. Mittens was meowing [in real life, Cuddles was meowing and it woke me up] ."
"3101"	"(2009-10-10 (18)) I was outside a huge school like building. I knew I was at a school but I didn't know where I was or how I got there. I ended up at this greenhouse thing and went inside. When I went through doors inside the building it would usually teleport me back somewhere. Some people were after me and I was trying to run away but it was hard because of the teleporting and I was quite panicky and frantic. I had a notebook and I knew that I had to write the first things that came to mind on each line. I was running away from the people and I kept stopping to write things in (I had to, but I'm not sure why). Something reminded me of Denny in Grey's Anatomy, so I wrote ""Denny"", then ""Anatomy"". I ran to a room and they were just outside. There were words on the wall such as evolve, different and 'iweizy' but I didn't know what it was. I thought it was cool and a good name for the things in the story I wanted to write. I was trying to write it down so I would remember it when I woke up but then I was watching Suspiria and I was scared and I was thinking 'why am I watching this before bed'. This guy came up to the door of the room (the room I was in, was now in the movie) and the door had a window on it. He started going through it and I screamed. The people eventually got me and they took me to this classroom. There were a few other people in there. There were a few different types of good, such as cupcakes and pancakes. They all had egg in them. I was telling everyone not to eat anything with egg in it. This guy also knew about the dodgy eggs and we started throwing all the food at the wall and window. One of the people came in and asked who did it and we wouldn't tell them. They brought us into a big room that was like a main floor of an office and there were two escalators (without the steps). There were lots of people going up, but only a few going down. They sent us up. I got to the top and saw the room they were sending us to and freaked out and tried to go down the down escalator but it went up too and I was like 'this is impossible!' and some kids who were going down said they were actually still going up (it was an illusion). I gave up and let it take me back up. We were all taken into the room and given puzzles [note: I have been playing on Jigzone lately] . I did a couple but then left to talk to them. One of them looked like Tony Soprano (The Soprano's). I asked him why we had to do puzzles and he said it was to improve memory and the like and I said why not mix it up. I said we were humans and that we needed a break and variety. I could see he was starting to get annoyed at me. I said our fingers are hurting because we've been doing it for so long and that our minds weren't working at full speed. He seemed to consider what I was saying. I pleaded with him to at least tell me why. Also, at one point it showed a highschool football team outside and they couldn't find a door to get in (they also didn't know what was going on) and I told them to find the door that was different. Anyway, he decided to show me a newspaper saying stuff about overpopulation. I was like 'oh' and realized. It said that this country had ""+499"" which was a joke. He flicked through and I also saw that the date was 2004, which was the future (I think it was 1996 or so). There was a picture of them and there were only four and they were all guys. He mentioned that the laws of physics didn't apply at this place and that's why the doors teleported etc. They also had slightly longer foreheads (they were aliens). I said ""But why highschool students? Why not old people and the sick?"". He shrugged and said ""I don't want to get kung fu with a gun"" and I was like ""what?"" and he made a gun with his fingers and said ""a gun"". I said there were other ways of killing them and he said ""I could fuck them"" and I laughed. I realized it had to be done and reluctantly slowly walked back and up the escalator. I was thinking that I was the only person who knew this. I got back to the room and was upset. The other people wondered what was wrong. I ended up going back down and Tony was looking up things that I'd gotten in trouble for. I had gotten in trouble for ""being 48 seconds late to a test because of a punk calculator"". A punk calculator was a normal calculator but it had a lock, like the ones on suitcases with the numbers on the 'wheels'. They went to ""-2"". He looked perplexed about this and I realized they sent any student with a black mark. He told me to go into a room and ""turn left to the water"". I thought he was letting me go because of the stupid reason. There was an open window in the room with the flaps like on toilet/bathroom windows. It was extremely windy and I said ""it's cold... and really windy!"". I thought he would tell me to take a big breath because I had been plucked from the ocean, but he told me to unplug it and let ""the wave of Neptune"" into the place. I realized it would flood the place and as I reached for the plug, he said there wasn't enough time for any of us. I got ready for it and held my breath and pulled it out. The room quickly filled with water and I swam to the top and took a breath. My face was at the ceiling and the water was still rising and when I was fully submerged I let out my breath."
"3102"	"(2009-10-10 (18)) This guy was sleeping with a friend of his called Claire. Her boyfriend was suspicious and showed the guy a video of them having sex to see if he got jealous. She was also sleeping with a girl and there was a video of them using a dildo with two ends. The guy was telling someone about it and that he had had sex with a guy even though he thought that was disgusting. Mom was going for a drive. Ezra and I went along. We saw Lydia, Naomi (who was fat) and another fat girl walking in white shirts and black pants/shorts. I slipped and ended up on top of the car. We all went to the shop, along with Dad. There was an escalator that led to a clothes shop. Safety Dance came on and I started singing it. Ezra showed me photos of us when we were kids and he used to be called Leroy but it was pronounced 'shay shay'. There was a That's Life story about William H. Macy, who was from here. He, a guy and a girl, had dug a hole in this prison cell to get underground. There was a hole in the door and they came up but one hole got closed. The girl was a bit fat and couldn't fit. They all got out though."
"3103"	"(2009-10-11 (18)) I was watching My Bloody Valentine and the killer was actually a werewolf or something. There was a scene in a barn and it threw a shark/bear through the top floor and it got owned. The cops arrested (?) it the next day. Jensen Ackles was there alone later. He heard a noise and it chased him. Then it was Dawson's Creek. Joey and Pacey ran from it. It liked Joey. She went to hide in a shed and her foot got caught in a net. It caught up with her and she talked to it and cut the net to catch it and then they teleported away. Then it was real life. Ezra, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and I were sitting at a table at an outside bar. It was like the beach ones in movies. The girl behind the bar was friendly with me. There was a guy there who I thought liked me. He gave me a cup and I put it in a fridge in the bar and took a water bottle. Also, there was a cure for lycanthropy. I got a potion but then this guy who wanted it confronted a friend of mine to ask if this map led to the potion. I ran the other way, saying that if I was lying then I would tell you to go in the opposite direction. I ran to the cave but I accidentally touched the wrong entrance and I got teleported back a little. Ezra and Jared caught up and I said that I had to go back. They were like 'it's ok' and sat down on the grass to eat. I was puffed out from the running so I walked back and got a water bottle. I then got distracted talking to Jensen. I then walked back with a long stick. I checked my phone and my wallpaper was of Jared and I and I realized that Jensen was sitting at the table behind him in the picture. It changed to a movie of Supernatural and there was a scene with 'bad' Dean in a tree (?) and Dean said that 'this is what happens when you drink too much' to a bunch of alcoholics. There was a deleted scene that showed Dean talking to them in the background and Sam was at a table. Sam said ""you mean like a gr...gr...GRAIL?!?"" just like 'Tim' says it in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I had a drink and then laughed. He said it really well and did a hand movement too. It then showed this behind the scenes thing where they were going to do this plot with an ice cave and had them steal people's heads and they decided not to do it because it was similar to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There was a behind the scenes bit of a Monty Python thing and Michael Palin and some guy who I thought was Finnish, were holding their kids and walking down a path. I was then in the back seat of the car with Mom and Fug was in the passenger seat. The radio was on my station (the oldies one). I lost some dreams that I had in my pocket. Mom found them and I pointed out Jensen's name in one of them and then his name was somewhere else too. I was going to show her Jared's name but thought she wouldn't get it. A lame song came on but I couldn't reach over to change it. I said to Fug, jokingly, 'change the station' and she reached over and randomly changed the station. I was like 'whoa!'. I pointed to one and she pressed the button. I clapped and she looked happy. Mom said she was also staying tomorrow. Mom was going to dads to get some food. I wanted to go home but she forgot and took me to dads."
"3104"	"(2009-10-12 (18)) The last episode of FlashForward that I watched was really good. It had been tense, good action, plot etc. I went on IMDb to post about it. I also watched an episode of Fringe and Olivia got invited to the other universe by herself (from the other universe). She had a dot on her stomach. She had to go to a school gym. There were people there. She told this guy to ""ssh"" and then there was a whistle and everything paused. She then slipped into the other universe. Her other self was there and told her to straighten up but she vomited and kept falling between the two worlds (it was like static and it would fade). Later, Dad came over and I was at home, which was different. I said that it was a good episode tonight and he said it was ok and I said I meant FlashForward. He said he wasn't watching it anymore. He had just been at the shop with Ezra. They had bought old Dawson's Creek books. James van Der Beek was on the cover of one of them. Jessica Warren was the name of a character. Another one of the books was about the army. Then I was in a clothes shop. I got a permanent marker and wrote that the last episode of FlashForward was good and don't cancel it. I wrote stuff about it on the window too. Raquel was there too. She decided to write on the windows as well. She said she didn't know what to protest about and she decided on 'getting a boyfriend' or something. I was like 'your so boy oriented'. She wrote 'LD [heart] NR' referring to Dmitri, on the window. Pink was also there and asked if she could join in and I said 'yeah whatever' and she said that she always thought that I was into girly stuff and I was like 'what the hell?'. There were people outside the window (it was an inside window). There were bras next to the window. Some police came but they couldn't stop us because of some law. Then we were doing some acting thing and it was in a pub setting. This cop was trying to remember our names and put us in different positions. I was in a sitting position last time and they wanted me to stand. In Fringe, the people in one world were in black and white. Someone touched one of them and they turned into colour, then another one did etc. There was a quiz about people but there were pictures of Supernatural, mainly of Jared Padalecki and one with Jensen Ackles alone. The quiz was actually about police being at home or on the streets."
"3105"	"(2009-10-12 (18)) Mariyam talked to me on MSN. She said a friend told her about some movies ages ago but wondered about some music video. She was sometimes Tanita. A song called Brain Brain was first and it was by Madness. I went on LastFm and it did something weird to my plays. It said I had listened to a song by 'Psych'. I put Heartbreak Beat on. It said that my most listened to song this month was 'PF' and other stuff I don't listen to. Everything was named wrong."
"3106"	"(2009-10-12 (18)) I was at a train station. Someone and I had gotten a new job looking after it. Olivia and Walter (both from Fringe) were there. Some guy threw a small rock at me but it hit a post and fell. He was confused but then it turned out there was a box which he pressed a button on and then it shot off. He showed us and it landed on the train tracks. The train came and the box shot out a blow-up thing and the train stopped, but then kept going, pushing the blow-up thing along. I went to the next train station which was a short way away, to tell them, but the door wouldn't open from that side. Walter did something else and a 'cab' landed on the tracks and then bounced off. Olivia went over and written in the sand was a guess that Walter had written before that it would land there."
"3107"	"(2009-10-13 (18)) I was out the front of Dad's old place near the garage. People kept driving around the corner really fast and pulling up. Darren wanted me to get some cat door sheets. I had to hold the roller door down with the bin. I was telling someone a story of how Barack Obama used to be our pool cleaner (I was telling the truth). I said that I had dreamt he became the president before he was. Nana was watching an episode of Supernatural. Dean got possessed by a girl and Nana was like 'how embarrassing'. Sam looked like he thought it was funny. Then I got invited to this party as part of a job. My boss was in the pool. This guy and I were partners and we asked him for something. He gave us two cheap disposable phones and we were setting them up. It was night. I was then in a car. This guy came and was pulling it apart trying to get me. I had a Frisbee like thing and was hitting him with it. I got out and ran to a building. I hit him when I got in and closed the door and locked it, although he couldn't get in anyway. I was covered in blood and my face was dirty and covered with white powder. I walked down a hall and it was empty and it was a government building thing. I wasn't supposed to be there so I was being quiet. I walked around and I found out about some zombie experiments. Someone else joined me and then this mother and son attacked us and he was being held up against the wall. I hit them and tied them up in chains. With the kid, I made it so the rope went around his next. I tightened it but when the other person saw, they stopped me. They were infected. I ended up getting angry and stormed away.  This guy I hardly knew called Laszlo [note: watched The Lives of Others yesterday] was with me. We ran away through the carpark. I looked back and the oval was crawling with zombies. We were like 'they're after us!'. It was now day. We had no keys so Laszlo hijacked this purple car. We drove for a bit and ended up at this waste place. There were sections of barbed fence inside. This muscly, but small, African woman was guarding it. She was dressed in old-fashioned armour and moved slow. I said something to my friend and he turned and attacked me (he was infected) and I killed him. I was annoyed about this because I thought he was hot. I got into the waste place and tried to get the African woman to walk onto a mine and would tempt her closer by putting my hand out. She grabbed it and I got a pole and managed to get away. I found a notebook and threw it at her. She said she had a letter from a lover (a girl) and it had like a bomb in it but it hadn't gone off. Later, I was near a bookshelf and my old stuff was in it. She said that I must be glad I'm not writing down my life now and I said that I still was. I started to cry and tried not to. I didn't know what to do now."
"3108"	"(2009-10-14 (18)) I was in bed and it was dark. Mom opened my door and I was in a different house. Eugene was in bed with me (he was closest to the door). Mom talked to me quietly and Eugene woke up."
"3109"	"(2009-10-14 (18)) Ezra and I were playing a maul on Warcraft. I went as purple but got moved to red and all these people came and filled up every spot and I didn't know what maze to do and most of the creeps got past."
"3110"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) I was watching The Soprano's. Meadow was spying on Tony and the others. She was paranoid and thought that Tony and Carmela knew. Carmela was in the kitchen and told her to stay and eat. Meadow got suspicious and thought they knew and she ran, scared, to the cops and they put photos on the wall and she felt ashamed."
"3111"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) I was at a park and it was night. Jayson and Ezra were there. Jayson brought a girl and I said to get rid of them after this guy did something that I can't read. We needed to take Ezra to the doctors. I took their car and told Jayson to follow behind in my car. We got there and went inside and then it was a shop. There were traffic lights in the shop and one set was out. We were lining up then I had to go back to the car. There was a photo of Samantha and she was then in the shop with Cyndi. When I got back they weren't allowing any more people in. I called out to Ezra but he couldn't hear me. This lady said they were dead but then she realized they weren't and I was talking to Ezra but she mentioned to him that it was all on file and he wanted to leave. We threw this bit of paper around and went out the door? This lady said they really liked his introduction. This song, ""crisp old fingers"" came on and I liked it and started singing along."
"3112"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) There was a remake or something of Fantastic Four, but it was different. Zachary Quinto and Eric Bana were in it. Everyone in it were like people in Heroes. Eric Bana was like an alien and was green, slimy etc. Now Zachary's character looked like that. There was a scene where Eric Bana got on top of him and had sex with him. There was a flashback of Zachary in a car and was talking 'gay' like and said that he loved Eric Bana's character (who was outside the car and was normal). I think it says Eric was taking his farm. This girl outside was upset because she liked Zachary."
"3113"	"(2009-10-15 (18)) Dad, some random and I went to Vietnam. We were talking about something that cost $600 but years ago it was really expensive. He said he wanted to go to Bali because it cost only $3 a night and that there were lots of girls. I said ""but they're Asian"" and he said he didn't care. Then Dad, Ezra, Mom and I were walking along some train tracks/ride to go to Bali. It went across the water too. There were tracks on an angle and a train was coming and it was hard to stay balanced outside the track. They jumped off at one point and frolicked up some stairs (outside). I stayed on the tracks and it moved now. It took me into this shop and there was a door that said led to the 'cat haven' and it said it was unsafe. This 40-odd chubby-ish Asian lady said something and opened the door to some cats and dogs. She said the shop had food from all countries. I asked if they had gnocchi and it was in a fridge. She had lost a daughter. I went to a checkout and this girl at the end had blonde hair and was quite pretty. They lost something and were taking a long time to add everything up. Then the lady was like 'look who I've got! Phil Tony!'. I recognized him from some lifestyle show and he was there to help them find what they had lost."
"3114"	"(2009-10-17 (18)) I had moved into an apartment with some people for university. There was a big room with four single beds. There were two other girls and Zach Braff. Then it was some time later and we were all fairly good friends. We were going to the beach. Zach and I were the last to leave and were getting ready. He joked ""I'll draw a map so you can find your way back"". We went to the carpark first to get some Vaseline out of his car. I put it on my legs. We went down to leave and we were in this cinema like place. There were confusing stairs. We walked across to the exit which led straight to the beach. I was putting sunglasses on. We got there and Sarah Chalke and Ezra were there. Sarah and this other girl were sunbathing. Someone looked at Sarah and she was sun burnt. We covered her with a blanket and took her to the shade. Now only one side of her face was burnt? We took her back out. Some dodgy guys were hanging around. They were ok looking for beach-y people. Inara (Firefly) was facing away from them and they wanted to see what she looked like. We went back into the cinema. Some of them were buying stuff. Ezra asked if I'd seen any good new movies lately and I said ""In Bruges"" and I said that I was annoyed because Colin Farrell was in it. Evelyn was there too and some guys were going to pretend they were interested in her."
"3115"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) Some girl was in court because she left her wheelchair bound father alone. She went to see him and he realized she had left to live her own life and he was ok about it. I was then crossing a street. I was making a new Twilight movie but was thinking that Robert Pattinson was known as Edward now and no-one would accept new casting. Someone said it was like Christian Bale in The Dark Knight and I said ""except 'The Goth Knight' sucked"". I then walked into a cinema (though it was only a cinema after I entered it). I went in and then realized I had no money so I called Mom and asked her to bring some money. I called back a few minutes later to see where she was, but she had just pulled up. She gave me a peanut butter sandwich, which I ate. I said I needed money but then I looked at the list of movies out and realized there was nothing I wanted to see so I said I would go home. Then I was alone and there were zombies. There were crowds of people rushing around. Eugene was there and he pulled me into a room to save me. A lot of us ended up in there. It was a big room and there was one big rectangle shaped window facing the carpark. There were lots of shelves in the room. Every shot the window and we all had guns and started shooting the zombies as they came in. Eventually they were gone. I was about to go get my car and then this guy with a gas mask came in. We shot him. Some of us moved into another room and this guy came in and I aimed my gun at him but he hadn't seen me and he faced away and the red dot from my gun was on the wall. He saw it and I shot him in the head before he turned around. Then lots of others came in and I hid with some people including Niki (Heroes). They came in and didn't see us and we had a baby with us who was the 'antichrist'. We realized his power worked like, because the people didn't know where we were, they couldn't see us. They called out Niki and she stood up and gave herself up. I was then alone with the baby and it turned red and started to shake and I was like 'I don't know what the hell to do!'. Then it was some time later. This girl checked on Niki and she was doing some conditioning program. She said she had finished and she did it with a hot brain which was a myth that was supposed to make it stuff up and she said her knees turned yellow. This lady said she was only '285' programs through it and Niki looked worried."
"3116"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) I was in the car with Dad and Ezra. Ezra was driving. We had just come from McDonald's and I had a McChicken. We were going around a cliff and the wheel got stuck and wobbled and the car went over the side into the water. It was a convertible and I had no seatbelt on and I fell off. I got to the shore and ended up falling asleep on a bench."
"3117"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) I was at Dad's old place. There wasn't much there and the roof was hanging down for repairs. They were watching TV. I was doing some logic problems in the living room. It mentioned Supernatural so I read the introduction. I realized it was actually about Supernatural. I was going out with Jared Padalecki who was in the lounge room. I called out to Dad and he read through it and I said ""after the death of their father, John Winchester, Dean and SAM!"" He thought it was funny. I drew a love heart around Sam's name."
"3118"	"(2009-10-18 (18)) I was watching Gossip Girl. It was Jenny's birthday. She was going out with Dan and they had an argument the day before. She was sitting on a bed talking to a friend and wondered what he was wearing -- the theme was 'modern love'. She heard a scream and went out to see and Dan was there wearing dreadlocks and normal/baggy clothes. She was angry at him and told him to change. Then I was there with some others and we were just hanging on this 'balcony' up the stairs (inside). The TV was on and this old movie was playing. Her father and a guy were there and I suggested we pull a prank. One of the pranks we sometimes pulled was called the 'oh by the way I'm Elvis'."
"3119"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) I was at the old house and I had gotten two posters of Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles and one of two girls? I cut them in half and edited them together and was going to put it on my wall. The one of Jared got morphed with these girls and he was on top, the girl on the bottom and she was naked. There was a knock on the door and this guy there. He begged me to let him in so I hid. He pushed his face up to the door and mentioned my name and I was like 'what the hell?!' and thought that I didn't recognize him but I let him in. He wanted to go to the movies with me and I said 'you can go yourself' but he insisted so I went to put my shoes on. I had gotten invited via a big truck to join some group (mafia like). I joked ""the first rule about fight club is, you don't talk about fight club"". There were rules about having affairs and you had to keep them updated and if a kid was born you had to let them know. This guy and I were talking to the leader and he said something about some Sims 2 family but they passed as a 'low' tree. He wanted to sue them but couldn't find anything against them. Ralph (The Soprano's) was telling this girl (who I had been at one point) that he had had sex with a horse. She was quite pretty by the way and she reminded me of Megahn Perry. He convinced her they should have sex and they went into the back of this van in a garage. It was the meeting place for 'sexual fetishes'. I arrived there and was checking things and I saw her sleeping in there. I knocked on the window and she woke up. She had underwear on and I mouthed 'get out now' and she woke Ralph and they quickly ran out. They casually walked in from another way and Ralph kissed her on the lips and was talking to some guy. There was some movie and someone said ""what is this, Buenos Dias? Oh, Buenos Aires"". I knew of it and it was some poor African/Asian place and there were lots of people who got starved. People wanted to give them huts or something. This guy got lifted up into the air and shot. I was like 'aw I liked him'."
"3120"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) I had just finished at the university. I stayed later to play poker with Calvin and some others. The game was weird though. You got three cards and you marked off the ones you got and had to discover which ones the others have to eliminate the winner. I was next to this guy because he was doing a scam. I was then at the train station and I took the wrong train. I ended up in Oceanside. I text Mom to tell her. I had to scan my SmartRider on this Timezone like thing and got a ticket. The train back was weird and then I realized it was the wrong one again and waited for the next one. It came and it was like a net and you had to hold on. I realized it was the wrong one again and I waited on the other side this time. I got really angry and yelled that it was the worst train station. It was like 7-8pm now and I was annoyed that it was so late."
"3121"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) I was at a train station and I had to put baggage into this hole because I was a girl. Giovanni was there and he was allowed to go on as normal. It took a long time for mine to get through. I gave up. I went outside and I think Mom picked me up. There were lots of lizards and snakes and insects around. I saw something and I said ""what is that?!"" and Mom said ""a turtle?"". It had weird spiky arms. She dropped me back off later to pick up my stuff. It was near Dad's new place. I was like 'why would you want to live near the beach with all these things around?'."
"3122"	"(2009-10-19 (18)) This girl friend and I were walking down a street. She said we should hitchhike and told me to do it. I put my thumb out and then there was an explosion in front of us (it was a fair away in the city). It was sort of mushroom-y and we saw all this red stuff (presumably flames) coming towards us and we ran behind this building and then the flame went past us. We sat against the wall and there were a bunch of trees in front of us. Black smoke came from behind us and it was thick but the trees managed to shade us from it. Then there was another one but it came from this side (towards us) and we ran around to the other side. It was thick with smoke and it was hard to breathe. There was a pine forest to the right of us. We ran into it and it was foggy but with little speckles of dust floating about. She ended up getting a car but it was American and there was a dent on the left side. She drove up to me and told me to get in, so I did. There was a half eaten sandwich and I was hungry so I ate it. We went towards where the second explosion had been. We went to our house/work and there were apartments below it or something. We went to this weird house and there were some guys there and had a weird dead fish. This guy jumped down this hole in the floor to check the ""computer server"". This other guy was involved with the explosion and told him to give him his work (the guy in the hole). We could see things better and the guy shot a gun and we could see the ripple around the bullet as it moved. There was already underground stuff going on (post-apocalyptic rebels, etc). People were going crazy. We went near some buildings and we heard some people talking and I moved away. I passed a toilet and I heard a girl struggling with someone. I went into a building and it was office like. I heard the guys mention us and called out to us. There was a TV on and it said they were the guys that caused it. We ran away. This guy's head was on the floor but he was alive and it was being used as a football. I gave it to these guys nearby. The head guy was called Manny Trejo. He threw it at a guy and he bashed it in. We went to this shop and they had school bags. I gave one to the lady behind the counter and it came with a notebook. This girl asked me if I stunk and I said ""probably, I've just been running""."
"3123"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) I was at Nana's. It was March or something but it was Christmas. I was at the table next to the kitchen with Dad, Nana and Poppa. I think Dad said I did ""super duper"" in the MUPC. I said I got high distinctions and they were like 'good' but no-one said much. Dad said I got the top mark in human biology. Aunt Sally arrived and then Nana wanted to take a photo of us. We went outside and some guys took the picture and I remember seeing Nathaniel with us. I was annoyed because I wanted them to take a picture when I had lost weight."
"3124"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) I had watched Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but it was actually good. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, someone else and I had to stay in a van. We were on our way to somewhere. Jared and I were going out. There were lots of mouse pads and books in there that we had to use to sleep on. I was going through them trying to find comfortable ones. A security guard guy was with us."
"3125"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) Gizmo jumped on my bed with her tail up and was cuddly [note: her tail might have to get cut off] Mom and I took her to the vet and they had given her something to stretch her cells. She was going to be ok. I got some pens and this girl told me about a pencil that came with a sharpener."
"3126"	"(2009-10-20 (18)) I was watching Dexter and Rita was on her P plates or L's or something. She asked Dexter something and he looked worried but then he realized she just wanted to drive."
"3127"	"(2009-10-21 (18)) I was watching The Soprano's but I only remember seeing Tony. He had something to do with us. I was trying to remember their last names to see what Italian surnames were like. I said out loud, ""Carm, Dante, Adriana La Cerva"". Darren had been setting up stuff at the old house to stop people coming in while it was empty. One night I checked outside from the kitchen and I saw some movement and realized there was a guy out there. I freaked out and went to get Darren."
"3128"	"(2009-10-21 (18)) There were cops at a petrol station and we had trouble pulling up. We went to a bowser and but we kept going too far forward. We went into a shop later and Calvin was there and he said hello. When we went back to the car, Mom said something about his mother dying and I said something like, 'why would he be working/he would've said something'. I was then at the old house and Ezra's room was different. He showed me and Dad his wallpaper on the computer. It was Dean's (Supernatural) face with a 'comedic' angry expression. I said ""Fetch [no idea why] . At least he didn't say my least favourite word"". I laughed, remembering the episode the wallpaper was from. I said it was the one with this dog which was crazy and barked a lot. But it actually wasn't and it was from the most recent episode. Then I was watching the episode and the dog chased me into this office and I closed the door. Dean shouted and said he was 'in' the dog (possessing it). I opened the door and I could hear him. He half joked about finding a female dog for me. Then I was watching Torchwood or something. Every child kept saying ""where is Eugene?"" and I was like 'I wish I knew [about Eugene] '. A group of kids saw this kid and stopped and realized the kid was 'Eugene'. They chased him up a tower."
"3129"	"(2009-10-21 (18)) I was at Timezone and I think I was in Year 9. I was in the library with Calvin, Silas and Samantha. We went to bowling and it was hard to throw the ball because I got a pain on my right arm. There was a video of Elijah and others walking."
"3130"	"(2009-10-22 (18)) I went to see some horror movie at the cinema that came out like 5 years ago. I started walking with a bowl of cereal. I passed Calvin and gave him the bowl and asked him to hold onto it. He was with a guy friend and he started talking and mentioned that they were seeing Friday the 13th tomorrow. I hadn't seen it. I decided not to go the cinema now and I said that we should all go as there was a movie marathon on. The guy wasn't too happy about it and said that Calvin and I shouldn't go out and I said ""what the hell, we're seeing a movie not making children"". There was also something to do with Michael Palin and Terry Jones but I don't remember it properly now. Anyway, we all went there including Ezra. We were at the counter and I was like ""brrr!"" and kept making other noises. The lady behind the counter was like 'ok... you're weird'. I said it was natural? I joked that I scared my door. I got a medium popcorn but asked them to change it to a small. First I accidentally asked to change my chair to a small one. Someone said that I was looking fat and I said ""I've lost 2kg!"" and jokingly pretended to hit them. I can't remember what happened but we were then on a boat and Ezra and I had a fight and he jumped off the edge and started to sink. This black security guard guy jumped in and saved him. The guy friend wanted to go home but I wanted to see the movie still. Calvin wanted to go home too (they were all upset about Ezra) but I was like 'let's just go watch the movie!'. But they all left. I was talking to a lady and asked her to write down my dream for me. When I went to get it, it was on my notepad but every page was full. I looked closer and it was the script for Deep Rising. I was confused about it and it cost $200,000 that night? I went to the lady and threw the paper at her and yelled that they were my last ones. She said she just felt like having fun. I calmed down eventually and said that Deep Rising sucked. I asked why she chose it and I got an image in my head of a huge CGI eel hitting a boat. She said something about a bear with a rabbit that drove faster. The bear was in a car and was chasing the rabbit. She was sending me the images telepathically. I went to watch the movie anyway but then I called Mom to get me because I couldn't be bothered. She said she would be a while. The end of the movie was set in a shop. This guy had accidentally killed his sister and there was some mirror trick using ""E Eloise Jorn"". Anyway, this sharp thing the guy had flung off and I joked that it would go into Colin Farrell's head. Then it showed him sitting at a table and it got him just near his eye (this had happened in In Bruges). Then it 'rewound' and it was just before this happened. A FlashForward thing had happened which explained a bunch of random things that had happened."
"3131"	"(2009-10-22 (18)) Grey's Anatomy was on TV. Mom said it looked like a good show and I said I hadn't started the new season yet because George had died and he was the only character I liked. Later, Ezra was looking at The Soprano's stuff. There was a picture of Silvio and I said that I liked Silvio. He also typed in some nonsense and we joked it would come up with stuff about Paulie, but it came up with Silvio. I asked who his favourite character was. We were going to the movies and usually I was in the front. Ryan and Ezra were also in the car. I went naked and got dressed in the car for some reason (and I was in the seat behind the passenger). I decided I didn't want to go because it had actually happened before and had to led to some lame events and I turned back time and I had to do everything the same but I didn't want to have to watch all the movies I'd watched again."
"3132"	"(2009-10-23 (18)) I was at Nana's. Mom and Nana were in the spare room. I was watching TV. We went outside later to do some adventure thing. There were quite a few people there. I was recording it but decided to just take photos instead. Ezra had really big boobs. The chickens came and started flapping near me and I squealed and jumped away. There was a round thing in some water that was where the top pond should be but there was no edge and we had to walk around. I was worried I would fall in so I went another way but then just waited for the others to get around and do it. They came around and this guy, who was kind of hot but was related to us somehow, opened this bathroom cabinet on the round bit. I took a photo of him as he did it. He was confused and said it was in Russian but it looked English from where I was and I realized depending on the angle you looked at it, you saw a different thing. I went around to the top fish pond later (under the shade thing) and there were now lots of stalls and vending machines with food (chips and chocolates, etc). Nana didn't know about it but it had been there for a while. She was upset and angry about it. I said 'isn't it illegal for people to try and sell stuff on your property'. She asked someone and they said no. I went inside and Janice (The Soprano's) was on the three seater lounge down the bottom and she was related to us and was called something else. I was going to ask her about it because she knew stuff about that."
"3133"	"(2009-10-24 (18)) I was at the old house on my computer. I got a text from Eugene and I was like 'Oh my God, Eugene!'. It said some random stuff and I realized it was spam. Ezra called me to show me something then I went to some place and they had a quiz (it was online first). The online quiz was 'what vehicle driver are you'. One question had pictures of B.A, Face and Westland (all from The A-Team). I got race car driver. I was then there and thought it was real so I went in but it was like Timezone and there were games. One was a skating rink. I was then back at the old place. Ezra's room was mine. It was cloudy and rainy outside. Dad came and I wanted to go back home but I couldn't take my computer out in the weather. I had a photo on Facebook of me naked but it was from WeightView and wasn't as freakishly [something I can't read, but it looks like 'finshy', but I don't know what it's supposed to say] . Ando, Hiro (both from Heroes) and I left this place and some bad guys chased us. This guy was fast with blades. I was trying to teleport and I grabbed his phone and this paper with [something I can't read again, looks like 'addnys'] . I touched him and nothing happened and it was because the weather was dodgy. This other guy was there too and he sat down in the corner (which was outside but the corridor was also outside the building). The bad guy sat in front of me and he decided to try to kill us and he started going crazy with the blades and I protected against it with this sword/knife. I accidentally stabbed him and then did it a few more times on purpose. I think it says we both got a 'fail' percentage on the exam. He was 16. He said something about bleeding to death in 20 seconds, but he would take 2 minutes. I went into the toilet to not watch out of respect."
"3134"	"(2009-10-24 (18)) I woke up. Ezra and Roland were in my room on my computer (I had two). I said to hurry up and get off because I wanted to get on."
"3135"	"(2009-10-25 (18)) I got taken to some place after university. There were lots of people there and some groups were wearing uniforms. They were teenagers. I sat down and Calvin was there. I was like 'where the hell are you and what are we doing' and he said he didn't know. He said something I didn't hear and he stared, waiting for a reply. I went off at one point and the rooms were confusing. Farrah was there and she was trying to hide from some woman but she came in and caught her. I was then at Dad's old house but it was different. I was in my room but it was windy and it broke the back door (it was flimsy). I wondered how Dad had lived here. I got up and closed all the doors."
"3136"	"(2009-10-26 (18)) I was with a guy, Ezra and someone else. We were taking photos together. Then it was a movie. There was a girl and a guy, who was played by Jude Law. They were best friends. His name was Gale and they were looking for someone called Harold. I can't remember it properly, but they were at some place in the middle of nowhere (it was sort of like the movie, Unknown). I read that the ending was much better than the theatrical release [note: I downloaded the Paranormal Activity screener last night and I read that the ending was better] . They escaped from there. They were trying to get a car started. Someone shot himself and the guy realized that it was near a car and [something I can't read, looks like 'roband'] , which meant that it would explode if they touched but before he could say anything the guy started it up and it exploded. The guy inside drove out onto the road and it exploded again and flipped. The other car had trouble starting and they backed it out onto the road. There were three cars in the left lane and there were two right lanes. There wasn't much traffic in the right lanes but the left lane had heaps. Then a bus pulled onto some long grass and the driver said people always needed to picked up from there. Everyone from before was dead now except for me and Gale. He got up from the grass. We got on the bus and he drove and then I noticed we were at the same place again. I realized he had purposely missed the turnoff. I saw an image of the bad guy (who was now Gale) and his evil self took over. The girl character (who I had been) didn't know. Then sometimes later she was Jessica Stevenson. They kissed. Then I was at home and Mom and Darren were there. I had just finished dinner and watching a movie."
"3137"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) Ezra was driving on the highway or something and he had missed the turnoff. It was night, but sometimes it was day, and there wasn't much traffic. He kept driving but Mom told him to turn back because he wasn't ""experienced enough to drive that long"". Then Dad, Ezra and I stopped at some deli thing and it was day. I thought it was dodgy. This hot guy owned it. There was a magazine with Jensen Ackles on the back. I wrote *love* and showed Ezra as a joke."
"3138"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) I was at a school with Raquel and some other old friend. We were walking down a path and I felt fat. We went to class and there were nerds. At lunch we sat at the nerd table? Then there was a movie and this nerd guy lost his virginity while some cool guy was under the bed."
"3139"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) I was at university and people were getting their usernames changed. Selena changed hers to T.A and Bradley and Jeremiah came too. Bradley heard Ezra say 'toilet swing' and I was like 'that's mine!' so he changed it. I was playing on Facebook later and this lady who failed at math wrote fail too? She was designing a name layout."
"3140"	"(2009-10-27 (18)) I was watching The Soprano's. Tony and some others were in a pool. There was a part they couldn't see and it was swirling. One noticed and they tried to get out and they managed to. Then it showed Carmela at their house. Her character was called Edie though. Tony was away and I was thinking that I hadn't seen Meadow and the others for a while. Mom bleached Gizmo and she shrunk. The top half of her was permanently changed to white."
"3141"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I was at a shop but in the car. Calvin came and asked me to drop him off at school and so I did. It hurt my left leg and arm to drive. I called Mom to take a look. Chase (House) was sick and he had been sick before. Cameron (House) was upset and said ""I'm sick of having to tie you up"". He didn't know what she was talking about. There was a photo of him as a baby with this metal thing on his head and he screamed."
"3142"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I watched the new Twilight movie and it had left out this awesome scene from the book (in which a monster had attacked someone). I watched it with Ezra. There was something about some stuff going into the sun. I did some puzzles about celebrities and you had to find movies in a word search. Darren answered the door and it was Clayton. He said he would offer $3 to stay over. I went to look for Gizmo and she was out the front but the house looked different when you turned your head the other way. I told Mom and she wasn't bothered by it. Then they went out to do it. I saw Dad and he said 'thanks for the help' and I said  ""What? I'm having a shower?"" and he said ""Oh. Take the steam cleaner to the oval to get rid of the dog poo with Ezra and Emery"". I thought it was random."
"3143"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I went to a Robin Williams live show. He brought Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall out for a bit. Robin threw a biggish ball into the audience and I caught it."
"3144"	"(2009-10-28 (18)) I was at Brookland to finish off this course to graduate. I was in uniform and I didn't know where to go. It was then a movie? This guy was being chased. He hid behind a wall and then I was there too. The wall was next to a path and behind it was this tower thing and then a field. I had a gun. This control box on the wall was screwed and I shot it so it wouldn't explode. I saw a bad guy and shot at him. Then the guy I was with and another guy were lying together almost naked. The other guy was asleep. I said to ""lick his face"". He went to (as a joke) but then he turned. When the guy woke up he kissed him and they were like 'uh... ok' and then he thought that he might like him."
"3145"	"(2009-10-29 (18)) I was at the train station. Madelyn and I were hanging out. There were two queues and one was huge and the other one was small, but you needed lots of cash. I waited for Mom in the line (there were four people in front of me). She finally came. I think Mom didn't want me hanging with Madelyn. I said that she used to hang with me and Calvin. I had lost more weight."
"3146"	"(2009-10-30 (18)) I was watching Heroes. Niki/Tracey got a glimpse into the future. There was this weird purple creature. They were on top of hair? There were lots of discussions. Someone teleported Claire up to see. Dmitri put Peter against a glass wall and said he was Sylar and then he saw Claire and Dmitri got through, not wanting Claire to see, and said ""no!"" and Peter fell and then ran out. Then I was with some friends. Some of them were gay and there were some relationships in the mix. There was a girl with big clothes on (or it was a guy in drag) and my friend was like ""You're much prettier"" (about me). They were gay and sounded gay."
"3147"	"(2009-10-30 (18)) I was watching a movie. These people kept rushing to these doors with these small keys that. It had a name but I can't remember what it was. Then I was there and we were all trying the keys in locked boxes. Then I wasn't there and it was a trap to kill them as no keys fit. Then it was different and people would wish for someone to die, but they would also die. The main guy from Zombieland was there. He was with a lady and he realized she was trying to kill him. She was a demon or something. I think he escaped but then this girl was there, and then it was me. I snuck out of the door and into a car. There were heaps of cars and it was night. I was driving out and kept hitting them but kept maneuvering around and got out. She came out to stop me but I got away. The deaths from the wishes happened within 5 minutes, I think, and they were random. I was then near where the dude lived. I found the street and went and found him. He was in a small building like a demountable but it was only room. He let me in and we were discussing the situation. Then it felt weird and we had been waiting for people to arrive. They tipped the building over and we fell on top of each other in the corner of it. They were good guys, but had thought something was up. I went on IMDb after finishing the movie and people were discussing bite marks that the people had. They thought it looked Latin. It had an 8.8/10 rating but not many votes. This guy said it was poorly edited and was lame. It was going to be turned into a TV show. Someone suggested Zachary Quinto (I assumed it was for the bad guy). They said he could say his name like ""I am Scaaarrr"". Some people suggested some people for the female parts, but they were all stupid choices (like tween stars). The person who had suggested Quinto, also suggested Hayden Panettiere. Then I was at home but it was different. My room was next to the toilet which was next to the backyard and my room was away from the other rooms. I could hear bass from some music [note: last night there was loud bass coming from somewhere] . I had been in bed for 4 hours and got up at 2am to go to the toilet. I saw people dancing outside. I got Darren and Mom up and Darren was angry but went to check. He knew this girl out there called Sarah. She turned the bass down and talked to me through the window. She was doing a PVC course? They let out tiny bits of paper to make a girls face."
"3148"	"(2009-10-30 (18)) I was watching Mork and Mindy. Mindy was with Mork. He went into a spaceship and accidentally took off. She cried and it showed him saying like 'when you show total sadness'. She fell asleep. When she woke up she was on the ship. Then it was me. It was futuristic looking and I walked down a hall. I had been separated from my boyfriend/guy I liked. I found some people and they were all girls. They said I was there 'God' and I was supposed to tell them where they came from, etc. There was an island called 'The Eye' and I had been there before in a submarine? The hall had pictures on both sides. One side had pictures from this old magazine. The comics started off 'gross' and violent and as they went on, they got cleaner and 'nicer'. The other side had another magazine which had started out clean, and had gotten more violent. Later I was telling Mom and I said that I didn't want to be stuck with girls and I was angry and upset about it."
"3149"	"(2009-10-31 (18)) I was at school. It was the first day and I had finished the MUPC but I had to finish year 12. Everyone else from year 12 was there. I went to English, but then I realized I hadn't got my timetable yet. This teacher lady was giving them out. Calvin got one, then me and she said I needed to have a chat about Ezra. They wanted me to write to somewhere about him, using my university 'status' to make them do something. It cost over $1000. Elijah was the next in line to get a timetable. As I was walking to class, Eugene passed me and I was trying not to look and be subtle about it."
"3150"	"(2009-11-01 (18)) I was with my boyfriend, who was Jensen Ackles (or at least looked like him). We went to a cinema which was in the US. We came in from the back and it was steep and there were lots of seats. The screen was small and was 'out' of the screen (it was like a TV in the middle of the room). We sat at the back as they were the only seats left. I was like 'it's so busy!'. It cleared out and when some people were left I said 'Back home, this would be busy'. We walked down and got seats in the front row. He didn't hear what I had said so I repeated it, but he didn't hear me again and I repeated it again. He put the arm rest up and I snuggled up next to him. My ex-boyfriend was then behind us and it was AJ from Dawson's Creek (well, his name was AJ and he looked like him). He started trying to talk to me and was getting angry and abusive. Eventually he left. Then Dawson's Creek was playing on the screen. Joey and Pacey were talking and she was talking about ""snakes and puppy dogs tails and I did it with you"" which referenced them growing up together. She kissed him and I was like 'gay'. There was also some stuff about Robert Pattinson and I was like 'he sucks!'. We left there. Jensen wanted me to move to the US. We also had a kid together. I had a girl with AJ too and she was also still a baby. I didn't really want to move. Then I was at the old house and we still lived there. Mom was there. I was playing with the first baby and tickled it and she was laughing and squirming and her face was red (she normally had a red face). I was saying ""You're an ugly child aren't you"" in that stupid baby voice people talk in. I went to my room and I was thinking that I didn't feel different from having a kid. I went to Mom and said that the first kid's face was red. She said she would take her to the doctor's tomorrow morning. She was worried that AJ was trying to poison her. I was watching One Tree Hill at one point and I heard a voice and I said ""is that Haley?"" and then it showed her. Then I was a guy or something and I was with Jamie-Lynn Sigler in the cinema. She was my girlfriend and was wearing jewellery and I felt grossed out by it. She took off her bracelet which was then a necklace and it was gold, but had little bits of silver. She gave it to me and I didn't want to touch it, but I held it and felt sick. She wanted me to have it and do something with it because her ex had given it to her and she didn't like him. I was wondering why I was with her if she wore jewellery."
"3151"	"(2009-11-01 (18)) Janis (FlashForward) and some black cop woman kissed. There was more but I can't remember it now."
"3152"	"(2009-11-01 (18)) I was with Ezra and someone. There was music playing and A Glass of Champagne came on but it was slow. I sang along and at the nickelodeon-y bit, I 'sang' it. I watched Moon and Sam Rockwell was on a big spaceship in the sky that was blimp like. It only made $6000 because everyone downloaded it instead of going to the cinema. I was telling Mom that it should've done well."
"3153"	"(2009-11-02 (18)) This girl was getting supplies for next year at university. Her teacher, who was a guy, told her to go a supplies place that was at the university. Then I was there too and we were both doing a science-y course. Her name was Izzy, and sometimes she was Quinn from One Tree Hill. I got a scrapbook and was waiting at the checkout. She and the teacher were having an affair I think. The teacher guy was hanging around me and she saw and looked annoyed. It happened again a while later. Then Elijah and a girl friend were there. The teacher guy organized for us all to stay there for the night. He was trying to find out if there were free beds at other universities nearby. Notre Dame was nearby and some other place. My eye was burning. As I went to cross the street to go to the carpark, I saw a bus coming and so ran across. It seemed to take ages to get across. We were all sitting around talking in the carpark. Calvin was there, along with Scarlett and some other girls and they were annoying me. There was a bed free at Notre Dame and Elijah took it (he was on the phone to them at the time). He called some girl's boyfriend that was in a race. Scarlett got on the phone and this other girl picked up the phone. The connection got cut. They discovered he had lost the race and was angry. Alek's status on Facebook had sexual, happiness (etc) ratings."
"3154"	"(2009-11-02 (18)) I was in a car on the freeway/highway. There was a flashing light up ahead and we realized there had been an accident. We were annoyed at having to wait in traffic, but when we passed it, there was a person hanging out of the car with a smashed head. Later, I was in a bed with an old woman. I got up and when I came back the wall had collapsed on her head. I took a photo and then I called 000 and said ""I need an ambulance"" and I told them what happened but they didn't seem interested. I had seen a photo of this happening before."
"3155"	"(2009-11-03 (18)) I was in a car with a guy. I can't remember properly, but I think he opened the back doors and pulled my legs out and was going to rape me, but I got him away and locked the front door to lock all the doors. I got in the drivers seat and drove off."
"3156"	"(2009-11-03 (18)) There was some weird stuff going on. I found an online room for DopeWars but it was then like real life. There were rows of tables and people were on each side and there were cards with random pictures. There was a pile of cards and post-its. I decided to play again but I couldn't remember what to do in the real life version. I was then at the old house and I found an old photo. I had a half sister called Loanne. Ezra called her and said ""it's Tommy"". She told him she thought we were dead and it had been 11 years since we last saw her. Dad and Ezra were crying. Then Ezra, some other guy and I weighed ourselves. Ezra weighed less than me. Dad said I weighed 86kg and said no-one seemed to be going down and I said ""I've lost 11kg!"". Then Nana and Poppa were meeting Loanne and some evil people out the back. She was magical? This girl said they had spells and were going to do bad stuff. Alyssa was nearby, and I said something about her fat but not being able to get through the door and she heard and got angry. I apologized and she got over it after a few minutes. The stereo was on and Pour Some Sugar on Me came on. I turned it off to call Nana and then there was a loud noise and they were here. Then Nana and Poppa were inside. The radio was now on 92.9 and the floor opened up and they fell in."
"3157"	"(2009-11-04 (18)) I was waiting for the train but I had to walk somewhere to get something and the train came. I didn't know how it worked from where I was so I walked the long way back to the normal train station."
"3158"	"(2009-11-04 (18)) I had to go back to university to finish off the course. I changed into a 6 year old boy to do one subject and the teacher said I could have the day off since I didn't know anyone. A psychologist there was annoyed because I hadn't done an assignment for that class and I said the teacher gave me an extra day. I was outside. Some girl was giving out awards and a celebrity got one and then walked off. An old lady that was from the church was there. I had invited her there and was talking to her. Then some guy was cleaning up a store and it was dark inside and night. He was washing the windows."
"3159"	"(2009-11-04 (18)) I had powder in my belly button. I lifted the skin and there was a metal like 'hole' in there and there were lots of powder clumps around it. I said ""why do we even have this?"" and I complained because it was dirty."
"3160"	"(2009-11-05 (18)) I was talking to Mom and I mentioned Sam Rockwell to her and I said his father did something and she said 'I know' and I was like 'how the hell do you know?' and she said we were related to him. She had been talking to him through email for a while and had discovered we were related (not closely). I checked my email and I had emails from him. She had sent him some, pretending to be, saying 'I had a crush on you' etc. One said 'don't worry, I'm still your friend' and something about The Pythons. I found out Mom had also been talking to the members of Monty Python."
"3161"	"(2009-11-05 (18)) This teen guy and his grandmother went missing on his birthday. Everyone was looking for him but then he returned with his sister. His grandmother had fallen and died of a heart attack. They had freaked out and hid. They brought back her head. Mom bought me this sea monkey stuff as a present. I opened up a packet of them and they were two small 'fish'. They were weird looking and people-y. I was trying to get the tank sorted out and there was a weird cylinder thing with a swirly thing. I got Mom and Ezra to help me and told them to be careful of the fish. The fish things were kind of sick, but one was a bit better than the other and I liked that one more. We put the water on for the other one and the good one went down the drain. I freaked out but I couldn't get it back. I almost gave up but I gave the sick one a drink and it got better. There was a photo on the back of the box of Darren and his family and they had been making these for years (since 1981). I had had a photo taken but they didn't use it."
"3162"	"(2009-11-06 (18)) I was on the highway with Mom and we were driving to a friend's house. They had a young son and daughter. The son said he had a girl's name (Marsha). She had brought up pizza and garlic bread like stuff. I had a little but I decided not to eat any more of it. I knew Nathan Fillion and we were good friends. There was a pool with a bunny in it. I can't read what I wrote but I can pick out the words 'trouble' and 'suburb'. Anyway, a friend of Dmitri's left a mat (it looks like it says mat) outside of his house and said to pretend that he was going and to wait for his best friend, who was the girl next door (it was apartment like). She liked him and this was all to freak her out. Later Dmitri and I were lying in bed and we joked about sex and his face was close to mine and he laughed and I was like 'ok...'. He quoted from the movie What Women Want and he was in it."
"3163"	"(2009-11-07 (18)) I was at the old house with Mom out the back. I saw cats in the pool and I saw a cat around and I asked ""is that Tigger?"". She and Mittens were both out there. Dad had given them to an old lady nearby. They had on those things they put over their heads but they were huge. They came to me and I gave them a cuddle. I cried because I missed Tigger. Mom said Darren had said he might've taken one of them but had decided not to take either of them. Then I was at home and Mom, Dad, some others and I were going to some place. We drove there and there was a lot of traffic so people were walking on the street. There were lots of people. We decided to walk too. I had to go back home. I was in the kitchen. I saw a reflection of a girl in Mom's doorway and it was my friend, Jamie. I thought she was possessed as the dog growled. I left the house with Mom and Ezra. Ezra got a call and I said if it was Jamie, to tell her that we can't get her. It was her and he made up a bad lie. We went to the train station and Dad said I'd be ok since I had a SmartRider and I said I didn't bring it. He yelled at me and I said 'why would I bring it if I didn't think I needed it?'. We went through but to get a ticket you had to climb this tower and it had this plastic plate thing. You pull it out and climb up on them. I was worried I was going to fall because it wasn't very stable. I got a score of 850 and got a $10 ticket or something. It was enough to get where we wanted to go. Then I had to go back and get my SmartRider while I was there. I had a little dog."
"3164"	"(2009-11-07 (18)) Ezra's hair was long. He brushed it and it looked gay and we laughed. He was then playing a game and always got stuck at the same point. His character went into this mirror maze thing, which had a slippery floor. He slowed down and then we were both there. It was hard to walk. We went into this room which had two doors on each side of one wall and one in the middle. I went to the one on the right and there was a scream, some footsteps and an evil laugh, which scared me. I went through the middle door. Ezra now had a double or something. I told them to try to climb this thing. I went into a hall and I went into this room with a bed and a small set of drawers. I found socks with rubber bits on the bottom. One pair was black with pink rubber bits. I put them on and I was already wearing socks. I went through the drawer but it was all useless stuff. There was an old mobile phone and I was scrolling through this text which explained how to climb. I went out and gave a pair of socks to Ezra and said I forgot about the other guy, but went back and got him a pair. I looked down the hall and it led to some kids rooms. It was dark and spooky down there and I didn't want to go down there by myself so I went to wait for Ezra."
"3165"	"(2009-11-08 (18)) Joshua Jackson was complaining about Peter (Fringe) being lame. I was going through some stuff and found a crunchy snake lolly and threw it away. Mom picked me up. There were toys on the road which I put there to sort out. To get back 'home', I had to climb up these stairs which were held together by some teenager's bubblegum. There was a pretty girl there called Izzy. The teenagers were sitting on the set of stairs I needed to pull down so I waited. Walter (Fringe) scanned something that was 1800lbs (which equaled 80kg) to work out something about me. This boy got bit by a vampire but the process was different. There was only like one vampire in the world. I bought this game and you go from town to town doing puzzles and helping the citizens, etc. Ezra and I were driving and we went through a red light. I said I wasn't going to do this again and that I needed Mom with me."
"3166"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) Crichton (Farscape) was told by some guy to meet this person somewhere. He went and had to go onto a ship. This guy attacked them. He got hurt. Later, he was lying under a laser which would fix him."
"3167"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) There was a place on the computer to plug something in but it had changed so it was harder to get to and there were fewer ports for it as well. I think it had something to do with a game. Ezra found a trick to get past it and they caught him."
"3168"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) I went for a drive. Ezra and Mom were in the front and I was in the back with Roland. When we got back later I watched a movie. Then it was 6am and Ezra came in and said we were going for another drive to see someone called Dawn and Roland came again. We went to a house and I said ""that's new"" (about a gate at the side) and Mom said it wasn't and I said 'yes it is, you used to pull up on the grass there'. She thought and remembered it was new. We talked about pickle sandwiches and Vegemite."
"3169"	"(2009-11-09 (18)) Noah (Heroes), but he was sometimes Tony (The Soprano's), had a spaceship and was selling it to some guy. They were at a restaurant thing. I was then there and we were in the corner with some guy and I was next to him. People came looking for him and he got up and left. I grabbed this bag and I went outside. It was night. Claire (Heroes) and I got into a light pink car. I locked the doors. We went to Tony's house which was weird and had pools out the front. Meadow (The Soprano's) was with us now and there was more than one of her. Claire and I were trying to keep the other ones out of sight. There was a birthday chart and Claire Fisher (Six Feet Under) was on there and she was only supposed to be twelve."
"3170"	"(2009-11-10 (18)) I had to one more trimester of the MUPC but it didn't count towards grades. I sent an email as 'Katy' to them asking about it. I got a reply from Mr Epstein saying they were looking to change it soon. I was annoyed about it. It was also October 14. The subject selection sheet had stuff like newspaper, create, bounty hunter etc. For the bounty hunter one, you had to scan barcodes on people. Calvin was there. We picked the same first choice but he put my second choice as his last."
"3171"	"(2009-11-10 (18)) Calvin and this girl were friends and we were somewhere. She was outgoing and the like. Se took us out down the street which was like in the city. There was some female singer performing a small concert around. You had to be over 18 but I didn't have my proof of age card and I told her. I went back home to get it and then walked back there alone. I walked in and there weren't many people. There were seats, but not many. Everyone seated had Pokemon cards. Calvin and the girl's seats were like 48-49 and mine was 60. Loren Dean was on the stage and I had thought about leaving, but thought I'd stay since Loren Dean was here. The female singer came on too. A girl went up to ask a question, but was nervous and asked ""what's the most, uh, what's um, the most, what-what's the most serious thing you'd like to do?"". The singer went to ask what she meant but she said she meant like 'serious music feeling'. She was annoyed at the nervous stuttering and said so and was like 'hey, you said feeling!'."
"3172"	"(2009-11-11 (18)) I was at Dad's new place. It was different and big and had two storeys, but each one was like a house. He bought the bottom one for me. It was big and there were lots of food and wrappers around the place. I was cleaning it up. There was a bar in the shape of a swordfish. It was sorted by categories such as alcoholic, non-alcoholic, wedding night etc. There were windows all around the house (it was like made of windows except for one wall). I had a lot of chicken fingers stored. I needed keys still. My boyfriend gave me a video to watch. Drew Barrymore and a guy were in it. She proposed to him then he had actually proposed and it was actually behind the scenes footage from Heroes. I was going to put it on Youtube. Then my boyfriend had actually proposed to me through the video. I said to Ezra ""lucky I watched it"". I went to the shop with Mom. Nana had been watching some show with this lady from PETA in it. The lady was hiding out in the shop and Mom needed to gain their trust before she was allowed in. The lady had killed someone too."
"3173"	"(2009-11-13 (18)) Someone was watching Farscape. Everyone looked weird and I realized they were young. I only remember seeing Aeryn and Zhaan and I think they got married. I figured it was like a prequel."
"3174"	"(2009-11-14 (18)) There was a movie called Ghost Ship. This kid kept seeing a ghost of a boy, who had his front two teeth missing, white skin and black stuff around his eyes. He eventually told him to go away and the ghost was annoyed. Then someone and I went on a boat. This doctor guy from the movie and a woman picked up something and they said it was ok and put it down. I read something later about this father who abused his son. The son was found dead in the ocean and had the same look as the ghost kid in the movie. I was telling Mom about it and said it was creepy. Ezra, Jayson and I were hanging out. Nana gave us books to learn different languages though they were Greek books. One of the words was ""2duvduv"". We watched some Greek movie on TV called Skillis and it was a comedy. We got bored quickly and started watching a 60's movie. There was weird tension between Jayson and I and I was 19."
"3175"	"(2009-11-14 (18)) I was driving down Wanneroo Road and I had turned on from Newtown Drive. Then I realized I wasn't supposed to be driving alone and pulled up on the side of the road. I got out and went across the road for some reason. I went back and a guy was in the driver's seat. I opened the passenger door and said ""Get out of my car"" and I stuck something pointy into his gut and said ""what did you take?"". He had a sign and a bunch of other stuff. I told him to put it back and get out. He said I couldn't report him to the school because I was in the wrong and I said ""suck my balls nub"". I ended up somewhere miles away and I was trying to get back. I got a big stick and was walking along the train tracks. Two guys crossed over. I called Mom and waited at a shop for her. She came. I went to the shop and we stayed there for a while. There were tents in there. There were collections of stuff. There was some Beatles stuff. I saw Michael Palin's diaries and a picture of a guy who I thought was Terry Jones at first, but it was someone else. I started jumping and floating and I said I was full of energy. Mom downloaded a crack to protect from something. Ezra wrote something somewhere about her being a noob. We went to Darren's work nd Mom gave him some wallpaper I chose. When we first got there, Mom pretended to order burgers. We were then at some house. There was a McDonald's ad on TV with Selena, Samantha and Alejandro. Dad had some woman come over. I had heard them having sex before? He said ""where did you hear that?""."
"3176"	"(2009-11-16 (18)) I was at university, which was different. Jeremiah and others I knew where there. I complained because I didn't have lunch with me. Jeremiah was like 'whatever' and I was like 'well, you have lunch'. Some lady saw a lite Mars Bar and said ""did anyone lose this?"" and I said yes and grabbed it. I didn't end up eating it though. Then I had a room there or something and it was like a family room thing. I was going to download a game on Steam and asked Ezra if it was on freezone. The game was Left 4 Dead 2, but wasn't. Eugene and I were going out. I curled up next to him on a lounge and we kissed. Later, he wanted sex but I was busy. I was then at the old house and I still had heaps of stuff there, including my bed, desk, toy box and Grey etc. Mom was annoyed about it. I went to bed early in the morning. It was starting to get light outside. I looked up and I heard Mom say ""someone coming"" and they were in bed in Ezra's first room. Mom had bought a sensor that picked up sounds. I think it says they said the rain made it hiss. I went to my room and there were moths everywhere. I was annoyed because I wanted to go to sleep. I had text Dad asking 'how much weight could I use as [something I can't read] , plus others and drinking lite green tea."
"3177"	"(2009-11-16 (18)) I got Left 4 Dead 2. We had the first one for X-Box 360 and so I set it up and got ready to play in HD. Ezra was watching me. I started and you started off in this forest. It was very bright and there was a thin path going through the forest and I was standing one the edge of a cliff thing. Zombies started running towards me. I fell off the edge and bounced off a platform and died. I tried again and this time started shooting them but I used all my bullets and died again. I asked Ezra to play with me. He sat on the lounge and I was sitting at a table and I moved the TV towards me. I had a keyboard on the table and you had to press 'E' to loot. We tried one together and he gave up. Mom had bought a small table and we got it for him to use. We managed to get past the first bit. The character was then Aeryn (Farscape), though she was called Christine. I got to the save place and there was a brown horse there. There were some weapons lying around and I got some and then left. Then it was real life or something. When we left, lots attacked at once. We got to the next place and it was a house. A zombie came in and we killed it and then a cat came in saying something about getting his gun (it was like a vision). I went to the bedroom and searched the cupboards looking for a gun. I was going through the top shelf and I found a box of condoms. There was nothing on the bottom either. Then I remembered that in movies, guns were kept in the guy's underwear drawer. I went to it and found a gun. It was little and very light. I found some bullets but they weren't actually bullets. I heard sex moans and then this guy came into the room and saw me. I explained what I was doing and he was like 'ok'. This other guy joined our group. I got everyone to gather pointy weapons and then we had to leave. We left through the back door and I stabbed a zombie in the head. I was stronger by the way. I found an axe but it was heavy and really big. There were zombies in the way. One of them was talking and I shoved the axe into his head. It was hard to get in. I got him and he fell. Our weapons got blunt etc quickly. I had a popstick and I hit one on the head a few times with it and it died. We got to the next house. A train full of people went past. The house still had electricity and stuff which I was confused about. The people there said they had no weapons. There was one outside but it was slimy and no-one wanted to clean it. There was a pool nearby. A young girl came in crying, holding a black kitten and a bunny and said one had been bitten -- it was the kitten. I took it off her and I was upset and crying (everyone was). I had to kill it and I put it in this thing, like a microwave. Aeryn was with it when it died and I think later, someone said the kid should've been with it."
"3178"	"(2009-11-17 (18)) I was at a party I think. I was sick and had one glass of alcohol and vomited. There were lots of people around and I was trying to get somewhere but was dizzy. I was hungry too. There was a cheeseburger that I hadn't eaten as part of this thing where you save something you managed to resist eating or remains of when you ate it. I kept my vomit too. I was then at the old house in the kitchen. I was reorganizing my vomit and the burger. I kept seeing the 217 lady in the bath in the bathroom. The first time, I glanced back and she was gone. This time, she was still there. She looked at me and I freaked out and started screaming. I tried to call Mom who was actually there and she came in to have a look. She couldn't see her, although I still could and I freaked out again."
"3179"	"(2009-11-17 (18)) I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Mac, Dennis and Charlie were in a big room and were naked (and there were close ups of their penises) and they were high. Dennis had the biggest one. They shook them and Mac and Dennis and had made out for ""two seconds"" once. Later, Dad took me to this underground carpark, and I had to walk to wherever I was going. The way I usually went was blocked with a gate now. I tried to climb over it but couldn't. This lady came and I started walking down to Dad's car and she told me to go somewhere and I said no. I walked through this other gate into this area. There was a path, which led into other areas (surrounded by small fences) and there was lots of grass and flowers and the like. One had lots of dogs in it, and there was a Chow Chow and a Welsh Corgi. I called Mom to get me but there was no answer. I walked through the place and was at Albany Highway train station. I had no money on me. This guy gave me a newspaper. I text Mom and Ezra. Calvin and a girl were there. I looked in my bag and I realized I had about $20. The girl he was with asked if we were ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" and I said no and got up to leave. There was a room there with a platform which took you down to this platform with the train. The one which went down to go to Centerville wasn't there, but I didn't realize at first and almost fell. I was hanging off the edge and got back up. This girl jumped on one and it started spinning around and it killed her. I had a message from Samantha and this other girl, replying to a question I had asked. It mentioned me having something in common with [someone, but I can't read the name] , such as The Beatles and other music. I asked this lady in a restaurant if the train was ready and she said yeah but to bring it back by 11 (it was like midnight). I asked why and she said ""you can't have her forever"" and she was talking about Chiana (Farscape) who had something to do with some service with aliens. I said no I want the train. I got in an elevator with 3 guys and it was squishy. I then had to take a train-like thing to the train. Stuff happened along the way and you had to say something, like fail, ownage etc. Stuff fell from the sky. There were toys scattered on the trucks. One was a big dinosaur toy in the middle of the track. I said ""fail"" and we got past. We ran to the train tracks and it was in the middle of nowhere and there was lots of sand. The train left. Another one came for Centerville and I had to run to the other side. I got in and the seats pulled down and there were about 10 seats. I was also at university at one point and I had to hand out notebooks. One was Grady's, but his name was spelt ""Gradee"" and there was also a book for Gavin."
"3180"	"(2009-11-18 (18)) I was at Toys R Us with Mom and she had cut out a picture of D'Argo (Farscape) on the computer and said he always [did something to her, I can't read it] . He was from another show too. I said he grew on me. Then the other show, he and some others were in a car and they were trying to catch a creature. Someone was like ""who's more important here. You?"" and he said no and then there was a big shadow and some guy was outside. I honked the horn to get it to leave. Mom and some others were in an alley. Bradley Cooper was there and there were some fences and he was in a 'door of fantasy' (led to another realm). We were trying to hide from something. I joined him and then we ran into this glass room. It was inside another room, and was just glass all the way around (in a circle). He said "" [someone] is nub"". We closed the door and then this guy who was like Ralph Fiennes in Harry Potter came and had to use magic to get in. Everyone went crazy and smashed the walls. There was an old guy there. I left and Ezra, some others and I were in a restaurant. A radio station was playing like 6IX. I was looking at the food (it was like a buffet) and there was rice, gnocchi and prawns. James Gandolfini was there too. I said ""Oh my God, they have gnocchi! Gnocchi is my favouritist thing in the world! Must resist the gnocchi"". There was good music playing and some guy changed the station. There was a cover of When I'm Cleaning Windows. I said it was made in ""like 1937"". Down By The River and Driver's Seat also played. Liar, Liar also came on. Then I had gone out with Ramona somewhere. We crossed the street and had a compass with us. I had a pen and I remembered back to when my 'boyfriend' had given it to me and it was like a movie and he had died years ago. He had given me the compass too, I think, and had said to ""point it towards me"". As we crossed the street I cried. We got to Subway and she wanted me to order her food and she gave me $2.25 per thing she got to use for myself. I said that I wouldn't order it. The seats we were at, were facing the wall, which had a mirror on it. I tried to call Mom to get me, but called Dad by mistake. He yelled at me and said he was trying to watch a movie and ""Tom Cruise just killed himself"" -- which was a scene in Risky Business. I waited outside behind a car. Some girl told me to move."
"3181"	"(2009-11-19 (18)) Dad, Ezra, some others and I were on a train thing, but it was like a rollercoaster. I was facing backwards. Living On a Prayer was playing. There was more around and I think we were only allowed to hit them in a certain place which would make them sick? They all stopped. Dad also lived in this caravan thing. He made me a pasta meal. This guy like The Joker was outside and I was going to say 'if they made a movie of you...' but then remembered about 'The Lame Knight'. We were playing some game and Dad and I were on a team and Ezra and two others were on the other team. We were then off the train thing and we were hitting each other with cushions. I was with D'Argo (Farscape) and others. I was then at an old school of mine. I was waiting at the toilet and there was one with stripy toilet paper. This teacher lady recognized me and asked I was now in Year 11 and I said ""no, university"" and she asked if I was doing something in media and I said ""no, science"". The toilet was blocked and there was water on the floor. It had leaked under two rooms behind it (that's what is says, no idea what it means). I left and had to teleport. D'Argo and the others got some sickness from changing realms. It made them into a demon randomly. It also was Runescape sometimes. I had no shirt on and hid in the toilet and I asked this guy to get me a shirt. Jensen Ackles was one of the people I was with by the way. He was sick and was getting something ready and he stopped breathing. I had to use defibrillator on him. It didn't work. Darren said ""so is my son"" because Quincy was dead. I tried mouth to mouth and he started breathing again. We teleported again and it was Runescape. I was at a castle, on the roof. It was dark and cloudy. The King looked like Rygel (Farscape) and needed to get down from the roof. Some people were jumping and he almost fell."
"3182"	"(2009-11-20 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I went to a restaurant on this beach area. It was night. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt and these light blue shorts with fluffballs on them. Dad was wearing the same colour. We got there 'late'. This lady said the special was chicken with a nice spice sauce. When we finally got our meal it was mixed with rice and gravy and they were like 'woops'."
"3183"	"(2009-11-20 (18)) I was at Nana's. Ezra was there too. I went outside and the fish pond was quite clear. There was a big orange fish and I was singing to it. This big silver fish was nearby. I saw something on the bottom of the pond and it was rock like, but then I realized it was a fish. I then realized it was actually a Murloc. I ran to tell Ezra. He was on the computer and was smoking. He said something about a Supernatural convention and he was up to episode 4 of season 5."
"3184"	"(2009-11-22 (18)) I was at home but it was different. I went to go have a shower but Darren was in the bathroom. The shower was in the middle of the room next to the wall (like, sticking out from where the window is and you could walk around the other side). I left to go wait. I saw steam coming out of the fishtank and realized hot water was going in. I pointed it out to Mom and she was on her computer but was like 'meh, there's nothing we can do'. The eel was smaller and there was a crab and other fish. They started to go crazy and I was like ""can't we move them or something?"" and I was freaking. Then it was like a movie. This guy went somewhere to get a wish granted. He was then Jared Padalecki. He was at this place where there were train tracks for like a coal train. Then I was there with Eugene and we ran to catch this person, but we were really fast."
"3185"	"(2009-11-23 (18)) I was at home but it was different. Jared Padalecki was my boyfriend. He wanted to move in and I cleared out some stuff and Darren got some boxes made of this cement stuff. Then we were in a train/bus/plane thing. There were beds and we were sharing one. The vehicle was also alive or something. I took it with me when I left. There was also a young boy and some others. It could only go back down if people gave it money. It let us back down."
"3186"	"(2009-11-24 (18)) I was at the train station but it was late. The next train was in ""900 minutes"". I went to the toilet and there were lots of cubicles and they were back to back. There was a toilet seat that was made out of like Play-Doh and bubblegum, so I didn't go. I told someone at the train station how to catch a train. The train came and I kept texting Mom to tell her when/where to get me. But when I got to where I normally went, something went wrong and I ended up 2 stations away. It was on the way to another one nearby though. The driver asked if we were all ok about it. It was still late and dark now. I said no because my Mom picked me up. This girl was there, whose online name on something was Nikki_08. Everyone kept saying her face looked like a foot. I was thinking that I had seen it written on IMDb. I was talking to another girl about it and she said it was for ""Madeline Zahn"", she meant Zima. She did the MUPC too. We went back to the station and waited. Jakob was there. I was repeating Communications and three other subjects. I had gotten a HD in all of them though. This policewoman offered to let the girl get a needle in her arm? But she missed and there was a bit of blood. I called Mom and she hadn't gotten any of my texts. She said she would leave now. Nikki was saying that her [something] was 20 and looked good and I was like 'ok...'. Darren had gotten a new car because of the bandwidth running out. I was watching Farscape and it was in an alternate reality so I was like ""Yay! No Chiana!"" But she was in it. I also remember seeing Aeryn and Darren."
"3187"	"(2009-11-25 (18)) Dad had knocked down the old house and there were four small units there. The pool was still there. One of the units was 'separate' and could be bought. The others had to be rented. Dad was staying in the place he bought but was changing it. He had had it for 20 months or something. The bed was 'in' the wall, on the ground because the place was tiny. I went on Runescape and Calvin was on there and was level 106. I was shocked at this. He had been playing it quite a bit lately and I checked his account and he had only signed up 5 days ago. He had lots of level 90 stats and lots of quests done. I was annoyed, but realized something was wrong and it also said he had only played for a total of 72 hours. Ezra and I were at the shop. I bought some food with my own money. I got biscuits and Nutri-Grain as it was going to run out tomorrow. Someone asked me for money and I said that I had like $3 and managed to get rid of them. When we left, Ezra ate all the food. I asked Mom to pay me back but she refused."
"3188"	"(2009-11-26 (18)) Granny was sick and stayed with us sometimes. She did some puzzles and a scratchie. Ezra and I had stopped going out to see her (she was in the games room) for no apparent reason. She told me about some scratchie and she had gotten three words with something I can't read, but lost. I checked it and she thought it was like a crossword scratchie and you only won by getting four words, but you actually got money per word. For 13 words you got $9.5 million. She had gotten all the words. I said to Ezra that I didn't know how to tell her (as she had recently had a heart attack). I said to her ""I don't know how to tell you this, but you've won over $10 mil"". She laughed with surprise. I had mail and it was something from the bank or the government. It had a number for something. It was night by the way. I checked if the scratchie had expired and it expired on December 9th. The next day, Mom, Ezra, Granny, some others and I went to the place to cash it in. We went to the counter and they said that it was ""almost $15 mil' and it was all in cash. We got the cash and went to another room. Santa was sitting at the end of a long table. We gave it to Santa, who was a young guy and was kind of hot. He checked the scratchie but he wanted us to bring it back tomorrow and clean it up a little. He said he was excited because he hadn't seen this big a win in ages. This radio show program was on and said stuff about hosters (it looks like that, but I don't remember what it's meant to say)."
"3189"	"(2009-11-26 (18)) Ezra was watching something and I realized it was It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and I went ""Charlie!"" and Mac was also in the scene. I said Charlie was my favourite but I liked Dennis more now because of his hilarious facial expressions. He asked, ""Which one's Dennis?"" and I said the tall, skinny one and pointed him out. I said that Mac annoys me."
"3190"	"(2009-11-27 (18)) I was at the old house with Mom and Ezra. I was sleeping out in the lounge for some reason. No-one would leave me alone. I turned off the TV and lights and then they left. Mom was suspicious I had taken a book of hers. She pulled out a book I had with me, but it was a different book and she apologized. I went to my room and I had been avoiding it because heaps of moths had died in there. I was then at a shop/university and Aliyah was there and said ""oh hi!"". She was doing history to get a pass for human biology. I said I was scared about university next year. This guy made us put something in the car and it was full in the back."
"3191"	"(2009-11-28 (18)) I was at university, which was different. I got a text from Dad about a sticky calculator and he was a teacher. This girl said ""I thought you were here to talk to Terrence"" and I said ""uh, why would I want to do that? I haven't seen him since I was 12"". I saw Evelyn leaving. I also saw Eugene and some others at a table. I couldn't find the proper way out, but I managed to get out. It was hard to walk out to the road. There were two buses on the other side of the road but they both left. I waited for the next ones, and a huge crowd gathered. We waited for the traffic to slow down so we could cross. I text Mom to say that I didn't have my SmartRider. This guy came with a gun and said to give him our phones. I said I didn't have mine. The girl next to me gave him a wallet instead. I pulled out a $5 note and said it was all I had. He told me to stick my hand in my other pocket and I pulled out a 20c coin. The guy now looked like Eli Roth, but was some other famous guy. I was talking to Ezra on MSN over my phone and said ""I'm being held up, go away"". He kept pressuring me to give him stuff. He told us to go, so we all went across the street and he tried to push me into the traffic. I waited at the bus stop. It finally came. I found my SmartRider in my bag. I tagged on twice accidentally. The second time interrupted this girl and she ended up getting left behind."
"3192"	"(2009-11-29 (18)) I was studying medicine. I had blue scrubs and a white coat. Ezra was on a computer and went on this website with a girl called Monica Reunion. Something looked pink. I was also skinny. I told Mom that whatever it was looked pink. I watched the first few episodes of NCIS and it had a weird storyline. This young Asian girl doctor and this guy always had to keep their uniforms on because they were always on call. The snuck off to have sex on a bunk in the on call room. Then it was me, but sometimes Thuy. I had sex with the guy, and I was on top. Then it was like before and I ran to this diet place. The lady outside said that I was perfect (to join) except for one thing and it was because my heart rate was probably high and I would have to pay. I asked her a question about something. There was a boy on a bike and she yelled angrily at him. He had a heart rate monitor on, but it actually measured words that he thought. She said he used to backchat Beethoven. Then she said I passed the test and was allowed in. There was a room with computers and her daughter, an adult, came in. Her two sons came in and they were around my age. It was squishy in the room and my last name was Daughter, but I thought it was weird I hadn't noticed. I went onto an oval nearby and there were some boys playing soccer. I kicked the ball back to them. I felt happy for some reason and I sat on this spinning chair and went across the park, spinning in slow motion. People were watching me but I didn't care. Then I saw this dude on top of a building with a gun. I got off and ran behind some trees. They tried to shoot me. Other people started shooting back. When they were all dead I ran across the street to this house. This Asian guy came down the street and he was the leader of the bad guys. I hit him with an eggplant and he threw it away. He had an avocado and I took it and hit him on the head with it. He died. Thuy came and asked what happened and I said ""killed some Asian guy"". She said he was their worst enemy. I walked down the street and the lady from before was looking for her sister. She was pregnant and I said the Asian guy was dead. These people in another room heard and were like 'yay!'. There was a little chicken and they put it on the fire to singe its feathers. It was special. The lady 'bequeathed' me the owner of it. It was cute and yellow, and had brown on the end of its feathers from where they had burnt it."
"3193"	"(2009-11-30 (18)) I went to this restaurant place but it was like a cinema. There was a small TV in front. They were watching Office Space. I saw Ron Livingston but he looked different. People from school were there and we were all on Facebook. I found a photo with Eugene and he had commented on it. Eugene, Samantha and others were hanging out to discuss university life. There was a movie on and people didn't like it so they left. I got a project and stuff for it. Before Ezra could get some movie in, there was The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and some new movie but he wanted Spiderman. Later, I went out the back with Mom. She said she invited Meyer over to hang out, ""but I'm not a lesbian"". I said ""I didn't say you were""."
"3194"	"(2009-12-01 (18)) I was at Nana's. Mom was there too but she left. Then Dad left. I decided I didn't want to stay and asked them to come back and get me."
"3195"	"(2009-12-01 (18)) I was at school and we had an assembly in this big room. This guy told us we got 'free' lunchtime now, which meant we could decide when it started and ended. Ms Solomon wouldn't tell anyone her kids last names, then someone was like 'duh, it's Faisal'. I left and called Mom. She was at a radio station outside of town trying to ""get to 100°C"". I tried to call Dad but didn't get an answer. I walked out and saw Mr Reilly. I realized I had no keys. I found some food Mom had recently eaten, which was from a place in 'Liddleton'. I tried to find it. Ezra was friends with Jensen Ackles on Facebook."
"3196"	"(2009-12-02 (18)) I was at Nana's. She went out because of an emergency, but it wasn't. I heard this thing about how Ryan Kwanten had recently purchased 3 TV shows and one had already been cancelled. Another was a reality show where the people do competitions and get eliminated. I watched a bit of it and it was good. Then I was watching The Great Dictator. It was actually funny and good, which I thought was surprising since it was Chaplin. There was a jetty and people were walking onto a boat. Chaplin was behind them and by the time he got there, the boat had left and Hitler's had arrived. Hitler got off and Chaplin got on. The crew thought he was Hitler. Then I was outside somewhere and I'm not too sure what was going on, but I was with Seth (The O.C). They were after us and we were trying to get on a boat. We went through a house and into the backyard and we were getting shot at. We went into the pool. We lifted our heads a bit later and there were more shots. I had trouble staying underwater. I managed to get somewhere with cover and we 'fell' over the fence. As we went over we saw Summer (The O.C) in another backyard. They shot and we saw bodies in the pool. There was a road next to the house she was at and there were three rows of houses. There was an alley next to us. She unlocked a gate and I was now Seth and I ran to the end of the alley. She had trouble opening the gate and then we hugged and kissed on the lips. But then I was me, but not, and I was actually going out with Seth. We left and there was this thing were people heard something and then went into groups of three (and no-one knew anyone else). We were going to pretend that was going on if we were caught. We went back onto the street and it was in America and these people were celebrating. But they were actually the bad guys. I went to go surrender to them at one point, but they started coming at me so I quickly 'flew' around this corner."
"3197"	"(2009-12-02 (18)) I asked Mom to wake me up by 11.30am. The next morning at 11, she left with Ezra without waking me, but I woke up anyway. I was getting ready later for the comedian thing. Dad came over and I still needed to do my hair. Mom said it would be done in a minute. She took too long so I did it myself. Dad had long hair and we straightened some as a joke. I finished my hair quickly and then I saw it was 7.45pm and I panicked and said we had to leave. We left and Dad went to get cigarettes on the way and there were also road works going on but he didn't seem to be worried about the time. I was watching Supernatural and I was in it. Sam, Dean and I were walking down a street and a train came. Sam was on a bed and Dean and I were pushing it. It did something weird and landed behind us. Sam's leg stretched really high and he took a step and then was back to normal. Then as a joke, Dean leapt into my arms and I carried him a fair way. Sam tried to do it, but couldn't. Then he got heavy and I put him down. Something else happened and it had something to do with spells. We got onto a bus which was actually a library or something though. They started talking to the bus driver and I said ""hang on, isn't he supposed to be the Trickster?"". I said I watched Band of Brothers recently and something else he was in. He changed into the Trickster and was like ""she's good"". I said ""not really, I saw the next episode preview and it showed the Trickster"". He had down the stuff to us earlier. There was a huge queue outside and there was an ugly guy with a mole. It started to rain and everyone started running into the rain. The Trickster wanted me to leave and opened the door. Sam leant over and shut it. I liked him and I think he liked me, by the way. Dean mentioned wanting to sit at a table with Bela. She was there and we were all acting silly. Bela kissed Sam on the cheek/neck. There was also some place called Twilight and we joked that the Trickster liked Twilight. There was also something to do with a ""Pokemon handbook""."
"3198"	"(2009-12-03 (18)) I was an alien or at least, I was friends with some aliens. We were in an outside area surrounded by fences (there were lots of areas and they were all joined together). Sometimes I was inside. We had people in one of the areas to keep them safe. One of them and I went two blocks away. He had an alien gun. I said ""don't I get one?"". He said no. People were coming. We then found a gun buried and he gave it to me. I couldn't remember how to use it. I was now definitely an alien. He showed me how to cock it and told me to aim at something to hit a mask to practice my aim, but then we heard them coming. I went behind the other guy and then they came in and we started shooting. The gun shot out a liquid which exploded but it had to recharge; so there was lots of 'bang' but then a five second pause. Then they came from the other side. There were only a few left on the first side. Jennifer Carpenter wandered in from that side. I said ""Jennifer, go through that door"" as she was friendly with us, though she looked really confused and lost. I aimed behind her and started shooting again. Then I was inside somewhere and there was a round counter in the middle (like in bars). There were a few people around, including Bill Clinton, who was the president. I shot liquid on him and he exploded. Everyone seemed shocked and I said ""is that bad?""."
"3199"	"(2009-12-05 (18)) Calvin and I went on a boat? It was a place for the MUPC. I had done the assignment before. I had to roll a dice for something (there were like 30 of them). I told them I was here for that. There was an elevator and Calvin stopped it, but it was only half way. We let it go and it was ok. We got in and everyone complained it was too small. We got there and just had to play around. Ms Edmundson got angry and annoyed with us. I found some notebooks at a shop that had been written on. I was like ""what a douche"". There was a table and we were told to sit there quietly. Then she came and said that maybe we should split up and I said ""why?"" and she said ""you have the rest of your lives to spend together"". I was like ""pfft"". I got the dice out a while later for some reason."
"3200"	"(2009-12-05 (18)) Clayton and I were running through buildings and such in a town or a school. There was a room with grass and steps inside. There was stuff on the outside and we climbed it. Then there was like an earthquake. We held on and it was kind of fun. Then there was a little kitten which was special and could breathe fire. I was watching Dawson's Creek with Mom. Joey and some guy had been trying to have sex for ages but something always went wrong. Sometimes I was Joey. She and the guy got into a car and the guy pretended to be a taxi driver and drove them around and someone was trying to kidnap them."
"3201"	"(2009-12-06 (18)) We went for a drive and it was late at night. I was with Mom and Ezra. There was a little ball of light that looked like it was floating. We were living in this place which like a caravan park, but it wasn't. It was like a small community thing. We went back a while later and there was a cloud with the light and there were sparks. It was worrying me. At some point we went to see some live concert in a small area in a tunnel. We couldn't stand and it was hard to get a seat. This young Indian guy got offered a house if he called the owner and get him to sell and do something else. We drove home and we lived near the beach. I was with some guy. Chiana (Farscape) had some food like those Turkish meat things. I signaled someone to get me some but realized she made some for me. I couldn't remember what they were called. We went to Dad's house. It was clean around the side and there was a toilet in his bedroom. We left the caravan park again. We stopped at a shop. The car was next to a window and I was on Ezra's side and he was on mine. I locked my door. Mom came back and this girl got in the passenger seat. Mom and I kicked her out. I was worried she would follow us. Then I realized it was a dream. I was scared and wanted to wake up. Then I opened my eyes and felt tired. I was now 'awake'."
"3202"	"(2009-12-07 (18)) We went through a drive thru at a takeaway place. I saw a car behind us and Jamison was in it. I joked around with Ezra and Samantha. Jamison' boyfriend was called Bill. Samantha drew a picture at university saying 'you should be with Damon' -- she meant Calvin. I was like 'ew no'. I asked this lady behind a counter when we would get our offers for university. She checked on the computer and said I had only put down Veterinary Science. I realized it was 'Jessica Holden' and I said it wasn't me. There was an online poker game at 4pm (US) which meant like 4am here. Robin Williams was in it and was doing well but then we realized he didn't actually know how to play. Nana and Granny were over. Grey's Anatomy was on. Teddy was in a hospital bed and Meredith visited her. I read that Kim Raver was moving was to my state for 'social [something] ' so she was only in 5 episodes but I figured that because of the move she was in more."
"3203"	"(2009-12-07 (18)) I was watching True Blood. Sookie died and turned into a vampire. Someone complained about it. Then it was real life. Three others and I were vampires. We could go in daylight at the moment. Someone was walking 'cool'. I watched a movie with Dad and Ezra. Nicholas Cage was in it. He had died and Dad was upset? Dad asked ""who's Angelina Jolie's husband?"" and I said ""Brad Pitt""."
"3204"	"(2009-12-08 (18)) I was in a room with Ezra and some others (there was about four of us). There were lots of beds. There were zombies. We were on the second floor or so. We had to leave and Ezra was worried and checked outside but nothing was there. We suggested other places to look. I went to the window in the toilet and looked out and I saw some. There was a light on in front of our house/building. The curtain wasn't staying up properly now. It was also like a game and you could 'loot' -- I got new shoes from looting. Then we were outside. To get to other places you had to use this complicated rope system. You had to hold onto the rope and swing onto the platforms. Someone fell. I almost fell off and lost a bunch of stuff, but didn't. I think Mel Gibson had been part of our group or something and someone said something that referred to ""the stranger that took him"". He was in some show called Macabre and that was his character's name. It was Tom Cruise's kid's birthday and he sent him to 'Cowboy Land'. He had a black maid and he was like ""What? It's cowboys!""."
"3205"	"(2009-12-08 (18)) It was my birthday. Mom was giving me money, but not yet. Darren was going to the shop to buy stuff for cheese and onion pie. Raquel gave me a bag of stuff and I said ""this is the most exciting thing I've gotten all day"". There was something about jumping off something into the ocean. When I was younger, a heap of others and I had done this, jumping from rocks. Some kid had hit the rock. There was a photo of him and he was like 30-40 now. I saw him somewhere and wanted to meet up with him. There was a queue for something. Then I was at home, which was different. I was organizing some mess. A baby had gotten kidnapped and there was an x-ray and pictures of other babies. They chased this guy. They were in a taxi and there was a fat guy. This guy got out and the fat guy punched him through the glass, which smashed."
"3206"	"(2009-12-09 (18)) I was excited because I was seeing Whose Line is it Anyway live. Mom dropped me off there late. I went down some steps and sat at the bottom of the stairs. I had a long microphone with me. There was a break now and Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles left. I got bored and felt funny about the microphone. I text Mom to get me and got a 'rap' text back and I figured it was from Ezra. I walked out to the carpark. I used the microphone as a cane because my legs were sore. She was already there and I got in. Ezra said that he got Jensen Ackles' ""signature"" and I was like 'what?!'. He said that this teacher who was obsessed with him told him that he was somewhere. He had a photo and on the back it said ""from Jensen"" and I said that he should've gotten him to write ""love, Jensen"". Jared Padalecki was also in the photo. I was annoyed and said that I wanted a photo. Mom was like ""you love Sam"" and I said ""Sam's gay""."
"3207"	"(2009-12-10 (18)) Our house had two floors. There was a hole in my floor under my desk. Water shot through. I went and woke Mom and she said she would get Darren up. He came to look. He took the carpet off. There were lots of pen size holes which he thought were caused from where something had fallen. He said I couldn't have the desk here all the time and I said that I couldn't put it anywhere else. He went off and I was trying to work out what to do. I was going to ask why but he had gone back to bed."
"3208"	"(2009-12-11 (18)) There was some event on soon. I went over to the neighbours. They were a couple and there was a cake with eggplant on it and it said ""Happy birthday"" on it. They asked if it was ok and I was like 'I suppose'. I wanted to enlarge it but it was too difficult. There was some dancing mummy dude. Then it was like the next day and the event was on. I went over to help them. They had a picture that I'd drawn and they packed it up, but I went back and they gave it to me. I walked out with it, holding it flat in front of me. Our house was a while away. I walked across the street and a car came. The wind blew and it started acting like a parachute thing and I had to let go. I chased after it and it was ok. Dad was outside with Ezra and he was like ""that better not have been your picture"". I had to go back in with Ezra to get the cake. As we left he said there was a song on before that he thought was catchy. I also had my iPod with me so I could listen to it on a drive."
"3209"	"(2009-12-11 (18)) Thea Gill, Michelle Clunie and I were friends. We were on a train. There were people throwing stuff and we moved to the end carriage. I think people weren't happy with gays. There was a cartoon and you could watch it in colour, although it was made in black and white. Some people were trying to run from some witch person and they ran into a different motel room. The witch found them. I think they went to her 'lair'. It was science fiction looking. When they walked through the front entrance, they started walking across and platforms appeared as they stepped on them. This girl came in from another side and nothing appeared and she fell. The witch or whatever, sent a ship to save her."
"3210"	"(2009-12-11 (18)) I was sharing a room with Ezra? Roland was over too. I went to bed with no pants on because it was hot. I woke up and I had to get out of bed to find my pants, but Ezra and Roland were awake. The light was off though. Roland was looking for something under the bed with a torch. I found a pair of red shorts and left to go to the toilet. As I left, Don't Ever Change started playing. The toilet was small and there was one on the side wall too. Mom had a cinema and she was in the projector room playing with the screen resolution. The popcorn was made in there too. I asked if when it was open, could I work in here and she was like 'of course'. The cinema was in a mall. We left and when we were going back we went through all these shortcuts that were full of people to get to it. Mom was angry about it. Ezra brought flowers to the cinema and they had bees in them. I got a butterfly and brought it to Mom. There was a big black one and it was the size of a cat. We got chased by a giant robot."
"3211"	"(2009-12-12 (18)) I was outside with Samantha and Calvin at school. He told her to run around this area and me to just stand there. It was an experiment that he was filming. He ran to the top of the oval and Samantha was still here and said if he did something for 10 minutes straight, he would collapse. We went up the hill and there was a crowd of people. He was mumbling nonsense and they were trying to give him water. I was holding a Sakata. Eugene came and saw my Sakata. I was trying not to look at him and it seemed as though he was waiting for me to look. I went to class. Mom pulled out old school stuff of mine. There was a game I made in year 6 and it was like a mad lib but you just filled in the last word. She tried to explain it but she didn't make sense. I told her to give up. There were Goosebumps books. I said ""Beast From the East for the win!"". There was a presentation about some computer thing."
"3212"	"(2009-12-12 (18)) I was in the car with Mom in the middle of nowhere. There was a bridge with wood slats. There was another one which also had gaps. We drove fast and then [did something I can't read] for the last one because it wasn't far. We went into a building. There was a concert with Bruce Springsteen and some guy. Springsteen's nickname was ""Boxy"". I had something and we mentioned holes and he gave me a light shovel and said we had to ""dig a hole for safety""."
"3213"	"(2009-12-12 (18)) I was watching Monsters Inc. with Ezra. It was totally different and was also a musical. The little dude was sent to a place where they were keeping these aliens. The aliens looked human. They had been there for a while. The big dude came later. The little guy would hide out in rooms, but they could see everything anyway. Then I was there in a room. I threw a letter and something else away and straight away there were replacements in the mail. I walked past some pregnant ladies and babies. They said they sent them out, but killed them. Calvin was there. We were trying to plan an escape. This young kid called out to an alien and then hid behind some people. I went over and pointed at this brown-ish kid and said ""it doesn't feel like [name] or taste like [name] "" and poked my tongue out. They laughed and the people in charge were satisfied (that I was one of them, or whatever). Then Calvin, his 'cousin' (who looked like Dewey), and heaps of others and I were on a bus. His cousin looked like a raccoon because everyone was in makeup and dressed up for a play or something. We turned the corner and he fell on me. We had trouble getting back up. I saw a poodle. Then I was somewhere else with Ezra. Dad took us to Granma's to tell them we were staying with Dad."
"3214"	"(2009-12-13 (18)) I was sitting in my car. I was at school. Some kids were playing around outside. I wound the windows up and locked the doors. This older girl came. One of them was a second cousin of mine. I had only known them for a while. The older girl was trying to get in the front window. I pushed her out and wound the window up. She could reach her fingers through the door handle from the outside. I got in the drivers seat and drove off. I was looking for somewhere to park it. Mom came and we left. A long time later, I went back and they had found it (the car). We gathered items for a quest, which was called Toad Hunter. The rest of my group wanted to do it tomorrow."
"3215"	"(2009-12-14 (18)) I was doing some course (MUPC or school or something). Raquel was also doing it and she was sitting next to me. We were told we were going to watch Das Boot. I was talking to Raquel about it. I said the ending was awesome, ""when he dies"". She looked at me blankly and she hadn't seen it. There was a scene with some guy swimming. He reached for a coin and this shark bit him. Raquel asked the teacher if she had to watch it. The teacher was Ms Solomon sometimes. She said ""you haven't seen anything like that before"". I said ""I have"" and she was like 'you think you're cool because you've seen it'. She took us to a room. She asked if we'd seen a bit of this cartoon and I said ""I don't do cartoons"". She showed us one and it was porn. I left. Later, they brought two guys in as it was ending. It changed into something else. Later I was with Mom in the car. I was supposed to be going to university or something but Mom wanted to go get something. I thought I'd just message Raquel for the notes later. There was a cupboard at the old house. There was special stuff and Das Boot ""extra [something] "". There was a slang sheet."
"3216"	"(2009-12-15 (18)) There was a movie with Jensen Ackles and one with Jared Padalecki. I watched the one with Jared Padalecki one night and I think it was good. I went outside. It was late and I can't remember what I was doing but I was trying to breathe quietly so I didn't wake the neighbours. There was something about the movie out there. Ezra was around at some point. Later I went through a drive thru with Mom. We had to put our credit card in a slot. The girl at the counter asked us what country and we told her. I did something and she laughed and said she was on something with a president."
"3217"	"(2009-12-15 (18)) I was in class at a table. I was with Ezra and others. We were playing Monopoly. I was late there and then we started. No-one wanted me as the banker. We had to roll five dice to decide who went first. Then it was a movie. This girl and a guy got caught. This teacher guy said everyone else got today and six hours to prepare for the next test, but they had to do the test now. They had six hours to do it though. Then I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We took our time because we were waiting for this guy, who was called Marlowe. We went to leave and then he turned up. We asked if he wanted to stay over and he said yeah. Mom drove off and he was close behind. Then it was the movie again. The next day, the guy from before hugged the girl from behind. They had to go to a funeral and the test was supposed to be at 4. He mother was supposed to work but she wasn't going."
"3218"	"(2009-12-15 (18)) I was at university. Ms Eckert was teaching. Evelyn was also in the class. We were given a strip of paper and scissors. She told us to cut something out. Everyone left except for Evelyn and I. I got bored so I got my ruler and sliced off the pieces instead of cutting them. She said I lost the race. She said we had to cut it and so the stuff properly to see who comes first. I went to get another one. It was a picture of a Runescape Christmas. I had gotten a distinction on one of these tests and was 100th percentile in the school. This guy I sort of liked was talking. I called Mom to say I was ready to get picked up. I walked out along with the guy and some girl. We stood at the edge of the road. A big bus came and people were standing and trying not to fall. Someone had a blue striped leg with holes and their big toe was upside down?"
"3219"	"(2009-12-16 (18)) Helo (Battlestar Galactica), Dad and I were invited into some secret thing. It had something to do with The Hulk and there was a picture of it. Mom and I burned all the evidence. Some people came for dinner and Mom slipped up. I was in the other room and pretended not to notice. Dad was also at the table. We found at later he was involved and when we found out he said we could have our account back. Then they captured Helo and tired him up and tortured him. He told them everything within a few minutes. It turned out I was the secret. They got me and I said to treat me like a human being or I'll just sit here. This guy came over and I moved away. Helo cleaned himself up. Then Ezra and I were in a shop and I think he was trying to kill some animals at a pet shop using a bowling ball. I tried to stop him and he tried to kill me. Something exploded. He threw something at a window, which smashed. We had a fight in a clothes shop. He was like 'it was supposed to explode', so I ran. Then a window exploded and started sucking everything in. We both ran through this carpark into the forest. I was then walking along with a girl and it was foggy. There were 3-4 African girls somewhere. I got to this place and I had a puppy and other animals. I let them out. This girl had a dog and it had white stuff coming out of its bum and I told everyone to be careful."
"3220"	"(2009-12-16 (18)) Some people were after me and this guy. We ran into a shop. I had recently lost my shoes and I grabbed some more but I grabbed two left ones. I kept trying to look but the people kept turning up. We ran to the back of the store and into the toilet and locked the door. I sat at the door to hold it closed. They got in anyway. We attacked and got out. We found a fancy hotel place. There was a room with a spa bath etc. My friend died. I took his shoes which were big, but they fit. When I locked the door, I hit a button which sounded the alarm. They came and I left. Later, I came back. There was a pet shop and I got a uniform. They had a Chow Chow creature and the people were after that."
"3221"	"(2009-12-18 (18)) I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dee entered a weight lifting competition and got Dennis, Mac and Charlie to help. For every level they went up, more weights were added and it got to a ridiculous amount. They edited something so much there was so resemblance. She asked for help again. I think Terry Jones was asked to lift weights and he said ""no I'm fucking not"". I said [someone] might like that, and I meant to get the guys to kiss him. Later, I was at home and Mom was on the computer. Dee came and told me something and he clapped. I said it was my idea, saying ""bromance"". Mom and Darren laughed but were confused about it. An old friend of Mom's came over and so did Meyer. Someone mentioned a movie with two guys and I said ""Jason Segel!"" (talking about I Love You, Man)."
"3222"	"(2009-12-18 (18)) Mom did something and a singer guy made a song called 'Sasha Off Cliff'. We heard gun shots or something across the road. I locked the door (we were at the old house). Mom went to have a shower and I was at the door. Then there was a tap on my shoulder and this guy was there with a gun. There was a knock on the door. I reached into the other room and grabbed a bin. There was another guy at the door and I hit him with the bin and he shot his gun. I threw the bin at him and held it down on him. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt and I got blood on it."
"3223"	"(2009-12-20 (18)) I heard about some puppies that were available. They were cute as hell. At some house the dogs were blocking the door. This guy had to speak with Mom. The pups were Akita Inu's. I told Mom that a Shiba Inu was what I had wanted originally. They were small dogs but they were cute. The males weren't very nice looking though but I was going to get one."
"3224"	"(2009-12-20 (18)) I went to a friend of Mom's with Mom and Ezra. They had Labradors but they were too old or something."
"3225"	"(2009-12-22 (18)) This guy at a petrol station was talking to Serena and Blair (both from Gossip Girl). There was something about Led Zeppelin and another band. The lead singer was someone's boyfriend so he could help them. Blair told him stuff in return. I can't read what I wrote, but he said something and Blair answered him. But they both liked him. Lillian started talking to him and flirting with him. He had tan skin. Lillian turned away and told him not to joke around. They were both breathing heavily and he reached his hand around her and they kissed on the lips and then made out. A kid walked past, unfazed. I had a dog and he was spotty and it was actually Mom who had gotten the dog. I think it was a poodle thing. I woke up at midnight but I thought it was noon. I was watching TV later and there was a movie from 1926 with Humphrey Bogart. Supernatural came on. Mom and Darren came home and started watching the episode. I was thinking they would know where the name 'Dean' came from, but I was thinking that Sam was my favourite character at the moment."
"3226"	"(2009-12-22 (18)) I was at the train station, which was different. Noelle was there and she looked the same and I was trying to get a photo of her for my Wiki. She moved and asked if I was taking a photo of her and I said no. Later, I was living/going out with her? I wondered why. I left my computer and when I came back she was on it, on the net. It was in my room. I had a photo on the floor of me and Jared Padalecki from Comic-Con, and also the one of me and Jewel Staite. I had a stupid smile on my face in the one with Jared and I was annoyed about it."
"3227"	"(2009-12-24 (18)) Mom got me into some concert. This guy said it was ""The Smiths"" and I was like ""Oh my God YAY!"". Savage Garden came on singing I Want You. They got stopped though because they weren't supposed to be on. Then The Smiths came on and it was a song called 'My Princess' which was a duet with Madonna and it went for like 10 minutes. I changed my status on Facebook to ""*Squee!* Morrissey!"" Savage Garden stood in the background and were annoyed and embarrassed. I went to a pet shop and I met this guy with a beard (it was black). There were lots of puppies and kittens. There were mice and they could get out and had leads on. There was a Timezone and it was closed but I went in and there were police outside. I waited for Mom to come get me."
"3228"	"(2009-12-25 (18)) There was a new episode of Supernatural out. It started weird. It started off with Sam and Dean but they were with a girl, who was Rachel McAdams, and were following her. It was funny. She was in a skimpy Santa outfit. These guys had made a resort full of prostitutes. She was talking and saying that she fully supported it. Then when she was out of sight of them (the guys who had made the resort) she told a heap of the girls to run. Some got caught. Then it kept reversing and kept happening over and over. The son of the leader guy liked her but he was evil too. The subtitles on the screen were funny and one was about tacos. Some nerdy girl was going to something that some guy called Terence D'Arby was doing and she was excited about it. At the end of the episode it showed a newspaper with Sam and Dean's faces in a crowd and they were on a list of names. I was like 'that's kinda gay"". There were some people with a Labrador puppy and it was acting weird. I realized that it was Sylar (Heroes). This girl in the family realized and he showed himself to her. He mentioned some cat was missing. The girl was now me. I said ""you killed my cat?!"" and he said ""I didn't say anything about killing"". There was a movie with Robert Downey Jr. and he had a weird ring on his right little finger."
"3229"	"(2009-12-26 (18)) I went to the newsagency with Mom. The guy behind the counter was kinda hot and was called Warren. He had given Mom something on World of Warcraft. She said she hadn't used it yet. There was a joke about me and someone who looked like me ""can't tell the difference"". I got the Dolly diary and it had green and blue stripes. There were two versions, one with the blue on top and green on bottom and vice versa. I went outside and Roland was there and was wearing a Spongebob shirt. There was a dog in the back of our car and he was called Roland. I thought it was weird that I hadn't noticed. Ezra said he thought he had gotten bitten by a spider. I flicked through the diary and there was a picture of Jensen Ackles in the back. Ezra was watching TV later and this show came on called 'Sullivan Bro's', which was like a spin-off from Heroes."
"3230"	"(2009-12-27 (18)) I was with Mom in the car. We passed Stormwind St and I told her that Stormwind was a city in World of Warcraft. We went to a pet shop and there were mice and puppies. There was a shih-tzu and a weird Labrador. It had long fur and looked silver on the tips and was silky. There were kittens too. Ezra and I were waiting outside. There was a plant. We heard someone talking and Mom too. They mentioned us and I tried to hide behind a huge red capsicum. They caught us and accused us of snooping and I denied it and said we came to look at the plant. I had a little puppy and he got put in the microwave with Amelia's milk. He got too hot and I quickly got him out. Granma joked about Amelia being cute and me being ugly."
"3231"	"(2009-12-28 (18)) Rover was playing with Amelia, gently. She was laughing etc. I wanted to take him away from her but they kept playing. Mom was there."
"3232"	"(2009-12-28 (18)) Ezra and I were playing World of Warcraft and were killing stuff. Then I was in bed with Jared Padalecki and we were having sex. I was on top and it was dark and it was fast. We stopped because we realized that Aunt Sally, Ezra and others were out there. Then we were all going for a walk. Darren had this big orange sock and a thick white one because he didn't like wearing short socks and shorts."
"3233"	"(2009-12-29 (18)) This girl got kidnapped by two guys and I think she sort of knew one of them. What had happened was he had asked her to lock up as he was going out for cigarettes. When she got to the door, she heard another voice. She tried to lock the door but it wasn't working. The other guy was Ted Bundy, although it didn't look like him. There was a recording of him killing her and him talking about stuff. The other guy was called Thomas, I think. Then I was at Nana's. I was reading about it on the net but icons weren't showing and Ezra thought something was wrong, but then it worked. Nana and some lady kept saying to me stuff like 'it's ok', thinking that I was scared by it. I got sick of it and went out and I said ""Ted Bundy's my favourite serial killer"" and said I've read everything about him etc. Nana had this look on her face but I didn't know what it meant."
"3234"	"(2009-12-30 (18)) I was watching Friday the 13th, but it was different and I was in it, or something. I was at some place near a forest and there was a party. I got away. I went to Cat Haven. This guy was there. The whole place was inside and there were only like 10 cages and they didn't put them down. I said I wanted to say a quick hello. Tigger and Gizmo were there. He asked for my name. The next day I got there early and no-one was there. Also, one of the rules was 'don't refuse anyone'. This lady came and took Tigger (like bought or adopted her). I told Mom and Ezra in the car later and I cried. Then it was just me and Mom. She saw some cops and went down this alley, but it was a walkway. We got to the top of it and this taxi drove past. They signaled the cops. We got out of the car and I took my shoes off and we went down some steps into this apartment like area and it was inside and underground. We walked through and out into a park thing. The cops and another cop car were on the street. This black guy climbed the fence and went into formation to say ""Police!"". He arrested Mom and gave me her car keys. I went to the top and my shoes were gone. I thought they must've been stolen but I couldn't remember if I had even brought them. I went to a shop and when I left I realized I didn't have my phone on me. I saw a girl kick it away and I went and got it and found my shoes. She had stolen them and we got into a fight. I gave her a deep paper cut and I had a strange pattern on my wrist. Later I went back to the Cat Haven and she came and we had another fight."
"3235"	"(2009-12-31 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was on a farm. There were three sets of mobs that I had to kill. I had to change each one to a different setting as I went around killing them. There were two flight masters right next to each other. Ezra was with me later. Then I was watching One Tree Hill and I paused the episode on Haley and Nathan. Ezra was like 'Yes I know she's in the movie' -- we were going to the cinema later. I said 'oh yeah, I forgot'. Jensen Ackles was also in the movie. There was an episode of Supernatural and Sam's fake name was 'RPlecki' and I thought it was funny. I also watched The OC and Summer was in a hospital bed and was like asleep. She was angry at Seth. He came and was watching her through the window. They then had sex in the bed and were messed up in the blanket and her father came in. But he had just imagined it all and was still standing out there wondering what to do."
"3236"	"(2010-01-01 (18)) We had those little puppies we looked at. They were ""under 34 days"" old, so we put them near a cat. They sucked on it but nothing came out and then we realized it was a cat. Mom, Ezra and I went somewhere that was like a Timezone and it had games outside (inside the shop, but outside the Timezone). It was night. There were heaps of people were at the games outside but inside it was really quiet. They were setting up a ride. It had a long seat. People got on, including a guy with a dog. It had no railing, and it went up and then he was like 'oh maybe I should've put the dog down', then it fell off his lap onto the mat, but it was ok. We went on and it weighed us, using a thing which put two bags on top of each other. My first one was full and a tiny bit of the second, Mom's first one wasn't full and Ezra's was less than mine. I covered up mine. We were at a shop later with Mom and Darren. He had this red and black umbrella/raincoat thing and it was spiffy."
"3237"	"(2010-01-02 (18)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I came across a Blood Elf Warlock and threw some snowflakes on him. A short time later I came across an Undead Rogue and threw snowflakes on him and got the achievement."
"3238"	"(2010-01-02 (18)) We were watching some show of Ashton Kutcher's. Mom and I went to a house with others. Their TV was stingy quality. Mom saw a set of books about insects in the bookshelf and was like 'I love these!' and chatted to the people. We went to leave and Darren was asking about the TV. Mom and I drove somewhere. It was night. We went to a petrol station to get those fruit biscuits with chocolate on them. As we left, this black guy came out into the street with a knife. We drove off and went around. We came back around and another guy was there (a white guy). I got out of the car and ran. I heard a noise and I saw the car drive off. I ran back and Mom was on the ground. We saw him trying to scam some guy and we warned him. There was a Labrador puppy and we told him to warn someone else. He was actually a bad guy but he helped us. This guy shot some people and there were a few left. I said we had to help each other now. I walked past this pyramid which I had to search for a quest on World of Warcraft. Ezra wanted to go to some artifact thing."
"3239"	"(2010-01-04 (18)) I was watching a local movie called Razor [Something] . Dad had recommended it to me. I had seen previews for it. It was actually American though. Katie Cassidy was in it. Some people were divided into three groups and were all given a needle thing that had different effects. One made the group jealous. A flying insect came. Then it was sort of like real life. Dad left. The other people either died or left too. When they came we had to do something. I was annoyed because Comic-Con was on. I ended up going anyway and I saw Jared Padalecki there. Then Jensen Ackles was somewhere else. There was a nervous guy with a guy called Justin Comics. I saw Ms Eckert in the car park. I was with Dad and Ezra. She came to talk. Daryl came past. There was a movie thing and these things were coming to life randomly and there was no control over them."
"3240"	"(2010-01-04 (18)) These girls were bullying this girl. I helped the girl and I think I tore something of theirs. I yelled at them. Then it was a show. This guy said his first thought was to burn the place. I had to get somewhere and I called Stephen Rea for help but he was drunk. Mom wouldn't take me. Darren was there too."
"3241"	"(2010-01-06 (18)) I was at dads and it was different. Rover was there. Dad made dinner for Ezra and himself, but left me some. I went to bed and told them to make sure the balcony was locked, so Rover didn't fall off. This girl created this product called Depeche Mode and sold it twice. I was on LastFm, looking at the top of 2009 and there were lots of Depeche Mode songs. I went to France and this nice girl and guy showed me around. First I was with Mom and Ezra in a car. We drove past a waterslide which went straight into the ocean. These kids threw some powder and it got in Ezra's hair. There was a river thing going through a cliff. There was a shop with lots of toys."
"3242"	"(2010-01-07 (18)) My notes are messy and hard to read. We saw the people we got Rover from. There was a park nearby and we took him there. I was on World of Warcraft later. Two people came to talk to me with their kids. Something was a peach colour. A boy in real life came to me and I explained something. I was then at school and it was graduation. I was at a table with Autumn and others. We got called inside. I saw Eugene and he looked hot and was older. Dad and I were supposed to be seeing a Morrissey concert. He called me to tell me the tickets were fake."
"3243"	"(2010-01-08 (18)) It was night and I was in the car. I was waiting. There was a guy washing a billboard thing nearby. He was naked and was actually kind of hot. We got closer and I took a photo, but you could see his balls. Then I was with others and we were far away at a place called Sunrise or something. We were at a petrol station and there was a list of places and I realized the train to downtown came here so we waited for it."
"3244"	"(2010-01-09 (18)) Our house was different and was attached to others. Sammy was renting the one next to us. One night he was going to a party and he came into my room to ask for something. He took some black thing when he left. I told Mom later. Darren had let Rover out and I was out there with him and he chased the cats over the fence. Sammy was going to the party with Vanessa (Gossip Girl). I was playing World of Warcraft. I was with a girl and we went into a level 17 instance and I died before I even entered it, which confused me. I was watching Gossip Girl. Chuck was friends with some guy. They kissed once and then started dating. Chuck was bothered by his homosexuality at first, but now he was fine with it. He and the guy were naked in bed (but were covered). His boyfriend said ""I love you"" and he kissed him. Later, Chuck was talking to Nate and said ""I love him"". I was talking to Ezra about it later but he hadn't seen it. I went to the university orientation. This guy was a TV show producer. I was talking to Ezra, saying I preferred movies and he said he preferred TV shows because of the way ""characters bloom"". Then, he, his friend (who was Nate) and I all said ""Chuck"" at the same time. Ezra thought it was funny. I had a letter from the university, confirming my acceptance and it had been sent on the 10 January."
"3245"	"(2010-01-10 (18)) There were two hotel like rooms. Dad and Ezra were in one with for beds in one room. I always felt uncomfortable in there and I saw a ""ghostly face"". I went to Mom's. She had two beds and I asked if I could stay. She was asleep, but said yeah."
"3246"	"(2010-01-10 (18)) I woke up and Sammy was in the lounge room. Mom made a comment about it being ""a week"" and was angry. I was playing World of Warcraft and I ran into a camp by mistake and they were level 57's. I tried to run out but couldn't find a way out. I saw a portal for Dalaran and to 'Galaran'. There was some cart thing. Selena and others were there. We had to pull ourselves up and slide along to a path. We let go and someone fell off too early."
"3247"	"(2010-01-11 (18)) I was at the hospital. Granny was still in there but they moved her somewhere else. Nana got a call saying they were changing Poppers's medication. Dad called and Granny had died. Nana and others we there and she cried. I had mail and there were lots of like little bits from fragile packages and notepads. Mom was there too. Then I was at a school place. This teacher guy was saying we would be ok if we ate pumpkin pie, do well at Monopoly and something else. Me and the guy next to me said at the same time, ""I hate pumpkin!"". Then I was actually reading a story in a magazine. This other guy pulled his hat off and said 'I'll show you how to eat pumpkin pie"". He put some on his fork and pretended to put it in his mouth, but put it into his shoe. He did that for a bit and then said ""Because it's punishable by death, you've got to put it on the guy next to you"". The story said the class cracked up for 715 minutes. I was at a house later looking at photos that I hadn't seen before. There were some of me and Aunt Sally."
"3248"	"(2010-01-11 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I were in some water. I tried to keep my phone above the water. We got a call that Granny was ok, so we gathered. We were still living at the old house. I was outside for a while and then I remembered I'd left some private stuff on the desk and I ran back inside. Ezra followed me and I tried to get rid of him, but he came in anyway. Austin was in my chair and he sounded like he was drunk. Everything in my room was a little messed up. He ended up showing it to Ezra and I had a whole box full of stuff. I tried to get Mom to make Austin leave. There was a fair thing. This kid and I went on a slide and we had to hold tight and it was fast. The police were chucking stuff into the middle of it. We got out of there. Then me, this young girl, Nate (Gossip Girl) and I lady all got into the back of the car. A guy was in the front and we drove off and saw a guy with two dogs and they were doing tricks. One of the dogs did a handstand. I was then at a bridge. Simba and Spaceman threw a mouse into the water. Rover ate something and vomited."
"3249"	"(2010-01-12 (18)) All cinemas got closed down. There had been a warning about it and it was up to Mozilla to do whatever with it. I was angry and upset about it. I ended up at a cinema. Seamus was there and he was eating sugar and ice. If my sodium level got over '40', I would pass out. Then it wasn't me and she passed out and they said to wheel her to the doctors. I went to the doctors and she was in a dark room and I said the doctor was a pedo. He was with someone else and we attacked him and left. I was with three people and their hair had turned green and got crusty stuff on their eyes. Someone said the Vanessa/Chuck (Gossip Girl) storyline was timed well because they had good chemistry. I said 'no they don't'. In real life, Ed Westwick and Jessica Szohr were getting married. There was a scene where Chuck was talking to a guy and Vanessa snuck up behind him and wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. Blair came and was angry and upset around it and ran off to a room. Chuck and Serena followed her. Chuck locked the door. Then I was Blair. I tried to open the door and I said we were trapped. I took my shirt off for some reason that I can't remember. I was hiding myself. There were clothes in the room but they were all female clothes and small. They tried to find something. As time went on, I got less annoyed at Chuck and started laughing and joining in with their conversation."
"3250"	"(2010-01-14 (18)) I went to the shop and I was only wearing a bra and shorts. I was looking at the men's clothes but there wasn't much there. I asked Mom to get something to call with. Ezra was there too. We got to the checkout and I went to the female section. A girl suggested this boy hair style packet and it took 37 minutes but I couldn't find it. Someone she knew kept singing this 'old' song. I saw Dad at one point and he lifted me up."
"3251"	"(2010-01-15 (18)) Ezra and Roland were hanging in my room. I went on Ezra's computer and played World of Warcraft. It was dark and I was near some water with a house next to it. I completed a quest and got chased by a guy and animal into the water. I went back to my room and they were asleep on the floor. I told them to get out. They didn't want to move. I told Mom. They also were saving money for something but couldn't get it, so Ezra was going give Dad $176 for a buoy."
"3252"	"(2010-01-16 (18)) I was at 'home'. Rover was chewing on stuff. We were now outside and I was with Mom, Ezra and Darren. Darren was annoyed at Rover. I got quests on World of Warcraft and I had to go to Outland. I was only level 51 though. One quest was like level 41 and could be done in Eastern Kingdoms, in Stranglethorn."
"3253"	"(2010-01-16 (18)) We had a new house. The bedroom was too small, so Ezra and I split the living room. My side had a door going outside and it was like in a block of units. There was a long pool. I went to sleep in the back of my car, which was undercover. Mom showed me something out the window. I had a box of private stuff and it had been moved. Ezra had chucked a hissy fit and moved me out of my room. Darren said they would put a wall up for me soon. Calvin came over but I didn't know why. I also had a letter from the university but it was weird and was like a math exam."
"3254"	"(2010-01-17 (18)) Mom showed me this loop/edited video of a tornado. It showed a house with a girl outside and it got blown away to another house and she was still there. Happy Hunting Ground came on and I was like 'I love this song!' and started singing ""it's fair, fair game inside"" and the last line. Mom was like ""I'm glad a song you like came on"". I was on IMDb later. Someone was asking who sang Killer Klowns From Outer Space and someone replied that it was The Dickies and the original poster said it wasn't. I replied that it was, although the post was from 2007. I was then with some guy and it was dark. The clowns from Killer Klowns From Outer Space were around. This guy got bitten and his girlfriend tried to go to him and he turned into one of them. She tried to help him but he bit her. We ran. It was hard to see and I had to keep waiting for my eyes to adjust. I ran from one and at one point, it stopped and ran back (like in World of Warcraft, when you get too far from their starting point). I mentioned it to the guy. We got to a soccer oval and hid behind the goal posts (there were four). Then a clown saw me and it started coming towards me. I threw bits of a tissue at it and other stuff to distract it (it had worked with some of them)."
"3255"	"(2010-01-17 (18)) I went to dads. He had a girlfriend. The house was on a street with fancy houses. I went to one and this lady gave me expensive clothes to wear to some place. She ended up getting annoyed at me so I left them there. Mom had a pool. We had blow-up toys -- a crocodile and an alligator/hippo. Farrah got on the crocodile and tried to jump in, but you had to go in at 40km/h. People were coming and we had to wait too long. Mom said ""60!"" and we jumped and held our breath. Furio (The Soprano's) was in some film/TV show, but it was actually someone else. I couldn't remember his name."
"3256"	"(2010-01-18 (18)) One of us was like a spy. As a test we had to set a house on fire to see how quickly you had to leave. I got my computer and left, but then went back for my diary etc."
"3257"	"(2010-01-18 (18)) I went to a party. The house was like across the road from our house (which was connected to it by a hall). I don't think I knew anyone there, but I had a drink. There were ""77"" of us, according to someone. We all tried to lie in a circle and I fell asleep. At 3am, I woke up and went home. Mom greeted me. I went to see Ezra and he was on the computer playing a game, which changed every 10 seconds. He said it was Final Fantasy."
"3258"	"(2010-01-19 (18)) I went to this jail thing. I think I was in another country. People were sent to death and had their heads dipped in lava/hot stuff to kill them. Their heads melted off except for some bits and I thought it was a weird way to kill them. I think I saved someone and then they came looking for me so I ran. This young kid was helping me. We ran through people's yards, etc. One had long thin grass. He ran back and said they were coming and we hid in the grass. The guy after us was Christoph Waltz and the kid pushed him into a pond. He heard the kid giggling so was looking for us. We got over some more fences but I think he had seen us. I managed to get something which looked like a sheep. This girl was there and I was sort of friends with her. She gave someone $8200 to get a ticket for me. I got on a train and saw Christoph and ran from him. He was looking for me. The train was moving but I jumped off and he didn't see. Someone told him I was in a field in London, but he knew it wasn't true. Mom was telling me that people who had been brought back to life couldn't use certain areas or ""smoke in private"". There was a new window at the old house and it made everything outside look pixelated. It was raining."
"3259"	"(2010-01-19 (18)) I was running away from people. I had to get some trapped soldiers out of a building. I took out the guards. They were German by the way. I went in and some others thought I was dodgy and I spoke German to them, to ease their suspicions, and then I shot them. I got chased by some others and I jumped some fences. I was then playing World of Warcraft or something and there were level 51 creatures. I found a teleport thing just as a 'bad' woman got there."
"3260"	"(2010-01-21 (18)) I was watching Gossip Girl. Blair and Serena went missing. Serena had gone missing first and her parents asked me if I knew where she went and I said I didn't know. When Blair went missing, her parents asked me as well. They asked Blair and she said she didn't know, but then she left and went missing. Dorota helped me look. Someone asked me something at one point and I pointed to the parents. Then I was at school somewhere and this guy was doing a talk. He marked my name and then I had to go to the next class. He told me to wait. I was annoyed because I wanted to get a good seat. Eugene went in and I sat on a seat up the back. He had shaved his hair. He had hairy feet and I took a photo. The talk was about some disease from some hot thing on walls."
"3261"	"(2010-01-22 (18)) Granny was still at the hospital which was different. Someone asked me where Virginia was and I said ""I don't even know where we are now! Woodside?"". I was right. I left with Mom and we got stuck on the road and then left there. I saw smoke behind us and there was a thing in the sky hanging off a crane or something. T here was a fire and this guy was in the crane thing with a hose. He fell off into a bush. Later I was at the hospital again and these gangster drug dealing brothers came and they were like Hispanic. They all ended up shooting each other, except for one, who left in a car with the money. I asked this lady for a lift and she looked scared and said no. I was with Ezra and Roland by the way. Then Mom came and we all got in."
"3262"	"(2010-01-23 (18)) I was at McDonald's with Mom and Ezra. They said they liked theirs ""out of a cup"" or something. They mentioned something about a large cup. There was a huge metal letter 'A'. This guy used to go to Brookland."
"3263"	"(2010-01-23 (18)) I was at Nana's. Rover was there. We stayed the night and they had a cat door. I was worried Rover would fall into some little pools. I went to one. Simba and Cuddles went in and there was a metal face on top of it? I was tired and I watched an episode of Big Brother. One woman stood in the bathroom for 15 minutes. They hadn't plugged the heater in and they found a cave. They saw a girl ghost and she was buried there and the place was covered in oil, so if we lit a match, it would explode. Mom was watching the same episode. Ezra came out of his room. In the next 1-2 episodes, someone was going to wear a wedding dress?"
"3264"	"(2010-01-24 (18)) Dad, Ezra and I went to a cinema. There was a huge queue for the candy bar because all the workers (teenage girls) were on break. Dad and I were discussing movies. He said that all the Batman movies were good and I said no, Batman Begins was good, The Lame Knight sucked and the third one (which we'd just seen) was ok. I was then at home and I went to the toilet. There was a lot of poo in it and it was from Ezra. I went close to it for some reason and almost threw up."
"3265"	"(2010-01-25 (19)) I was out the front. Sammy showed up and he was out of it. It was night. Mom and I were supposed to be taking rubbish to the dump but because it was late (1.55am), we couldn't."
"3266"	"(2010-01-26 (19)) I went to McDonald's with Mom (drive thru). I mentioned that everyone from Brookland was [something that stars with an 'e'] and Mom was like 'ooh big word'. Selena served us. Then Mom was in there and she organized food and stuff. She was saying ""you look pretty in a dress"" and I was like ""you're an idiot"". Calvin was saying I was a tomboy and mentioned this time in accounting where we either had to dress up or play some game where you draw pictures and Jemma yelled out ""Everyone choose that!"". Eventually we left there and we pulled up in a waiting bay. I was driving. There was a car behind me and they were being annoying. There was also something about Spaceman and a kitten."
"3267"	"(2010-01-28 (19)) I got two little green worms as pets. We kept calling them slugs though. They were really tiny. I had had one for a bit longer. The new one was called Alexander. I went to Mom to ask her what I should feed it, but it complained so I asked her to do it. I went back and almost fell on the floor and there were more slugs. They were trying to eat Rover. Mom and Ezra left to go somewhere and I was like 'what about the slugs?' but they were like 'meh'. Then we were parked on the side of the road with the door open. These guys drove past and Ezra said some 4chan thing and they threw a dark green slushy out the window and went on the car. This teacher told me to clean it with this other person. I had to a project for 'school' and I had to collect materials but I couldn't go. Finn and Rachel (both from Glee) asked to do it and Rachel offered to get the materials but she was organizing to clean the car. She had only joined to spend time with Finn. He had a girlfriend who wasn't happy about it. I was on a train at some point and I was singing Should've Known Better."
"3268"	"(2010-01-29 (19)) I was at a place like a prisoner of war camp thing. I was in a room with beds. My 'bed' was a group of people. Elijah was one of them. The people in the block next to us always yelled at them complaining about sheets. I realized one of ours had never been washed. Later the leader died. Elijah, someone else and I were talking and Elijah came to the conclusion that the replacement was going to be evil. They were standing in line and were all young females. One was really tall and Elijah was staring at her. One had a big mole. We were messing around and she tried to kick something and then realized it was hers. Elijah was annoyed because the tall girl was taller than him. Gizmo was in a cage with a lizard. I let her out. Mom let the lizard out and it bit me and I squealed. I ran and screamed and it chased me. This teacher lady gave a quiz to Fatima. I wanted to do it and she said it was mainly for guys. At the top it said to text this number to get your name. I was on IMDb and there was a 'Top 10 quotes' thing. I said ""I watch 8/10 of these shows"", although there were repeats. One from Grey's Anatomy was there and a Supernatural quote was number 3. The Supernatural quote had something to do with liking a sandwich and it was a Dean quote. Later I was at a table/desk and Milo Ventimiglia was next to me and I think we knew each other. There was a movie about a war with Susan Sarandon? She left to go to James Spader, then it was from his point of view but it was 'me'. He (as me) walked into a house and she was on a lounge reading. I went up to her and hugged her. There were people there watching."
"3269"	"(2010-01-30 (19)) I was at Nana's. Granny was still alive but she was in water? Nana took me home and some young guy was in the passenger seat. This older guy was driving and I was in my usual seat, behind the driver. Gold by Spandau Ballet came on and I was tapping to it. I got home and it was different. Some guy with a bag of ice shards was at the door and I walked past him."
"3270"	"(2010-01-31 (19)) I was at a petrol station with Mom. It was night. I drove there and Mom went in. I decided to drive off and I drove to the exit, then I turned around. Mom came back, looking angry. She said she would drive and we drove off and she said that everyone saw, including the police but she didn't tell me that. Later they stopped us and gave us a fine. I said that I accidentally put my foot on the accelerator."
"3271"	"(2010-01-31 (19)) I was at school. I ended up with some older guys and I was helping them with something. Calvin didn't like them. We were in a computer room and I was next to Calvin and this guy I liked was on the other side. He looked like Cory Monteith. We had an in-joke we kept giggling about. There was a 'Top 6 upgrades' and number one was Charizard and then ""Ninetails, Vulpix, something I don't remember, Pokemon, Runescape"". Later some friend and I went to this caravan to visit another friend, who was Doug from Dawson's Creek. The caravan looked like it had been broken into and he was acting weird. I saw him wipe blood off his hands and I walked down the hall and saw the bath/shower curtain had been pulled to. I opened it and there was a dead guy in the bath. This girl saw it too. I asked my guy friend in and we thought we saw the dead guy breathing. It turned out that Doug actually didn't like this guy and he had come over, but didn't actually break in. I was later driving with Mom and I said something, but I can't read what I wrote -- ""that's my [something something] ""."
"3272"	"(2010-02-01 (19)) I was at the university orientation. There were only a few people none with the purple or green lanyard. I put mine on. I went into a room with lots of desks and sat at one. The girl next to me was a first year vet student and asked me a question. I can't remember properly, but we ended up having to run from something."
"3273"	"(2010-02-01 (19)) I was walking back home (which was different) and I was in a public hall. I had a measuring tape on me. This oldish (30-40 year old) guy stopped me and asked to buy it from me. I said no and he offered a higher price and I said ""I don't care if it's $17 million, it's not for sale"". He got angry and tried to get it off me. I called out to Mom and she yelled back telling me to be quiet and that she was busy. I yelled out again and she was like 'I'm not listening to your stories'. I ran in and closed the door and locked it with a chain. Mom came and still didn't believe me (until a while later). We were then younger and Ezra was like 5. I stabbed the guy in the finger with a butter knife and then stabbed another finger. He left and went out the back of our house. We were all in the kitchen and we hid behind the counters. Mom said she had to see Slater and I said 'you can't leave me alone'. Our back door, which was fly wire, didn't lock so we locked the back wood door. We went out the front door and I first looked in the kitchen drawer for a knife but there was nothing sharp in there or nearby and I grabbed some fluffy thing. I said 'I don't think this will work' and then I heard the guy say 'it doesn't matter' and he was in the house. He came out to us and I threw cardboard pieces at him and tried to stab him. I don't know what happened then."
"3274"	"(2010-02-01 (19)) I was driving out of Midvale shop car park by myself. It was different. I realized I still had my L plates and I freaked."
"3275"	"(2010-02-02 (19)) I was watching Burn Notice and it was a weird episode. I said that I hated Fiona. Mom and Ezra were watching and Mom said that she probably wouldn't mind the show. I can't remember it properly, but Eugene and Sam were on a job. Then they were in an office building. Adelle DeWitt (Dollhouse) was there. This group of guys blew up this bit outside and then went inside. Jack Bauer (24) was also around and quietly went in through the sliding front door. He hid a gun in a plant pot and joined the rest of the people. Then it was Eugene again. He was speaking in code to this person. I was inside too and I was trying to get this metal 'lid' off this thing on the floor. I didn't have enough time. Then it was House. I went upstairs to find Taub. I asked ""where's everyone gone?"" and he said ""I replaced all of them"". It was Christmas. He asked if I was still on. Some guy had only joined because he liked Cuddy. She found out and was like 'why didn't you just tell me' and they had also had a one night stand years ago. Taub was actually called Ezra."
"3276"	"(2010-02-03 (19)) I was at Dad's new house. The doors had mesh and were very weak and weren't attached properly. I went in with Rover and found his penguin toy. Three worker guys were at the front door. I went 'blblbl' loudly and scared them. We laughed. Then I was at this place which had quests. I got one where I had to make some pot. I asked Mom what to do and Darren did it for me -- it was created on a nail file thing. It burned quick. I was almost at the place to hand it in, but I failed as I was on a time limit. The next quest I got I had to get a stylish outfit and got to some restaurant. I got a white men's shirt. Mr Stevenson was outside. My shirt had buttons on the side and he said that for the buttons on the front, I was allowed to have the bottom button undone. I saw Samantha around. There was a 'baby' Bart Simpson (The Simpsons) and everyone was like ""Oh my God, he's so cute!""."
"3277"	"(2010-02-04 (19)) I was at university. I had found something on the net about the results of something to get in to it and I was 10/58. I was in a computer room and Alejandro was next to me. Jakob came in and asked me something and left. Someone else I knew came in and asked me about the stuff at the computer and I said it was Jakob's. They were with people. I mocked someone and I went to do something and hit a gun. It hurt and I started to bleed. My mouth got really bloody. I tried to take a photo of it but it was too hard. Mom said she had made spaghetti and it was ready but then she said she had to ""burn a special biscuit"" to make it taste the same. I was like 'why do you tease me?'. Darren got a 12 month job with the government which had something to do with traffic signals on a busy road."
"3278"	"(2010-02-04 (19)) I found a new TV show to watch. I can't remember what it was about but it was a teenage type of thing. This girl needed a transplant and her boyfriend agreed to do it. She wasn't sure about it though. His sister came and she tried to make it sound like she was cheating with her, then she admitted the truth. There was an interview with her and she was saying that because she was short, she had to be better looking and they had to shorten everyone's name by 3/4. Someone said ""perfect 24.3"" but I can't remember what it was about. Two months later, he went to a friend on an oval. He collapsed and the girl came. There were drugs. People climbed over the fence."
"3279"	"(2010-02-04 (19)) I was at a school. A guy who looked like Cory Monteith was flirty and nice to me. The day after I met him, I found this thing on a locker that said that guys got points for how far they got with girls. He also got a wheelchair and was using that (for sympathy?). I went through the locker. After school there was like a party. Cory was in the wheelchair and I wheeled him down a hall. I stood on the back wheels which was fun. The doors were all locked. We went back and he got up and walked in. He gave something to some girls. Two girls kissed."
"3280"	"(2010-02-05 (19)) I was on a playground thing on an oval. I was with Elijah and Ezra. There was some stuff up high and we were trying to get over it. Ezra carried me over some bit. I got stuck and held onto a wall crack. We were also on a time limit. Elijah was working his way over to help. A brick started falling near me and I was like 'Oh my God I'm going to die!'. Where I was, was about the height of a house. I left where I was and held onto another bit. Elijah was saying that I was light -- when Ezra had carried me earlier, so had Elijah at one point. He said ""I don't know why it's so hard to get over you"", which had something to do with the carrying. I said ""... coz I'm awesome?"". I got down and was singing I Don't Want to Get Over You in my head. I went under this thing to find something. I went under to this other bit, and I can't read the next bit but it had something to do with Elijah and I thought it was funny and I laughed. I saw Mom and I ran to her and it was raining."
"3281"	"(2010-02-05 (19)) I was at a beach with Mom and Rover. There were huge waves. This lady was doing some thing where no dogs were allowed. I had my period so didn't do it today. Then I was running from Mom and Darren and I kept jumping a fence and hiding then when they found me I would run again. Then I was at a school. We were cleaning up stuff. Something I did had something to do with Farrah and I and others at an amusement park. This lady said I did something wrong and I admitted it was me. I helped some people do a project. Five at a time had to cook? This guy tried to leave and he got punched in the balls. Tiana and Ramona were in the year below me and they were young."
"3282"	"(2010-02-06 (19)) I was at a shop with Mom and she was going to try on some jeans and I walked off. Calvin was there with a girl and we chatted for a bit."
"3283"	"(2010-02-06 (19)) I was out with Ed O'Neill. I was going out with his son. He took us to a movie, but first took me to the place to buy food and stuff. We got alcohol, snacks etc. This lady asked ""who's this?"" and he said ""my date"". She asked me ""how old are you? 27?"" and I said ""19"" and she said ""and he's 50?!"". I laughed and said ""I'm with his son"". We didn't make the movie on time."
"3284"	"(2010-02-06 (19)) I was at a clothes shop trying clothes on. I thought someone was next to me but realized they weren't making any sound. I realized it was a mannequin. I heard someone looking in all the cubicles and it was creepy. I was trying to try on a shirt but someone reached over and I left. I was then in a carpark trying to park but there was always stuff in the way. There were some kids, but I can't read what it says. Their mother came and she yelled at me. I tried to explain but she ignored me. Ezra was there. I went over to her again and she was like 'you don't want kids having fun' and I said 'yes I do. I mean, I'm still a kid. I have a year to go before I'm out of my teens' and she was like 'oh I love those times, do you like dancing?' and I said ""Nooo."". Our next door neighbour looked like Marisa Tomei."
"3285"	"(2010-02-07 (19)) I was with two guys and they could turn into dogs. This guy was following us. I held onto them as they ran (as dogs). We were on a dark oval. We hid behind a tree. He caught us. Then we were in a house. The two guys had been hung up by their hands and the people were getting ready to tie me up. I can't remember what happened but later I asked for a drink. They gave me some cold water but it was gross and I spat it out saying it tastes like pee and he said it was pee. There was a pool behind the house, but it was down a hill. There were lots of people. We managed to escape but he found us. Ezra wanted to watch The Little Mermaid."
"3286"	"(2010-02-07 (19)) Grady was a good drawer and was drawing pictures of people, which he drew really fast too. I wanted one but then someone got chosen and he said that was the last one he was going to do."
"3287"	"(2010-02-07 (19)) I was on the computer. Someone came in and they were a transvestite. She asked me about my computer. Later she was trying to work out who was the 'best'. I said I was level 56 on World of Warcraft and Ezra was level 21. So I won."
"3288"	"(2010-02-08 (19)) I was at university. There was an online activity and most options were full and it had a bar to show how full they were. There was one on Tuesday from 8.30-5.30. Then I was there. We all sat in the first row of the class. Charlene was there. There was a picture of a bulldog puppy. There was a female teacher. The next class had more people. I got Mom to get me after and I was in the car but then realized I had one more class and then another class which was somewhere else."
"3289"	"(2010-02-10 (19)) I was at home which was different. Mom was saying she got stuff from Dad's old place. She and Darren had been staying there. I asked why they didn't tell me and they were like 'meh'. They said 'wouldn't you like to have the house by yourself' and I said no. Ezra also said no. We argued. Dad was nearby and ignored it. I said ""I've wanted that house since I was like 3!"". I was then at a shop and it was quiet. There were no aircons on or the freezers for the frozen stuff. I grabbed some snacks."
"3290"	"(2010-02-12 (19)) Cory Monteith and I got married. We were at the old house but it was new. People were sleeping. It was night. We took this lounge bed out the front and we had sex. We lay on it outside. Then it was cold and I asked if we could bring it inside and we took it into the games room. As we passed the kitchen I saw that the oven light was on. I went to my room and checked my phone. I had over 30 messages and they were all from Mom and Dad. I had forgotten to take them to the wedding? I went back out to go to bed."
"3291"	"(2010-02-12 (19)) I was at a friend's house, or a friend of Mom's. Mom was there too. He was hot. He had been writing a book, but had gotten in trouble lately and I heard someone say that he had gotten raped. There was a kitten with weird curly fur. There was a mouse and someone put a toy on it."
"3292"	"(2010-02-12 (19)) I was at university getting my photo ID. I got my proof of age card out to show them. The girl in front of me got turned away. I saw Eugene approaching and he was with someone else."
"3293"	"(2010-02-13 (19)) I was at school. I sat at a bench and I was near Darius, Eugene and others. Eugene was closed to me and moved closer to make room for someone. Calvin was nearby watching. The others left and Calvin and I were talking. Eugene was standing around and I saw in the corner of my eye, that he laughed a few times at our conversation. We were talking about something and I said ""and I was jizzing in my pants"". Then I was playing World of Warcraft. A heap of others and I were on a ledge outside with a girl. When we were walking to a lower ledge, I said ""abortion for the win"". We sent the girl across some water. We all went across. There were PVP Horde around. It was a big deal when we got back."
"3294"	"(2010-02-13 (19)) I was picking up something from Calvin on the side of the road. I was driving with Mom. We were waiting for this bus and we went to stop but then the bus came so we had to go. There were people on the road including Bradley. I said that people from school were always in the way. Later there was something that looked like it had a plane going through the wall and I joked with Ezra about it."
"3295"	"(2010-02-14 (19)) I blew my nose and this big clear slug came out and I showed Mom."
"3296"	"(2010-02-14 (19)) It was the first day of university. I realized I had forgotten to go. It was like 2pm or something. I got Mom to take me, but I forgot my lab coat. I had time to spare so I went to the bookshop, which was different. I asked if I could borrow a lab coat and it cost $5. They only had large and 4XL, so I took the large. Elijah was there doing a similar course. We had the math tutorial at the same time but in a different room. His lab was on Wednesday. This girl asked for help with math and she had an equal sign with three lines. She had asked some 'smart' people for help but so far had had no luck. This lady had to interview me and she said I was a survivor since I was a ""little bit fat"". I was like ""uh... what?"". I said that it had never bothered me. I mentioned that I had lost 12kg in the last year. I passed the interview. I had to wear the coat for the lab even though we were just watching some football. Eugene was there with Bradley. I was filming and Bradley and the others were being silly. There was a movie thing and this bad guy died, but then crawled out of a lake as a different person. We threw some slug things?"
"3297"	"(2010-02-15 (19)) I was driving out of a carpark at the shop. I needed to turn right but something was going on. I had to go on an escalator to get out. There were people behind me running around. I finally got out. It was stressful and there were lots of people around. I was then driving down Princess Rd and there was a lot of glass. I pulled into a shop. I was walking with just socks on. Mom was with me and then Darren came too. I left and had to go the other way but I didn't know how to so I just kept going the wrong way and I was asking what to do but they wouldn't tell me. Then I found out where to go. There was a weird way to get home. We had to go through this shop and then climb out of a fireplace (like, we came in from behind it). There was a lounge in the way. It was a new house and it was lame. I went to 'college', then I came back. Then I was there with Dad, his girlfriend and Farrah and Ezra. I said that the baby better not be in my room. Then there was a movie and there was a mushroom cloud. I explained it to Granny, who was also watching it. It showed the survivors and there were a lot of people outside."
"3298"	"(2010-02-17 (19)) I was driving with Mom. There was a cop on the road and he pulled this yellow gun out. We stopped and he wanted the car. I said I didn't have shoes on and he settled for us driving him somewhere. We went to a shop for clothes. Also, Roland liked Samantha and she 'tried to be bad'. She had been pretending to date this guy and he found out and was upset."
"3299"	"(2010-02-17 (19)) Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were brothers in real life and Jeffrey Dean Morgan was their father. There was a video of them and some funny stuff they did as kids. They said that one video had the 'best timing', when Jensen played a joke on Jared and he sulked and looked around. I watched it with Mom and Ezra."
"3300"	"(2010-02-18 (19)) I was at a shop and someone was filming. I was in the background of the video. It sped up and so we had to do something. I was then sitting with someone in a car. This angry guy got in and took off. It was like an expensive, fast car and he had put his foot right down. I was like ""I hope you're a good driver!"" and then he crashed into a lake. It wasn't actually a lake, and it had like paths surrounding it. The car was yellow by the way. I held my arm up out of the water holding my phone. I took a photo with it. I swam to the other side with one arm. Poppa was there and helped me up. I had text Dad saying ""it had [something] . Do you know guys with ebay?"" and something else that I can't read. The guy got out and was shaken up. Mom and Ezra came. Ezra said something about the picture, I think but I can't read what I've written. There was a mention of a drive in the past week when Mom and I had crashed into the same river/thing. Later, I went for a drive with Mom to this place in a really dodgy neighbourhood with gangs and stuff. I saw some gangster girls and I said I wanted to leave so we did. Then I was doing a quest and I had to break into some girl's house. I got in and pressed a button on a remote and then I had to find photos. I was searching through the wallet. Someone was coming and we left. Then I was some guy and the son of a famous guy was in a field. I can't read the other bit it says. I had to change. There was something about The Matrix?"
"3301"	"(2010-02-19 (19)) I got an email from the university about driving. I told Mom that Ezra needed to change his phone number and he was angry about it. I was then at university and Ms Burton was there. I had math and we had to round to 30.10, but someone said it was 30.11 but then that was wrong because we were dealing with money. Anyway, I can't remember properly but I found out that Dean had been bitten by a werewolf. We were at a beach and some others got back to the house (which was at the beach). It was very busy and there were long queues. I asked Mom if she knew about Rover and she said ""that Rover's a werewolf? Yeah."". He was outside and she put food out for him. Then it was night but I was with him outside. I was trying to get around the back. It wasn't a full moon though. I got there and then he started to change. I ran in and he tried to come in. I started to cry and was upset. Then some celebrity woman and her husband were doing something. She was in a dressing gown and her boobs started to hang out. Lots of similar mishaps happened with the cast of Glee -- they touched her boob. Hayden Christensen said he was gay but it was unknown whether it was a joke or not. Marisa Tomei said she was against gays and Santa Claus."
"3302"	"(2010-02-20 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I went to this place to get food. We were eating in the car. It was nice but obviously fattening. Later, I found out it was snake penis, balls and something else. Ezra said something like ""It would be cool to see David Lynch to [something I can't read] "". I opened the car door and vomited. He recorded it. Later he gave some of the food to Mom and she liked it. Then I was watching a behind the scenes of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Kaitlin Olson was making up some dance. Rob McElhenney was singing a song badly. Later, Ezra and Kim did this thing where they would randomly run. I followed them and they went through houses and yards. They jumped over fences, went through cat doors and jumped on stuff. I fell behind and lost them. I walked along a path and didn't know how to get back. This Italian guy tried to help me. Rover was around at some point. It got to 5.30pm and my driving instructor hadn't come."
"3303"	"(2010-02-20 (19)) I can't remember it properly, but there was a zombie infection thing. You could get rid of the infection. Some people I knew got infected and I killed the 'main zombie'. Someone said ""Charlie"". The infected person was wearing yellow and had holes in them and they were blind. But then it was just a suit and they took it off and they were normal. We went into this room. This guy had had a heart transplant and the heart was from a pig? He turned into a zombie later and I stabbed him in the chest hard. I was then in bed, sharing with Ezra. He poked me from behind and I turned around and he was a zombie and I stabbed through the blanket. I chopped this zombie guy's head off and his mouth and throat were full of rice. Mom came and saw it and left. She came back and said ""Why did you do this?"" and everyone was back to normal and I was confused. We left and I was in my car and I had my P's. As I drove further away (I was coming from Mom's old house), there was lots of smoke and light posts down, house alarms going off, people crying etc."
"3304"	"(2010-02-20 (19)) I had a driving lesson. Then there was this thing going on and everyone else was young. We went in groups of three. We had to pick a sport and you had to get all to leave? I can't read the next bit I wrote."
"3305"	"(2010-02-21 (19)) I was at university in a lab. It was a big class and we were separated into two groups. I ended up with eight people. We followed someone and two others and I were at the back. Then we were on a train and we had to run and jump to get on. We got to where we were going but then I realized I had forgotten my bag, but I hadn't. Then we had to do a dissection of a monkey, but it was still alive, which made me upset. Dad was watching and I cried and sobbed and he was like 'what the hell are you crying for?' and I said 'it's whimpering'. I forgot to draw it in my lab book, but I got a photo of something else. There was an online quiz and if you 'passed' you got to be lead photographer. Dad came to help me with it."
"3306"	"(2010-02-21 (19)) I was watching Kenny vs Spenny. Kenny put stuff in his hair and Spenny did something to him and he died. They resurrected him though the next morning. Then it showed what had happened in between. Spenny's 'sister' came in and had lied down with Kenny and gave him a handjob. I was like 'what the hell?!' and confused. Then Spenny dressed up as a hippy like woman, but Kenny had introduced himself to a policeman, who had called out to Spenny and Kenny realized it was him. Then I was at home, but it was different and apartment like. Luisa came over and was wearing a black dress. She wanted to take me out and I refused. I called Mom to tell her to come home."
"3307"	"(2010-02-22 (19)) I was driving with Mom. We were going to the beach but we missed the turn off at first. We turned around and not in the car and Mom rolled a skateboard on the ground and this car ran over it but didn't hit it. Then we were back in the car and they reversed into us. Mom drove forward and pushed them into the car in front of them. We ran off and left her car behind. Later we went back. There were some Asian girls there. These two guys that had been in the car were now blind. We got on a train and it was weird and the seats all faced the middle. I used my SmartRider but it picked up on Mom's address. Darren was there too. The Asian girls gave me some money. Mark (Ugly Betty) was excited that the guy's were blind. I called Mom to tell her and she screamed with excitement and I was like 'ok...'. I went to leave and Mark said ""Do you know you want to be with her?"", which meant 'do you like your current crush'. I laughed and said ""Why did you say her?"". He just stared at me and I figured it had something to do with him being gay. Then this kid had this electronic book with information about people from school. You could find your compatibility. I got 30% with someone. I got 100% with Eugene and Dmitri. Tears Run Rings played on the train."
"3308"	"(2010-02-23 (19)) I was at the old house, trying to find something to wear, but none of my new clothes were clean. Mom and Darren complained about everything I chose to wear. It got late (it was 10.18, but I had to leave by 10.30 to get to university on time) and I still hadn't eaten breakfast or straightened my hair. I went to my new math tutorial. It was in a small computer room, but there were lots of people, including Autumn and Elijah. The teacher said that the class was bigger than last time and that there were five extra people. I said I changed because I can't do the early one. They said it was too bad and that this one was full, but asked if anyone wanted to change. Heaps of people did because they wanted to change to some boating thing. Ezra got accepted to the Technical College but was going to drop out. It was some sort of cooking course with this old rich Asian guy."
"3309"	"(2010-02-23 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft, but it was for X-BOX 360. I said to some guy, ""I've been addicted to games since I was 5"" and he was annoying me. Ezra and others were in another room. I lied on the couch and he came to watch. I went to Dalaran and I had to jump into this hole. Dalaran was tiny and had like three quests."
"3310"	"(2010-02-24 (19)) Mom bought Ezra and I a present. His said ""To Tom, from Izzy"", with ""Comment: Sam"". I was confused about it but it turned out she had bought him a Supernatural bedspread and for both of us, three pillows. I took the one with Sam, because I figured Ezra would want Rover. The third pillow had Sam pointing."
"3311"	"(2010-02-24 (19)) I, but it wasn't me, was young (like 5 or so) and knew I was going to die. Dad and I went to a restaurant and had tuna. Then I was poisoned. I tried to tell Mom and she was like 'meh' and rolled over to go back to sleep. Someone told someone else to stand on a log in water and said it would roll around on the spot. I said it wouldn't and that it would go down the waterfall. They eventually believed me. I found blood on my sheets, but the blood was from the future. We thought it was from a cut I had gotten from a bush. A friend tried to make me go into this dark place with a sword, but then I saw my real friend. They looked the same. I pretended that I hadn't seen anything, but then I turned the sword on the fake one."
"3312"	"(2010-02-26 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft but it was different. I went to Northrend through a mirror. There were lots of level 70+ mobs with over 10k health. I was trying to avoid them but they kept chasing me anyway."
"3313"	"(2010-02-26 (19)) I was at university and it was different. I went to some class and then left. I was with Evelyn in an elevator. She was really short. My feet were cold and I realized I had no shoes on and I went back to class to find them. I asked the lady there and she said she had seen them and got them for me. She got rashes from my socks. I went to class and it was full of people. I put my shoes on. I had another class but it was later. I was on MSN with Ezra and he told me to accept the webcam invitation. He and Emery danced around. Ezra had dyed his hair black and Emery was wearing a tutu."
"3314"	"(2010-02-27 (19)) I think I was someone else. I was with a friend outside and I realized there were zombies. I took a car and drove off. My friend realized and she caught up with me. I had a boyfriend in another city. I drove to the beach and there was a guy with a boat. I went on and got across.  Then I was driving on the road in the other city. An ambulance kept trying to knock us off the road and after passing us, turned back around to get us. The streets were full of cars and it was night. I pushed past some cars and drove to this building and ran inside and we split up. It was a place for poor people and there were lots of people inside. The next day, police came looking for us. My friend was now Ben (Lost). There was a close up of his face and he looked creepy and fat. The zombies were smart and ended up taking over."
"3315"	"(2010-02-27 (19)) I was doing a crossword scratchie. I was getting heaps of words and I realized that it was a 'big' one and you had to get at least 13 words to get the minimum prize, but it seemed like I was getting all of them. Mom commented on it."
"3316"	"(2010-02-28 (19)) I was watching House. Wilson died at the beginning of the episode. At the end, House started crying very openly and loudly. I cried too. I was thinking to let Mom know there was a new episode out. We went to a shop. There was a guy and others behind a counter. This guy dragged me around the floor and I laughed and said it tickled my bum and everyone laughed. The guy behind the counter liked me. He said he called a video shop at Morley and had guaranteed me a job there. I drove out of the parking spot by myself and as I drove out, a bus was following me."
"3317"	"(2010-03-01 (19)) I was at some place where celebrities and the like were walking through to somewhere. I bumped into Nathan Fillion in a dark hall. I stopped him and asked for a photo and he agreed reluctantly. He looked impatient and said he had 10 seconds. I got the camera ready on my phone and turned flash off and took the photo and he left. Later I went to check the photo and it was gone. I remembered we were in a different time zone as we were on the other side of the country, so I changed the time zone and then the photo was there. It looked weird and was a blurry. I showed Mom and she was like 'nice picture, he's cute'. I said ""Yay Firefly, second best show of all time"". I looked again later and the photo was different. He was in a different outfit and there were ski's in the background. I remembered that he had come back later and I had gotten more photos. There was a roller coaster thing there too. I can't remember properly but I had trouble getting in somewhere or something and Mom and Darren complained about it. I also saw Peter MacNicol at the place."
"3318"	"(2010-03-02 (19)) I was at the old house alone. Something weird was going on. I saw a police car with two young guys cheering and going like ""Woo!"" and they pulled up at the house across the road. I closed and locked the door. I went to my room and heard a noise. They were at the front door trying to get in. One had only light blue jeans on. One looked like Ron Mael and the other looked like Russell Mael. The one that looked like Russell went to the back and tried to get in through the back door. I sent him back out. Later he was back out the back and said ""I hope you know what happens at the end"". I locked everything up. Then Ron came out of the toilet. I put my arms between his legs and carried him out on my back. I text Mom to say that people were trying to break in and I needed help. Then Russell was Kenny Hotz. His mother was young and really Jewish/Bronx-y sounding. He said he was on an 'island' and she misinterpreted as an actual island and said ""I don't care if you fly, jump from a plane or swim"". I can't remember properly but some bad guys captured me and some others. We were now actually on an island [possibly from having watched Shutter Island yesterday] . We escaped and were trying to get off the island. We were in the water and had a cannon. They tried to aim for the bomb, but missed. Then I was Rick from The Walking Dead comic and his wife was still around. She was floating? It turned out this alcohol was actually poison and everyone had drank some, but she died. Kat had moved a toilet so it would fall outside and did something to a door and this was how, presumably, they had poisoned the drink. Chuck (Gossip Girl) and his girlfriend and a guy were having a threesome. The guy kissed Chuck, and I thought it was hot."
"3319"	"(2010-03-02 (19)) I was outside at night. Someone said 'help me'. A teenage girl was trying to get out of a shed and she pointed to her parents. I saw this pointy thing with a handle. This guy was being dodgy and I poked him with it. He came and tried to attack me. He took it from me. Then it was like a Donkey Kong game and I said to Dad ""remember how you had all those sheets of paper with cheats"" and he was like ""... no""."
"3320"	"(2010-03-04 (19)) I went to the toilet and I saw Simba with a half eaten mouse. I distracted him and it looked like it was still barely alive, which upset me. I accidentally pushed Simba into a hole. I freaked out but he was ok. Gizmo was around too. I went to some shop thing with Dad, Ezra and something that I can't read which were all tall and big. Then it was a show. David Anders and his brother (?) were scientists, but different kinds. Both invented a similar thing. Then David Anders spent ten years building a tall building thing. Then I went to a simultaneous world? One of the brothers was $1000 away from $50,000."
"3321"	"(2010-03-04 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft and it was different. I was with someone else. I went to an area that was a higher level than me. We crossed an oval and it was 'night' and all mobs were asleep. We got to a temple and they were all asleep over the stairs and ground etc. We ran through the temple. I went up the stairs and found nothing and went down and through a door. They woke up and people started to shoot. I ran through and everyone was dead. I got to the end of the building and someone jumped into this little blimp like thing. Then the good guys came and they were in SWAT uniforms. Kim Raver was the leader."
"3322"	"(2010-03-05 (19)) I was at a house. Ezra was there but I was in my room and we were talking on MSN. Dad was finishing work soon and was probably taking us to the movies. The movie had Jensen Ackles in it and Ezra and I joked about it. Mom picked me up from somewhere and was taking me back. She said she had to take the train back and I asked why and she said it was because of the L-plates. I was confused and questioned it and then she realized what she'd said. I called Dad to ask if we were still going. He said he just finished work and said he'd let us know soon. It was already 9.20pm though."
"3323"	"(2010-03-05 (19)) I was at the old house. I was in my room on the computer looking at stuff about the Top 250. This retard guy wanted to see how many he had seen and me and some others said no. He liked me. I left to get away from him and he followed and hugged me from behind. Then it was like 10pm. Mom and I went to a cinema to see a movie. There was some UFC thing on TV and Mom asked me a question about another movie. We got to the cinema one hour early and she left. I had no shoes on. I went outside and walked down this forest path and I think it was to get away from the retard. There was glass everywhere. Lots of people were driving past and I slowly started walking back and I had to pick glass out of my foot. A bus went into the cinema area and I ran to get it but I missed it. I went to the other entrance and asked a security guard where the bus 'ended', but then I saw it and people started getting off. I got there just in time. The driver was black and I asked how much it cost because I didn't have my SmartRider on me. He said it was $5.44 and I said 'whoa! I'm going to Midvale' (I was in Northtown). He said it would be $25, so I asked if I could use my SmartRider when I got back and he said I could transfer the money. Other people needed to as well so he wrote down contact details on a piece of paper. He gave me a photo of a pet shop/garden shop/school with instruments, which was on a piece of paper on the wall. It was good quality and you could zoom in. I was then there and I had to go on the internet. I did what I needed to do and I went to leave. I walked in and out of empty classrooms. Then the retard guy lived out in a swampy forest. There was a black guy parked in a car just staring out. The retard got scared and started hitting him with a hammer over and over laughing crazily. After that everyone wanted him dead so he killed himself by jumping into a grinder thing. I was annoyed that he killed the person because I knew people would tease me about it There was a weird dog that had things wrong with it and it's back was like a squiggle. It was creepy looking."
"3324"	"(2010-03-06 (19)) I was outside. Ryan Kwanten came running past (it was possibly on a video) and he was naked and ran and jumped into the water. Everyone was like 'he's hot'. Selena said something along the lines of 'at least I've seen his butt now'. I was like 'ew, who wants to see butts' and she looked at me confused and I said ""he poops out of that. You've seen his poophole"" and she was like 'ew'. Then I was at Nana's. Her birds were acting weird, I think they were dying. Ezra and Emery were there with some others. They told him to touch this hot pipe and he did and he burnt his finger and then tried to kill me. Ezra tried to stop him and burnt his fingers too. I had to shoot Emery in the head, it left a small hole but then I didn't have to, so we were being careful."
"3325"	"(2010-03-06 (19)) I was at a shop and this guy was wearing a black Alliance shirt. I was holding my blue one. I left with Mom. I was driving. I was still in the carpark and there was lots of stuff in the way to the exit. I had to drive in an exact position but I kept missing it. Mom complained but I got out finally. I was driving at 60km/h. The lights were green but they turned to red suddenly and I went through and I noticed there was a camera there. There were police with guns and there were people all over the road. I can't read the rest."
"3326"	"(2010-03-07 (19)) I was at the old house which was different. It was haunted or something. I was playing a game on my computer. I was in an elevator and I had to collect stuff to drink or I would lose health. The lighting wasn't very good in my room so it was hard to see. This ghost would come and at times it would just sort of [do something that I can't read] and then it would start making things bleed etc. He got an award at level 15 which meant that he had killed 15 people. My highest was four and I was determined to get it to 15 tonight. He smashed some stuff that I left behind. Then Ezra, this guy and I ran along train tracks to beat the train. There was also a photo of Cuddles and Gizmo."
"3327"	"(2010-03-08 (19)) We were having a joint get-together for me and Mom's birthday. I was naked with a towel around me and I sat next to Gizmo. I saw Eugene near me. He was putting his bag down and I saw him writing in a card. I imaged him started to write 'I love you' and then changing it to 'have a good day'. Then I was at Nana's. Dad and Ezra were in the lounge room watching a horror movie. This guy was in a plane and there was a special button to allow for decoys. There were some more but I can't read it. The movie was called IC Eric or something. Another movie that was on was called CCVII and there was another one which was getting heaps of good reviews and Dad said he had heard enough of it. There were two towers of buildings. I can't remember what was happening but the one I wanted to go to was closed."
"3328"	"(2010-03-08 (19)) I was watching Network. The first 40 minutes were lame and then it was really good, but it was different. I was in a building and ended up on the roof. I was talking to this guy who was the boss of the company, which had something to do with technology. He said that if I ever wanted a job there to let him know. He ended up dying because he was an alcoholic and someone did something to him using his alcoholic status. Mom and I went there and Mom went to the roof and asked this guy if I could have a job there because the other guy said that I could. I was waiting on the street and Mom yelled down to me ""do you have any hours spare?"" And I said I could do it Wednesday right after Native Animal Rescue. There was a guy on the street and he saw a toddler walk into the middle of the road and he decided to keep it. Then he was on the roof talking to this guy. There were twins and someone half jumped onto the train tracks in a subway. The toddler jumped off the roof and the guy was upset and angry. Then the building was on fire and we were waiting for the firemen. Then he ran down and it had been mostly put out and was smoky on the second and third level, but then he was at the top again. I took a shortcut and there were cats and dogs on the platform I had to organise them."
"3329"	"(2010-03-09 (19)) I was given some vibrators to look after. I put them in the glove box of my car. Later I was with Dad and Ezra. Dad was driving and Ezra was in the back in my seat. I hid another one in the glove box and it wouldn't close. Then I was at home. I went to get them out of the car but they were gone and I remembered that I had text Mom while I was at University to say that I had forgotten my lab coat and to check my bag and other places in my room. Then I was thinking that she didn't find them and they were there. Then I was going out with some guy called Eugene. We and some others went to a house/school place. I had been there when I was younger at least twice before. It was creepy. I remembered that I had found Zelda (Pet Semetary) and it had scared the hell out of me twice. I think that we were in trouble for something. We were in a building and we saw police outside and we all hid under the windows etc. I was in front of a door of a room that Eugene was in. He didn't know what was going on so I made a ssh sign and he went along with it. Then some guy got up and greeted one of the cops and said that we'd been here for a while and that we were okay and the cop left. I told Eugene about Zelda and he got goosebumps. She was actually related to someone and he said that she had freaked him out too. I saw a staircase leading up high and I figured it led up to her. I went to Eugene and grabbed his hand and we went up together. She was sitting at a sewing machine with her back to us. We went up close and then she turned around and it wasn't scary as it had been before. She said ""it's coming for you"" and I asked what and she talked normally and said ""evil"". When Eugene left she said it was him. He was like Jekyll & Hyde. I wasn't sure if he knew though."
"3330"	"(2010-03-10 (19)) I was sometimes Lexie (Grey's Anatomy). She was sleeping with Karev (Grey's Anatomy). He discovered that he loved her and they were in a hospital and he kissed her and she pushed him away. Then later they were talking again and she had her back against the wall and he put his hands on the wall and pressed up against her and kissed her and she pulled away in disgust. She said it was because they worked together. Then I was dating Callie (Grey's Anatomy). I went out with Nana in the middle of the night to check on some small people. They were about ant size. We had to cross this huge oval. Then she was Callie and I said that we should get our own bed. This was because we were sharing with two friends. I'm not sure if we were sharing a bed but we were definitely sharing the same room. When we got back, she said to them that we wanted our own room and they were actually friends of hers and I felt awkward. One of them looked like Leighton Meester. Callie said she wanted to move tonight and said that 'we've been sharing for [however long] , you can't expect us to stay here again'. Leighton looked upset but was then like 'until you meet hot twin guys' and then she said that they would keep the noise down. We then tried to work out the standard deviation of noise during sex. We laughed. Then they left and we saw two twin guys at the door and they were like 'whoa everyone's hot'."
"3331"	"(2010-03-11 (19)) There was a math thing. I was with a teacher and Ezra. I can't remember properly but he said we could join an online discussion with him. I was then at a shop thing. The teacher guy was there, although I didn't acknowledge him. There were some guys there that looked dodgy so Ezra and I ran. We opened a door and went in and shut it. It had no handle but I could hear the guy's just outside so I was trying to lock it but it could still be pushed in. Then it wasn't a room and there was a counter next to the door, so they just kept threatening us over the counter. There was also a gap between the counter and the shelf at the back. I'm not sure why they were keeping as there. The leader guy pulled the door out and on an angle, put it in neatly then I kicked it out. He picked on me and seemed to flirt with me. We were trying to find ways to escape. The guy kept annoying me and I went out through the shop and chased him outside. There was a road and the cars were going really fast and I pushed him out like five times but each time the cars missed him. Another one of his guys was watching. I was confused and laughed in shock. After that I voluntarily sat with them. He was sitting outside. Someone mentioned that he was spending a lot of time on me and he said that he never spent so much time trying to get with someone and that he had a crush on me. I was like 'ok...'. He was okay looking but wasn't my car (he was about 30-40 and tradesman like). I was using a fake name by the way. His name was Medd Menthril. I ended up kind of liking him. We also talked about getting married, which I agreed to. Eventually we were saved and he was set free. I was then at home which was different. Mom said she was going to start making dinner. I left and there was a big water thing around the shops and you could get a jet ski or something. I took out this fast boat but there was a speed limit and I was annoyed. I got to the end and this guy in a small boat was there to help people get off the boats. He turned around and it was Medd. We pretended we didn't know each other and this other guy said ""let's hear it for Gretchen (me)"" and I was thinking 'now he knows my real name'. I got home and I had a text from him asking me to put aside a list of movies for him and he also asked 'how old are you?'. I wrote down the movies on my finger and Mom asked what I was doing and I said that he had asked me to get movies for him. She accused me of having sex with him and I said I didn't (although I didn't know if I had). I was also thinking that maybe I had gotten Stockholm Syndrome."
"3332"	"(2010-03-13 (19)) It was post apocalyptic-y. We were all separated into groups. We were living on an oval with buildings that we built ourselves. We had 'houses', farms, markets etc. We called ourselves 'San Diego' [I watched Anchorman last night] . We had gotten new people in recently. Two girls and I went into a house looking for a friend. We peaked into the bedroom and there was a random guy in bed with a cigarette. We ran to leave but he caught me. I sent that we thought you were a friend of ours. His girlfriend complained too and I said we must have got the houses is mixed up and asked him to let me go. I suspected one of the new girls of being crazy. There had been other crazies but they had been dealt with. We had this paddock behind a shop which had sheep, cows and some other new creature. Some had died recently and I thought they had been killed but no one listened to me so I didn't say anything. I had found a bit of a hoof a while ago on a path but I had ignored it. Today I was walking near the paddock and I jumped into it. I saw this orange thing on the ground which was like a screwdriver handle and a paint scraper shoved into a hoof. I grabbed it and got out of there. I went to Rick (The Walking Dead comic) and asked him something and he asked why the lambs were out. They had been sprayed with something and we couldn't touch them or it would kill them. I said that I was just near the paddock and they had been in there. He fixed it up. There was a makeshift house for the leader which was two storeys but the first just consisted of a set of stairs and there were no walls. I saw the leader up there but I realised I didn't trust him. I went to Rick and I said ""can I talk to you for a second"" and he said sure and I said away from everyone else will stop he finished what he was doing and we walked away. I said ""I'm not sure if it's from a live one or a dead one"" and pulled out the half hoof and said ""but I found this the other day and then today I found this one"" and then handed him the other one. He fit together and we went to check the hooves of those still in there. I said that I had remembered seeing some hooves missing on a live one. I said that I suspected someone was killing them. There was a nerdy girl nearby reading a book series, the name of which was two words which both started with a P. I asked her something. Someone mentioned me going crazy when I saw two new guys throwing mangoes etc around (which was because we had limited food)."
"3333"	"(2010-03-14 (19)) There was a new season of Lost. Jack Davenport was in it and I was thinking that he was hot. I was in the dining room of the old house. Mom came out and was angry because I was in front of the fridge."
"3334"	"(2010-03-15 (19)) I went to this place to see Poppers and Nana. I was with Mom and Ezra. We had chocolate but had only four left. There was a white chocolate bunny which only had 6g of fat so I ate it. I think someone was chasing us and we were driving fast down a snowy road which had lots of things in the way to stop you from driving wildly. Then we started running and I was jumping over traps. I was then at University and I went on and MAIS. I had new grades released for an assessment for ANS102, but the assessment was actually just saying that the site was going to be down later. I had grades for the self quizzes on which I'd got 81% and 82% and a valence thing on which I had gotten 80%. Somehow my average grade was 88%. I couldn't read the notes on the valence thing (it wasn't really valences). I went outside to wait for Mom. I called her and she said she was just leaving. I sat at a bench and then this girl came up and said 'I want to sit at this table, we're going to [something I can't read] "" and I said okay. Two of them were black and then they weren't. The girl in front of me said 'look at this' and she had drawn a random squiggle on a piece of paper and then she said that I had screwed it up. She turned around and it was a drawing of her face but it was really good and had colour but the other drawing she tried didn't work. This guy there wanted to try it by drawing a love heart. The bench started spinning wildly around barely missing the trees. I was screaming and laughing. It finally stopped and he had basically drawn nothing but there was a small love heart drawn in pencil. Mom called to say that she was here. Ezra was then there and I took a photo of them all."
"3335"	"(2010-03-16 (19)) Nana's house was a zoo. There was a baby elephant inside and the mother was outside ready to give birth. I was with the baby elephant. There were a lot of media people outside. The mother elephant climbed over a fence"
"3336"	"(2010-03-16 (19)) I went for a drive with Ezra. I was driving and I went into a carpark and I saw someone who looked like a cop and then I remembered that I shouldn't be driving alone. I went to park and there was another person there and I parked in a pram bay and then drove through to a normal spot. Then I was on a red moped thing. I was then at a petrol station and Rover was there. I said ""anguish"" and he looked at me with a weird look. I knocked on the window of the station to tell Ezra. This skinny girl walked up to me and said ""do you have a Porsche?"" And I said no, laughing. She said okay and walked off but then she called out ""do you have any passions?"" And I said ""yes, one"" and Ezra was laughing. Then I was filling up the car with disco music and petrol. The girl distracted me and I put too much petrol in (I think it went over by one dollar). She squirted me with a hose and tried to get me with petrol. This guy showed me this cord thing to wrap around the moped wheels to keep stuff in place. Then there was this movie which was the third in a trilogy and it was called Satan's Grave. The first one was set in Western times, the second was more recent and the third one was set in the present. The first one was made in the 80's and Clint Eastwood was in it. It involved time travel. I was then in a huge library. This guy said it was during school hours and I said that I was in University and he was like 'pfft' and said he didn't care. I said ""I'm 19!"" And I showed him a Proof of Age card but he said it was different. It also said that my birthday was in 1994. They refused to let me stay there. Then it was the movie again. This new guy had just finished writing his last 'note' and he found one from SVP (Clint Eastwood's character) which had been written in 2082 (which was now) saying that 'whoever else wrote in here we know who you are' etc."
"3337"	"(2010-03-17 (19)) I was at Toys ""R"" Us. It was a tiny new shop but I liked it because it was neat. I was there to get something unrelated. There were two Asians at the counter. There was an ad for Warcraft. Mom and Ezra went outside. I had gotten some lollies and I did something and then I went outside. One of the Asians said 'you're Alliance, I'm Horde and strong and [something about backing off] ' and he didn't call me a bitch. Then the other Asian said 'I think she is confused'. He came out and had an American accent and said he was level 1 and I said that I was level 68 but I had only started a few months ago. He said he was in a high-level guild and that he would go with them on raids etc. They would all end up dying and he would be the only one left. Mom was up a hill in an ugly green car which she ended up buying. Later I was driving and approached these lights which were red but were flickering green. But then they stayed red but Mom told me to go left. We ended up lost and walking. Then we found a shop that had nice rolls. We went up a path and we found 'guard horses'. There were four. They told Mom about this diet/workout thing that I had seen before. This was on a collection of short films and was the last one. We had gone to the beach before. I also got a low mark on my math assignment."
"3338"	"(2010-03-17 (19)) I took Ezra to McDonald's because he was working. We were late because we went somewhere and I had said that we had to leave but they were like 'there's plenty of time' (he started at 6pm). I said it was 6:30pm (it was 6.27). We quickly went there. I hung around for a bit and I actually worked there too. I was just about to leave and this Indian guy wanted a muffin, saying that he wanted ""a small one"" and I asked ""a small what?"" and I eventually figured out he meant muffin. Music was playing on a television and Good Man in a Bad Time came on and I was like ""I love this song""."
"3339"	"(2010-03-18 (19)) I went to some event thing with Dad. We left in his car although we had gone there in mine. I asked 'what about my car?' and I text Mom to ask if we could pick it up tonight. I was annoyed because I had almost finished my logbook. We got back home which was a bit different. This creepy guy came to the door and told me to come with him. I did and jokingly asked ""I don't have to get in the back seat of your car do I?"". There was a car across the road that was normal looking it was red on the side and black everywhere else. He told me to look inside and I saw my car keys (although I had them on me too) and other stuff of mine. He said that it was for me. It turned out that it was because Bret Michaels was related to us. His son, Eugene, looked like him but was uglier and they had only recently found out that they were related, which led them to finding out about me. Then he wasn't Bret but was some other rich guy/explorer. We were in a room with some others and he gave a speech and said that most of us would get money from him, but some wouldn't. He said that the first $500,000 was over there and he pointed to my car. There was a party game, where you did an 'evil' stare at people and if your eyes glinted, the person you looked at 'died'. You had to be drunk from a certain drink though and I wasn't drunk, but I played anyway. When I went out later some of the red paint came off. Poppa was around as well and I felt kind of bad because of my old car. I was driving the new car and there was no lag when taking off and it was really comfy etc. There were bad guys after the famous guy and he grabbed his daughter (who was me at this point and was a toddler). He ran up a lot of stairs which were gate like. He got to the top and then his son Eugene who was still the same age, was puffed out. There was a trolley and someone asked ""why isn't this running?"" and then jumped down."
"3340"	"(2010-03-19 (19)) I was friends with Obama. Years ago some lady had done something to his wife, who was different. She had had a son who was this weird midget and then it showed them years later and they were in space and they still wanted to find her. The midget still looked the same and had grey hair and was retarded. They were making their way to Earth. Anyway, Obama got me to find out about them. This happened a while ago. I went to see him and he was in a room with this table with a curtain around it. He said ""hard day?"" And I said why and he said 'I could tell'. He then said that his wife knew about us. I said ""we haven't done anything"" and I was confused. He looked at me and then he said the thing about the lady. I said that I had seen a look in her eye when she was near the midget. His wife really didn't like me and was suspicious of me. I had some pens I had to give to him secretly but she was watching so I left. Mom gave this black coat to Ezra to use as a distraction. I went with Ezra and we went to 'school'. We were late. I realised I'd forgotten to straighten my hair too. I was then outside a classroom and was running and joking around with some people. I went to the toilet which had joint urinals and had open seats which I thought was lame so I didn't go. There were guys on the computers outside and they were trying to get 10,000 people to join something and they were about 10 people way and I pressed ctrl + alt + F4 and ran. They were angry and Obama was up ahead (he was working out of the school). I got to him and he was with someone else. I said there was a weird vibration in my leg. They told me to talk to Mr Willingham, who was called Hupping, and he told me to go to the nurse. I asked for Anna and they asked 'who's Anna?' and I said ""Anna Kendrick"". I told her and I said I had been recommended to come here by Mr Hupping and they let me in. I told the nurse what was happening and she pressed a little round muscle on the back of my knee and said ""this fat little bugger!"" I said I had been on a 'diet' but I was having trouble now due to my legs. She gave me a list of good foods to eat which were mostly gross. Also at some point I was carrying around some of my dreams and they got wet which I got upset about."
"3341"	"(2010-03-19 (19)) This guy took me and some others in a car. I knew was bad but he didn't know that I knew. It was night time. We got to this snowy place and we stopped and I got out of the car and I ran. I ran up this hill which was covered in fake snow which was like a carpet and I used it to pull me up. There were a lot of houses and they all had these LED signs with temperatures written on them (all the temperatures were different though). I went into a house which was dark and empty. I heard a noise coming from the front of the house so I lay down and started to pull myself into the house, but this guy came in and had a look. He said 'I think that's Izzy' but he was looking for someone else first. I watched his shadow to make sure that he left and then I went out the front way. They turned off all the street lights. I went into this other house and there was a kitchen with steps leading down to a kid's room with two beds. There were a heap of blankets and whatnot at the end of the first bed and I hid under the blankets just as some people came into the house. This young boy found me and said 'I see people... in my head'. He tried to help me. His other sibling was getting smacked. I said that I should leave and ended up staying the night. In the morning I heard the mother saying that she filled in the blanks - he had written some stuff on the window which mentioned my name. She wasn't in the room so I quickly opened the window and climbed out. It was now day. I had asked the boy where the good hiding places were. I ended up at a pet shop. I wondered if everyone in the town was evil. Seth Green worked in there. I saw this official guy in there as I opened the door so I hid my face and pretended to open the door for him."
"3342"	"(2010-03-20 (19)) I was going on a boat ride with Mom although we mostly swam. It took us five days to get where we were going. Rover was with us. Then there was like a road in the water - there were two sets of buoys on the far ends and two smaller sets of buoys in the middle to make it into two lanes. The weather was bad and stormy. Then we had to hold onto the big buoys and stay within the lane. I got sent underwater for ""15 seconds"" although it had been 20 and one more second and I would have died. Mom gave me a coat hanger and told me to bang this pipe to see if anything was stuck in it. I grabbed it out of the water and whacked it but nothing happened. Then this guy was with us and he was Mom's boyfriend or something. He was actually a swimmer. Mom was yelling at him and they broke up just before we reached a 'rest' save point. Then we were on the boat. Rover and Gizmo were cuddled up together. There was a German shepherd and some puppies and I picked one up. I held it like a baby and it was adorable. They sent them out but they kept coming back in. Some time later the guy from before had lost weight and now had a six-pack. At first I was just on a computer and saw some pictures but then it was real life. He hit on Mom and then on me and I said I wasn't interested. Some time before, I was on the internet and years ago I had this online game, called 'Hotie'? I had made it and it was for ages 12-14? I hadn't been on it for years and I had applicants from 2002-2009. I think the point was to choose yourself and some others and then you pick a sentence and then I give a list of 'muffins' and they would choose one and I would put the word at the end of a sentence. The 'muffins' were like round balls and were made of fudge, ice-cream, mint and then white and brown chocolate mixed together etc."
"3343"	"(2010-03-20 (19)) Dad, Ezra, Roland and I were in a car going down a country like road. There were two lanes on each side of the road. A white van was coming down the right name on our side. There were dead animals on a playground on the side of the road, I saw dogs and sheep. We got to our destination which was like a holiday home. We decided that we couldn't be bothered going there and so we turned to go back. There had been more animals killed. Dad said that he heard on the news something about killer with a white Ute and then one flew past us. We decide to go back to the holiday home and saw more dead animals going all the way up to the house. We decided that the killer must still be around and so we turned back again. We then had a flying vehicle thing which was made up of four balloons and we all held onto them. The killer ran out of the gates at the front of the house and shot an arrow and hit a balloon. The others fell off. I blew into the balloon to keep it up high. They were running down the road and I was flying above them. The guy shot another balloon out. We ended up in a shop and we were trying to get to the exit when he shot down a third balloon. As he was shooting them down I was getting closer to the ground. I was almost at the door when he shot the last one down. We went outside and it was dark but it seemed that the unlit areas were like 'nothing'. We got into a car and drove over the unlit areas to get to the road which went through the shop area. Then we got out of the car and we had to hitch a ride. This guy stopped and he had his son in the back seat. He was going in the opposite direction so I asked him if he could take me to the bus stop. I got to one which was weird and wasn't TransMetro. I saw a station up ahead. One was going to Centerville and was leaving in five minutes. I asked the guy for a dollar and I said that I'd give it back over the net or another way. He gave me $10 in coins. I got his details and his name was Stanley Reeithis or something. There was two minutes before the train left and I ran down the steps to get to the platform but I had no idea where to buy a ticket. This lady was saying something about Ezra and Roland and I said ""Oh, are you Roland's mother?"" And she said yes and said that they had gotten tattoos. The next train wasn't for 41 minutes. Then I was back at the top of the station standing outside. There was lots of traffic. This guy on a bike crashed and his head was bleeding on the ground. I took a photo of it but then I realized my phone wasn't on silent. Police came. I called Mom to say that I would be a while."
"3344"	"(2010-03-21 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop. Ezra was eating ice cream. I had one and then three pieces of Vegemite toast. Then Mom made a huge chicken dinner."
"3345"	"(2010-03-22 (19)) I was at Dad's house. There was a little train there."
"3346"	"(2010-03-22 (19)) I was watching South Park with Mom. Kyle and Stan had grown up. Stan and others were making fun of Kyle and then they left and Kyle was upset and they told him later they were just joking. I was with Ezra and a friend of Ezra's. We went to this creepy neighbourhood which I'd dreamt about before. It was like World of Warcraft. I had to go into this cave and get something but there were mobs around and they were hard to kill, so I was trying to avoid them. They attacked us and we ran. I went home and it was different. Mom went out and was going to be a while. It was night, about 9pm. We went to this ice cream shop. Later they wanted to go out again and I said that I wanted to come. I grabbed my keys and was going to follow them but they got in this other car and took off. I did a two finger salute at them. I noticed that there was mail in the mailbox. The postman came walking up. He was sort of hot but was like an average build. He gave me some more mail and left. But as I took it all out, he came back and I realized he was dodgy and whacked him with the mail, which included some chocolate. I ran to the door and he tried to open it but it was locked. I said that my brother has the key. I stabbed him with my car key. He started to bleed and I unlocked the door and went in. He blocked the lock, but let it go for a second and I locked it. I locked the back door too and he said ""forget something?"" and he had come through the other back door. We ended up in a bedroom with two beds. I was half hanging off one and he was on top of the bed, raping me, except he was somewhat gentle and I liked it. He told me to hold the bottom of the bed. At some point before I had managed to get on MSN and told Ezra that a guy had broken in."
"3347"	"(2010-03-23 (19)) I was at a post office to hand in my passport application. A lady served me. It was in a cinema and Clash of the Titans was playing on the screen. She was like 'we can do this now and then watch the movie or we can go behind the counter'. I went with the latter option. I was like 'I hope I can get it this time'. One of the questions was about the average life expectancy of students at Westland University. I was telling Mom about this lady on the Internet who was a dobber - she would get people who failed to reference properly. I said that David Duchovny had played a joke on her. She was a taxi driver and he had her come out to this spooky forest. Then he did it again another time. There was a virus which turned off all computers. A fire started from the carpet at home. I ran to my room and it was everywhere. There was also some quest and I got sent a letter to eat a muffin to give me extra strength etc."
"3348"	"(2010-03-24 (19)) I was going to two schools and doing certain units at one. I was outside with Ezra and Rover. It was night but it was easy to see. There was a fence and I could see through it a little from this side. There were two guys from my class who were both kind of hot. One was really quiet and the other wasn't. I had a weird feeling about one of them (he was the hoter one, and had a very flat nose but it looked good). Both of them had dark hair and eyes. There was a little dog that I had got and a thing where the dog slides onto you. Some boys were watching and were like 'whoa a girl can do it'. This Indian woman was on their side and they got up and started talking to her saying stuff like 'Hello madam' etc. I reached my hand around the back and pulled out a water bottle and took a sip. I think he was going to kill her, so me and Ezra got up and ran away. We wiped our footprints from the sand and we had some trouble with a lock, which was like a USB and kept sliding out. I left the school. I tried heaps of others such as Creekside, which I was supposed to start in an hour but I didn't want to go. I reluctantly went back to the old school which was called Midvale but people from Brookland High School were there - well, I saw some photos of the Year 12's with six different ones. I was going to look for Eugene's but later I saw a video of them waiting. Evelyn was there and was just going for photos. I was then in class and there was a guy who looked like Shen next to me listening to You and Me except it was more techno. I tapped my finger along to it. The more talkative guy from before was there and he was going around the other side of the desk talking to people. I was wondering if he would recognize me (he had liked me before). Someone asked ""who made Gone With the Wind? Was it Scarlett O'Hara?"" and I was like 'what the hell?'. The guy sat at my desk."
"3349"	"(2010-03-26 (19)) I was at university in the carpark. I pulled up next to a car to wait for Dad. Eugene's car was next to me. We were then all standing around together and he was really tall and older looking. We then became friends. Then it was like the comic Crossed. I was with some others including Rover. We were at a shop. The Crossed attacked us and we ran. The cross looked like swastika from the side. We were then outside a little building. One of us got Crossed and attacked another one. Rover also got Crossed so I killed him. This guy grabbed a girl and fell to the ground. He was Crossed but he grabbed a pole and stabbed himself and then he was okay. We realised that we could change back and I was upset about Rover. To change back they had to do a good deed."
"3350"	"(2010-03-26 (19)) I had two ANS102 assignments. They both involved me doing a prac somewhere. Mom and I went to one and it was at the old house. The games room door was on the other side and I ran out and Ms Burton was there with some others at a table. I asked it was too late and she said that it was. I mentioned that I used to live here but my aunt did now. Rover and some other people were in the pool. Then I was at Nana's. Aunt Sally and her kids came over. One of them were given $25 in coins and chucked it in the bin and left. I took it out and put in my money box. I had a small shelf to keep stuff on. I was reorganizing it. I was then outside a shop. Stuff started chasing me and acting weird. I went into a building and Wilhemina (Ugly Betty) was in a room. I went past and I heard a snort. I was near Marc (Ugly Betty) and I called out ""Willy?"" and she replied ""yeah"" and I asked ""are you alive?"" and then she said ""yes"". She also took something from me and Dad and herself? There was something do with clothes. Then I was in a shop and stuff was chasing me down the aisles etc. At the end of it, people thought I was crazy because they hadn't seen any of it. Then I was this guy and he was singing a song in a strait jacket. The walls behind him had weird creatures on them and they were filming him. I could get reputation with some creatures (like in World of Warcraft)."
"3351"	"(2010-03-27 (19)) I was watching The X-Files. Mulder and Scully were at a house. I was with Scully. There was a dressing table and some glasses on top. I put them on and then I could see the mother, grandma and daughter who lived there and were dead. I freaked out and Scully didn't believe me. Then the grandma was going to kill herself to save the girl and the mother was crazy. I cried a lot. There were some cheap houses in Seaside and I said that I wouldn't live in Seaside. Then we were in groups and there were beds in one room with no room to walk. I was with Ezra and we were using a picture to map the beds."
"3352"	"(2010-03-28 (19)) Some others and I had to get into a building. We got to the top and we had to run out down some stairs. It was night. Then it was like a game. There was a fortune teller in the shop and she said that someone, who was good, would end up with Seber who was the leader of the bad guys. She did say ""Destinies can be changed"". I was going down the aisle and there was a Stanley Kubrick section but there was only The Simpsons stuff. This guy came and grabbed me and I realised it was Seber, and he put his hand over my mouth and took me away. He had me locked up at the back of the shop. My boyfriend came and was allowed to stay with me. There was a blanket on the floor and we cuddled under it. Seber was just nearby. My boyfriend said we should go naked and he took his clothes off and I took my shirt off. I didn't know if he had taken his pants off but then I felt his bits touching me. He asked if I still had my pants on and I said yes, but then I took them off. I hadn't originally, because I didn't want to. I fell asleep and I woke up later and Mom was there and had taken my clothes away. I got up and found my clothes and went to the bathroom and got changed. I had my period and there was a blood stain on the mattress. Then I was at an outside concert thing. There were competition things. One girl was singing some rock song and audience that was there left and another five people left. There was a guy at another section singing Doctor for My Heart and there weren't many people there either. I was inside a shop and I was looking for the toilet. I worked there as well. It was then night but it was still open. I ended up in this quiet area and I thought to go check on my car because I didn't know if I had locked it. This black guy was nearby and he grabbed me and wanted my keys. I screamed for help in this girl saw me and attacked him and then we ran. The police came to deal with him. I went out to my car and put my wallet was in there and grabbed my phone. I text Mom saying that 'I got attacked'. I pressed the lock and held it down and then I left. I looked back and I saw two old ladies in the car. They were taking money out of my wallet and they were saying that it was her daughter's car. I pulled out my licence etc and she realised the mistake and gave me the money back. I got them out, took her key and then locked it and left. As I went to go back in I saw the black guy coming out and he saw me and then I recognised him. He smiled and came after me again. Daniel (Ugly Betty) saw and grabbed the black guy. The police came again. My boss was like 'how can this happen in the dark' and he'd just come from Washington DC and nothing like that happened there. Daniel was then talking to my boss on the phone and I told him to ssh."
"3353"	"(2010-03-29 (19)) It was Sims 2 like. There was a lady called Julie that moved into town. I think she was in the army. There was a fire at someone's house this lady's teenage son died. There was a thing where you got a clone one in The Island. Later I was at cinema with some friends and a guy who liked me. Then I was in the movie or something and I was hearing voices in Spanish. Then there was a new season of the UK version of Queer as Folk but it was set in the past, like in gladiator times. This guy liked this girl who was married to this leader guy. They had been friends. The guy got sick of the leader one day and pushed him into a deep hole. He hit the ground and this creature was supposed to eat him but he was okay. The guy who pushed him in was like 'oops'. The opening of the show showed Aidan Gillen and some dude kissing. I was also on LastFM at some point and I deleted this guy's play history and then he did it to me and I was like 'flip, I lose my stats'."
"3354"	"(2010-03-31 (19)) I was studying for exams. I went out and Mom and Darren said I had to do something. On TV some guy had been asked to play a part in some thing that I think was fake but he didn't know it. Darren said I had to go see him at some place which was to prove my 'trust' because I was suspected of killing a friend of theirs. It was 1:30 AM. They said it was to see if I was the 'person I used to be' and I said ""I haven't changed since I was six"". As I stormed out the door with Mom, he said something about 'sucks on lollipop'. Mom's car was undercover and mine was out the front of the house. I went out to my car and I said 'Oh, I can't drive because of the night time restrictions'. I started walking back to the house and I saw this guy come running quickly from one house over. I saw him stick a gun up at Mom and I ran to the front door, scared."
"3355"	"(2010-04-01 (19)) I was at a petrol station filling up my car. It leaked a bit and I said to someone nearby ""I've only been driving alone for a while"". Elijah was behind me and he said that he had just got his P plates. My car had a retractable roof. I got in and got onto Newtown Drive. Later I was doing sport at University. Ezra was there and I noticed that his hair was short. Eugene was there too. This Asian guy was with Mom and they threw a rock and the Asian broke his hand. Everyone left. I let him in and tried to work out a way to take him to the hospital."
"3356"	"(2010-04-02 (19)) Eugene and I were going out. We went to Nana's. There was a huge meal set out like when we go up there for holidays. She hadn't met him before and she was like ""oh, who are you?"" and I said ""a retard"" and he laughed and said ""I'm Izzy's... boyfriend?"". I felt uncomfortable about it. I got a plate with food with a big ball of lettuce and an egg which was half white. I cut the white out and there was a black yolk which tasted funny. I said it tasted weird and Eugene said his did too. Nana said it was Vegemite and garlic and I was like 'ew'. We also both stretched at one point the same way and Nana pointed it out. I could time travel. Then I was at a place and I had to go on this playground which had slats of wood with different years on them. I can't remember why but I went to the past for a bit. I had to sing in a choir to pass it. I went further back to when Ezra was a toddler. Mom and Dad were there. We were outside and I was in the car. Mom had told me a story before of a time when she had to feed Ezra but a huge storm had interrupted her. The sky was dark and cloudy and there was lightning and it looked like bad CGI, but otherwise it looked awesome so I took out my phone to take pictures. I locked myself in the car and they left. This guy came to the window of the car and I said ""you are going to get struck by lightning now"". The storm started but ended quick. I drove off to find them and they were on the side of the road. I turned around and came back and they were like 'oh my God did you hit the curb?' And I said ""no because I'm not a frickin' idiot"""
"3357"	"(2010-04-03 (19)) The world was getting attacked by terrorists everywhere. This girl friend that this guy liked got taken. He saved her and others. Then he came running into this building yelling something to the girl. Everyone there was ok and he realised it had all been a dream. He and the girl ended up together though."
"3358"	"(2010-04-03 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was outside and this guy gave me this jumper which let me fly. I had to jump into the air and flap my arms. A group of us were doing it. Then I drove to some house and there was a lady there. I was with some friends and I think someone was sick. She gave us food etc. We went to leave and there was a maze outside and I couldn't maneuver out."
"3359"	"(2010-04-04 (19)) Mom woke me up. I got ready for school and then she took me there. It was dark and there were like three people there. I checked the time and it was 4 AM. She had woken me up at 2:40 AM. She then text me that she had realised the time. I told her to pick me up. This teacher guy came out and told me to be quiet on the phone, but I had already gotten off and I complained back saying that I was being quiet. Mom took me home and her and Ezra played a card game. I waited for a while and I was going to drive to University but it was peak hour. Note: in RL I had to get up early this morning to pick Ezra and Dad up and when I woke up just now my phone was off. I also watched some Modern Family and there was a character called Izzy Jade who interacted with Sofia Vergara's character."
"3360"	"(2010-04-04 (19)) This was sort of continued on from the last dream. We went to the old house because I had to get some stuff. Ezra was with me and he asked if I could drop him off at a roundabout to make it easier. I started at 11:30 AM and it was 10:10 AM. I started to panic so Mom came to get him. My hair wasn't straightened. I got my lab coat and there was heaps of stuff already in my bag. I left at about 10:20 AM. I was on the freeway which was different. It rained heavily and I have my wipers on. Cars were breaking a lot and it was peak hour etc. Up ahead I could see cops shining a light in all the cars. One stopped me and said to keep my radio on. I kept going and they said that a guy in a white Corvette was dangerous. The right lane was free and I saw him coming up. He sped passed and the cops followed. Everyone else sped up and followed too. He ended up getting out of his car and running. We all got out and some people chased him excitedly. A news crew were there and I watched them. I walked past and someone's shirt said 'Little Nemo'. I went to this shop and this guy was there next to me and he said his ""Poppa"" and I said 'oh, are you Greek?' and he said yeah. I said that I call mine Poppa too. He waved me off like 'what ever, I don't care'. He kept saying stuff like that he was better than me etc and I said 'yeah right'. I text Mom to ask if she heard anything about the guy from before. This cord got stuck under the guy in the shop and when I went to move it he got all spazzy and I yelled at him and said ""I'll do it slowly if you don't trust me!"". I went through some clothes at the shop. Eventually I got to University and I was early."
"3361"	"(2010-04-05 (19)) There was a class on for writing. Eugene was there. I pretended not to see him. I had to go across the hall to another room for a bit and Geneva was there. This lady talked to us and then we left. Mom wasn't there to pick me up so I called her. Eugene got on a bicycle and left and it had a licence plate. I left with Mom but before we did Eugene's father Abraham was talking to us and flirting with me. We ended up back at their house which was different. Then his father and some others were being weird. We went to the elevator to leave. This priest guy was there and we waited for him to leave and then we got on. They Eugene came with this big blowup like thing. They caught him so we opened the doors and let him in. We got down and ran to the car and then left. We were in my car and I didn't have much petrol. We ended up falling off a cliff but we were okay. We went back to Eugene's building. Then I was at this hole in the wall where I had put stuff when I was younger - stuff that was worth money such as drugs, rocks, a big fat fish and 'dog' fish (which were cute)."
"3362"	"(2010-04-06 (19)) I got an iPad demo which was like $500. It was really big and wide. There was a Maxis like game. Then it had different areas with different characters and things to do. There was a path which went into a forest. I had to go to ""Broadway"" and listen to a song by a guy. There were little houses and people would give you stuff. There was a little path with a car at the end and this guy would play music for you. He played Can't Take My Eyes off of You for me. I went to this computer section where I had to download this thing. This zombie girl was there, so I picked up some weapons. Then Ezra was there too. We both went off to show him stuff. Then it felt weird and I saw this dog running. I realised the zombies were coming and yelled 'run'. We ran and we held hands to slow me down. These gates were locked so we had to go the long way around. We ended up at this apartment. We saw people that we didn't know there. There was blood all over the steps. The zombies were rabid and the people and us hid and they eventually left. They said that everyone else was dead and that they had been attacked earlier. We found a survivor - a young black kid. They carried him out. We all walked out to leave when we found a heap of other survivors. It looks like it says they shouted for skin? They took us back to their area. I said that other zombies were slow. This girl said that there were different types. Later that day I was with someone around the back and they were acting weird. Then they bit someone and their voice became raspy and they came after me. I started walking backwards away from them and as they walked they became more rabid. Eventually they turned completely and started screeching and flapping their arms. I started running backwards calling out ""Spearow!"" which was a code to the girl. Eventually I got around and I think someone killed them. We were now preparing because more would come. We had nowhere to hide but we went inside anyway. We turned the perimeter lights off. The zombies pulled a submarine apart from and were now hanging around. When it all calmed down we went out and pretended to be one of them. There were these two metal bars parallel to each other like rails and we did push-ups over them. The girl from before and I were walking through them. They mostly had black eyes but it didn't matter. We had 'evil' grins at our faces because that helped. We had gone 'undercover' before. No one liked me. I was called Hildy [I watched His Girl Friday last night] . We went to this bench where some zombies were sitting. Me and the girl had a fake argument and we stormed off. This other normal girl was involved too. Then we were in a shop and someone called out ""intruder!"" and then pointed to us and said that we knew she was an intruder; they were pointing to the other girl. I gently pushed her along and said that 'yes, she's the only one'. She was shocked that we'd given her up. I pushed her into the aisle and they all ate her in like two seconds. We all licked our lips and the girl and I slowly left the shop. We went out to the carpark which was full of cars. We now had a guy with us. We all got into a car and went to leave but then this girl came that looked like Milla Jovovich. They let her in despite my objections. I was driving and there were people on the road. I was watching out the cops."
"3363"	"(2010-04-07 (19)) I was watching Kenny vs Spenny [I watched it last night] . Spenny was chatting to some school girl with big boobs. He invited her to something and then I realised that she was only 13. Then he was drunk somewhere and had facial hair and was singing and then said ""Heil!"" at the end (like that little bit at the end of The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill) and I was trying remember what song it was from and I was thinking that it was Wishing (If I Had A Photograph Of You). I had to get Spenny approved by some insurance thing so that he could go into some shops. One was a kid's shop. Then Kenny and I were in a shop. I hadn't told him about Spenny and he had asked me not to. They had some lollies like those bracelets things. The 13 year old from before had a geometry test, but wanted to go out instead. I went to the park with Mom and Rover. There was a magazine with a diet plan where you could lose 2 kg in two weeks. Running was part of the exercise. I decided to use the mowed part of the oval to run on but Mom complained so I decided to stick to the abnormal route."
"3364"	"(2010-04-07 (19)) I lived at this weird place like a hut but there were lots of doors and people etc. I shared a bed with some guy. His fingers were touching me and I pushed him away, but then he did it again. I asked him if he had a pen. The people below us did and I reached down and took one. The guy kept putting his arm around me etc. Then, he had told me he liked me. We were friends, but I didn't know how I felt about him. Some girl friends and I had to go to this Science Museum place. It was huge and there were a lot of elevators and halls to places far away. They were trying to get me to talk to the guy and I didn't want to so I ran away. This one girl in particular chased me. I went behind this curtain and she followed. It was very dark and I jumped over this thing into another section. The other girls gave my hiding place up. Eventually I gave in. We went to this elevator and we had to stand on a seat and step into this TV (it was a perception thing). We were then outside a building and there was a vending machine with lite Mars Bars but then I realized they were Kinda Bueno's. There were lots of people around. There was a question on an assignment and this guy was asking if anyone understood it -- it was about measuring the 'safeness' of these two parties. There was another elevator which took us into this dark hall. This lady came out of a room and we asked where the exit was. She pointed to it and said it was 4am and asked 'why are you on my phone?' [I think, that's what it looks like it says] ."
"3365"	"(2010-04-08 (19)) I had also signed up for the RSPCA. I hadn't gone to either of them yet. It was now time for RSPCA. It was from 10 AM to 1 AM but when I got there I realised that I'd forgotten the forms and it was now 10:30 AM. I went to go home but there was a hailstorm. People from school were there. A Ute got smashed. When I got home I remembered we got to choose your hours. I was watching Ugly Betty. Betty had a baby and Daniel was possibly the father. Some fancy school said they wouldn't take him and people accused Daniel of doing it. Mom and Ezra had mail. They were 'Valentines' from a volunteering place. I had done them. Ezra's said ""To Tommy"" and ""from Lana Lang (Smallville)"". I asked ""who's mine from?"" and it said Oliver Queen (Smallville). I giggled, thinking I must've done it because he was the hotest, but then it was Zod (Smallville). There were also a few from Clark. Then I had a bar? When people from it, they got a green symbol above their head. This new guy was with this guy in armour who had light skill (like in Smallville yesterday) -- I don't remember what I was talking about here. I went in and some people had red symbols. I said to my friends to not drink because it was bad and I gave them mine. I tripped some person over so they would spill their drink and I gave them my drinks ""on the house"". A guy friend of mine was worried about his red symbol. Then the guy with the light wanted to kill me. A bunch of us told him to leave. We discovered he was blind. Zod stayed behind. I went back quietly and whispered to him and then hid under a desk. The light guy came looking for me. Zod attracted him somewhere else. I was copying his movements on this metal framework thing; hold and jump etc. But then he made a bit disappear and Zod fell to the ground. He got out and later ran across the restaurant and hid under a table, while the light shot at us. People at the bar were angry at me for not letting them drink. They read out from an old diary of mine. It mentioned some crush from when I was younger called ""Peter Bishop"" (Fringe). I took it off them, upset, and they realized it was wrong and were nice again."
"3366"	"(2010-04-08 (19)) I was at university after hours (i.e., it was late). There were ladies checking for people. I said to one that I had to stay to check out a building. There was some experiment with these mice -- there were two of them and I had to hold onto this handle and shock them in the head? This lady marked all the tests and I got 51% and I was like 'lame'. This mouse was getting tired and the lady let them off. They collapsed and there were heaps of them running around. I called the mouse 'Gizmo', because it was like Gizmo."
"3367"	"(2010-04-09 (19)) Wilhelmina (Ugly Betty) cloned herself or something. The other her was evil and took over. Actually, the evil her could've also been from an alternate universe. She killed the clone thing. Silvio and Paulie (both from The Soprano's) were guards. She led someone to this place, asking ""it's south of Canada, right?"" and they said they were north. Silvio and Paulie ended up getting killed and I was annoyed because they were my favourite characters. Ezra left his phone with me and I took photos of myself. Also, at some point this guy weighed Wilhelmina, Ezra and I and Ezra was the 'ideal' weight. It said I weighed 190lbs. Wilhelmina was also overweight. Then everything was over. Casey (Chuck) was tied up in a chair. He looked like Jayne (Firefly) though [I started rewatching Firefly last night] . I had this belt and looking serious, I went over and did a whip movement and he was like ""hey!"" and I laughed -- he had thought I was bad for a second. I showed Mom and she fumbled with the belt. I couldn't stop laughing."
"3368"	"(2010-04-10 (19)) I went on MAIS. Ms Burton said that there was an 'expulsion' of results and that some results had been lost and those people would have to do extra credit. It also said that a red car had been affected. I was now at home and I went to my car. It was in an underground car park. The car was facing the wall and it was next to this tiny blue 'cab' part of a Ute. There was another car parked nearby and it had heaps of oil under it and around it, almost flooding it. People were sweeping water. I was then in a library and Natalie Warbuton was there and she grabbed a pile of my dreams, thinking they were for her to read out and I said 'they're mine, they're not relevant' etc. She couldn't read them anyway. Dad text me saying that he and a friend wanted me to help them with some chemistry stuff. Ezra got a job at a shop, sweeping. We turned the music up in the shop, because the shop next door's music was louder. This guy said Ezra could get Poppa anytime to go to Midvale deli (I think the shop was at Midvale) and get food. The deli closed at 8pm."
"3369"	"(2010-04-10 (19)) Some of us had 'powers'. We came to this place to practice them. Raquel had good balance and something else. Dad was there. There was a tunnel in the wall and someone chased me. He said to go home and don't stop. I went out some hole and ran away and he was confused about it. Then we were in groups, but I think the other group was bad. We had these cards to put up in the middle of the room and they all did different things. We had to make them stand up for them to work though. One guy on the other side had these big hoops that he threw and they would go around people. We built the wall to completely separate us but the guy still got me."
"3370"	"(2010-04-11 (19)) Sean Maher (it wasn't him, but it 'was') and I had become friends and were secretly dating. I kept sneaking off to make out with him. He was lying in this thing and I lay on top of him and we kissed. I told Nana he was going to make us food, but then it was something weird, so she made it. There was a 'chicken' with a big lump (like a loaf) of brown stuff, which was caused from it swelling up from the air, which happened sometimes. I left and went to this room and Sean put his arms around me and I put my hands on his back and we kissed (the 'holding' was quite vivid). I came back to my room later and the bed was messy and there were clothes on it as well as other stuff. I started to clean it up. Then Sean was Cory Monteith. He had to go back to America or whatever soon, but he wanted to stay. We were trying to work out how it would work and we eventually decided that he could to go some music thing at the start of semester 3. We celebrated. Mom had finished cleaning my bed. There was a list of hot guys and I remember seeing Aidan Gillen's name and there were love hearts on the i's."
"3371"	"(2010-04-11 (19)) I went to school. I was in class and we had this seat thing which floated around the room. Jeremiah came in with other people, including Ms Solomon. Mr Stevenson came into the room and his name was Jumphed or something -- they all had changed a few letters in their names. Then I was driving at night. I knocked on the door of a house and it was little and in random spot, but it was Ms Solomon's. She let me in and there were locks on the windows and stuff. She was on the phone and got off and I said I was here looking for something. We heard a noise and I told her to get down and don't look at it ""pretend you're asleep"". I shut my eyes and she was like 'it's so long' and I realized she had looked and I was like 'damn it!'. It broke in and I ran to my car. Calvin was there now too and he had also looked. I said it looks into your eyes and sees your 'soul' -- knows what you eat and then eats you. I got in this weird buggy car and wound the windows up and rove away. I didn't know where I was though."
"3372"	"(2010-04-12 (19)) It was Easter. Someone came from the future and said we needed to drill into the Earth to stop it from exploding in the future. I think I came from the past to say it was a lie. There were 18 layers of Earth. Ezra and I were tying to explain them to Dad. The guy could be listening to we couldn't tell Dad that he was probably lying. The first few layers were like grass and 'poop'. Further down there were hidden pirate treasure chests. The one before the core was important and had DNA in it. I brought an example to Dad and it had like a stick and a ball where mitosis was happening. It just had two pairs of chromosomes in it. I said 'this is where we came from'. The guy who wanted to drill into the Earth drilled out a worm that grew really big. The worm would actually make the Earth explode and we'd be ok because the future was ""far far away"" -- when he said that, I thought he was going to start singing. Also this thing had happened to bring people back to life. I was at home, which was different, but sometimes it was a shop. It was raining outside. It was starting to flood. I was with Ezra. We were trying to close it up. I think I got hurt. I can't remember properly, but the people who came back to life after this kept any injuries they had, eg if they died with their leg half cut off it stayed like that. Most of the people who had come back didn't seem happy about it. I went to this hotel. I was in a room with some people from Firefly. We all paired up -- Mal went with Inara (and I was annoyed at first because I wanted to go with Mal), Zoe went with someone and then Jayne and I went together. I joked, ""why am I always with Jayne?"". Wash was looking frantically around for someone to pair up with, although he was left with Kaylee. There was also another pair, but I don't know who. We had costumes. Mine was dark blue and looked like the hospital uniform in the Firefly episode, Ariel. Zoe's was brown and looked like a mechanic's outfit. She said she had picked that choice (it was some role playing game?) because she liked the clothes and I said that I did too. Jayne started to ask a question about something then said ""oh no, that's us"". We went to this room, which was a kid's room. Granma had died at some point and had come back to life and was in a nearby room with some kids. We heard her yelling and the kids started crying. I ducked behind something and this woman came in and said that I had to leave. I was annoyed because I wanted to spend time with Jayne. I went back to the room with the costumes, which was another kid's room and took it off and put my clothes back on. As I walked out, I noticed that the hotel lobby was really fancy and gold. I went out to the carpark and to my car and Mom came. Dad and Ezra were already at the car. Mom said she got Easter eggs and I realized I had left mine in the room. I ran back and Mom said there wasn't much time (she had also died). I went back and got them. There was an episode of Fringe and I was with Walter (except, it was the actor). I said ""I almost called you Walter"". There was a photo from a prom and this girl had gone out with Simon (Firefly) and I was sort of jealous until I saw the photo and he had earrings and I thought 'eh, he's not that hot anyway'."
"3373"	"(2010-04-13 (19)) I was with Jayne (Firefly) and others. He would sneak away a lot. This girl went up to the attic and saw him sitting at a table with dolls on the chairs, having a tea party. He saw her and was like 'it's not what it looks like'. There was a wrestling figurines and a video tape? They had one lying down on his back and the other had his hand on the other one's crotch area. I told someone to get Ezra to show him."
"3374"	"(2010-04-13 (19)) I was at university. I had a math test tomorrow and an ANS102 test soon but I didn't know when. I tried to juggle the studying. Then it was the morning and I had to leave in 30 minutes. My hair wasn't straightened so I got Mom to do it and I hadn't written a page of notes for the math test yet."
"3375"	"(2010-04-14 (19)) I woke up in a car. This girl got in the driver's seat (it was a US car) and she had weird eyeliner and she said something and hit me with a gun. Then the car was normal again (ie, not US). I said 'you don't have to keep the gun on me all the time. Even if I had a gun, I wouldn't shoot you'. The car was fancy and we drove out of a carpark. Every now and then there was a burnt out car. She said 'I see why you chose this one'. She mentioned not liking innocent people getting killed. I said once I had been with my Dad and airplanes were lined up and one had left the others (which had actually been one of her people taking control of it) and slid on some oil and crashed into the one next to it, then into a McDonald's and we could hear the screams. I'm not sure where she took me but I ended up with Jayne (Firefly). We had been together before. We were in a building with others; it was like an office shop. I thought I saw a shadow of someone coming and I pushed two people down. We all ran to hide. I ran to a nearby wall, but I couldn't hide behind it, so I went to go behind a better one, but this guy came in. There were others in an aisle and they lined up behind each one and made a noise and laughed, etc. This guy found them and saw my ""golden curls"" and caught me too. I got up and joined them. He took us back where we came from. Then Jack Bauer (24) had been part of our group but had stayed out of all this. He came and shot them all and saved us. Then Jayne and I went into a house and we killed some people and he said to stay prepared and that the 'main' killing part was easier than the part after, because you've already calmed down. He said he liked to able to walk into a room and know where all the exits are. We went into one bathroom and this Asian guy was in the shower and I said 'oh, is that all?' and then heaps of others came out behind him. I went back into the hallway and one ran out. Jayne put his arm around his throat and he fell. He fought the other one. I ended up going in and helping. We then ran out. Outside it looked like home. I saw Mom's car and got in the passenger seat, but Jayne ran past. He then noticed it and got in the drivers seat. Heaps of Asians came out shooting at us and the car. We had trouble starting it. We managed to leave and I saw the Ute out the front and I said 'I don't know why I chose Mom's car; I panicked'. He said it didn't matter. We drove away and stopped at a corner with a Christmas tree. It was actually Easter, but it was called Butterfinger here and there was some tradition. It was outside though and we slept there. At some point, Dad had posted on Ezra's Facebook that his friends had all maintained their weight over the holidays. We went out to lunch and we had chicken, but it was still in the shape of a chicken (not a real one, but it was weird looking). Ezra's job was actually right near something that did math? Something was explained about alcohol and Dad said ""What? Those prices are horrible,""."
"3376"	"(2010-04-14 (19)) I was at school. Calvin was there. Some guys were asking about IT and we said we didn't know anything about it. We had been warned about spam? A movie was being made and was set in ancient times. Samantha and I walked across the oval on the way home. I said I was sick of this place and seeing the same people."
"3377"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) I woke up in the morning and it was really cold and there was supposed to be bad weather today (although, it was only cloudy). Mom was awake and I wasn't sure if I wanted to drive in the weather. Dinner from the night before was beaked beans on toast and I ate some for breakfast."
"3378"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) I was at university. I was in a building that looked like a shop. I had gone there earlier to put three water bottles in a fridge but I couldn't find a place to put them. This girl told me to put them 'behind the shop' and I had to lift something. When I went back, I didn't know which ones were mine. There was something on at 2.30pm the next Wednesday -- something to do with Kiefer Sutherland coming to help you when it's 'hot'. I was thinking that I wanted to go. You had to order tickets. Adam Baldwin was also going to be there and he was interviewing people for plays and he was a playwright. I was also home at one point and I was watching TV with Mom. Supernatural was on, but I only remember seeing Rover and I saw Serenity (as in, the actual ship) and I got excited."
"3379"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) To get my license, I had to do some weird test online. The first question had something about two workers at a cash register and they served some customers. Then I was asked what the name of the one on the right was, but it was hard to read the name tag and I ended up getting it wrong. There was a second picture and question, but I can't read what I've written. It was a joke though for Johnny Knoxville to get money for a party? The guy behind the counter pulled out a gun and he was like 'whoa' and I took his bag and went outside and was messing around with him in a playground area?"
"3380"	"(2010-04-15 (19)) There were two sets of brother and sister. I think their parents were married. One of them was Adam Baldwin (and he looked like he does in Chuck). Then they rebelled against their parents. So the parents called the opposite set of children and came up with a plan. What was supposed to happen was someone would 'kidnap' the kids, but then the mother changed it so the father would be kidnapped too. There was sloppy food to fee them with and some others and I had to shove it in their mouths. The father wouldn't open his mouth. I kept shoving the spoon into his mouth and he eventually opened and chewed and spat it out. Then I was at a house, which I think was home. Mom had called this babysitter lady. We had mattresses on the floor and everyone was sleeping (all the kidnapped people). Rover was on the lounge. I saw the babysitters car pull up and Mom answered the door and said we didn't need her and she asked ""oh, you found the puppies?"" and she said ""yes"". But she came in anyway and had a baby with her. We were trying to get rid of her. I also saw a cop car drive by."
"3381"	"(2010-04-16 (19)) Mom and Darren got the old house. They wanted to pretty it up and then sell it. I was confused because they had rented it. Then they were actually fixing up some random house and we were staying at the old house while they did that. I was annoyed and said I wanted to go home. A friend of Mom's and her daughter (my age and black) were staying there. Gizmo was in my bed. We shared a bunk. I couldn't sleep. I got up and it was early morning. I asked Mom for the keys to the old house and Darren tried giving me coins. The pickup was out the front. Ezra was with me. My 'car' was this cylindrical container thing on like a trolley. I got in and Ezra pushed it. We were then at a shop and this psychic lady kept giving me readings. This girl walked towards me and realized I was at the booth and I went to the floor and said 'I'm bored. I sleep now'. She said she wanted to play Scrabble and I said 'ok, Scrabble, Monopoly...' and then said Monopoly was too long. As I was trying to get back, there was a little cooking place. This girl couldn't touch anything because it was hot and she kept almost falling over. I accidentally turned a tap off while the girl was trying to wash her hands and she got angry. I was playing a Mario game. You could morph and it was different. Luigi snuck up behind Mario and he screamed and ran and said ""Mario!""."
"3382"	"(2010-04-17 (19)) Mom and I went for a drive to see Acquaintance-F-06 and some lady. Mom got me to go by myself. She gave me $400 in $50 notes and I also had a $20 and a $10 for petrol. I went and there were heaps of people. They tried to take my money and said I was weak. This guy was next to this other guy who was smoking. I said ""yeah, but you don't know how far I'd go"". He had a gun. I took the guys smoke and put it into his face. I got my money back and left. They followed me. I got to Mom and we left but we still had to do the deal. We went to an abandoned ice-cream shop? We went to the top floor and there was a little door/window leading out. They came and Mom told them I would do the deal. They came to me and I said I'd still do it. They agreed and we ending up laughing and hanging out."
"3383"	"(2010-04-17 (19)) Ezra got a baby. We went to the shop and left it in the car. We also had a rat which was dark brown/black at the front and 3/4 down its back was a different colour. At the shop, we got some chocolate for Easter. We found baby clothing, but it was at a food shop so there wasn't much. We asked Mom if she checked on the baby. They had Firefly clothes for babies. There was a quest on World of Warcraft in the Noblegarden area. I had to find eggs. There was also a shooting star which I had to find."
"3384"	"(2010-04-18 (19)) I went back in time? Cory Monteith had been in something that had gotten popular, but not at the moment. I was walking down the street and I called out to him and told him about stuff in the future to help him and also to try and get close to him. At some point a group of guys I went to knew about him and they started to fight, so I got out. Other people tried to take Cory. Later, I went to a concert and it was of someone I didn't like. This guy and a kid pushed in front and they didn't have tickets on them. My ticket counted for three people. They were getting in trouble and I said 'hang on' and I called Mom and asked if ""Ezra and Ari bought tickets"" and she said Ezra did and I said it was either Ari or Dad that was going. There was also some Kylie Minogue play there too."
"3385"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was at home which was different. Something was weird and I discovered that someone had broken in. My externals were gone but my computer was still there. I was really upset. I had a new one which I kept on me at all times. An account of mine had been hacked and I told Mom."
"3386"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was watching Chuck. Casey went to a poker game after an argument with Chuck. Chuck came to lend his poker skills, as he was really good and Casey wasn't. Casey was using his eyes to signal to Chuck what to do (pushing up, pulling up etc). Some caught them out and he admitted to it and apologized. He started singing to Chuck by opening his mouth a little and the sound was almost like 'baa!'. Chuck laughed."
"3387"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was watching Glee. Lea Michele said she didn't get along with the guy who would be playing her love interest. I was at home. At the front door, outside, was Seth Rogen but he was sometimes Jorge Garcia and had lost weight. Drew Barrymore was there too and had slept with him before he'd lost weight? Then I was inside with Mom and Ezra. They had vibrators and they had electrons which could disrupt other electron fields. We were hitting them together. Mom was like 'you're wasting good battery' and I said 'who cares, I don't use them' and she said ""I do"" and I was like 'ew' and put it down. She said to me, 'I think you like having more than the back of your head visible'."
"3388"	"(2010-04-19 (19)) I was half asleep and wanted to have a lucid dream about 'Jayne Cobb [Firefly] '. So I kept thinking about him. But then I just got an image of him and it disappeared. I went inside somewhere and there were fish ponds with dog poo in them and I had to get it out. On Twitter, some girl had been talking to Ron Glass and said ""I'm Inara [Firefly] "". Another girl replied to her saying ""I love Inara!""."
"3389"	"(2010-04-20 (19)) There was an online activity up on the University site. I had to put an 'option' subject but they were all lame. I went to University. I parked in an underground carpark which was creepy and there was an elevator like the elevators in Super Mario. This teacher guy read out the new subjects. The ones on at good times were mostly taken. There used to be a Beatles one. Most of them were physical. Dexter's (Dexter) boss or something was called Principal Banshee (and was the principal from Glee). Dexter was in a carpark and he turned and saw something and screamed like a girl. Debra (Dexter) and someone saw and he pretended he was going crazy. I was thinking that I didn't pick up on the 'banshee' reference before. I went to class and realized that I hadn't re-straightened my hair. Then I had a boyfriend and we had a room there. We were in bed making out, he was on top, and then we had sex. Then I was at Nana's. I was trying to find my way to the carpark. I went around the back and there was a big hole and I felt like I was going to fall. They were putting a deep pond in. Poppa and others were working on it. Nana helped me around. I went around to the front of the house. Fido was there with a big snake. It snipped at us and Nana told it off. There were more snakes and she was trying to get rid of them and I went to go back and Darren and Ezra were there and in the way. Then I was watching Dollhouse, which was different. I remember Boyd. There was a face on a logo with something in the mouth -- ""a bird"" and she had big blue eyes. There was a dead bird which didn't have a disease in its leg, whereas most did. Then I was back at Nana's. I watched Firefly bloopers. Zoe and someone were on a webcam and a 'trial version' came up. Wash was on the other end. The internet was slow where they were supposed to be -- ""frozen in space"". Zoe touched the screen, but she pressed too hard."
"3390"	"(2010-04-22 (19)) I was at the old house. I went out to the lounge room and Ezra was watching Ordinary People although it was made in 1986 and was about the cast of Firefly. Rover was lying on the floor next to the recliner. Adam Baldwin segment in the movie was played by a guy didn't look like him and was a bad actor. I complained about it and Ezra said 'well, I haven't seen the show so it doesn't matter' and I said 'yeah but you're getting a fake story'. From some angles he did look like him and I said ""he looked like Jayne for a sec"". Then I was driving a car and I had a tattoo on my hand. There was a snake cane thing then it was Alan Tudyk's segment."
"3391"	"(2010-04-22 (19)) I got a kitten and Mom spent some time with it. A few days later I called it Vera. I had to catch a train but I kept missing it. There was a weird elevator somewhere. I went to sit down. Adam Baldwin had his legs up on a desk. I sat in front and played the theme song from Firefly. Mom had gotten rid of a pool that he had had and I was amazed about it. I watched a Firefly special feature where Inara and Mal had a fake wedding. Then I was watching Castle and Beckett asked if Castle would give her sperm. Then ages later she cried out ""what you did is rape!"" And she also had had a baby. A DVD cover mentioned Firefly."
"3392"	"(2010-04-23 (19)) I was at the old house. Ezra and I had to share my room and my bed for a while. I had a double bed coming out from the window. Nana also shared it sometimes. His computer was in there too. I complained about it one day. I locked the door and was getting dressed and then he opened the door. I was like ""what are you doing?"" and covered up. There was a joke to do with a boat and The Princess Diaries and it was a quest on RuneScape."
"3393"	"(2010-04-23 (19)) I could take people into my dreams. Mom, Ezra, Darren and I were there. I chose a past dream that had been vivid and long. There was something in the water and I tried to save them and it was slippery because of soap. There were a bunch of Asians at a log and they gave us some to take. We did some other stuff and there was a bit from ""my favourite episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?,"" I got in the car to leave and then said ""I forgot my water bottle and my shoes, can I have the keys?"" Mom was like 'whatever' but wouldn't give me the keys. Eventually she gave them to me. Then I was at home which was a new house. I locked up and left. It was dark. I went to the end of the driveway and people were driving over the sidewalk because the road was busy. Two guys went down to the house and there was a thing outside with money. He tried to take it and was like ""we live here"" and ignored us. One had a baseball bat, so I took it and hit him with it. Ezra got one too and we both kept hitting them, though our swings were slow. We got medals for stuff. We got a bronze (or third place) for 'raping' [as in, beating people up] 10 times; but it was actually getting 'raped' 10 times. I was like 'awww'. Then I was somewhere with Nana and she asked ""How much weight have you gained?"" and I said ""I've lost .7kg"" and she congratulated me."
"3394"	"(2010-04-24 (19)) I was watching Firefly. They were competing against another group for something and Jayne was like ""Yes! Yes!"" And he was a vet and it was actually because he was getting qualified for something. The other team was like 'it's 45 to 44, it's only one point' and they thought that he cheated. Mal was looking on. Then I was with a huge group of people from different movies and shows and we were at prison and we were trying to do something (like break someone out or something). I was in a toilet with Jayne. I opened all the cubicles looking for this bad girl but she wasn't in there. I walked out and then there was a small room just before you got outside. She was in the corner and we fought. There were locks on the door and I tried to lift one up again and unlock it so that Jayne could get through. She set off an alarm and we dealt with her and then I got Jayne out of the toilet. There was a window and all the others that are climbing out the window. I thought everyone was getting away and I looked up and every window had police helicopters near them (there were heaps of people; around 50 odd). Eddie Jemison was there. At some point, Jayne and I were in bed. He kissed me for a long time with is hand under my chin and moving his hand up my leg. Then he turned and said ""goodnight"" and we laughed."
"3395"	"(2010-04-24 (19)) Mom, Ezra, Emery, someone and I were in a car. We parked in front of this building that looked a bit like a sports centre. Mom went to a shop nearby. We were messing around and they accidentally shot a gun and put a hole in this roof bit hanging over the entrance. We went a while away and it ended up catching on fire. I took photos and then we all ran to hide. Ezra and I went together behind this wall near a fence. It was dark. We heard Mom speaking to one of his friends and we ran back to the car. We got in and then this lady ran up and said we couldn't leave and said a guy had died in the fire. One of the friends asked who and she said something like ""Ernest Trumbull"", the guy went quiet and then said ""that's my father"". His name was Ethan, I think. Then it was Dad with us, not Mom. They decided to go into the building and there were no firemen there yet and it was also raining. I went too and Dad said it was dangerous. We went in and couldn't see any fire. Dad and someone went into an elevator, but when I went over to it, it started going down, so I said I'd take the stairs. The floor above was visible and there was no entrance for an elevator. It was like a trick 'house'. There were two sets of stairs outside. Also, some time before, I found a notebook of mine half burnt and I realized it was because I was going to die. Anyway, this guy who was a friend of the family was nearby and I think he had tried to rape me once? We went up the stairs and this guy at the far end went into another room which was dark. He saw me and aimed a gun at me and I threw stuff at him. His assistant came and looked like Jason Flemyng. He shot at me and I threw stuff at him and then dropped down, out of the window. But then he pulled me up and threw the gun away and kissed me. I had also found a pocket knife thing and I swung the blade out and stabbed him with it. Then I was with Dad and I had killed the guy, though Dad said no-one was there. Then later, I had gotten some footage of ghosts and stuff. A forum said ""Evan Peters and I had an affair. I miss you man"" -- he had been one of the people there. Then it was like 2 years later. I was a guy and was trying to tell people about the events. A car drove past and stopped. Ari (Entourage) got out and said he had been trying to find us for a while."
"3396"	"(2010-04-25 (19)) I went to university and was going to a different tutorial today. It was 9.22 and it started at 9.30. I found a parking spot and went in. I didn't know where the class was, so I picked one. It was night. The teacher lady gave me my assignment back and I got 19/45, although sometimes it said 49/90. Alejandro was sitting in front of me and he saw me, but didn't say anything. Then Mom, Rover and I were at a shop, I think. Some paint fell and made a mess. I tried to clean it up. Pink paint came out, but blue didn't. Then I was in a car with Ezra and some guy. We turned around and I said this reminds me ""gay cowboys eating pudding"". I explained that down this road was a cabin in snow where Dad and James Marsden used to hang out and supposedly they had secretly been together. We went there and there coins scattered everywhere. I took some. I asked Ezra if he knew if they had had sex and he said that he didn't think so, because they weren't gay now. I said that Brokeback Mountain was about love, not gayness. Then it was a movie. Some guy came along and pretended he was in real estate, but was actually scamming people. There was an Asian couple and the girl wanted to see the products and then her ex was there and it was a scam too."
"3397"	"(2010-04-26 (19)) Mom and Darren were in the lounge room watching a weird movie. I asked what it was and they said it was Love Story. I said ""oh yeah, I was going to watch it this month and watched Barry Lyndon instead"". Ryan O'Neal looked different. I watched a bit and it looked interesting so I decided to watch it. A voice sounded familiar (with an Irish accent) and it was Nathan Fillion. I was like 'He's so young!'. It was set in like, the stone ages? Then I was there and there was a guy with a puma. We jumped into this house and it came in. It attacked me and we got it out. It hurt its paw and it was bleeding. I cried and then the dude and I tried to fix it. At the end of the movie, the girl he loved got offered a job far away and took it. They said goodbye. Ezra had to walk 4 hours to somewhere. He wanted to go to the shop later."
"3398"	"(2010-04-26 (19)) I got my own house which was small, but had a big yard -- it was just a big square area fenced in. There wasn't much grass, but lots of dark sand. We went to this shop with traffic lights. You had to get one item at a time, so I went through and people were moving so slowly and I rang a guy to complain and got a pack of something. I went home and went back later and it was heaps faster. Mom came over and she was like 'the yard would be good for Rover'. Ezra drove a tractor thing. The sand was poison and I wasn't able to get rid of it."
"3399"	"(2010-04-27 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I went for a drive at night. As we were coming back, there was stuff on the road which looked like huge balls of ice. I said ""that can't be hail!"". We were near home and there was a carpark with not that much ice there. Home was fine. Then there was more. I had university and had to leave soon. Mom and Ezra were at a tax place and I said ""Ok, I'm leaving now"". I got into my car and locked the door. This guy was hanging around the passenger door and he had red eyes. I tapped on the window to scare him and he made a Murloc sound. I reversed out too fast and accidentally hit a car as I drove out. I stopped as this woman, who I think was Spanish, got out and yelled at me. I was like ""I didn't do it on purpose!"". Then the guy jumped on her and started eating her and I realized he was a zombie and I got back in my car and drove off. There were more around. I was with a girl at one point and she was talking and I saw a red dot appear in one of her eyes (which were brown). I said 'you're turning' and she was like 'ok' and I stabbed her in the head. Then I killed someone in this big empty room which had windows all around it. Jacob (Lost) was not happy and I could hear him speaking, but I couldn't see him. I had a pair of scissors and was holding the pointy bit towards myself, and I turned it around. Jacob kept bringing the guy back to life. He kept calling Jacob 'Mark Pellegrino'. Jacob appeared and his face was close to mine and I thought 'actually, he's kind of hot'. When I sliced the guy's neck, he 'evaporated'. Then I was with some people at a shop. Adam Baldwin was there. We were staying there. We had this wood pole like a broom which we used to kill the zombies. I also had a toothpick. There was a walkway thing with layers which we used to catch zombies (there were two near there). I was at the top and there were fish ponds and stuff where we stayed. I heard a door open and a bell noise. It was just people, but they attracted the zombies. They also had a thing to test for zombies and we asked for some. We had a scientist with us who had done some type of physics. I was looking for a weapon and couldn't find anything. I said to Adam ""I like 'em sharp and pointy"". I found a rotting wood handle, but it was useless. The zombies came and three women with leather jackets and machine guns. We waited until they were close enough and got one each. My weapon didn't go all the way through, and Adam finished her off and we took the guns. I asked ""Anyone know how to use these?"" and someone said ""No, we'll just work it out"". All these people drove out and I said 'we need a car'. Also, there was a photo of Zachary Levi when he was young and he looked weird."
"3400"	"(2010-04-29 (19)) Ezra and I were at an arena. There was a sports announcer guy. It was a movie though? The visiting team looked like they were going to win and I had bet $80 on the home team and I said to Ezra ""I know home's going to win, the movie has to have a happy ending"". The announcer ended up dying before finding out and everyone called it a tragedy. I was sick somewhere. Mom picked me up. I kind of didn't want to leave. She got me and said ""I know you're not pretending"". There was also a TV show and Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin and Alan Tudyk, who I referred to as just Alan."
"3401"	"(2010-04-29 (19)) Ezra wanted to buy tickets for something. He thought it was a movie, but he got them for a reenactment. I agreed to go and got tickets. I thought it was going to use real actors. There was a huge queue but we had like the 9th and 10th tickets to we got in first. It was a small room. There was bedroom stuff to the side and a big TV which was going to play the original movie. I said to Ezra 'I can't be bothered, I'm leaving. See ya!' and ran out, yelling ""Ma!"" and told her to wait. It was night and we walked back to the car. I said ""I can't believe I bought a ticket. I wasted $10"". We got to the car and started to drive off. We saw a girl only wearing a tight black vest with her boobs showing a little. It was gross. Life is a Highway came on the radio. I complained saying that I'd rather be [somewhere I can't read] than see this movie. A girl in the queue nearby said ""I don't want to listen to this bullshit"". I wondered if she meant me or the music."
"3402"	"(2010-04-30 (19)) I was at Dad's, which was different. I was going to watch Firefly or something. Then I was at home, which was also different, with Ezra. The X-Files was on TV. Adam Baldwin was in it, though he was young and it was only season 2. I think he was a bad guy. There was also something about Beckman (Chuck) and a crazy dog."
"3403"	"(2010-04-30 (19)) Ezra and someone who I think was Madelyn, were doing a cooking job. Mom took them there and I made sure they got in. They said they finished at 8.30-9.30. I left. There were no cars. I had some 'fake' lights and I was walking along the road and they weren't very bright. A car came up behind me, but got on the other side of the road instead. Another guy did it too, but then it was Madelyn and she said they both left early because of ""one with ADH and one with TDD"" which were illnesses with different reactions to the sun. I called Mom and said we were just past ""Brookland, the school"". She thought I meant somewhere else but finally understood. Then I was hiding out in a building with Adam Baldwin and others. I wandered outside and a guy was like ""I'm on fire!"" and someone tried to help and I pulled them back. There were flames behind him, like a mob. He was then ok and ran. Then he stopped and went back. I ran out to get this guy and a flame had followed him. I hid behind a tree and it killed him. Then it showed from the flames point of view and it could sense body heat and it started coming after me and then saw 'Jayne Cobb, cunning' and it went after him instead. Eventually it went away. We also tried to escape from a building and we had to break down doors. This guy was hiding somewhere and we risked it and went in, but he came at me and we attacked him. There was a photo of Adam Baldwin when he was young and it said ""Chariate Chassiel"" and he had some instrument. He was holding this square thing and had a ring on his middle finger. I asked him who the hell Chassiel was. There was a picture of a girl and she was 'Senator' (she was a celebrity now). I turned the photo around and Dad was there. I said, about the picture of Adam Baldwin, ""I'd rather see him peeing in a bowl, naked"". There was a fat naked guy and a young toddler. Adam said ""that's my father, Moby Dick""."
"3404"	"(2010-04-30 (19)) I was on a mountain. The sea was below. I went down a bit to look for rocks as there were some grey rocks which had something useful in them, which was why we were there. They were loose and I couldn't get back up. Someone grabbed my hand and helped me up. Adam Baldwin was also down there with me (he was new) and I grabbed his hand and pulled him up, which was easy because he helped too. Someone said ""shark"" and I looked at the sea, but saw nothing. But they meant dragon and we got rid of it. There was a little 'cave' which two purple dragons. I had to get their attention and put a blanket over this fire and I had to do this for ""77 minutes""."
"3405"	"(2010-05-01 (19)) I was driving and I went to Morley shops. I parked in the underground carpark and went to a computer room. There was a computer free next to Eugene. He was playing Warcraft. I tried to load up World of Warcraft, but after 15 minutes it still hadn't loaded. I went to leave. I couldn't remember how to get back to the carpark. There was a mini emergency room. A guy was then with me and we were trying to find this other carpark."
"3406"	"(2010-05-01 (19)) I upset the Visitors (V) somehow. For a 'fair' fight, we were each allowed a number of people to send underwater and they had to kill as many others as they could in 10 seconds. They had 130 and we had 110. Anna (V) was like 'It starts now'. I quickly went under. There was random stuff in the water too, like tuna tins and stuff. We paired up and I had just got a new fish and I fed it. I hit 'Iron Man' and I said ""I didn't mean to kill Iron Man!"". Mario and Luigi were down there too."
"3407"	"(2010-05-01 (19)) I was at Midvale shops. A big pet shop had opened up where the bakery is (it went out to where the bottle shop is). It hadn't opened yet. There were lots of shelves and exhibit things with some puppies in them. There was a lady there and I was going to ask about a job but then she was talking to a group of kids saying that once a week, she got kids in to feed and care for the animals. She also did this weird thing where she would dance at the front of the store and kids had to march stuff up to her. It was really lame. I started to walk home, but then I was walking down a path next to a forest (but it was up higher, so I couldn't see it). I heard people talking and there was a guy with a little machine. Little bits of rock came up in the air. I screamed and covered myself. Then I kept going. There was a big obstacle area. There was door which had barbs all over it and I climbed around it and beat some guards up. Then a guy was with me, helping. He said ""They reckon $40 a week for this?"" -- it had continued on from the last dream and they had kept some V's for studying. We broke into the place they were keeping them. We let them out and there were some we knew. There was a small box with a metal thing in it, which was a 'brain' of this girl we were friends with. I got upset when I saw it. There was a copy of her outside, but without her memory, or something was wrong with her, so we couldn't put her brain back. One of the people we let out was a black guy, who was human, and thought the V's were good guys."
"3408"	"(2010-05-02 (19)) Ezra was watching TV. They were doing weird match ups. The match-up at the moment was The Doors and The Strawbs and Part of the Union was playing. They also did The Beatles and The Smiths. There was an interview with the cast of Arrested Development. Will Arnett had a whistle (the chipped tooth had happened in real life)."
"3409"	"(2010-05-03 (19)) I was undercover. I was a cop, and I was pretending to be an undercover prostitute to try and get a job with some bad guys. One of them was actually good and he was Tobias (Arrested Development). I told him to act like he thought I was a cop. Then I was in a hotel room and I was sharing with a girl. She put on some nail polish and I said it was gross. It was a dark, but bright, pink. I was telling her about my job as a prostitute. Then it showed the bad guys talking and Tobias was telling them I was a cop. They discovered I was a prostitute and they offered me a job in their operation. Then I was watching Arrested Development and Lindsay looked like she was covering up because she was naked but Tobias had called for help because they were both naked. She moved and covered herself on the floor? She said ""one fell"" and Tobias said ""I told you to tell me if I fell"". Her boob was hanging out and was blurred. I walked to a big building which was huge and empty and like a school gym. People were there and we were told to gather. As I was walking in, someone said ""Did anyone have sex with Duran Duran before they split up?"". We all sat down and there was a video of all of us saying funny quotes. A girl was in a toilet and her friend said 'We're going to be late and Chris Potter is cute' and she was shocked at this? Some guys, one of them was Samm Levine, went into a toilet. There were some chemicals -- some worm things? They were on me and made me itch, so I was flicking them off and it was annoying. My quote clip was from outtakes of Castle. Kate was at a pub or something with a black woman. She said her line muddled and Kate teased like ""Who I be phone?"" and laughed, no-one in the room made a sound. I was thinking that I didn't even say that often. There was a new movie and it started with this teenage guy in a car. It was wet and the car was covered in bits of ear and blood. The guy had blood on him too. He woke up and was trying to remember what happened. There was a flashback -- it was 'underwater' and this girl asked ""what's your name"", and I said ""Izzy"". She said ""there's a shark to your 'shaft'"". We turned and I swam and the shark ate her and kept going. Then there were octopuses that had been after him. They were saying that because of the flashbacks, it was more likely to believe the situation because we knew he had survived."
"3410"	"(2010-05-03 (19)) I was at a house. I had to get to a little octopus to inject it to stop it transforming. I got it outside and hid it behind a mattress. I got someone to get someone to help. They came back with a needle and I injected it. Then the octopus was a girl and she started having a fit and was turning into something dangerous, so Ezra and I ran inside and locked ourselves in a bedroom. I saw a cat under the door. It left, then Ezra called it back. I was annoyed at him for doing this, but it left again. The girl cried that the cat jumped off the fence and said it was ok explaining that cats had 'help'; she demonstrated on hands and knees saying it was like that, but on a pillow and she was ok. Later we had dinner and everyone had a good sized meal, but mine had a few thin slices of carrot and yellowish meat. The lady said it was ""grilled banana"" and I said 'what the hell, I'm not eating this'. I said ""I'll go myself"", then went for a drive with Mom and Ezra. She was driving fast and there was a bend around a cliff without a rail. Then it was a race. I can't read much of this, but at the end we were on a mountain and had to go through these rings? Ezra got no armour? People were staring at a church thing. Willem Defoe was a lawyer and some girl liked him."
"3411"	"(2010-05-04 (19)) I was at a place at university. I was doing math work, but for a part of it you had to smoke marijuana stuff. It was actually incenses burning in the middle of this round table thing and you had to inhale the smoke. We talked about random stuff and dreams. I typed 'hot guys' in somewhere but I accidentally hit all the wrong keys, so it was all the letters next to them, except it started with 'O'. Someone was possessed? Someone said to me 'I know you want kids' and I replied 'No I don't'. There was some movie where Jim Carrey was in this girl's head."
"3412"	"(2010-05-04 (19)) I was watching something. Will Arnett and Adam Sandler were in it. Will put a banana and other stuff on his windscreen so Adam did it back and they laughed. There was a joke about him and someone in a coffee shop. Taub (House) was there and asked ""you have a coffee shop in Portugal?"". I was in a queue at 'school' to get tickets to this prom thing. Calvin was in front of me and I had promised to tell him who I liked and I said ""It's Eugene!"" and he was like 'oh my god!'. Eugene was further along in the line. There was a video of funny stuff. There was this thing, where we had spent ages putting soap all over a windscreen. Soap sprayed from the roof. Then water came and rinsed it off. I was thinking 'Now Mom will have to straighten my hair again. Sucks to be her'. Before that they had been saying certain people liked each other. They said this girl called Natalie wanted to kiss Dmitri, who was in front of Calvin in the line. He ducked behind the guy in front of him. Someone asked if he was 'not having any trouble in that department' and the guy in front said he liked some girl who [something I didn't catch] and went to Westland University, and it turned out to be me. They had said it insultingly and I gave him a 2 finger salute to his back. Eugene told his friends who he liked and I think it was me. I went in to the shop finally and got some pyjamas etc. I said ""I might not be allowed in because I'm wearing shorts"". Ramona was there and she put this Hawaiian costume on. I got a big Hawaiian shirt that went past my shorts. Then I was in a room and I saw some people on a computer taking photos off it and I grabbed the USB and thought to come back later. There was a line to get school work/marks. People all came out crying. I went in and Elijah and someone were all crying and told me why, but I can't read what I wrote. I hurt my nose and it made me cry too. The average mark was 88% for this year. I went to find a room. There was one computer. Outside there were lots of buildings. I went into a few but they had nothing. One small one had this gruff dude and a dog and it was a car servicing place. He shooed me away. I ran off and changed the setting and everything was underwater."
"3413"	"(2010-05-04 (19)) Some guy threatened to steal some lady's baby. They got the police over to the house and Zoe (Firefly) came for support. Her bedroom was dark and had a taser in the shape of a bottle which they used for light. Zoe came in and started to kiss her and they went onto the bed and rubbed against each other -- it was a distraction because the guy was under the bed."
"3414"	"(2010-05-05 (19)) Ezra and I were going to watch a movie on Foxtel. Michael Emerson was tied up in chains and Terry O'Quinn was standing behind him. Something was possessing them. I found it amusing that Ben and Locke from Lost were both in it. The picture was going weird because the cord was falling out. Then I, except I was now Dana Walsh (24) and it was from my past, was on a computer. I was inside it first and Cole (24) came and he needed some pictures. I had stuff that would give away the fact I was a bad guy, but I had to transfer them. I blew into the machine to clean it. There were a bunch of short films. One was about a plant guy. They said I had to describe it without using certain parts of him, basically all of him. I showed it to Mom and she didn't know how to do it either. A while later someone said 'maze' and I realized it was a maze."
"3415"	"(2010-05-05 (19)) I went to Ikea by myself. It closed at 5pm and I had left at around 4pm or sometime after. It took me ages to find parking, and I was looking over the bays and I didn't like them? It was 4.54pm and I ran to get there but the lady said it was closed. I was like 'damn it' and I text Mom saying 'closed damn it'. I got back to my car. The people parked next to me were close and I had to squeeze in. They came too. I reversed and they reversed too and I had to stop. Then no-one did anything and so I just went. A car was coming and I managed to get out of the way. Then Nana was walking with me to show me how to get out. Then I was at the other side of the carpark. I was talking with Mom too and it was night. There was a concrete block on the road and there was a bit to walk through. There were a bunch of cars and one backed up and faced towards us. I moved behind Mom and he drove past. She yelled at me for not going behind the concrete and I yelled at her and slapped her hand on the back. I walked through the back way and it was covered in hard 'wire'. Mom said someone was Jewish and I said ""is that a dance move?"". I was then back in the car and the police were next to my window. Mom drove out. I had two trays to drop off."
"3416"	"(2010-05-06 (19)) I went to the cinema to see Iron Man 2, but I didn't go. I was in some army training thing. A guy was out of breath and this guy came up to him and said that his brother did and he pushed himself too hard and he wasn't going to. The guy was a former boxer. He took him through the place, explaining all the obstacles (it was like a huge indoor obstacle course thing). For one of them, you climbed down a ladder and attack the enemy. He failed the first time, tried again later and failed again, but was finally able to do it. A few other people passed through and were put into the same group. The guy overseeing it was the principal guy from The Inbetweeners. Some guy and I got into a fight with someone. Another One Bites the Dust was playing over the loudspeakers. Then I left and Mom and Ezra were in the car. I said I didn't see the movie because I'd already seen it and I didn't want to waste time rewatching movies. I said I had a fight influenced by a song called Iron Man 2. There was a scene where Tony Stark was in a boxing ring with someone and stabbed them and yelled about his father. He also said ""it's me"" (admitting he was Iron Man). People complained about it and said it was Justin Theroux's fault. Then I had a lecture and it was as Youtube video about a principal guy and a leprechaun but it didn't work. He was well-known and he had been found out to have down leprechaun porn."
"3417"	"(2010-05-06 (19)) I was staying at a friend's house with some others (all guys). We went to this place where waterslides were being built; which were a long way down. The slide was in the middle of lots of water. We were dared to go on. The water was green and this guy got in the water. Then we all ended up in the water. We got out and walked back. I ran, being careful not to slip. Went to a toilet which was small and dried myself and went out. They were getting told off and his mother was cooking stirfry. I joked she was out of something and the broccoli was still frozen. She said I had to have a ham, cheese and tomato toasted sandwich."
"3418"	"(2010-05-07 (19)) I was working at this place and Ben (I'm Alan Partridge) was there. We were using a notebook to write down all the people that were here using the Dream Research coding. He put me down as 'e-' and the - meant he didn't like me. Someone also mentioned Darth Vader so we put him down. I asked if I could click through and he reluctantly gave it to me so I said I wanted to break it and said ""oops"" although I was joking. It started off neat and then got messy. I was at a desk with him helping. I went to the toilet but there was only one toilet. I went back and Ben and I were talking and laughing. There was a tutorial and the tutor was Alan Partridge (I'm Alan Partridge). He didn't finish all the questions. I was playing Hotel City on Facebook and all the photos were blurred. I had Jewel Staite on there, but her name was Jasmine, and I also had Morena Baccarin. There was a really small photo of me as a kid and I showed Ezra. There was another photo where one person wasn't looking at the camera, another person chucking a sad, then another person looking away etc. Then I had a house. Out the back a bit, there was another house. It was windy and it started snowing and raining. Ezra lived there too. Mom was over. I went to close the windows in Ezra's room. I went into another room and Michael Cera was sitting on the floor reading and I screamed in shock. Mom said 'that was weird'. I said ""what are you doing here?"" and he said ""what are you doing here?"" and I said ""I live here"" and started cracking a smile. I asked why he wasn't at school etc and he said that he hated it. He was then 18 and actually my son, or adopted or something. I said ""You're 18, if you don't like it-,"" and he said that they (job people) don't really like those wanting to act. I said that 'all you have to do is say you were in Arrested Development'. Someone else was there. He joked around for a bit and was wrestling on the bed, someone said ""and not stroking my back"". Then, Eugene was coming over to join us at this other house (a house better suited for the weather). Michael Cera said that I had a ""highschool crush on Eugene"" to Mom. Then Eugene arrived. He got out of car and I tried to avoid him. He was speaking to some weird people. Tobias (Arrested Development) was out the front too. Also, the character of George-Michael in Arrested Development was also in another show, in a similar role and was also called Michael. Then it was a movie and an old lady was like ""he insisted that we sleep in separate beds""."
"3419"	"(2010-05-07 (19)) I got two packages in the mail. One was a Brownshirt shirt except it had a picture on the front of some character in cartoon form. It said XL, but had 4XL underneath. It fit like an XL though. There was a tiny Jayne (Firefly) face in the background, and Mal was at the front. Was going to complain about it and show it to Mom."
"3420"	"(2010-05-08 (19)) There were some lost kittens. One came back, but people were trashing the owner's house looking for something. I was a spy, but in a similar position to Chuck (Chuck). I was with Chuck, Sarah and Casey in a shop. There were milk bottles in the freezer. They were all 5-6 years old. There were also water bottles. We load them onto this 'plate' on wheels, which was slow. This foreign guy who worked there yelled at us. I went to push the thing to the back of the store and I passed an aisle where the bad guy was. I went back and told Sarah. The bad guy came and they fought, but then they realized he was actually 'good' and the milk cartons had people in them? We all climbed up into the aircon vents. Sarah was like 'I didn't know they were still here'. The next season of Chuck was going to have him based at one place in another country. Then Casey and I were in a room (still at the shop) and we'd been attacked by the bad guys. I saw that Sarah was there too and we were all lying on the floor. I had been drugged and could barely move. My head was under a table, squished against the floor, but then I could move and was just faking. Casey was going along with them. Then he pushed a piece of paper towards my mouth. I slowly reached for it. Then he secretly handed me another one saying 'I'd like to help'. I gave him a thumbs up and he handed me another. The last one had detailed instructions. It said that when he came over again, run out and go to 'Stage 2'. Then when he arrived there, go to Stage 3, etc. He got some of the other people to leave and came over and I mouthed 'now?' and he motioned for me to go and I ran. He told the others to not worry about me. I snuck around the shop and couldn't find stairs, so I went through a door. It led to the toilets and there was an emergency window up high. I went out and ran past the room I was just in. Casey was still in there and saw me through the window. He mouthed 'what?' and looked sort of angry. I asked where stage 2 was and he pointed to a building outside. I went through the door behind me and ran over. The inside was like a cinema, with seats and rows of people. A lady was checking IDs which were actually some thing from fish and chip shops with red lights. One was on the floor, so I took it. Someone saw me though and mentioned it to the lady, so I quickly walked out instead of going upstairs and waiting. She followed, so I ran out to the bushes far away and they were purple. She went back in and I ran back, but into the third building. The lady saw me and yelled out to me. I ran down. She accused me of lying and I asked her what her brother did -- assuming he did something that made her choose this line of work. She scanned the ID thing and it went red, meaning rejection. I did it again and it was positive. She didn't know what to do. Casey came and he had a thick silver metal ring on the middle finger of his left hand and one on the ring finger of his right hand. He came over and we walked out. There was a busy road nearby which had three lanes going each way and a roundabout. A bunch of young kids (around 12 years old) were there. One was running across the road. The cars almost crashed and one almost came straight at me. I flinched, but it stopped in time. We tried to cross again and walked to a car. I saw Eugene's car and Eugene's father Abraham was in it and was driving over to the other side. I was thinking it was weird that he was there. I got into our car and got ready to drive off with Casey. An ostrich with 4 legs right at the back of it and it was on wheels and could bend weirdly."
"3421"	"(2010-05-09 (19)) I playfully kicked Dad in the butt and he said ow and grabbed it. Then he said that he thought something went up there and I was like 'what the hell could've gone up there?'. He put his hands down his pants to check and it had been his balls. There was a female doctor and she said that a hair straightener nearby was for ""bum hairs"". There was a girl with a boyfriend called Chris but he liked the doctor. The boyfriend was lying on a lounge and she laid on top of him and said ""I love you"" and the doctor was in the room too and said ""Who? Oh, you're talking to your boyfriend"". Later, Seamus posted some fail pic on Facebook and someone said ""dat comment""."
"3422"	"(2010-05-09 (19)) I was at home on my computer. I was trying to access results of some test. I couldn't remember the password. Calvin came over. I was in the dining room and I saw him go into my room with some other guy. I went down there and my desk was a mess. He was sitting on my bed and the other guy was standing next to my bedside table. My desktop was different -- all new icons and the resolution was like 640x480. I went to change it, but the guy started opening my drawer and I quickly slammed it shut and said it was my underwear drawer, but I had a bright pink vibrator on top of my undies. He didn't say anything but was hinting at it. He said ""take a picture of my bum"" and I said ""take a picture of your... balls"" [in a 'yo mama' type of way] . I was thinking that I needed to stop saying balls so often. I finally got to the results and I had gotten 5.5/10. I was confused and disappointed about it. Some stupid girl had gotten a higher result. I was watching an Arrested Development video, but I only remember seeing Buster."
"3423"	"(2010-05-10 (19)) I was in the army? We were at a shop. We all had to hand in DNA samples because they were going to randomize it and make babies. One person was black and another was Michael C. Hall. I was watching some show with Morena Baccarin. In season one, she had dark, golden skin and had a baby at the end. The baby was like 8 years old in season 2."
"3424"	"(2010-05-10 (19)) I downloaded some program for university which could download information into your brain. I picked something for ANS about geese and Afrikaans -- I saw images and subtitles. Mom didn't believe me when I told her about it. Then I was at university, which was different. I went to the toilet and passed Samantha on the way. There were two open cubicles. I went into one of them and it said you could only be in there for a maximum of 2 minutes. There was a girl in another one. I finished before her and then she came out and asked if there was anyone outside. She said her mother or grandma had died and everyone was bothering her about it. There was a big TV somewhere and people were playing a game. There was a computer room nearby which had a TV for people to play Guitar Hero."
"3425"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) I time travelled or something (it involved alternate realities and stuff). Ted Bundy was famous in a good way, although he had still killed. I was watching an interview with Will Arnett -- who was sometimes someone else -- and he had a young girlfriend once and there was a quote ""I want to fuck her so bad"". There was another video and Amy Poehler showed up at some event of his and he joked ""not you"". She was wearing a ballerina/fairy outfit with wings and had a wand (it was a reference to something). She went out in front of an audience and danced. Ted Bundy also had a girlfriend that he was going to marry. They were walking back to their house and something weird was happening. She ran into the house and he ran in after her. Then there was a gun shot and Jack (Lost) and I ran in. She got shot and Jack was angry and cried at Ted, ""You did this!"" and Ted was upset and said ""No, I didn't. I love her,"" etc. I believed him. I think she died and they argued and then Jack and Ted left. I sat with her and it was pitch black. Then I heard someone move and say ""don't look"". I shut my eyes and I saw shadows as they left. I was really scared. I was trying to explain to people later that it wasn't Ted and that I'd seen the guy who'd done it but they wouldn't listen. Then I woke up [within the dream] and I was still scared and my heart was beating fast. I went out and Mom was on her computer and Darren was at the TV. I went to Mom and said I'd had a nightmare. Then Darren said he'd gone on my computer to print something out and that he'd found interesting dreams on there and had printed out copies. Ezra came out and they teased me about some dream, but I didn't know what dream it was. I went back to my room and I heard Ezra reading it out -- it mentioned Locke (Lost). I didn't recognize the dream. Cuddles was rolling around."
"3426"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) I was watching Castle. Castle and Beckett were in a sports car. Beckett was like ""nice brand"" (?) and Castle asked ""what?"" and she said ""this"" and started the car (it was a US car and she was in the passenger seat). He smiled and then she drove off and he was standing outside."
"3427"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) There was an alien girl, possibly two. One was in a lesbian relationship with a human and she took her back to her planet. I was annoyed they never took me."
"3428"	"(2010-05-11 (19)) I was at Mom's, which was different and further away. Dad picked me and Ezra up to go back to his place. He still lived at the old house. Ezra and I ended up walking down Princess Road at night. There were some people far behind us and we started running/walking fast. Then Roland was with us too. We stopped at Midvale shops and there were two new stores. One had huge muffins and pies. We were then with Dad again and he had bought scratchies and a small amount of food. We were walking down the road and the people came up behind us. A girl stepped out and we stopped. It was Tonya. She was really skimpy looking and started talking about some sex site and then said 'thank you' and walked around to another street. I said I used to be friends with her. We caught up to her and Dad gave her something he'd gotten at the shop. She thanked him and kissed him. We continued walking and accidentally walked through the gates to some fancy estate. We decided to walk through. A lady asked us what our names were. Dad said ""er.. Conell,"" and she said ""Oh, can you go over there?"" We went over, but it was creepy and they started singing, so we left with keys. There was a steep hill and we had to pull ourselves up. I took my phone out to take a photo. There was a campfire with a wolf. Roland, Ezra and some kid were screaming and had a fight with sticks. I picked up a stick to use as a walking stick and the kid said 'no, that's mine', so I picked up another one and he claimed that one too. He suggested I take this huge one with branches and I asked how I was supposed to walk with that. He started arguing, so I hit him with my stick. I grabbed him and pushed him to the ground. I had this star-shaped cutting thing and I cut the log and tried to get him. I got up and said that I was going and that ""You can't claim the environment, so gtfo!"" I kept walking and looked back and he said ""her butt's so fat, I can still see it"" and I yelled back ""your face is so ugly, I'm still bleeding"". He didn't hear. There was a lake and I had to jump over. There was a 'fat' kid nearby. He said something and I joked back. He was saying that Silas was what girl's wanted and I said no. He said he was a bad jumper and I said that I was too. Somehow I made it over, but he landed in the water and said he was scared of the ducks. I said I was going to go watch movies and he asked to come too and I said no."
"3429"	"(2010-05-12 (19)) I was well-known? I wrote on some forum saying ""Jeffrey Dean Morgan is hot"". Some replied, agreeing. I had an assignment due for university. Buster (Arrested Development) was in a van. At the back of the van, something said ""if you take me to prom, I'll marry you"" and it was from 1991. He had this frog with him and he had made him twitchy, so he was always flapping his arms around and stuff. Someone said that George (Arrested Development) was ""probably your father"" and I thought it was weird because he used to be Jeffrey Dean Morgan (not really sure what this meant). I convinced Buster that a visit to the top of this mountain could help the frog. I also had to go there for some project I was doing with Elijah, as well as some Korean restaurant. Dad was coming too and he was driving on his own, and I was driving myself, but I ended up in front of him and I didn't know the way there. I found it and had to stop at the red light, but I couldn't stop in time and gently touched the 4WD in front of me. I parked and was trying to remember the way to get there. I was then with Mom, Gizmo, Cuddles and Amelia. Amelia smiled at me and I felt like threatening it or throwing it over the edge. It was now night. I put Cuddles and Gizmo in a bag and they went to sleep. I told Mom to look after them. Dad text about the mountain saying ""Elijah is pulling $40,""."
"3430"	"(2010-05-12 (19)) Mom and I were walking outside. I had a lot of money in my pocket as well as my debit card. There was a group of guys and they stopped us and told us to give them our money. I jumped over a wall and ran. There was a big building, like an empty shed that looked like a classroom inside. I had a fake subscription. I turned into a bird and I had to touch the tip of my tongue to my top lip to help keep the transformation. I thought it was similar to trying to get lucid."
"3431"	"(2010-05-12 (19)) I was in France or something. Some people I knew were staying at a place across the street from some hotel where Hugh Laurie lived. There were flashes (?) they didn't like and I went over to tell him. I knocked on the door and explained the issue and he said he'd fix it. Sometime later, I went back and his door was unlocked. I went in. The kitchen was at the far end and the TV was next to the door. He had two video players and one DVD player. There were lots of movies, mostly on VHS, and quite a bit of 80s/90s horror. I remember seeing Children of the Corn and Basketcase. I looked at his CDs too. He had two doors to his bedroom and the blankets on his bed were messy. I quickly went back to the front door to leave. He came in from the hall and I said I had just come over to remind you and he said he hadn't forgotten. There were lots of other celebrities in there too. Something happened and caused them all to cheat. He called me there and I went up and when I got into the room, he pressed me up against the door, locked it, and kissed me. Then it showed others bringing people in. Then I was in bed alone and I took a photo of the room and then left. There were tables outside and we all sat around. There was a video that looked real of me on this buggy thing. Jared Padalecki was on the seat behind me and Jensen Ackles was next to me. I was filming and joking around. Mom said Ezra wanted to move out. Dad was collecting something about people for something (pictures maybe, I can't remember). He had Wash (Firefly) and he said ""I liked Firefly and Serenity"". He also had Dominic Monaghan (although Dominic was spelt differently) and he said ""I like Lost and Lost"" and there were others. I laughed and only one had the actual name of the actor spelt correctly."
"3432"	"(2010-05-13 (19)) There was a new called Serenity (spin-off/sequel to Firefly). I downloaded the pilot and only Mal, Zoe and Kaylee were in it. There was a computer person called 'Woman'. It started off with them in a prison (or something) which they had bought. They were standing under it and it ended up collapsing. I was then there too. There was some animal chasing me. I jumped over a fence and it ran around it. Someone yelled at me to give it the fence. I did, but it tried to bite me still. I wondered what was going to happen to Castle since Nathan Fillion was in this new show and I hoped that Adam Baldwin would make an appearance. It was written and created by someone called Jelly Bean. I said aloud ""the guy who does Dexter... oh, girl."""
"3433"	"(2010-05-13 (19)) I was at a party. Inside there was a big section of water and a few square blocks floating around to rest on. There were fish in the water. I accidentally went underwater and saw what looked like a hammerhead shark and I told some people near me about it and we moved to the edge. A crocodile ate someone. Everyone started rushing to get out. There were no doors. Supposedly there was a portal thing -- a guy ate someone's head to open it, but nothing happened. The crocodile came and got him. I tried smashing a window but it didn't break. We managed to open it and then I ripped off the hinges and the flywire and we crawled out. There were cars in the driveway (and the house looked really old). There were two motorbikes and a fancy black car. Jewel Staite was then with me and she grabbed some keys from inside and gave me the one for the car. The crocodile poked its head out the door. I remembered that my phone and keys were inside and wanted to get them. It started coming toward me and the passenger door wasn't closed, so I quickly closed it. I couldn't get the key in, but the car still came on. I drove off, but it was really slow. I tried to hit the crocodile but it kept dodging it. I waited at the top of a road and a car came and then I kept going. A guy was trying to get out of his driveway and honked. I yelled out ""I didn't see you, sorry!"". There was a woman in front of me driving slowly, so I overtook her. Then it was a movie/show. A kid drove to an oval and there were triplets, two of which were called Claude and Clyde. One of them was stupid. The kid told them to get in the car. The crocodile was circling them. A pedophile guy smiled at it."
"3434"	"(2010-05-14 (19)) I was watching Lost. I overheard Locke being told to kill everyone, except for himself and River (Firefly), though sometimes she was Kate. Later, Jack had to go talk to some people in this cabin thing. Charlie, Kate and I were outside. They asked Jack if anyone was with him and he said yes and that it was a guy. They asked him to describe the guy and he realized he shouldn't say where everyone was and he said ""big"" -- he was talking about Locke. I realized what he was doing and I got Kate and Charlie to go around the other side. There was a mirror and I saw them peek out. Charlie wondered what was going on and I whispered that Locke was told to kill everyone but himself and Kate and Charlie was upset and confused because he was close with Locke. Then Charlie and I were outside a building and there was a school nearby. An Asian lady came over and was speaking in an Asian language, then English and gave us a workbook. She took us to the teachers lounge or something. There was a TV and some spoof movie was playing. The food there looked very greasy and fattening. Someone asked who Jason Bateman's ""twin"" was and I said 'Justine', but that I didn't think they were twins and that she was older. I looked it up and he was born in 1963 and she was born in 1964 and I said 'yep, she's older', then I realized my mistake, but I didn't correct it."
"3435"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) I was watching Supernatural. Sam was possessed by Satan. I had been friends with him and Dean in the past. Then I was at university and Ezra, Sam and I went there to do some course. Sometimes Ezra was Calvin. There was a test that had to be done in pairs. Ezra said you could put 'llama' down and then he said ""but I'm going with Sam"". I asked 'isn't Sam failing? How is he doing? I haven't seen him in 3 years."" He was actually getting 90.3%. There was a computer assignment and the teacher asked where some guy was. I told her. Everyone thought I was a dobber and were annoyed at me. I told the teacher later that I had a tomato patch in my room ""at my Mom's. It used to be my old house"". She wanted to discuss how to grow them and I said I hadn't done it for 4 years. Mom gave Rover to this lady for some reason. We were letting her meet him. She seemed to like him, but if he did something naughty, she would look angry. We were outside in her yard and the grass was soft. Rover ran behind the shed and she went and got him. I went with Mom somewhere and got a text. One was from Jeffrey Donovan, saying ""not again"". I checked my sent messages and I'd accidentally sent him and Sam a blank text. It cost $10.30 altogether. I said I had to get a new phone. Then there was a court trial and a young kid was possessed so they could use him as a witness against his family. Buster (Arrested Development) had been 'blown up' and we had to deflate him before he could get in. They took off his wrist monitor and then he ran off. Jewel Staite was getting photos with people. She kissed some guy and they played a 'game' with him like 'guess the celeb'."
"3436"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) Ezra was cleaning my room. Mom and Darren were in there too. They were emptying bags to use as rubbish bags and I told them to stop. Ezra was making them neat though. Ezra was like 'we can do what we want with this stuff'."
"3437"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) I was friends with Sam and Dean (Supernatural). We went to this community to check it out. There was weird stuff happening to people. There was only like one girl there, but she got trapped. I was interested in Sam, but I wanted to like Dean and be with him. The girl there flirted with him. He disappeared. Then I couldn't find Sam. I called out ""Sam!"" and he replied and I found him in a building. I went in and it looked like a lounge room and was heavily decorated. The guy wasn't Sam and was actually the bad guy and said to me 'You're not going anywhere'. Then Sam came in through the door to help me, but then the door shut and locked. There was a thing with some water - you pulled it up to get the water, but something weird was in it so I left it. I was thirsty. Then it started getting hot and it was bright outside. I said to Sam that I thought it was all our worst nightmares. Two girls, young adults, were outside with beach outfits on. I asked them to open the door, but they couldn't. Then we managed to open it and we walked out. Then it was night. I freaked out and said 'now it's gonna be zombies!'. I saw some people up away from us, then heard a noise behind us and we ran. Zombies began chasing us. Sam had a small baseball bat and hit one. We ran to the group of people and were near a carpark. Molotov cocktails were lying on the ground, ready to go. Someone grabbed one and threw it; it exploded once and then finished off. Someone else went to throw one but it broke. Another exploded near a car. I was trying to get to a car. Then Dad was watching Burn Notice. Eugene was on a beach and called out and ran. He wasn't wearing pants, and we saw his butt. He then wrapped a towel around himself. There was a Russian guy there and he went up to him and said ""Boris?"". His bird was called Boris."
"3438"	"(2010-05-15 (19)) It was like Civilisation IV. I decided to build a city, except it was more like a cottage next to a road. Then Ezra and I were in a car there at night. I plugged a cord into a power point on a pole. We parked under the street light. I put the seat down and tried to sleep. Ezra heard a noise. There was a dark house behind us and there were bushes rustling. I turned the car on (it was a US car) and drove around and chased some guy. Then we were walking and Rover was with us. A lady from the house was near our car and let us in. Rover wandered out and I couldn't find Ezra. I went in and realized they were dodgy and ran. I picked up some thin sticks. We were together again and went back, but nothing was there. Eventually we realized we were trapped there. My tooth was wobbly and I pulled it out. There was a young cheerleader girl. A guy who looked like Michael Cera was also in the first season of Arrested Development and he wanted to lose his virginity. An older lady said she'd do it. Then a guy at some place took this girl into his room and told her to do something and she was allowed to wish for something. He had sex with two women and at the end cried out ""Oh shit! Fuck!"". The girl said she wished to see a movie tonight with something that I can't remember. She got us our car back? The cheerleader went back to school. They were from the olden days or something."
"3439"	"(2010-05-16 (19)) I was at a hospital. Simon and River (Firefly) were there. There was a black girl in a coma, there was a spike on the machine which was caused by a strong feeling - in this case, love. We realised it was because of her brother and we told her ""don't touch your brother or your father"". Simon was in another room and made up this thing for River to drink and it was twice the normal dose. He gave it to me and I went to find River. Then I was with this girl who could teleport. We went to a hotel lobby. I asked this lady if Boyd was staying there and someone said ""what about Lynn?"" and someone had a message. I told them that they were about to go out because the bad guys were coming. We saw them and teleported away. Then there were cops (or FBI) in an alley but they were dodgy. Then I was on an excursion somewhere far away. People started getting weird after a few days. The guy in charge said he didn't know the way to get back. A guy kept trying to attack me. I called Mom and asked her to pick us up -- there were 511 people. She asked how much it was going to cost. It had also cost $80 for the excursion. She said she would do it and I was thinking that I'd just take my friends and leave the rest of the people here."
"3440"	"(2010-05-17 (19)) I had 'created' a guy and he wanted to get married. Mom was teasing me about sex. He was a doctor?"
"3441"	"(2010-05-17 (19)) I was at an ice-cream shop with Mom and Ezra. I couldn't decide on what I wanted and I asked the lady if I could test this blue one. It was ok, but I decided to get cookies and cream. But Mom got it with this weird sauce and popcorn and I got angry and started to yell at her. Screech (Saved by the Bell) was around and someone mentioned Saved by the Bell and I said they probably haven't seen it. When I repeated it, I got an answer to something and Mom said ""are you going to tell Dustin?"". There was also an amusement park with this Miley Cyrus ride -- it was like those ones that have a seat that goes up and around and then down really fast. There was a ride near me with a duck in the far corner next to a fence. I was watching some behind the scenes Arrested Development stuff. Some guest star was excited about being in it. There was a blonde guy that looked like Beavis (Beavis & Butthead). There was a show and a teenage guy and day after day was different. Something about who you were in a movie? Hiro Nakamura (Heroes) chased a bad guy up these chairs. There was some other thing where David Duchovny had dated Gillian Anderson and had cheated on her with Tea Leoni. There was a re-enactment with all of them. Someone ran through a bush."
"3442"	"(2010-05-18 (19)) Mom had an email from some job thing at a call center. There were photos of people who worked there and it was nearby so I was looking at school photos to see if I could find Eugene. I found one with Rebekah, and Rodney was in it, so I took it. Ezra got a job at the Science Museum as security or something. I decided to apply for a job there too. Then it was morning and I was getting ready for university, but I was late. Dad and Ezra were there. I was eating breakfast and then put on a caterpillar costume and Ezra and I went with Nana and Rover to the Science Museum. While we were queuing up, Ezra pushed me. A guy said he would interview tomorrow and then I suddenly remembered I had to get to university."
"3443"	"(2010-05-20 (19)) I sent in a job application to this 'bank' which was actually an insurance company or something. I'd gotten the right 'score', but was rejected. I was driving and the light to turn was red, but I didn't stop in time and went out and then turned around and went back the other way. I was watching Fringe and it was focused on some guy and Olivia was in a sewer, hallucinating. I was at Nana's. I was going to stay the night and I had a lab on at university (it was 'today'). I hadn't asked if I could stay yet though. Mom was in the room with others and Rover. Rover had ripped apart my old Minnie Mouse cushion and there was fluff everywhere. I asked how it happened and she said she'd gotten it out for Amelia and I got angry and yelled that the stuff is mine and I don't want Fug using it and told her to gtfo. I started to cry and Mom was just like 'whatever' and said 'I'm going to bed now'. I heard Nana asking what happened. Mom asked if anyone else was staying and there was. Nana was worried that my alarm would wake him up. Tinkerbell and Tigger were in there and I gave them a pat. I unpacked my stuff and then changed my mind. I called out to Mom to tell her I wanted to leave. There was a poker game on the TV with Will Arnett, David Cross, Matthew Fox, Morena Baccarin and I thought a guy was Chris Potter, but then I said ""oh no, that's [someone else] "". Mom was ready to leave though and then I was annoyed I'd miss the game. Outside there was a shop carpark. I realized I'd forgotten my bag and I saw George (Arrested Development) and said that I'd left my bag inside. He was with a girl. I went in and then was like 'hang on' and saw a guy with a black afro wig on and it was actually Oscar Bluth. George hid. He was actually my granddad? Nana was in the kitchen gossiping with a girl. There was some chicken in the sink to soak in some juice? I left again and there was a Pizza Hut outside. Asians liked to sit at the tables. I said I didn't want pizza and that I wanted Chicken Treat (which was nearby). I also had no pants on."
"3444"	"(2010-05-20 (19)) I was at a shop and said that Firefly was awesome. Some guy agreed. I said there were no words to describe how awesome it is. There was something else that Alan Tudyk was in too."
"3445"	"(2010-05-21 (19)) I was doing some chemistry online. People were discussing flashcards and some were doing it on the computer and others doing it 'the long way'. I was then with Jared Padalecki and we, and some others, had to go on a flight because I had to deliver something for Nathan Fillion. The flight would take all day and we had to go to two different US states, but it was different and they were like different countries, but all together. On the way there, Jared and I were talking to someone foreign and there were subtitles. I got someone's subtitles confused with his and he got hit by a car. I apologized and his eyes went black and I realized he was a demon. I got away and grabbed Jared and said ""he's a demon"". I also clearly remember calling out ""Jared!"" at some point. Then we were near an outdoor eating place. Demons came and we hid in the bushes and Jared fought them. One came up from behind and stabbed me. Jared got angry and upset and killed them all in a rage. Then, I was watching Lost. Some others and I broke into a school. We hid in a room to hide from demons. Heaps of us were sitting around the wall. Then a few guys and girls and I broke into another place to escape. Sawyer (Lost) was there too to escape the island. There were some people there and I think we killed them. There was a big guy and one of us went to him and the big guy shot him. They took us to a room. A lady said that certain people had to go somewhere and she said she'd seen something and that ""There was a blade"". I had been hiding and I stood up and she was above this girl with sores on her feet. She was wearing open shoes (toes were covered, but that other bit was showing). Then she called me out to go with Jacob (Lost). I was annoyed by it. He was sitting with others on a high table. I went to climb up and they put a pineapple in the way and I was like 'how am I supposed to get up?' and then he was the actor and said sorry. Jacob was actually evil as well."
"3446"	"(2010-05-21 (19)) I was in a car with Dad. Someone chased us. Then we went to this place for the finale of Lost. We had to go underwater and there was a cave thing with steps and a big screen. I sat down but realized I'd forgotten my bag. I went out and got it as Ezra came in. It went for 2.5 hours. Jack (Lost) was speaking to a webcam and making faces."
"3447"	"(2010-05-22 (19)) I was watching Lost. Jacob was actually a bad guy and then it was like a game. I had to drop people off a ship to move it (like World of Warcraft) and get to a part of the island."
"3448"	"(2010-05-22 (19)) Mom, Rover and I were out the front. She wanted another dog and she asked me what breed I thought would be a good second dog."
"3449"	"(2010-05-24 (19)) It was the first day of semester 2. I had two labs. Mom drove me there and I realized I'd forgotten my lab coat and glasses. I asked Mom for some money and $20 for this math answer book thing. I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Yang had 'showed emotion' when George died. Izzy had long hair and then said she was grateful for it. Someone wanted Bailey to announce something. There were new credits which showed the person's name and then their role (eg, director, producer). Ron Glass as 'Book' was listed."
"3450"	"(2010-05-24 (19)) I was at Nana's. I was going to watch some TV. There were two guys outside who I hadn't seen before and I told Ezra about them. Nana said they were cool. Some time later we realized there were some dodgy people out there. I locked the doors and hid inside, but we weren't fully closed off (blinds were open etc). I hid in the spare room. I ended up having to leave later and went to Nana's room. Two guys attacked me and it looked like they had yellow eyes (sorta zombie like), but it was disguised. I realized one was in the bathroom. There was something involving the door handle. He had something fake and it went and told his master? I was then in a room with some machine with poles. I held on and it went to a different universe. There was a guy there in some water and I told him to stay."
"3451"	"(2010-05-25 (19)) I was watching Lost. I was with someone out the back of an old house. Ben was an alien or something and someone said he was hot. Someone could do a weird thing with their eyes. Sam (Supernatural) was with Daryl. She was angry at him and he wouldn't go with us because he wanted to wait. Jack said someone was coming. We were in a shed and someone used an ability to 'hide' us. A girl came in and said she couldn't see anyone. Jack said we couldn't go yet. We needed to find a way to time travel and choose a different option so nothing on the island ever happened. Then it turned into Supernatural. Sam and Dean needed to try and get close to Driveshaft during a performance and play the guitar. Neither of them knew how to play, but had memories that could activate it. Dean said 'for me to concentrate, you can't be looking at me like that and can you put some pants on'. Then Sam was working in a car in a garage."
"3452"	"(2010-05-25 (19)) I was at home. I was going to go over to dads and he picked me up. I heard him and Ezra talking outside and he asked him something to which he replied 'yeah', but he was lying. I went out and said I wanted to come."
"3453"	"(2010-05-25 (19)) I went to some guy's place and I went to play Terms of Endearment, but it wasn't actually the film. Jack Nicholson was in it though. Mom watched it too and said it was lame. Then I was in a place and a well-known guy had had a heart attack or something. His family turned up. Then there was a party. They got me to guard the door. Later, there were some big flashlights. I told a lady to get rid of all the non-family guests. I wrote a news report on his death. I heard from a friend that they fired me and they wanted details for the story and I said I couldn't do it. Later, Mom, Ezra and I went to a petrol station. We locked our doors. Mom came back and opened her door and said 'this is a very dangerous neighbourhood', then a dude with a gun ran around to Ezra's side and showed it to Mom. We closed the door and put the car into reverse and I was terrified. Then I woke up and I was still scared."
"3454"	"(2010-05-29 (19)) I took an elevator down. Freaks and Geeks was on a TV. Jason Segel was standing next to me. We joked about my favourite character being Nick. Then I was at some place at night. I was with Neil Patrick Harris and Mom. I saw three guys with what looked like guns. I told Neil and said to run. We ran around some bushes and some of the guys came to cut us off. I heard Mom yell out from there."
"3455"	"(2010-05-31 (19)) I was friends with the characters in How I Met Your Mother. For a long time, Marshall and I would end up making out but stopping before it got too far because of Lily. We were making out in bed and it was very passionate and tongue-y. Then we stopped. There was a mention at some point about a possible threesome. I was then in a car with Mom and others. An ambulance went by with flashing lights and a siren and it did a big turnaround. We turned down a street and there were some guys on the side of the road. There were lists of top 5 games for each game company. GTA IV was on one and another was some 'maternal paternal' game. I was trying to find it online to see what it was about."
"3456"	"(2010-05-31 (19)) I was at a pet shop with Mom. There were kittens and there was an orange one (a girl) who looked like Spaceman in a basket with others and it rubbed its chin against the edge of the basket. I was thinking we could breed them, but they were both fixed. The girl at the counter said something to put us down (like, that they were easy to breed), and that she had cows. We were at a beach later and there was a guy in the water with a big cow. A lady was there with her creepy son. I think he may have been retarded as well. As I got out of the car I said ""I just don't think dead people care what we wear to a funeral"". We got a new house, which was almost the same as the old one but slightly different. Darren and Mom were there. I had no pants on. I asked Darren where the toilet was and he didn't know. A lady made a peanut butter sandwich and then threw it in the bin as I made one. Then she cooked muffins on the stove. Later, I was with Jason Segel, though I think he was Nick (Freaks and Geeks) and he was at a school. We were walking outside and walked around the back of a building and he kissed me against the wall and I fainted? I was thinking that this had happened to Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks) in an episode once."
"3457"	"(2010-06-01 (19)) I was studying somewhere. My chemistry exam was in a few hours, and my math exam afterwards. I was talking to Mom and she was going up that way and could take me there and then back home, but then the exam was now. She finally came with Ezra. Dad came too. Mom decided to let Dad do whatever it was she was down there to do. There was a bridge over some water and there was some traffic backed up. It started to rain and it was dark from the clouds. She drove slowly and I was worried I was going to be late. I started up making up some notes for the math exam in the car."
"3458"	"(2010-06-01 (19)) I was at Nana's in the kitchen. I was going to play Monopoly with Ezra, Nana, Dad and Poppa. Dad explained the rules to Poppa. We had a giant sized board and the dice was made of cardboard and was the size of my hand. Poppa decided the game was stupid and didn't want to play. Poppers came into the room and I went into the dining room. I went out the back and there were some kittens in the birdcages being naughty. Fido was out there too."
"3459"	"(2010-06-01 (19)) I was at Ted's (How I Met Your Mother) with Robin and Marshall. The other day, Marshall had made some hash cookies/muffins and tonight we were going to eat them. We were sitting around and Ted gave us all a cookie. It was nice and chocolate-y, but there was no 'hash'. I thought maybe it was in the muffins instead, so I went into the kitchen and on the table were a square container and a round container. One had muffins and the other had cookies. I took a small muffin (it was the shape and size of a squashed mushroom) and took a bite. It had choc chips and was really nice. We ended up all laughing and messing around. I said something like 'Didn't you make them, Marshall? They're really good, but what the hell?' and he laughed like he was stoned (we all were). We acted like we were high for hours. Robin pretended to be reporting. Ted's boss came and Ted was actually supposed to be working. He said he had a video of one of the nights here. The video had him saying 'Do you know about this door?' and he seemed crazy. He had a girlfriend who was very modern and fashionable."
"3460"	"(2010-06-02 (19)) I was watching Dollhouse, which was different. I remember seeing Dominic though. Raquel had some exam map as her status on Facebook. I found something that led to me discovering some secret weapon thing which I apparently had. Somehow I confirmed this. I realized people were after it, so I called Mom to let her know and she was away for the weekend. I called her and she said these people had just asked and were asking her questions. I panicked and packed my bag with clothes and books for studying. I was going to go to dads and I had an exam tomorrow. I put my shoes in there too. Then I heard a car door shut and I realized the people were here. I heard someone talking from outside the laundry door. He said that he would give me $100k for it and they'd leave without a fight. I noticed the guy was Keamy from Lost. I said they'd have to wait for my Mom to get back. I watched him off his reflection in a mirror. I pointed a gun at him and said I had a good 'ratio'. I went down the hall and quickly got to the front door -- the door was different as well as the front yard. I locked the door as he got to me through another entrance. We fought and I ended up slashing his throat and he fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, he looked like Ted (How I Met Your Mother) and I thought he was actually hot. His mate came and I ran outside. I had a package and ran to my car and drove off. I ended up going back later and they were gone. I tried to brake, but it wasn't working. I got to where Mom was and Ezra was with her. I didn't know if the key was in properly. Then the car was shrinking because of fear of a lake? Mom asked if anything 'traumatic' had happened today and I said that 'terrorists came after me for a biological weapon' and she was shocked. There was a guy with some chocolates and she flirted with him."
"3461"	"(2010-06-03 (19)) This creepy anorexic girl and guy were talking nearby. Mom and I were there and she said something like 'everyone sees an ugly girl talking' and everyone stared and I said 'that's coz they are'. I told Ezra about it later. I was playing World of Warcraft. The Queen of Stormwind looked like Mom, except fatter and she had red hair. I was with lots of others waiting at two elevators. One opened and it was pretty full and I thought someone dodgy was in there who wanted to 'steal' the Queen (she was with us and was like a blow-up doll). We went over to the other one, but thought that was dodgy too, so went with the first one. The door closed, but then immediately opened. Eric (True Blood) was there. We sat on the floor and heaps of coins spilled out of my pocket. The guy behind me was staring and I made fun of him. A person with me helped me pick them up. Then we stopped because we were supposed to let Eric and others do something. I had boxes at the old house and I carried them into my room. I was then watching How I Met Your Mother. There were flashbacks about how Marshall's mother hated Lily. One time Lily went outside, she came back to find the door locked. Then when she went back again, the door had never been used and was covered in spiderwebs and a red-back spider. The steps were falling apart and I thought she was going to fall through them. Marshall would go 'pfft' when he was doing something important or when he was nervous. I can't remember the first one they showed, but the next was when he proposed and there was a banner saying 'is this the type of host you wanted?'. Someone was on a road pretending to wait for something. A girl Ted liked was coming his way and he ran in the opposite direction."
"3462"	"(2010-06-04 (19)) I went to a place which I think was university and they had this building where important stuff happened. I was with Dad and Ezra. On the way out, my phone beeped because some machine had screwed it up. They took it. I snuck back in to get it. It still turned on, but it was really slow. I wanted to get the photos off it, but it would take 30 seconds."
"3463"	"(2010-06-04 (19)) For some reason, I had to find pictures of Hilarie Burton, as she was very anorexic, to show Dad. I also found some old ones of Mischa Barton. I was looking at the questions for the math exam. There was a different one about finding the probability of certain people dying naturally as opposed to being killed by this crazy girl."
"3464"	"(2010-06-05 (19)) I was watching Supernatural. Two people were in an office who liked each other and then one got possessed and killed everyone. I was thinking they were chosen because the actors were married in real life and they had chemistry. Then I went into a bathroom and when I came out, the possessed person was nearby and was a demon. Then I was Sam, but it was from my POV. Dean thought I went to get my gun and came into the bathroom to stop me, but I was in a bath, hiding behind the curtain. The door was locked, but he got in anyway. I explained something to him and then the creature tried to get in. It managed to get in and we said some spell and got rid of it. Ruby 'melted' into water into the bath. I wondered why Sam had married Ruby in real life. Dad watched a home reopening."
"3465"	"(2010-06-05 (19)) I was outside at night with Mom and Rover. Rover barked and then lay down on the front porch to sleep. Mom said he barked to let her know what his bark sounded like. There was some game with a guide dog and a torch, and you had to move from area to area and I think you had to do something too. If you were caught by the torch, you lost. I had a cute little terrier thing. It kept running away though and went to sleep under Rover. I had to walk through a tunnel with train tracks. Someone had set a path, which I followed. When I got out, I saw a torch flashing outside I started down a nearby path. I went into a room and then didn't know what to do. The torch was coming closer and got me and it was Alexis Denisof and he seemed happy to get someone. His accent kept changing from English to American. I asked where I was supposed to go and he wasn't sure. My dog ran towards me and I fell backwards and almost toppled off a ledge, and it barked."
"3466"	"(2010-06-05 (19)) I was at home and Mom was out. I was watching TV and they played I Predict. I sang along to when he sang 'I predict' because I didn't know the rest of the words. Then it wasn't home, with people from school. There were guys outside with some teachers playing sport. I also watched something from Freaks and Geeks with Nick playing sport. Someone came in, who was sometimes Eugene, and he suggested we take off. I got someone to distract the teachers and we snuck out the front door. Then it was like I had gone back in time, so I could drive but I didn't have my licence. I took my car anyway. I kept speeding and having a bit of trouble. We went to the beach, although it had changed. There was a path and there was stuff going on everywhere. I realized I had no pants on. We went to the waterslides, but there were better ones somewhere else. Then I was by myself. The Royal Show was there and I went inside and there were some booths. It was dark. I saw Jason Segel and was like ""goo"" and pretended to stretch himself. I left and I had a quest to hand in. I had to ask a girl to sing. Across from her, another girl started singing The Breakup Song. I had to go to a tower to hand in another quest. It had winding steps and there were lots of people. I had to vote for the best band on this list, except we weren't allowed to vote for The Beatles or Michael Jackson. I was thinking 'who even likes Michael Jackson?'. There were rows of seats for the 'Superbowl'. I sat in a seat, hoping that the guy I liked would sit next to me, but a girl came and I moved. Cory Monteith and the guy I liked, who was sometimes a young Chris Barrie, were a few rows over and I saw Cory look over at me."
"3467"	"(2010-06-06 (19)) I went to Big W with Mom, which was at Midvale. It was Sunday and it was totally empty. There was one person working at the counter, who was an Asian lady. Mom walked off, but I went in. They had only red pens? The lady asked me to read these letter numbers. There were three; red, green and another colour and the numbers were 13, 14, 15. I was going to ask if they were hiring, but then couldn't be bothered. Then Rover was with us and ended up lying in chip packets. We left and I saw Evelyn and gave her a short wave. She worked at the Big W and she couldn't get promoted because she was already at the highest level. Mom said a group of girls were whispering. They asked me a question and I said that I couldn't hear them and they were like 'why is that girl talking to her?'."
"3468"	"(2010-06-07 (19)) Rachel and Puck (both from Glee) were in detention, colouring in pictures of fruits and vegetables. All of his were green. She said she hadn't been to the doctors since ""I saw you"". On Chuck, there was a kid with magic powers. A girl related to Casey was staying with him. He brought her a plate with snacks in bed and she said that she thought she was only leaving her badger and some other animal for a couple of days and she couldn't stay anymore. He said Sarah would call her and leave her on speakerphone until she had had a certain conversation -- they were trying to get her to join their group and were leaving hints. The magic kid put glasses on weirdly and pretended to ride a broomstick, which made everything disappear but then it came back again. Raquel and I made a movie together. I had written the plot and she had written the dialogue. Mom was there."
"3469"	"(2010-06-07 (19)) I was doing quests and one was in a tree. Then I was at a building and I had to get in this secret area that I wasn't allowed in. The name on door was Jesus and the last name also had 'esus' in it. I was going to take a photo. Then I, and someone I was with, got some ice-cream and lollies. I couldn't find my phone when we left, so I got her to call it. I asked ""is Henry VIII playing?"" and she said ""no"". I had a different ring tone, but I found it. It was 3pm, but it was pitch black outside. The car was further away then I remembered. We got into it and locked the doors. Some people were driving up and down the road and then suddenly started going fast. I waited and then reversed and tried to leave but they were blocking the street and I had to drive up the curb and get on the freeway. There were 4 lanes and the people in the car followed me very closely. I went over the speed limit a bit and I was worried. I saw a police car with its lights and siren on and I didn't know who it was after because it was a few lanes over. Darren was watching The Hangover and I caught a bit of it. Ed Helms was in it, but everyone else was different. Marshall (How I Met Your Mother) was a character in it, and another character (but not a real one) was as well, played by George Clooney. Neil Patrick Harris was also in it as himself. Marshall, Lily, George Clooney and a girl were making out on a bed. Kristen Stewart was in a car and she was saying things like 'hey, there's Nikki Reed, shouldn't she turn into a dog or something', 'hey, there's Nikki Reed in a tree'. They hugged. I was thinking the movie was really lame."
"3470"	"(2010-06-08 (19)) Mom, Ezra, someone else and I went to this carnival thing which was all organized into different sections. We were looking for some people. Rover was there too. Darren and Rover were acting as spies? Rover and another dog had a conversation to confirm that he had a box of porn. The one on top had a cover like Not Another Teen Movie, except they were all fat. The cheerleaders were all black. I went to meet with others and then we were at a porno party which Dad was hosting. I was looking for my friends, one of whom was Neil Patrick Harris. Neal (Freaks and Geeks) was with another guy and I grabbed him jokingly and said ""what are you doing here?!"". A lady was talking to Ezra and then he was like 'oh, you're from Modern Family' and they hugged and I was thinking that I didn't remember her. Ezra said she was the one who ""sleeps with Alan (from Freaks and Geeks)"". To get an 'achievement', you had to get her to say a special nickname to you. Her name was Leannie Bird. Jason Segel was then there too and we were friends. I think he liked me. He ignored all the other people and kept trying to hang out with me, but I was looking for something and didn't notice. I complained to Dad that I forgot my phone and couldn't take any photos and he gave me a camera."
"3471"	"(2010-06-08 (19)) Mom, tranny Acquaintance-F-07 and I were walking through a school to get to another building. Police were at the school looking in empty fishtanks. We got to our building and I was looking at the answers to my chemistry exam that I got wrong. Acquaintance-F-07 had some drugs in a fishtank, so she took them out and was going to leave. As I was leaving, I saw cops coming. We all walked away, but this guy asked us something and thought Mom and Acquaintance-F-07 were acting dodgy, so asked us to get strapped in this chair and it would spin around fast. He got in and did it and then we followed. Ezra was there too. Mom went on after Acquaintance-F-07. Someone else went and then it was my turn. I had to be blindfolded and I asked the guy if I would get extra points and he said no. I got off feeling dizzy and sick, but it was fun. I waited outside and tried to get a photo of the guy. Then I had to go on this bus, which was driven by the guy. I took a photo of the guy through the window. Eugene was sitting by himself nearby. I went to the other side where my bag was. When I got off, I ended up in a building with this Asian girl. We walked fast and I tidied my bag as we walked. Then we started running while singing along to a song. There were markers to pick up along the way. There were achievements written on a board and I got one for 'highest pitch'. We had to run up stairs and there were trick pathways etc. At the last part, we went up a set of stairs and I won. She got every other achievement though. One was to collect hats and I went down later to check out all the hats. I grabbed them and it counted towards my score automatically. There was a faded Jayne hat. There was a clown with purple hair who was cracking up. Jeremiah said he was rooting for the Asian girl and I thought 'figures'. I was at a shop at some point and How I Met Your Mother was playing on a TV. There was swearing (like 'fuck') and it wasn't bleeped and I thought it was weird. Marshall said 'shit'. Someone was wearing a shirt with a Barney quote and I was thinking I wanted one that said 'suit up!'."
"3472"	"(2010-06-09 (19)) A girl was with a guy in a gorilla suit. She was like 'what the hell' and he took the head off and it was Barney (How I Met Your Mother) and they kissed. Then some others came out and laughed and it was some joke they played on him."
"3473"	"(2010-06-09 (19)) Ezra, Roland and I were at this school place. There were five levels for each grade. They were in Year 9, in the easiest one to escape. Year 11 and 12 had too many bars. People were leaning out of holes? Outside somewhere, Ezra swapped something with another person for long guns. Mom and I gave him a permanent marker. I had to leave for some academic summit [I finished rewatching Freaks and Geeks yesterday] . Ezra and Roland wanted to leave, so I helped them escape and then a lady chased and caught us. I said I had to leave for the summit. She suggested that I call Mom so I did, but she didn't answer, and then I discovered she'd left her phone here. The lady was then Anastasia. Mom lived across the street, so I went over to give the phone to her and she came out and got it. I was watching the end of Freaks and Geeks and Lindsay dyed her hair blonde, which looked nice, but she was mean. I then decided to ditch the academic summit and follow a band."
"3474"	"(2010-06-10 (19)) There was a new season of Arrested Development, and it wasn't funny at all and was completely random. Someone complained about something. Will Arnett was apparently 21. Then I was watching a pilot of a new show. It was a bit random. There were ships with 'aliens' and they were killing fleets to get a 'set'. I went to bed and woke up some time later and it was 9.30pm, and I wondered why it was so early. Ezra had some mates over. Mom invited me to come for a drive. She was going to an insect shop. I said I'd go, but then I was in uniform at a shop. I worked at a fish and chip shop. My boss was mean and bossed us around. I text Mom to say I wasn't going to go for the drive. There was a report that we didn't compliment or smile enough. An example complaint was about Family Guy. A guy in the show said he got things confused like ""when I said Whedon, I meant idiot"" and then went on to talk about Joss Whedon. I had a boyfriend who was a quadriplegic. Someone had swapped stuff around on his desk to confuse him and I was annoyed because it was my desk."
"3475"	"(2010-06-10 (19)) Three friends and I moved in together. I actually owned the house and wanted $280 a week rent. I asked one of them for $210 and he agreed. There were two girls, one had to pay $235 and the other was his girlfriend."
"3476"	"(2010-06-11 (19)) I was sitting on the step in the back room, talking to Mom and Ezra. Mom was on her computer and Ezra was standing near the table. I was thinking about How I Met Your Mother and how awesome Barney was and I was going to ask Ezra who his favourite character was, but then remembered he didn't watch it. There was a video of Jason Segel (it looked like it was from around season 1/2) laughing a little and looking at the camera. There was a TV show called Triers. Dad said on Facebook that he cried. It was about a hospital thing in the forest. Sharlto Copley was in it. A lady was pregnant. Mom and I were then at the hospital thing. Spaceman was there too. I said 'woo!' and she mentioned Spaceman and I was like 'how did you know I was woo-ing at Spaceman?' and she said 'what else?' and I said ""the guy from District 9"" and she said she didn't remember it. Then it was like World of Warcraft and there were lots of different mobs in one area. I kept getting attacked by these giant worms and I squealed. I had also been at college years ago and Ted (How I Met Your Mother) said that I just stayed in bed and had sex all day. In Freaks and Geeks, someone had made a video of the 'losers' to show them what they were."
"3477"	"(2010-06-13 (19)) I was doing my week of work experience, though it was doing cheerleading. I went down there on Saturday wearing my school jumper over my Woodstock shirt and pants. I got to the court and there were guys in jock outfits and cheerleaders in bright orange shirts. I asked if wearing pants was ok and she said shorts were preferable. I was thinking I'd text Mom and asked her to drop off some shorts, but it was only for an hour, so it seemed like a pointless trip. Someone called out that it was 9.30am and got back to the train station at 1.30pm. Ezra and Mom were there."
"3478"	"(2010-06-15 (19)) It was my first day of work experience. Mom didn't make dinner until 3.30am, so I didn't go the second day. At 8.01am, I got a text from 'Anna Frost' asking where I was, so I replied saying I was sick. Ezra was doing an internship on this forum when people had learned too much? He was kicked off and he was now doing something on Sims 2, and had a low percentage. Mine was like 99%. I downloaded a movie from 1987 with Jason Segel in it, but he was a teen/young adult."
"3479"	"(2010-06-16 (19)) I drove somewhere and then ran back on the train tracks. I asked Mom to take me back later to get my car. I was at a shop and a TV show was playing and James Callis was in it, but had an American accent. It had something to do with kids."
"3480"	"(2010-06-16 (19)) There was some reunion on that I was supposed to go, but I sent Mom instead. She texted me saying that Kaleb had mentioned to her to tell me about something, which was an inside joke from a few years ago. I laughed and then tried to remember when I had been friends with him. I text back 'how formal is it?' and then I went there. I was wearing a suit and said it was 'so I can say suit up' and someone high fived me. Everyone was like 'Barney's awesome'. Then Ezra was there too. We had a drink and I started thinking about my proposed drinking game for The Marine. I was then at a hotel and I had a list of people who I had gone to school with. I'd written 'Jayne <3', who was actually a girl but I was just pretending it was Jayne from Firefly. There was a lady, who was around 50 years old, who I had dreamt about, added something. Then, I was her, and what she/I had written were qualities of her husband 'bald, but had hair'. At some point I was watching music TV with Poppa. He said someone on TV had threatened to sic a crocodile on him."
"3481"	"(2010-06-17 (19)) I was with some friends. We went to some house and some people attacked us. We got in our car and drove away. It was then night and raining and it was hard to drive."
"3482"	"(2010-06-17 (19)) I was signing up to be a volunteer at Comic-Con. I was looking for Summer Glau on the list, but then I remembered it was Morena Baccarin coming. It started at 4.50pm. I chose the time slots for volunteering and some were already taken, but I picked ones around Morena's appearances so I would get to leave right after with a few little breaks."
"3483"	"(2010-06-17 (19)) I went into some place with Dad, Poppa and others. Michael Palin and an old guy were there. There was a new Monty Python movie and I said that it was weird they'd made a new movie without Graham Chapman. We went to see it and there was footage from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. A girl there, who was my age, was going out with the afore-mentioned old guy. I wasn't sure how they were connected. We ended up at some nightclub and everyone was dancing. I was then at some college and it was very busy inside. I was on a staircase and there were people everywhere. I was then outside. Some friends and I were having races. Pam and Jim from The Office were there. Pam was called 'Nick' though. Pam, this other guy and I raced for fun. She was fast and won and I was second. The last part of the race was down some stairs and then back up. Then there was a pool with those green plants, but you had to swim across it. Only people with 'nice butts' were allowed. Pam used to be allowed, but wasn't anymore. She was writing in a diary. I went to do something and walked along the walkway on the 'butt' pool. I went up to Pam and tapped her on the shoulder and said that I was just in the butt pool and she said ""this is the best thing ever!"" and started writing again. The lady in charge came and I hid and she said that Jim was never allowed in and that she didn't notice me because she 'forgot she was here'. James Lafferty was also there and he was allowed in the pool."
"3484"	"(2010-06-18 (19)) Sarah Polley was sleeping in a bed. She had a crossword under her and one of the answers was 'Polley'. She woke up and saw it and found it odd. She wrote it in the spot for Linda Cardellini. Another answer was to do with a movie from 2008 about a nurse."
"3485"	"(2010-06-18 (19)) I was doing this massive real life RPG thing. We pretended we were on a ship and we were all given roles. We were the bad guys. Ezra and Roland were on there. They shot a heap of people and were laughing, but I didn't see them again for the rest of the game. I liked this guy, who was given a role like Jack Dawson in Titanic and he had to put a necklace on me, which I let him do so we could make out, although it was a small kiss and then he left. I took it off the first chance I got. It was heavy and small and made it hard to breathe. There were two Nicole Richie's -- one was anorexic and the other was healthy. Both of them had a lot of makeup on, although they had slightly different eye makeup. Her boyfriend came out with the other one and she was angry and I said ""you look exactly the same!"". Three guys were playing bums and they put on an accent and said 'mate' a lot. Then someone was looking for some people who turned out to be Ezra and Roland. They were in a room (it was at a house that was a bit like the old house, at the end of the hallway just next to my room). I went to my room and my bed was close to the door and I couldn't open the door, so I sat at the door."
"3486"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was watching the second last episode of Lost. There were two Jack's. Charlie dragged a guy 200m through empty space. He was still dead on Earth, but everything was black, except for people. They were in a forest. The real Jack had died and someone said that 'dead Jack's right there' (not in front of the other one) and Kate was upset."
"3487"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was watching the first episode of season 5 of The Office. It showed the end of the last episode again with Toby in his neck brace, but it was actually his twin. The real Toby was coming back to Dunder Mifflin. I was in a car with Phyllis, Pam and others. One of them was a guy Pam used to date and he had lots of rings on and was kind of stupid. The camera crew had requested an interview with Toby's family, but they denied it. We stopped at a trashed bus stop."
"3488"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) Ezra and Roland were doing a quest. They had to kill some mobs in this village. I was there too and for part of my quest, I had to kiss Ezra. It was just on the lips, but I was grossed out anyway, especially because of his tongue ring. Mom got in a car and changed the station. They were playing Round and Round. I was sitting in the back. At some point, I had my first kiss with Jason Segel; he had one arm around me and another touching my face. I kissed back because it was hard to resist."
"3489"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was at a house with Mom, Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and others. Uncle Wilbur got angry and yelled at the others about something on a cupboard from them. They were fat and they made him compete in something that he was pro at. He stormed out and Mom was like 'heh, look how slow he is'. He came back in and took his key."
"3490"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) Neil Patrick Harris and I had been going out for a while. Someone we knew was pregnant. Someone came up to me and said congrats and it was because I was pregnant too. I didn't know how they knew. They started telling me stuff like it was better to sleep with my hair up and to not curl your leg under you and I said that I wasn't keeping it, because I wasn't going to waste my life etc. There was a church thing nearby where couples were getting married. We decided to get married too. It cost nothing and I said I didn't want any fancy stuff. The person doing it said that he could tell we were in love etc because of the way we looked at each other."
"3491"	"(2010-06-19 (19)) I was at a nightclub place, but it was more like a computer lab/classroom. The lighting was nightclub like though. You could choose 'buffs'; one of them was choosing a hair colour that would be attracted to you -- options of black and purple, black, red, blue, brown and others. I stroked my friends' hair to find soft hair. There was one girl with short/medium black hair. She turned and I said she had nice hair. We kind of flirted? I went through everyone else's hair, but hers was the best. I was supposed to find someone. I sat down at a computer and Joel McHale was next to me and was actually very Jeff like. We started chatting and laughing. I didn't know his name, but I found it out and searched for it. Pictures of him shirtless came up and we joked about it. Everyone got up to go outside and he put his hand out and I didn't know what to do. He said something about it and then we held hands and there was this weird 'connection'. Then it was awkward. I was at a computer later reading trivia about How I Met Your Mother. Alyson Hannigan was pregnant."
"3492"	"(2010-06-20 (19)) I was watching The Office. Eugene quit for a bit, but then came back. Toby had his job."
"3493"	"(2010-06-21 (19)) I was at a beach thing with people from The Office. Angela and I had had a fight a while ago -- the last few days she had started to like me. Then, she told me something in private (not important) and I had angrily told Lily (How I Met Your Mother), who had told everyone else. She eventually told me it was fine and I said that I shouldn't have said anything. We went down to the pool. The beach had a 'house' on an island in the middle. Angela was wearing a bikini, but the top was like a top instead of a bra. She had brought us there. The house was on fire and I got my phone out to record it. The writers of the show had made Andy roofie someone and have sex with them. They decided they didn't like a 'nice guy' doing that, so they made him evil and I was like 'aw, but I like Andy'."
"3494"	"(2010-06-21 (19)) I was in New York with Dad at a place with chickens in cages. He asked me what one's height was. I accidentally sent him three photos of myself and I explained they were from when I was writing my dreams on the side of the road? There was a hill. Someone turned off all the power in New York. Then all these people turned 'bad' -- mostly Asians. It was night. I was hiding out in a building with lots of others. The Asians were shooting at us through the roof (which had a window that was open) and some of them were in the building too. I was hiding behind a cabinet with a few other girls. Eventually I realized it was just me and another girl left. We got up and went around the corner and saw lots of bad Asians. We went back and they came around the other way. I hid behind a wall, then the other girl turned on me. Something happened to some of them and they turned zombie like. I went into another room which I thought had stairs, but it didn't. I went back out and the girls from before were there with one gun. One of them turned and I took the gun and shot her. Oscar (The Office) was there wearing a red, silky suit thing. I thought he was a good guy, so ignored him and aimed the gun at someone else, but then he pulled out a gun and I said 'no, Oscar!'. I ran into another room which was a big bathroom with a toilet. Then there was another room with a bath in the middle of it. A crazy girl was in there. She asked if I wanted to 'watch' -- she had a bomb she had made. She went out and I peeked out and then I went into the bath to protect myself, but I got up to check and there was water two foot high in there and everyone was drowning themselves instead of getting blown up. I opened the door and swam underneath to get out. I floated up though and a girl said I was going to die anyway. I ran out the door and got outside. It was day now. I ran past lots of buildings and gassed areas (they were all together, like part of a university or something). I saw a guy on a motorbike and I said the building was going to blow up, you might want to get off the bike. We ran together. We got a carpark and could see smoke coming out of the building. I asked ""should we get in a car?"" and he said ""I want to go in the post office"". We ran around and he ducked under the building. I couldn't work out how to get under, so I just put my face there and took a breath. He had a black arch thing as an earring, but was otherwise ok looking. We talked for a bit and were kind of flirting. I said I read that a guy on the news did this. Then some guys in a car came and asked if we wanted to go with them. Someone mentioned Pam (The Office) and I said that I liked Pam. They were talking about which character from the show they were and I said that I got Stanley in a quiz I did. They said a friend of theirs got Andy. I went to a pavilion place and met some celebrity there. There were quite a few people there."
"3495"	"(2010-06-22 (19)) Something happened and heaps of people got powers. Some people got kidnapped. One guy's legs weren't working, presumably because he was getting used to his power. His girlfriend was Japanese and she was on a ship. I was one of the kidnapped people. We escaped. She returned and had a power. Then she and the guy were at a Laundromat together. A guy, who was Death, was in court because he was going to die? Rainn Wilson got into an argument with him and it was in all newspapers. Death was with us and was sleeping on the couch. Gizmo and Cuddles were sleeping near him. I grabbed a newspaper and read a story next to him. He woke up and wanted the paper and I threw it at him. He asked if the guy [Rainn Wilson] was ""Dwight Schrute from The Office"" and I confirmed it was. I was reading something that said Alexander Skarsgard was only 19 and I didn't believe it. Someone asked what my power was and I said 'I guess you could call it women's intuition' -- I could 'feel' others' feelings. Mom and I had bought/rented a shop in a shopping centre."
"3496"	"(2010-06-22 (19)) A girl and I, and others, were taken by this guy for a game. We were on a small platform and we were surrounded by nothing -- it was just floating in 'nothing'. There was this 'door' which was special. If it turned on, we would float standing up in the frame, which is how we slept. It never worked properly for us though and we would always float around. On 8 October, the guy came back and we complained. He was different though and he said he didn't care. He said something and we realized he was actually a bad guy and had been taken over or something. We said the game was pointless and stupid. He made us get in a car and took us away. We went to Midvale shops and the deli was bigger. I thought about asking for a job there. Someone in the car wrapped string around our wrists. The guy talked and he revealed he was 'evil' and I sarcastically said 'no-one saw that coming'. He misunderstood it as 'no you're not'. He started to explain how and why, but I stopped him and explained what I meant angrily. The girl with me was now Farrah. He started driving the car crazily and almost hit another car, then slammed into the back of one at a petrol station. While we were stopped, we got out and ran. I ended up on a fence and she was on the ground running. We caught up and he was in a backyard with Farrah and told me to come down. We decided on her coming up and me going down? She came up and we got ready to run and I said I was coming down now. Then we ran. I took off the string. There was a small caravan park and we ran in there, but it was silent. We walked quietly and she suggested we hide somewhere in there, but I said it was too obvious. I went to a fence and saw the beach and suggested we go there. We ran along the wet sand to get to the main part of the beach. There were lots of people and we joined in the crowd. I was thinking I could go to dads. We started having fun and stopped worrying about the guy."
"3497"	"(2010-06-24 (19)) Michael (The Office) was dating people in the office and when they would break up, he would mark them as 'having bad relations' and could make them do something so he could go up a level, which gave him a lot of benefits. Jim and Dwight were outside and Jim played a joke on him, sending him around with 'threats'. There was a playground. Creed was standing around and Dwight warned Jim about something he was getting worried about."
"3498"	"(2010-06-24 (19)) Matthew Morrison was on the cover of a magazine promoting Glee. It was in black and white. I was watching an episode of it, but only remember seeing Finn."
"3499"	"(2010-06-25 (19)) Leonardo DiCaprio was a character who was a 'bad' guy and visited a guy. Leo was pretending to be him and had the same accent as he did in Shutter Island. The guy suddenly yelled ""when was the last time you woke up listening to 8 Mile! That whole movie and one little song"" and he responded with ""I know, right!"". The guy realized it was a test. He got a job to pick up this 19 year old girl. He went to a carpark to get here and she was actually a transvestite who looked like Anthony Perkins. She got in the car and the driver was now a female and put music on, which sounded very sexual. Anthony Perkins got upset and got out of the car. The Academy Awards were on and Antonio Banderas had said he wanted some weird looking guy to win and was like ""this is what I want"" and everyone else was like 'who the hell is he to say that?'. A lot of the winners were very odd choices, but Christoph Waltz won. There was a bit for TV shows and Rainn Wilson was in the newspaper."
"3500"	"(2010-06-25 (19)) I was with some people looking for ghosts. Apparently there was treasure in a certain spot and we found an old radio and one of things with balls and loops."
"3501"	"(2010-06-25 (19)) I drove to the vet for work experience and then remembered I wasn't going anymore and drove back home. It was raining heavily. The cars in front of me were driving slowly. Then I was doing volunteer work until 7pm and it was almost 5. I was sweaty. There was an area with famous people. There were lots of paths and flowers. Then I was at a shop. Harry, Hermione and Ron (Harry Potter) were there. A guy was doing something with them and Hermione was giggling whenever Ron was mentioned and I was annoyed because I liked him too. Ron's brothers and the three of them did something 'naughty', so a guy had emptied their bank accounts and punished them, but because Ron didn't talk back he was let off, then his brothers threatened the guy and they were allowed to go too. The guy was now Timothy Spall. Harry was in the lolly section and got some alcohol and got drunk. Something happened and this creature was released (size of the monster in Gwoemul). It burst through and we all ran. I got in the car with Mom, who had been waiting, and it put its foot on the bonnet and breathed onto the windscreen. I said ""don't move"" and it smashed the window, but then left. I ended up back inside with it and we were trapped in. I was hiding around and it was being mean to others, but it was not bad to me. Seamus was with me. All of a sudden, it started singing Ask the Lonely loudly, but with modified lyrics, eg ""close the windows and toilets"". We laughed."
"3502"	"(2010-06-26 (19)) Mom and Ezra were watching Freaks and Geeks on her computer. There was a fake episode where Lindsay was in class and the class joked that her drug of choice was coke and you could put anything in a shoebox these days. Mom was doing something else at the same time and wasn't watching it properly."
"3503"	"(2010-06-27 (19)) I was pregnant or had a baby. I was practicing 'motherhood' with a mouse in bed and it peed on me. There was a person with us. I didn't know who the father was. I was reading something about Jim and Pam from The Office."
"3504"	"(2010-06-27 (19)) I was at 'work'. I had a desk with a computer and post-it notes with TV shows written on them. There was a list of movies I'd watched while also doing something important. A girl looked at something and I'd written 'I <3 Jeffrey Dean Morgan' and two others. I had a daughter called Kaylee and a granddaughter called Jessica. Eugene was the father. Someone kidnapped Kaylee and left notes, then they kidnapped Jessica as well. I went to Darren and Mom. I was in the car with Mom and it was raining. We pulled up on the side of the road and opened the door and a big dog came running up and managed to close the door, but the window was down and it stuck its head in. Then we were at a shop. Julia Gillard was there and I'd overheard her talking about gays and it sounded pro-gay. A girl asked her for advice and she helped her."
"3505"	"(2010-06-28 (19)) I went to Comic-Con. I was watching people on stage, but I only remember seeing Eliza Dushku. I was trying to get to the break room before them, but it took me ages to get out. When I left the main room, there was a hall next to it and someone snuck out of it and it was Nathan Fillion. I got excited and I averted my eyes, but he noticed and he said he was in a hurry and called me 'Izzy'. I asked how he knew my name and it was because of my badge. He went through these doors and he said he had to be at a place in San Francisco and I said 'ok, have a good a time' and he left and I was annoyed. I met with Ezra on the way to the car, but it took us a while to find it. Spaceman was in the back of a Ute in a box. There was a bad drawing of a house I'd done on Facebook and people were liking it. Nana had a gift but there was no reward?"
"3506"	"(2010-06-28 (19)) I was at an award show thing, which was quite small. They said 'The Office' and I clapped once excitedly and Dad wondered why. Everyone started chanting 'Rainn'. Steve Carell was nominated as well as Rainn Wilson, but Rainn Wilson won."
"3507"	"(2010-06-28 (19)) I was in a building, like a house, but I'm not sure what it was. There was a room with 'Murlocs', but they weren't really. They were found underwater, but I thought they were aliens. I closed the door and left. Later, I walked past an open door and there was a folder on the ground keeping it open. I pushed it away and let it close. I went back to another room and told Ezra. Dean Pelton (Community) and two guys were in the air vent dealing drugs -- it was some alien drug. Someone did this thing to make all guys there extremely horny and they were raping people. This hot guy that I was friends with was in a room with me when it happened. He kissed me violently and pushed me to the ground. I tried to get him off, but I couldn't. Whatever the thing was was turned off a few seconds later. Later, I was walking with him and another guy and he said that he didn't remember anything. I had taken my pants off and was giving them to someone in a trade. Then I was watching Red Dwarf, but it wasn't. Mom had been in a few episodes as a girl from the past who travelled forwards in time. There was a character who everyone thought was going to be a love interest, and it was Dad, but it was 400 years in the future. We had some banana cake but it was black. I felt sick. I was playing World of Warcraft at some point and was doing Auchindoun with others. We hung our bags up and I went to kill the main boss."
"3508"	"(2010-06-29 (19)) I was watching some comedy show. Eliza Dushku and a blonde girl were hiding under a blanket and a box on a bench. People came and lifted them up and the girl was like 'Micah!' and Eliza was like 'it's Meccah'. Someone asked me if I was nervous when getting her autograph and I said 'no, I'm not really a fan'. I said she was uglier in real life and I was more nervous when getting Summer Glau's autograph."
"3509"	"(2010-06-29 (19)) Mom and I were at a place and something had been pulled out which meant it had just been robbed. It was night. There were some black guys and one was at a platform at a train station. Another started coming toward us."
"3510"	"(2010-06-30 (19)) I was 'in' Queer as Folk. I went out with some guys. Later, there was a bunch of us and they were having a competition and asking how 'big' everyone was. Stuart was sitting on a toilet, naked, with his butt sticking outwards. Then I was watching Community, and Jeff was expected to like this 'hot' girl. Abed picked up on Jeff's emotions and convinced him to tell Britta how he felt. He chased her down and she was on the phone and he said ""I have a crush on you"" and she looked shocked and repeated it and he laughed happily and left."
"3511"	"(2010-06-30 (19)) Rover got his claw stuck and had warm vomit on his head. Mom was around."
"3512"	"(2010-07-02 (19)) I was on World of Warcraft. There was a long quest line, and each quest had an hour timer on it, but they were short. The quest reward window was different -- there were four different choices all which four different items, all of which had no value. For the second part of the quest, I had to speak to an 'Alpha Male' wolf in a cave. There were lots of them and some were yellow (non-agro) and some were red (agro). I finished with him and got an exp reward and I turned to run from an agro but he attacked me. I flew out to get to the next place. Mom was going to take me to university to drop off my chemistry assignment. It was worth 15% of my grade. She said that we would be going to a barbecue picnic afterwards and were going to bring along stuff for a steak sandwich for me. I said that I'd just go and get my assignment. The house was different. Before my room, there was a big toilet (it was probably about the size of my room in RL). It had a sliding door. My room also had a small toilet to the side. I did a pee in the big toilet and Mom came and was like 'what are you doing?' and I said I was peeing and she was like 'what?' and went to open the door and I held it shut and I repeated what I said. She was like ok and left. I had a red shirt on. I grabbed my grey jacket which was on my bed, my chemistry stuff and my water bottle. I was still logged on to World of Warcraft and it said that I had tried to trade with heaps of people. I then realized I only had 4.9k gold and it said that 600k had been traded to someone called 'thinking [something I don't remember] baby' and I told him to give me my money back and he ran off and I used an angry emote. I asked Ezra why he took money from me and he said it wasn't him."
"3513"	"(2010-07-03 (19)) I was at this place like a shop but then it was like a house. There were lots of people over and we were having a party. First I was in a car with Dad and we pulled into this place. This guy came to my window (the car was US style, so I was on the right) and said hello and flirted with me. We started to drive off, but felt compelled to stay and Dad turned around. Everyone got drunk. Ezra was there too. He had a job in 'engineering'. We yelled at someone to leave and then called him to come back? Anyway, it was fun. A few guys there were friendly to me and I knew them, sort of. I was then driving with Mom and she was driving crazy and ended up hitting cars. Then we had 'ducks' that had the last name 'Sparrow' which was like ours. But I was saying to people that they had changed them to something else, but some were still Sparrow and I eventually said 'no last names'. One was called Andrew and someone was like 'that's a girl's name' and I said 'How is Andrew a girl's name?' and they said it was because of the 'Drew' and I said ""That's like saying Rik's a girl's name because of the 'i',"". Everyone thought it was hilarious and they were all laughing. This guy and I got close to having sex at one point, but we didn't."
"3514"	"(2010-07-03 (19)) I was at a shop. Yvonne Strahovski had some product there. It was pink and I dipped my fingers into a bottle to taste it."
"3515"	"(2010-07-04 (19)) I was watching a 'behind-the-scenes' thing for Queer as Folk. Denise Black, Scott Lowell and Craig Kelly were in it. Denise Black was like 'don't even let me better than this man' and pointed to Craig Kelly (I think that's what it says, it's hard to read). She was going through this list which had them all ranked in attractiveness. Scott laughed that she was last."
"3516"	"(2010-07-04 (19)) I was at a shop with Dad. He went to buy condoms and I left to go to the toilet. I walked to a cubicle as the one next to it flushed and a guy walked out. I thought it was weird but I went in anyway. He washed his hands and walked towards the door but didn't leave. I then saw the feet of the girl in the cubicle next to me hanging and it sounded like she was choking and then it stopped. I text Dad saying 'guy in here, dodgy, come here'. I waited for a bit and then I got up and walked out towards the door. Then Dad opened the door and I left with him. Then a heap of others and I were on this little train and then the tracks ended and were replaced with some weird thing then we were walking over it. As we were going back the train started coming and we got off. Then Sylar (Heroes) was gay and had killed his boyfriend by putting him through a mulcher like machine. I met him at one point and liked him so helped him but he ended up turning himself in because he missed his boyfriend. Then I was Sarah (Chuck) and he was being held in this weird room with a guard. I went in and I told him to go but he refused. There was a cat in there too. The guy came back and saw the cat and he was like 'come on sweetie; let's get you out of here'. Sarah could turn invisible and I was thinking 'I thought she had a different power'. I had asked Sylar at one point what he did with his boyfriend and it had something to do with a lathe. I was starting to like him a bit and then he stopped to do something and this thing blew up killing him. I was upset and angry at this. I left and there were police digging up bodies in this forest area. There was also this funny message that he had left on my phone and I kept listening to it, crying and laughing."
"3517"	"(2010-07-05 (19)) Ezra and I were playing this game on the computer. It looked like World of Warcraft. We were randomly assigned roles. The first two games that we played I got the same thing and it was the easiest role. The setting was like outside a castle and this big door/gate would open and all these flying things like gargoyles would come in. We were at desks. The third time I got a different role where I had to fly and I also had to choose the appearance of our flag and my character's appearance. I picked this guy with a black handlebar moustache and black hair etc. I got this thing that was like a stake and had to stab these blog things on the left side. Some guy complained when I did it. Then we had a teacher who was Jack Black and he started singing a song about R2-D2 and someone said that he was made of aluminium."
"3518"	"(2010-07-06 (19)) I was doing a quest on World of Warcraft. When I logged on I was underwater and this big thing started fighting me. I got down to 2000hp quickly but then I killed it. I had some other quests underwater and it spawned quickly and started coming over so I left the area. This guy who was an alien or something, came over to where I was. He shook my hand and I fell to the floor with an orgasm which lasted for a minute. I couldn't move. There was a Sporcle quiz on all the types of characters in Joss Whedon shows including demons, names of demons etc."
"3519"	"(2010-07-06 (19)) I was out with this guy and a couple. We are at a shop. There was like a party on and one section was all lit up but the rest of the shop was dark. This other guy was following me. I went off to the stationery section which was dark. He was talking to me and seemed nervous and friendly. I think he was a security guard. He walked away, but then he ran over and grabbed my arms. He was strong and pushed me to the ground to rape me and I screamed loudly and high pitched and he let me go. I had gotten changed a while back and was looking for my old clothes. Eventually the shop closed and it was just me and my friends there. It was now totally dark. The party was illegal/not allowed and there was one security guard outside who we had to avoid. We ran out to the car and the alarm went off. Their car wouldn't unlock so we got into mine and I drove off. Later, I was playing Frontierville and the 'Gold Rush' had opened. I started clearing stuff and there were some crops already planted. Jeremiah had helped out and I was like 'oh, that's why he hasn't been leveling up' (because there was a separate leveling system on 'Gold Rush' and he had been playing there instead)."
"3520"	"(2010-07-06 (19)) Mom opened up a pet shop thing. There was a small circular ramp leading inside and you had to crouch. There were mice and snakes etc. Ezra was there. A snake climbed inside a mouse. I ran up and asked Mom what to do but she wasn't listening. I asked why I hadn't been given a job there. There was a new band called 'New Brothers' and it was made up of 'the three remaining Beatles' and another guy. The only dead Beatle was George. Someone mentioned that one was no longer with us and everyone was silent and got upset."
"3521"	"(2010-07-07 (19)) There was a picture of Dan Aykroyd in Ghostbusters and he was really young, but it wasn't actually him. I had a different car. I was driving and had a bad accident. I got out of my car and was dizzy etc. Mom called this person to get help and they asked what kind of car I had and Mom made a joke while explaining to them, that I had gotten the car that was more like a 'work car' model which was less safe, but didn't look as lame. They started joking and chatting with her. I was trying to take photos of the accident."
"3522"	"(2010-07-07 (19)) I was on the beach. Quentin Tarantino had a stand with a back room for watching movies. Dad knew him. Mom and I went down there and she recognized him and was like 'what's his name?' and I said ""Quentin Tarantino!"" and she asked ""Are you a fan of [babble] ?"" and Dad was then there and said I was a fan and Quentin said I could come by one day and watch some movies."
"3523"	"(2010-07-09 (19)) I was at home which was different. We all stayed up late. Darren went to bed first because he had to get up early for work. Mom was watching TV. I watched some Queer as Folk (UK), but it was different. It was just Stuart and I was like 'where's Vince?'. The lesbians were played by different people. Ezra watched a bit and thought it was lame. There was no sex in the episode. There was a bit with Stuart and Vince on a road trip or something and they were making out in the back seat. Ezra went to bed next I think. We had mice. Their box could be changed around by clicking and dragging as if it were on a computer. They all escaped as I was changing it around. Then they were kittens. Rover was in my room and I tried to close the door so he couldn't get at them and I could round them up, but some went in there and Rover chased them. The toilet was next to the kitchen (well, the toilet was in the room next to the kitchen). I went to the toilet and Darren came into the kitchen and I pulled the door closed a bit. I used the last bit of toilet paper. There were lots of tissue boxes. I went to my computer and my wallpaper was of Firefly, but you could add extra people. I had Dan Aykroyd's character from The Blues Brothers on there and some other guys."
"3524"	"(2010-07-10 (19)) This girl was watching a movie. The movie was made by Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin was in it. It was also similar to Time Bandits, even though I haven't seen it yet. She blew bubbles and in one of the bubbles was this explorer gnome guy and his pets. They came out of the bubble. She became friends with them and kept them on a top shelf. Then it was years later. Now had actually been this guy who was a friend of mine and who I liked. We were down in his 'basement' cleaning. The small people were helping us because they had extra strength or something. We were all moving furniture like shelves and tables etc. We finished with the heavy stuff and put the little people on the top shelf. I left to go up to this building and I had to walk up this walkway up high. I looked through the window of the basement at him and he looked too. I went into the building which was like a shop. I saw this lady in there watching me. The shop was closed by the way. I got in the elevator and hit '5'. She started walking up the stairs so I hit stop and then '1' and started going back down. I ran to the front door and she chased me. She caught me and carried me to the window and pushed me against it so everyone could see. Then she took me over to the edge of the walkway, but I pushed my feet against the railing to stop from getting too close. She claimed she was his ex-girlfriend and they had had sex etc and I was like 'I don't care!'. She was lying though. I don't know happened then but Mom, Fug and I went to a supermarket. Fug was in a pram and I was in another pram with a blanket. I had been cold and my legs were sore and that was why I was in a pram. We went down an aisle a teenage guy followed us calling Fug an ugly baby (to Mom). I got sick of the pram and got out. The guy left and I asked Mom what happened and she said he had asked what kind of baby I was and tried to make it sound like he had called me ugly. We got potato chips. There were lots of open bags. We went to the checkout and all the things we had gotten were the same colour and Mom said ""it's so yellow"" and I said ""and red"". I told Mom to tell the guy about the open bags and he said that he was having a party and we could come. We realized it was a bribe so we wouldn't say anything about this razor we had also found before. I was watching Penn & Teller sometime later. It was an episode about not speaking. Teller was miming to someone talking and was swearing at Penn."
"3525"	"(2010-07-11 (19)) Ezra woke up at 3 AM to go to work. I had two puppies, a brown one and a yellowish one. I was going to call them Stuart and Vince after the characters from Queer as Folk (UK) but I realised the brown one was a girl. Ezra had been looking after her. The names I was considering now were Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks), Kaylee (Firefly) or River (Firefly). I decided to go with Ezra for a bit. He was driving. He stopped at a house and they took him the rest of the way. I ended up at a friend of Mom's. I called her to get me. The clock said 12 PM but that was wrong. I heard the opening theme song of Queer as Folk (UK) and I turned around to see it playing on the TV and it was a scene with Stuart. I watched a bit of it."
"3526"	"(2010-07-11 (19)) I was at University which was different. I got Dad to bring me his laptop as he was nearby. The carpark was undercover. We went to the car. There was something about a 'crush' and it had something to do with Chris Barrie photos on my computer. A guy and a girl were near me and they had bright blue eyes and were pale. They said they were vampires and they showed their fangs. I told Dad and he was like 'whatever' but eventually he looked at them and realised. We went to leave. I wondered why no-one had known of vampires before then. We drove off and saw all these people running down the street followed by heaps of creatures. There were giant dogs, ogres (like in World of Warcraft), clouds etc. Some then decided to come our way. Then we were on foot and we ran. There were creatures everywhere. We were with some others. There was a ladder on a wall which was hard to climb and this female creature was following us easily. We got to the ground and ran. There was a big meeting on the oval for the creatures. We got past them and then suddenly there were no creatures. There were some little rooms so we went in one. We shut the doors but the windows had no glass. We got talking and realized that none of us had had sex before. One of the girl's was a 'popular' girl. We wondered why that would matter. One of us asked ""why is sex always a bad thing?"". Then we realized all the creatures were staring in at us. We ran. Later, it was shown that a moth had flown into the room, which supposedly made us visible because it had mated before. We got caught. They impregnated us with random guys. Tara from True Blood got impregnated by Eggs (True Blood). Sookie (True Blood) was impregnated with Sam (True Blood). This other girl liked Eggs and complained. There was this thing about Sam Trammell, which was Wikipedia like. The photos of him made him look gay. It said he was gay and also used to be a teacher. I don't know if it was true though."
"3527"	"(2010-07-12 (19)) I had a job interview at McDonald's. It was done by two girls. People in the shop were being loud and people were coming in and one of the girls yelled that the job interview was taking place. I was embarrassed and I wasn't sure how it was going. The meaner one left. The chocolate in the sundae machine was spilling and mixing with the ice cream and I warned her. I was only allowed to work for a maximum of 20 hours a week and I was thinking that I needed to change it so I could work longer. Some cop/forensic guy did something and someone called him a ""douche""? He marked this thing from 100 down to 71 thinking that no-one would notice and it got people in trouble originally, until they realized it measured itself automatically, so they double checked the machine's records with his. Then I was doing a dungeon with Ezra. Eugene and others were in a 'pub' nearby and when we were in the dungeon we could hear them talking. They were fans of the Harry Potter movies [note: last night there was a FilmForum video which used Harry Potter movies as an example] . There was this new thing with floating rooms. Couples usually rented them. It was unknown to them, but the walls were glass so they could see through and all the rooms would float together in this big 'room' (it was kind of like The Matrix). From the top, you could see everything. It showed some couples cuddling, kissing, some having sex and one guy was masturbating alone. Then Jason Segel and I were in a room. He was my boyfriend. We were having sex, on our side and he was behind me. I was watching Smallville and Clark said ""fuck"" twice and I thought that was weird. It was a weird, complicated episode. Then I was watching Queer as Folk. Hazel (from the UK one) was in it, and Michael (the US one) was her son. Then Mom and I were in the car and we went to one of her friends. They were trying to impress me and I was yawning."
"3528"	"(2010-07-13 (19)) This guy who looked like Christian Kane (although he was sometimes hot) and I were out at this club thing which was in the shape of a ship. When I showed the bouncer my ID he put his face right up to the card. It was night by the way. I don't know what happened but we were then outside in the carpark. I saw a Camry and got an idea to blow up all Camry's. We got to this car and I signalled him and then he came. I pretended to be drunk. This lady came over to it, and she was the owner of the car. He put a plastic bag over her head and killed her. We looked to the car for stuff, leaving personal belongings. Then we went to the next car which was a red, sports like, two-door car. He broke into it. Some others came and he killed them. Then a group of people came over and asked if we had seen anyone dodgy around. They opened the boot of a car nearby and saw two dead people sitting in the front seats and they freaked out. I pretended to be shocked as well. Then the Christian Kane guy started walking with a plastic bag and was then get them before he realised that there were more people around. He said we had to go and we took the sports car. I asked ""is this really the most inconspicuous car?"". There were p-plates on and I took them off. The car drove fast and smooth. People were everywhere in the carpark. Later a sketch of some guy was going around the news and I was trying to find out what it looked like to make sure that it wasn't him, but it didn't look like him."
"3529"	"(2010-07-13 (19)) I watched the sunrise. There were red flames and you could watch without hurting your eyes. I asked Mom if she had seen it and she said she hadn't. I had taken a photo. Darren was there. The house was like the old house. I was in the bathroom and Mom came in and she had extra rings on. They were silver diamond-y ones (like gangster's wear)."
"3530"	"(2010-07-14 (19)) University was different and was where North Midvale Primary School is. I was walking down and I was wearing shorts and a jacket. I had forgotten my water bottle. I heard Calvin talking. Some other people and I sat with Elijah and some other people I knew. My phone was a touch screen and I accidentally called this girl nearby. I slid the bar on the phone across to hang up. The principal lady asked ""how would you introduce yourself to someone in America?"", someone said ""Hey, what's up?"" but she had meant someone important, ie to use ""yes, please, Sir"" etc. Eugene had an account on some dating site and I went on it and saved all his photos. I made a fake account and added him as a friend. There was a new quiz thing and I went on to see his results but he hadn't done it. My real account had photos of me and some guy. It was then some guy and girl who were together. They had a small apartment in New York. I ate lots of lollies 30 minutes ""before the start of this dream [I can't remember what word I used] "". Then I was at the old house and Dad still lived there. Ezra and I went over for a bit. Dad asked who it was he normally talked about from work and I said ""that young guy"" and was thinking of Jim from The Office. We got our stuff together to leave. The garage door was open a bit and Dad closed it. As we drove off, the front door flew open. The radio was playing Mambo Sun. I was then with Mom and Ezra and we called Dad to tell him, but we said that it had flown off."
"3531"	"(2010-07-14 (19)) For some reason, I was watching Hot Tub Time Machine [note: I haven't seen it, nor am I interested in seeing it] . Then it was real. Everyone was running from someone into a building with different rooms behind these curtains. I was there too and ran into a room with mirrored walls and I could see everyone else. I then woke up in bed in a house with the shutters on the window opening. I was married to Harrison Ford (who was one of the people who were running before). We wondered why we were partnered up and I was annoyed I hadn't been paired up with Eugene. There was dog poo on the floor. We had a little dog, who was old, and had liver problems."
"3532"	"(2010-07-14 (19)) I was at 'school'. Calvin and others were sitting on these steps. Then I was younger and Ramona and I were given our reports. Mine said 'obesity' and had drawings of exercises to do. I yelled back at the teacher and then decided to wag. I got to King Road from across the reserve, and was near Wellington Street or whatever it is. Ramona had come with me and she went off to her house. Then I was in a class and I was about four, but had gone back in time. There was a thing on the wall which had birthday cards for the teacher. I realized he was gay. I laughed and read out the card which had long, weird words, one of which was ""totalitarian"". He was amazed that I was reading the words so fluently and got me to read out more. As this was happening, some kid fell out of the window. Then I was driving and I followed this car into this mechanic place. It was a police car and I parked next to them. I said it was a magic trick. There was a piece of meat and I pretended to be a character from From Dusk Till Dawn and made a slurpy noise. I laughed. I was still four by the way. We were near a beach. I went to this food hall place. There was a guy who looked like Jason Segel."
"3533"	"(2010-07-17 (19)) I was at home. Emery and other people were outside and Ezra was talking to them. I went back to school and Ms Bigwood was chatting to me and said ""oh, you haven't changed yet"" and I replied ""I'm not going to"". There was a lake thing with crocodile heads. I left my car at Midvale petrol station for some reason (it was different). Some time ago I had hacked two games by typing this word in some 'code' and then it gave it a virus? One day, in Japan there was something that was sold to ""topless [it looks like it says venlon?] "". Later when I went back to my car there was stuff missing from my bonnet. Something in the shape of a symbol had been taken off. Then Dad was there and I showed him and said that my car had been there all day. He asked them if they knew anyone around you like to steal ""hubcaps"". Two guys got into separate arguments and seemed violent so I got into my car and locked the doors. Dad got in the car and we decided to leave. As soon as I got on to Princess Rd it started pouring (like in The Passing stage of Left for Dead 2 which I played yesterday). I kept driving and we ended up at Nana's. It was no longer raining. We went in and usually the first room was the kitchen but it had changed. I was confused about it. Poppa was in the room watching TV. To the left was the kitchen and dining room and the room straight ahead had another TV in it and led outside to a pool. I said that I didn't like it and Dad was like 'don't be rude'. Nana hadn't liked the kitchen and had gotten rid of the long cupboards and the long benches. It was annoying because everybody seemed like they were in the same room. Granny was there and she had very grey/silver hair. I was thinking she was supposed to be dead, but wasn't sure. There were kids in the pool. We watched some Gossip Girl. Chuck and Blair danced at a dance thing. Jenny was dancing to some hip hop music."
"3534"	"(2010-07-18 (19)) I was out the front and Josephine was there. She had a bag from Bunnings and she said ""oh I have a job there"" and I said I might and she was like 'I don't care'. I said I needed money and she was like 'that's why you're doing it? My parents give me all the money I need'. I said 'so do mine, but I want my own'. She said that her family had a maid."
"3535"	"(2010-07-18 (19)) I was at a park with Dad. There were horses around. It was in the UK. Then Ezra was there too. We were on holidays. Ezra was staying there for study. He dropped us off at school. It looked cold but it was hot. I went back to the hotel and I went inside where the staircase was. There was some event on next to it. There was a queue to get in. There was a table for food and I grabbed a lamington and a brownie. Dad went up the stairs while I was doing that but then the guy wouldn't let me through and I said that my Dad had just gone through and he asked if I had proof and I said no. He asked 'what about your Mom?' and she came and they let me go through. I was like 'I'm 19!'."
"3536"	"(2010-07-19 (19)) I was outside somewhere. There were clouds and they were very vivid and very dark grey. There was a storm coming and I had to get inside. I found cover and then started pouring down. Then it was The Soprano's and I was at their house which was different. I went to the toilet and there were two doors to it. I opened one door and someone pushed back and I realised Meadow was in there. Later I went out and then it was a movie and this girl and guy were separated from each other. They were both under separate cover from the rain but to get to each other they had to walk a fair way outside. I was seeing from the girl's point of view and she went up the stairs and around to him. They kissed and hugged and then went to go find better cover. Then Farrah had been seen this guy but Justin Bieber was staying in the same area and she liked him. She snuck out one night and I saw her. She ran into a room but I heard someone coming and I hid behind a pillar. They went away and I ran into the same room. She was hiding under the bed and I joined her. Someone came in but as they were leaving they caught us. Her mother was angry and yelling at both of us and I yelled at her while I was alone with her saying 'big deal'."
"3537"	"(2010-07-20 (19)) I was coming back on a plane with Ezra. As we were landing we were going towards stuff that was on the runway and the pilot turned and we spun around and went into the water. We got out easily. I went to the toilet and I wrote this letter and donated this book etc and then put it in the bin. I changed my mind and took them back. I went through a scanner thing and it beeped so I emptied all my stuff. This lady said ""I miss Michael (she was reading from my letter)... Have you got a boyfriend?"" and I said ""No"". There was a wig with my stuff and I said ""oh, that's not mine"". Mom was there too. Also, she would send Rover on flights all the time because he liked them."
"3538"	"(2010-07-21 (19)) I was at home. A few days ago I found out that Ezra had been having the exact same dream that I had last year. He had written one down that sounded familiar and I was pretty shocked by it. Mom was around and we were all discussing it and I realized it was exactly the same. I was thinking 'how the hell am I supposed to talk about this' and I thought of sending something off to DreamResearch."
"3539"	"(2010-07-21 (19)) I was watching the first episode of Big Brother UK. Some of the contestants went into a backyard and were kidnapped. They were let out when they stood up to the kidnappers. Lea Michele was one of them and introduced herself as Rachel Berry and shook the kidnapper's hands. Then Mom and I were at a newsagency. They used calculators. A song called 1756 was playing. The guy accidentally gave us a $100 note which had been meant for the people behind us. It was yellow. We left without realizing though. We were walking away and we realized they were following us. We went through the Northtown McDonald's carpark (different) and down the road and this path up ahead was forest-like. We walked through the park and there were these big black plastic forks and I grabbed one. We ended up also walking through a school. We got to an office and David Bowie was behind the desk and he had calculator like mine. Ezra tasted it and it was actually cream. We gave the money back to the Natives (the people following us) and it was now just a guy and a boy."
"3540"	"(2010-07-22 (19)) I was at home at the end of the driveway near the wall. I had a rope to go across which was tight and in a triangular shape for me to walk across. Granma visited and commented on it. I was a spy or something. I can't remember what I did, but people left my stuff in a plastic bag in the middle of a busy shop. I found it and it had my phone, chocolate and keys in it. I went out to go to my car and this dodgy guy was outside. This other girl was out there and he asked her where some car was and she pointed and he went over. I went to my car and he came over and I unlocked it and he ran to the passenger side and I locked it. He ran over and I scratched and stabbed him with the key. I ran back into the shop and he stayed outside. Every time I went out, he was out there waiting. I asked some girls to distract him or sleep with him. They said no, and I said ""but it's Adam Baldwin! Who doesn't want to hang out with Jayne?"". Eventually I went out to confront him. Then it was a short time later and we were dating. He told me had actually liked me more every time I had gone out. I was like 'zomg *sigh*'. Also, I watched this episode of Misfits, but I only remember seeing Robert Sheehan and I was like ""I can feel it in my balls!""."
"3541"	"(2010-07-22 (19)) It was night and raining and I was driving Ezra somewhere but I was letting him drive. I told him to pull down the next street so we could swap because it was illegal. We did and I turned around and stopped behind some cars at the lights. I got out to take the L-plates off. There was a car behind me and I took off slowly and turned left. I was trying to find my way around. We ended up in a hospital and I couldn't work out how to get out. This lady said she would help but we had to sign up for this course etc. We ran away and she got angry. We ended up in a street and one side was decorated 'spooky' because it was some area that did something like the Royal Show. There were cartoon-ish cars. Then we were with Mom and Roland and I asked what he was doing and he said ""drunk"" and offered me apple pie. I said I'd have half of it. I asked if anyone had found this photo album/magazine which had photos of celebrities and I remembered it from this night ages ago where I had been on that creepy street. James Spader had been there and people had said they liked him and he said ""it was my brother that you liked"" etc -- his brother had died. There was also a professional photo of Milo Ventimiglia. They were mostly all candid though. There was also a photo of Jason Segel and one of Neil Patrick Harris meditating and he was really skinny."
"3542"	"(2010-07-23 (19)) I was at home but it was a bit different. There was a dog door on the front door. Rover kept running out. Ezra and Fug were there. This other Labrador ran over to the house and I let Rover in and then shut the door. This lady from across the road came and got the dog and asked ""which one's your dog?"" and I said ""Rover, a Lab"". Spaceman was near the other dog. She asked how big Rover was.  There was a movie called Silimidia, but I got confused and thought it was Suspiria. When I pressed two fingers on my arm, hard, they would 'merge' and turn into a tongue and one started coming out of my arm. I said ""Do you know how hard it is to lick yourself?"" Then I laughed and shook my head [at the double meaning] . Fug put her hand on Ezra's arm and everyone was like 'aw'. Later I went to university. There were lots of others in the class. It was a class with labs and we all had different numbers. The teacher guy was calling out names and said ""Izzy"" and I said ""yes"" and then he said ""Izzy Conell"" and I said ""oh... yes"". The other Izzy was 'Connor'. Elijah was there and was sitting next to me. The teacher called me outside. I had to draw/colour something. This teacher/guy came in and the teacher said he was in the wrong place and he left and everyone laughed."
"3543"	"(2010-07-24 (19)) I was at home, but it was on Barlow Way and was different. I was at the end of the driveway and Mom had just left to walk Rover. I followed her up the street to the end of the neighbours and then started to walk back. There was a baby on the road and it grabbed my finger and I couldn't run and it kept doing it and I got angry and yelled. Oskar (our real next door neighbour, the creepy one) came out saying like 'you smacked my baby!' and I said that I didn't. He threw this rock which bounced over the wall out the front of the house across the street and hit the wall of the house (only a small whack). He sat down on this chair at the front of the wall in front of his house and said 'you left my baby on the road' and I was like ""What the hell? You did, it's your baby, not mine"". He just sat there calmly and not listening to me. I spoke calmly and said ""she wrapped her finger around my thumb and it was like, if you were working and someone was knocking on your wall every few seconds it would drive you crazy"". Suddenly, he was enlightened and apologized. I told Mom about it alter. We had basically become 'friends' now (ie, they wouldn't dob us in etc). It started raining and we hid out in my car. There was fog and I took a photo with my phone."
"3544"	"(2010-07-25 (19)) I had changed my Facebook status a while ago. I had released a book and I had said that I got an e-mail about it and I had been like 'what the hell, oh that'. Seamus said he had gotten it too and had forgotten who I was. Another status of mine said I had woken up with $55 in my bank account and it said I had spent the rest on sex -- one night stands two days in a row. One of the guys had been black? I think I was pregnant."
"3545"	"(2010-07-25 (19)) Dad, Ezra and I were in a 'new' area. It was night. We heard someone cry for help and Dad went to go check it out. I heard growling ""like a dog"" so I went the other way. It started chasing us. Dad told us to hide and we all went with him. It attacked us and we went behind a fence. We heard water and it started to flood up to the trees. It was a thing for University students to get money. I had another week of work experience at a vet. There were lots of people there. I was in a room with my bag on a chair. They told me to leave it and this guy made me a new sandwich. There was a meeting for everyone which was about 15 people. Some of them were called ""the Down's syndrome's"". Some sat on chairs and some had to sit on the floor; I sat on the floor. There was a chair stacked with sandwiches. I got mine and it was gross, it had cucumber and lettuce. They discussed Dr Horrible, saying that Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion could sing but Felicia Day could not. Someone said she ""started off good then Izzy'd"". I asked what they meant and the receptionist was called Izzy. Later I went to tell them that my shift was over while they were operating. It was a male vet and they had a dog under anaesthesia on the table. The top layer of his skin was off. On Facebook someone said they were going ""to meet Bella"". I think it was Aliyah. Some kid was angry about a Dolly magazine."
"3546"	"(2010-07-25 (19)) I was at dads, which was different. He was watching some show and it showed this guy 'killing' a pig and he was covered in lots of blood and I thought he looked a bit like Michael Palin. Later, it showed him again and I realized it was him and I clapped excitedly and said ""Michael Palin, my favourite person in the world"". I was reading about Jabberwocky and it had been made in 1928 and Michael Palin was actually born in 1914. I was confused about this and was thinking 'I'm sure he was born in 1943'. Terry Jones' real last name was Chalice and he was born in 1914 too. John Cleese was born in 1911. I couldn't remember Graham Chapman's name, but then I did. Dad cut my hair and then gave me this red and orange wig to wear. He was wearing one too and was like, in drag. I left and my car was American. Obama was around outside and I asked if anyone ever didn't recognize him. He said one time he had said hello to this black Christian lady but he had sung some religious song and she had said that he was a good singer and that he should join their choir. We laughed and he said it was embarrassing. I left and was having trouble driving, though I had driven the car fine in the US. The road was full of boxes and I drove over them. I saw one with Tom Conell on it, from January. I pulled over and took another car. I got home and I asked Mom to take me back to get the car. She said no because she was babysitting. Darren had the baby and it was called Kaylee and he said he would take me in a minute."
"3547"	"(2010-07-26 (19)) We didn't own our house. It was different too. They were designing a new house? Mom, Darren and I went out the front. It was night. There were two of these long things together (I think it says pole) and we took photos outside with it."
"3548"	"(2010-07-26 (19)) Mom and I were watching The Terminator on Blu-Ray, but it was different. I said it looked good and Mom said she preferred it ""old school"" and I said I was going to say that. She said it felt ""more candid"" and I said 'yeah, Blu-Ray is too stylized' and then ""What do you call it when they make people pose?"". Also I was with Dad and Ezra and I wanted ice-cream but they forgot me and told me to go out and get it myself. Some others and I were on the run. We didn't know each other before this. They kept getting killed. I liked a few of them. There was a guy called Dave and he was interested in this girl. He was nice and I was thinking that I'd like to get to know him after this. Then it was night. We were outside and we took the train home. All the lights were off and we quietly moved around the carpark. We saw someone and someone said to try and get into a car. Someone picked up a log and smashed it into the window. This girl ended up getting a bit in the corner and it broke. We opened the doors and got in. Dave was on the driver's side and the person got him and he died and fell out. We locked the doors and the girl got in the driver's seat and we left. We got to some building and I said ""I keep thinking I'd like to get to people and then they die!"" She went to go to the toilet and there were lots of mirrors. I thought something was up. She was getting attacked by River (Firefly). I got a knife and she threw these spinning spiky things. I had this thing which looked like a pen but it had a soft bit at the end which vibrated and I used it to disable the thing she had thrown. She left the girl to attack me. I pushed her into an elevator and called to the girl and she disabled it and closed the door and I sent it down."
"3549"	"(2010-07-27 (19)) I was watching a movie/TV show. Aidan Gillen was outside and there was some song he danced to. I said that it should've been Santa Maria. Mom was watching too and I said ""that's the main guy in Queer as Folk UK. Gale Harold plays his character in the US version""."
"3550"	"(2010-07-27 (19)) There were zombies. I was in a shop with others and we were living there (it was just a food store). There was this cereal with blue cockroaches in it. Then I time traveled and Mom and Dad were there and they were young. I had to make them meet each other. Then I was back with the zombies and we had to leave. This guy and ran toward this forest. There wasn't much space between the trees when you got down far in the forest. The zombies were fast, but if you touched them they would pretty much crumble. We ran into the forest and hit them with branches. It started getting harder running between the spaces. There were heaps of zombies in there and we killed them all. Some wandered over to us and let us try to kill them but I couldn't stab through them. We eventually got them though. We had gamer-tags (like on X-Box 360) and one guy was called Erik-Sto (Erik Stolhanske) and he would get dares. Someone dared him to go back to this original tag and he said he was actually Michael Jackson. Then I found this community and I was staying with them. Jared Padalecki and Genevieve Cortese were getting married and everyone was outside the 'borders' and they spoke quickly, kissed and then everyone went back in. He broke down and cried and said ""it's not happening"" and she asked ""us?"" and cried and she said ""no"" and she cried out ""forever?!"" and he said he was dying and probably had about 6 months to live. One day it was really hot and the curtain was open and bright light was shining in."
"3551"	"(2010-07-28 (19)) Ezra and I became door-to-door salesman for fences. A guy bought some from me. Some lady's husband had gotten leprosy from a friend who went crazy. He didn't recognize anything and was basically a vegetable. I had gotten famous for some reason. I had Twitter, and a tweet of mine was rated the 5th most popular tweet. I had lots of others in the list too. Dad had some too. There was this group of guys that would get people pregnant and then you would bring the baby's and they would rebirth it? I went to one place and Eric (True Blood) and two other vampires were there. They were holding someone, I think. The person they were holding was trying to convince them to let them turn him. I told them not to do it. Eric got angry and went close to me. He liked me though, I think, and he punched me in the face. Then I was Sookie (True Blood) and there was a close-up of her nose. Pam was there too and she said ""it only takes a bit of blood"" (to excite them). Sookie said ""well, it's coming"" (as in, her nose was going to bleed)."
"3552"	"(2010-07-30 (19)) I was at an ice-cream shop. Mom and I went there to get this drink like an ice chocolate, then we got another. Then we went back for another one, but I changed my mind. Later I was at this place involved with animals (maybe a pet shop). There was a snake in a container and I asked someone what to do with it and this lady said I couldn't do anything with it because I didn't have a snake license. Later I was at university in a lecture theater. There was a big storm outside so heaps of us were sleeping there. This lady said the whole world was going to flood. Two of the teachers slept in another room. I saw water starting to come in through gaps in the wall. I went to the other room and the carpet was slightly wet and I told her what was happening. She came to look and it stopped raining. We ended up leaving at some point. There were crazy people with long hair we had to watch out for (I think everyone with long hair was crazy). We were trying to work out where to go, etc. I can't remember the journey, but this girl ended up with a backpack and was leading us, which I was annoyed about. We ended up in this shop and we went into the elevator. These two crazy, long-haired Asian girls came and started singing some pop song and we kept hitting the close button. Eventually someone came and distracted them and we went up. They came up the stairs and we went down a level. Some others were already down in this place. I followed, crawling along on my stomach. These people went up the stairs to a little section (not another floor, but like a balcony), but they saw us. The girl who had been leading us was called Izzy too. This girl with the other people asked for ""Izzy the Leader"" and asked who I was, ""Greek?"" and I said ""no"" and she said ""Izzy the Not-Greek"". She got a box for the other Izzy and I guessed ""dead rabbit"" and it was actually a rabbit toy, but it was screwed up. The brought a box of mine and I said ""oh no, not Grey"", but Grey was still intact. Calvin was there. We joked around and he asked if I knew ""two lesbians""."
"3553"	"(2010-07-31 (19)) I went to Chicken Treat for a work trial. There were no ""shifts"" (which actually meant places to work). The lady in charge didn't seem to care. She suggested putting me in charge of the ""Harry Potter section"". I said no and that I had other stuff to do anyway. I got in my car (in an underground like carpark) and was directed out. I ended up in this other bit of the shop, now on foot. There were 'forums', which were these little rooms to the side. There was one for Das Boot, Harry Potter and down the stairs was a new Joss Whedon one. Everyone was excited about the Harry Potter one. There was nothing of Joss Whedon's in his one yet. I called Mom to say I was trapped in the shop. I squatted over a bin and peed. I apologized to the others and put a towel in it. This guy opened a door which let us out. Mom was waiting and she had caught a taxi. I went off to the car and she came along saying that some guy needed the taxi so she let him take it. There was a big cruise ship parked next to the shop too (in water)."
"3554"	"(2010-08-02 (19)) I was at a party, which I think was at my place. My boyfriend was Josh Radnor and we kept sneaking off to have sex. He kept slipping into a dream and I told him to do a reality check if something was weird. In one of his dreams, he was in a room with me and I took orange juice out of the fridge and started drinking it. I disappeared and he couldn't read the words on the juice box, so he did a reality check. When he woke up he asked me about lucid dreaming. Someone warned him that he could get addicted. They used me as an example and I said I did it as a hobby and I wasn't even good at it. Someone said about Christopher Nolan, ""spending 3 years to make a movie"". There was a tape of me when I was 2-4 with a psychologist. I hadn't seen it before."
"3555"	"(2010-08-02 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop. Ezra saw this spiffy Snorlax figurine and wanted it. I went to the back of the store with Rover and Mom and crawled through this maze of chains. I went back and Roland was there talking with the Indian guy who worked there about something. I had forgotten my socks so went back to get them. I went to the old house for a pizza delivery. There was a half dead magpie lying flat out on a branch on a tree near the garage. I said we had to take it to the vet, but it started flapping and squawking and scared us away. There was blood on it. We left and later Ezra was on MSN at the old house with Roland and others. They were making fun of me."
"3556"	"(2010-08-02 (19)) I was in the US on an exchange. I was walking down the street and saw Raquel and she asked if I wanted to come to the lake tonight. I said no. I went through a park with a lake and it had fish in it. I dipped my shoe in. I started back and it was around peak hour, but it was called something else like 'drinking time'. Everyone was rushing back. The school I was staying at had a 'hotel' lobby. There were four elevators. Others were waiting. One came and it was like leathery and wobbly. A woman said 'do any of you bother to help it before pressing the button? No? You die'. Someone joked about it going down and setting on fire. I slowly worked my way down. Each level was open. I got onto one level and a dark skinned adult guy was in this office. He led me to the woman's section on the third floor. A lady accused me of having stolen goods? I said I only just got the key for this level."
"3557"	"(2010-08-03 (19)) Dad and I had gone to this place a bit far away and a guy had given me a good haircut. He had asked us to take off our shoes. Then Mom and I went and he said 'no pants, shoes or shirts'. Mom started taking off her clothes and we saw some customers with clothes and I questioned it. He pushed us into some water and Mom pulled him in too. I was under a bit long and took a breath and choked. We got out. I had a boyfriend who looked like Bill (True Blood), but had a different name. I was thinking that a guy had attacked him. Now I was at 'home' and he passed out covered in blood. I called out to this guy to call an ambulance and when I looked back in the room, his face was completely bloody and he was dead. I went to the phone and dialed 911, then realised I was doing it wrong and got my mobile. I said I needed an ambulance and that my boyfriend had [whatever happened] and another guy had been involved. A girl there asked for me and she said her name was 'Rob's daughter' and told me Quincy was dead. Then she was there and in the room with me, as were Darren and another woman. She asked if she could tell her and I said yes and she told her and Darren at the same time. I went back to my boyfriend and waited for the ambulance. This family came. I said I had to go to the toilet, but it was open and the seat and wobbly and I couldn't go. I went back to Bill. I checked his pulse and temperature and noticed he was still alive. The girl from before came and she started saying all these weird things, then Bill woke up and was like 'you're fired' to me and the girl smiled. Then he pushed her out of the room and grabbed me and kissed me. He pushed me to the floor and we made out. Then I mentioned he was still covered in blood."
"3558"	"(2010-08-03 (19)) I was in a car with three girls. Then I was in media and Mr Billings said 'you should be in math'. We were watching some movie on DVD, but there were lots of video tapes there too."
"3559"	"(2010-08-03 (19)) I was with two guy friends and I liked one of them and thought he liked me too. We took a photo together. They took my clothes and left me with this formal dress, which I put on. Mom asked why I was wearing a dress and I explained. I chased after them. There was a mannequin wearing clothes and I took a plaid jacket. The other guy was joking about it, but being mean, then he said he wanted to have sex. Then it was a movie. Beckett (Castle) was me and he shot her and she ran off. She walked through this door and said to the police ""I'm shot"" twice. Then someone walked up and it was the beginning of the movie and they asked these people about it. At some point, Rover was eating pumpkin soup. There was a place with a bathroom with something soapy."
"3560"	"(2010-08-04 (19)) It was the future and it was very dystopic. I was with a girl friend and we were staying in a house. While we were out, we came across two other girls. They said they were 'good guys', but we realised they were lying and had this green rubbery thing to put over our hands. They got out while we went looking, but we got them back. We slept and kept our hands on them. Sometime after, they left during the night. It was my birthday and when I woke up, I saw they had left a note. I let one back in. One of them lived at this house. We said she could leave. We went to the front door and there was no back door. There was another opening. We threw something out and there was smoke. It was thick and started filling up everywhere outside. The backyard had wired fencing around it. We tried to breathe and choked. I ran in and grabbed scissors and cut the wire and it started to go. My friend went to the roof to fix the air filter thing. I saw other people on another roof."
"3561"	"(2010-08-05 (19)) I was on an exchange in the UK or US. I was hanging out with some people, including Calvin and Tiana. A bunch of us went to this place to vote for stuff. We got poster for what we voted for and waited outside. A plane was going to fly above saying what got accepted. All the things we voted for were accepted. Calvin, Tiana and I went to this cafe place. He ordered a vanilla and chocolate thickshake. My water bottle was almost empty. I sat with Tiana who was upset and he brought the drinks. I was then at home, but it was the old house. I was watching Entourage and Vince had a Swedish girlfriend called ""Kiri"" and he was lying in bed and she was going down on him. She was going fast and it was very graphic. He told her to stop and she said ""it looks so real"". I thought she meant his genitals, but then she said 'who is it?' and I think she was referring to an affair he was having. Dad commented on it later. Eric had a tumour or something and Sloane was upset/angry with him. He was driving and helped some family get to and from hospital. He pulled out on a busy road and a car nipped him. He continued driving and a huge pile-up started happening. There were flashes as he drove towards it. Then it showed him in hospital and his face and ears were messed up. I wondered if that was the end of the show."
"3562"	"(2010-08-06 (19)) It was night and it was spooky. I went to this Chicken Treat somewhere a while away. It was more like a booth than a store and there were two girls working there. I was walking and ordered at the speaker in the drive-thru. I was given this 'key' which was like a bullet. I ordered a chicken dinner, ""with nice peas and chips"". The girl serving said she didn't recognize me and I said I wasn't from around here. I kept looking around nervously. Then I heard a noise and it was coming from the top of a hill some way away. I realised it was zombies. It ended up getting close and was making gurgling noises. I went into the booth and one girl complained because it was cheating. I asked how it was cheating and she said that it knows where we are now and ran out. It chased her. The zombie looked like it had bad effects. When it attacked, it had this '80s' glow around it. I ran the other way. More zombies came. I kept running and ran into a house. I held the handle of the door up, and there were two doors, but only one had a lock. Then it was ages later and it was now a movie. The leader was a girl called Pinhead. There was a tough guy called Rook. At first I called them 'Sook and Mal'. We had been living there for a while. We were waiting for a zombie to die, but it didn't seem to be happening. I watched Zombi 2 and complained about Lucio Fulci and Michael Bay to Ezra. I joked that I was going to watch a Michael Bay film and he asked which one and I said I was joking."
"3563"	"(2010-08-07 (19)) I was with some others, including Ezra and a friend of his. It was night. I saw something weird happen, like a government cover-up. We were in a room with a laptop and the webcam was somewhere else and saw something else. People turned up and we shut the laptop off and quickly left. We hid under a ledge when someone was nearby. Some other people were going to hide out in some Native place, but we refused to go. There was a girl called Erin Poor who was about 6 years old and she had killed a girl with a syringe or something. She was there. I was then at the shop with Mom. I said to look for a ""little Chinese man"". Daryl and a guy were outside too."
"3564"	"(2010-08-08 (19)) Ezra and I went for a very long drive somewhere. Then I was at a school. Then it was a movie and a guy went there late one night to drop off an assignment. There was some security and they pointed to a teacher's window. He knocked and handed it in. Then it was day. A girl there that he kind of liked was going out with a mean guy who didn't like him. They told him they filled his car up with toilet paper, but he ordered them to take it out. Then I was at a shop. A guy said to me ""do you like games?"" and I waved him away. It was Michael Caine. He followed me to my car and a friend joined me. It was a red Mazda. There was stuff in it and I said it was probably planted and we drove off. The roads were weird. At one point, the other lane had big chips all over it. A billboard shot out onto a two lane road, but then it was only one lane. Noddy was on it. When I got home, I told Mom that she owed me a lot, ""about $100"" and she paid me $1 every time I said a certain word."
"3565"	"(2010-08-10 (19)) I got a job at Chicken Treat. I went out the back to the girl's toilet and there was only one and a girl was in there. I waited for her to leave and went in. I couldn't close the door and these other girls came in. I found out that the store was a cover and it was some weird sex place. The pay was good. There was a room with food; there were biscuits, kiwi fruit and other fruit. Some girl had been attacked by another girl at a party and had lost her boyfriend. She had a problem because of it. Ezra tried to work out what my job was, but only Mom knew."
"3566"	"(2010-08-11 (19)) It was around 2.30am. I was watching an episode of Six Feet Under. I remember Claire and Nate, and Claire was a bit chubby. I was on my bed, reading a book in the dark. I had an ensuite and saw a creepy shadow. I went to Ezra's room and asked to sit on his bed and read. His door opened a bit later, but made no noise. Then a girl walked by and I tried to scream, but it was barely a squeak. I shut the door and locked it. She tried to open it (she was a ghost). Another one came and the door flung open. She had the shape of a cross on her face in blood. She was a 'star'. They said the star was 22 degrees and there was no nuclear thing, so couldn't develop water on them. I took her to the shop and I waited in the car. She got back and we had to wait at a set of lights to leave the carpark. I said she was worse than Dad to drive with, then said 'no, he's worse'. I was watching Spiderman or something. A guy found this ring to time travel with and James Franco found it and was using it."
"3567"	"(2010-08-12 (19)) Dad decided to leave for our holiday tomorrow. I was packing and was washing some clothes (we were at the old house). Mom said I couldn't pack wet clothes especially yellow ones because they would fade. I realised I had no books on my iPhone, but Dad said he had some. We got to the plane and Dad had the tickets, but the pilot said we needed proof that we had bought them. Luckily Dad had some. We stopped somewhere and Dad said it was 'Nottinghamshire or Ireland' and I said that I think it's Singapore."
"3568"	"(2010-08-12 (19)) Ezra, Roland and I were waiting for Mom. Ezra got bored, so he started driving. He went up towards Woodside, but all the roads were different and long. We parked at a dentist. He walked through and came back out. Then we were at home, but it was different. I saw a guy at the door in the mirror. I hid, but then he was inside. He had a letter. It said I had to sleep with Roland or the ""world would die"" and I said ""screw the world"" and said I wouldn't do it. I asked if he was human and he said he used to be. Then I was somewhere, sitting behind a waterfall. Roland came and was talking to me. Ezra and some douchey friends of his came and they all ended up naked in the water. I got out. A friend of mine was seeing Kevin Bacon and he was ""36 months"" older than her. She had rejected him when she was younger and said she had gone back when she was 3 ""to kiss you"". She leaned over to kiss him and I closed the door and left. Something was happening like in The Stuff. Some others and I weren't affected. Your eyes went blue when you weren't eating it. Ezra's friends asked if I wanted some and I said I did, but then ran off. I walked to a booth and took a cylinder of cookies and cream. A guy asked why I wasn't eating the Stuff and I said I liked to eat 'not so great' stuff rather than eat 'delicious' Stuff. He was hyper and crazy. Another girl there had gotten over the Stuff. People would get mad if you weren't eating it. There was a truck going down the street in the shape of a pig. This guy ran across the roof saying ""I love you, let's never part"" or something. He was an old family friend, but looked old and different now -- I assumed it was from drugs. I went inside and told a friend and said 'you look like a duck'. He was then Gio (Ugly Betty) said 'you told me that before'. He was short and we seemed flirty. Nana was there."
"3569"	"(2010-08-14 (19)) Something had infected people like an Invasion of the Body Snatchers kind of scenario, but I'm not sure if they were taking over the body or replicating the body. I was at Nana's, but it was sometimes school. There were lots of rooms with ensuites. My room didn't have one. Ezra had one, so I went to it as I needed to pee. I was pretending that I didn't know some of them were like that and followed them. They lead me into the middle of this place surrounded by fences. They let lions in there and there was a wooden bit on the door. I smashed it and climbed through. I ran into a closed alley. Nana looked out through a window and I told her to come and help. I discovered that they were killed easily; one was in the alley, so I threw plant pots at them and sprayed something in their eyes. I had a gun and pointed it towards them and pulled the trigger, but there were no bullets. I cracked a plant pot over their head and they shattered. Nana came down and as a test, I hit her on the arm, but nothing happened. We got in a car and locked the doors. I told her to just keep on driving."
"3570"	"(2010-08-15 (19)) I was at university. There was a big lecture in a small room. There was a canteen outside with hot dogs with weird curly cheese. I asked ""how much are they?"" and they said ""$2.50 and 25c"". I found a door that lead to the carpark and there were a few cars, but mine wasn't there. There were three carparks. I ran to another one on the other side of the university and it was book and ocean themed? My car wasn't there either. I went to the last one and found it, but there was no licence plate on the back. It was near a cemetery. I called Mom, but she said she couldn't find the plate."
"3571"	"(2010-08-15 (19)) Dad still lived at the old house. I had stayed there and for some reason I was going to run out when he wasn't looking. I ran to my car and unlocked it, but accidentally locked it and then did it again. I climbed through the passenger side. He came out like 'what are you doing, I made you sandwiches' and I said 'oh, can I have them?'. He brought them out. He posted a thing later saying ""absolutely a big deal"" about when Jayne (Firefly) had thrown a game. There was a card for Mal, someone else and one of me and Simon? Mom drove to this place and parked on the side of the road. They sold silk, though it was actually squares of some other material. We picked up some kids? The eel was in the boot (it was like a hatchback) and floating around. We dropped the kids off and went home, but it was different. It had no doors and we had to slide these wooden things around. We had heaps of old people over. We went to dads and closed off the doors of car and let the eel out and ran inside. I asked Mom if he was inside yet, then we saw him float in. I was in the dining room. I ran down the hallway into my room. I remembered my computer wasn't there and ran into Dad's room instead. The eel came down the hallway, chasing me, and I closed the door."
"3572"	"(2010-08-16 (19)) I was in the car with Mom at a set of lights. I saw some flickers and it freaked me out. When I got to the lights, they turned red, but I went through anyway. The next ones were green. Then I was on foot, alone at night, and ran. I went down a street where people were throwing stuff. I had to go through a house to get back to the street. I went up some steps and couldn't find the house. I couldn't remember where I was and I was thinking it was a dream and saying ""this is a nightmare""."
"3573"	"(2010-08-16 (19)) I was at Nana's and watching TV with Ezra. It was different. A girl and a guy started playing Guitar Hero, the girl was really good and the guy sucked. Ezra didn't speak, but wanted the TV back. We left the room. Dad, Poppa and others were outside looking at something. Poppa did a pee. There were bees around. Nathaniel liked nurses and his shirt said 'Princess Nathaniel'. Later I was at home and I had an email from Myer for an interview and it said it was for 'Asia Pacific' and was just up the road. I had to fill out a form with weird questions like 'why do you like disabled people?' and I put 'strong mental power' and you had to write about things you loved. I told Mom and I said I didn't know whether to accept and she said I should because she would get discounts. I was colouring in a picture of Mario and Luigi. Aunt Sally asked me to drop her and a kid off at a cemetery down the road and I said ""I'm going to be late for university"". There was a TV show with Paul McCartney and he was the love interest of two young girls. David Lynch got some present for me, but Darren had lied to him about something and the present was something lame. He was upset."
"3574"	"(2010-08-17 (19)) I was sitting at a table outside with people from Entourage. I only remember seeing Eric and Ari though. Omar Epps and some others were there too. Eric was a lot shorter than me, so I was pretending he was a kid. I sat next to him and joked that he was lame and moved next to Omar. I accidentally splashed him. Then I was at Nana's and Ezra said they were taking the Cocky home. They were saying ""eat the poo poo"" and I recorded it. I showed Dad later. I was on Facebook and I had a photo of Ezra and Jensen Ackles. Scarlett commented on it and said Jensen had nice eyes. Jared Padalecki was on a photo too. I was watching TV with Mom and Jeremy Piven was on it talking and then it was some show with kids wearing lots of makeup."
"3575"	"(2010-08-18 (19)) I was at Nana's with Dad and Ezra. We were watching TV and something came on saying ""Malcolm, the bad cop(?)"". The presenter changed and something was 600px wide. We were eating food and there weren't many chips and this guy and I ate them all."
"3576"	"(2010-08-18 (19)) I was friends with Ted and Marshall (How I Met Your Mother). Neither of them were dating or married. We were at a house and I was lying on a bed with Ted chatting and Marshall was in another room. Ted was flirting with me. They both liked me, but I was supposed to end up with Marshall. There was a lot of stuff on the bed and I saw something eating some maggots and I jumped up screaming 'ew'. Ted grabbed them and put them in his mouth, joking. I was grossed out and screamed and ran to the room where Marshall was. Ted had followed and Marshall asked what was wrong and Ted opened his mouth. I ran out and then Marshall said I had a bloody nose and I grabbed a tissue and held it to my nose. He said to Ted ""help her"" and I said it would go away quickly. Then my friend, who was a dog but not, went somewhere. I was driving on my own through a school zone and there were lots of lollipop men and kept sliding into the other lane. There was a Russian lady and she said she was going to learn the rest of English today and mentioned something about movies. There was something about the French and one of her lovers being somewhere. Then I was with Ted and Marshall again. They were throwing sprinkles at a board which revealed something. The Klowns from Killer Klowns From Outer Space were around. Someone was poisoned and I got to level 3 of 5 for something. I went into a room with a boy and saw the Klowns coming out of hiding. I was going to run, but decided to help the boy. I attacked the Klowns and ended up in a mirror. My dog friend, who looked like a person, came in and I banged on the mirror and told him to get out. He ducked out the window and I was then on a train? The dog had to tell them where I was and they found out eventually and came back for me. Then I was watching the real How I Met Your Mother and it showed Robin and Barney years later. She looked old and not like her. They had a one night stand."
"3577"	"(2010-08-19 (19)) I rewatched The Dark Knight and it was actually good, but completely different. There was a scene where some rocks flew to the ground (it looked like a meteor shower) and it was then real life, and there was a long patch of grass where I was and Mom didn't get it as nice. A building flooded and we had to get out and managed to. But then something was happening everywhere and this guy, who I think was my boyfriend, and I went to dads, which was different, to find stuff to use. We had been told to keep towels and pillows on us and they were hard to carry. I found these pink/red net stockings and put them on. Extra clothes also helped. We couldn't lock the balcony door, but figured it didn't matter and left. It was night. The people next door were having sex. Then it was years later and we were both teaching at the same school. We had two sons and I said ""ok, don't listen to us"" during an argument. I was annoyed that we had 'normal' kids."
"3578"	"(2010-08-21 (19)) I was at the video shop in Parkville, but it was different and organized differently. The foreign movies were separate from genres. I was in an English aisle and found Yojimbo and Oldboy there. I grabbed them and then remembered that I'd seen them and put them back. I was looking for Paris, Texas. I found a section which had all season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and said ""I wonder if there's a Joss- [Whedon section] "" and then saw there was. There were two other girls and they wanted 'Keeping Julian' and there was an exchange which I can't read, but has something to do with Firefly, and then we stared at something in amazement and discussed how awesome Joss Whedon was. Then a guy called out to one of the girls and they asked his name and he said ""Big Tuna and I laughed, as well as the others. Ezra and Dad were then there and I was thinking that I should explain about Jim and Andy's tuna joke from The Office. I got my phone out to record them and they were just saying jokes from the show. Then Will Arnett and Amy Poehler were there and got up to talk. There were two guys and they did a competition and the one that lost said the other guy cheated, but went along with it anyway."
"3579"	"(2010-08-22 (19)) Mom, Ezra and I went to Aunt Sally's, but they weren't home. Mom and I went out the back and I threw a towel in the pool and then remembered this wasn't our place. We snuck out as they got home. Bryson saw us and asked what we were doing and Aunt Sally said 'mind telling me why there's a towel in the pool?' and I said it was like that when we got there. Then we lived there. Dad just got home and Ezra forgot to put the dishwasher on (so Dad could make dinner). We walked out the front and my car was in the middle of the road. This cop looking car drove 'over' it and pulled up across the road. I angrily shouted and the guy got out and just smirked at me. I went over and kicked his car. The other neighbours just went in and told Dad, so he came up to the car and yelled out and then went out. He said he was trying to fix it and it was totally screwed. I started crying and said I was a university student and wouldn't be able to attend now. I asked when I could get a new car. There was a musical called 'Uberletzen'."
"3580"	"(2010-08-22 (19)) This alien girl had a container full of white powder. She had killed some people. There was a red pie with strawberries and the alien loved strawberries. The red bit was blood from some people including her mother. I told Mom about it and she was like 'meh, if this was your Mom's blood and you were eating it, it wouldn't bother you?' And I said ""not really"". The powder stuff was a portal to her planet? You had to put something else in it. It was all white, though some had red, but it hadn't mixed. The alien's skin came off and was scaley and hard and took the rest of it off. She went to her planet. It had those rock formations like in Enemy Mine. Then the portal was in a ship. I went there with the girl, who I think was Leilani (from chemistry) and Eugene, who was my boyfriend. They wanted alcohol but no-one had ID. I called Mom to bring some and tried to explain where the place was. There was ice-cream and one was like a giant pizza and then some single ones -- one was on a stick with chocolate 'balls'. There was a step going down and if you had the stick you would fall into another planet/world? The shop was called Greacy Bacon and the spelling annoyed me."
"3581"	"(2010-08-23 (19)) I replied to an ad for a job at Bunnings and was hoping there wouldn't be a group interview for it. Then I had to do some assignment. There was something about Nintendo and someone asked this other girl and she said that she'd been playing Nintendo 64 since she was young. Then they asked me and I said ""60% N64 and 40% PC"". They were like 'wow, N64 wasn't even the highest'. This guy was called Mike Spencer and he sat on a couch. Mom was nearby and I felt uncomfortable with her listening. I had to go down a level and had to do an interview with Mr Billings for some hospital thing."
"3582"	"(2010-08-25 (19)) I was at a school. A guy and I hid in a closet in a bedroom. There was a monster and it opened the door and sniffed -- its sense of smell wasn't great, but it had good hearing. It left and it went into a classroom and killed everyone within seconds. I hid behind a bench but it saw me. It was right in front of me, but killed this other girl and then left. When I left the room everyone else was alive. It was then the end of the 'movie' and supposedly only virgins could see it and it left them alone. It was black and scary looking [possibly influenced by Ten O'Clock People] ."
"3583"	"(2010-08-26 (19)) Ezra was still in school -- at Koondoola, but it was different and like a boarding school. Mom and I went there and there was an underground carpark. There was a guy putting white square stickers on cars, like parking tickets. We went in and the rooms were all scattered. Ezra's was in a room with around 6 other beds -- 2 of them were bunks and he was in one of the lower ones. They had lots of chocolate and stuff. They were rocky road with nuts and they tasted cheap. I had to get permission to leave. There was a walkway outside and each side had a bench. Some people were playing 'soccer' and you had to throw the ball under the bench. People kept trying to catch them. I was playing as well and a guy on our team could stop time so we were doing well. Then it was the olden days and there was a 'race'. They wouldn't let Ezra in for some reason but he could come in at 11 if he got permission. There were timers with big numbers on them. I asked ""This is the 20s right?"" and said they looked the same. There was a big Jesus statue underneath the city of Bangkok. Then I went to a school and my room had photos from Comic-Con there. I paused the TV and it was a scene with Mal (Firefly). There was a guy with makeup on his face and someone said he looked ""paler than normal"". Everyone looked tired. It made me think of SG (?)."
"3584"	"(2010-08-27 (19)) I was pregnant and on my honeymoon. I was about 5 months pregnant and had five kids. I had sex with the guy at some point. There was a bed somewhere in an open area. Danny Devito was there and I took a toothbrush out of the bedside table and put it in my pocket and then I left. He went to look in there when I came back. Then I was with my kids and we had a live-in nanny. Then, in an unrelated part of the dream, I was walking home late at night. It was really dark and there were others walking along the median strip. A little black kid ran past me with a gun, then turned back around and I rolled onto the ground. He shot at me and when there was no traffic, I rolled away. It was pitch black over there and I kept walking. I ended up at the train station and the next train was in 5 minutes. I got my phone out to call Mom to ask if she wanted me to get off at Centerville and she'd pick me up from there. A kid -- possibly the one from before -- gave me a ruler. I said ""what's this?"" and he said ""a ruler is a ruler"" and I replied ""yeah, but why are you giving it to me?"". He also told me that Kinski (Klaus) was in the bathroom and was going 'oh, oh I love you!'. It turned out he actually meant Stellan Skarsgard. I knocked on the door and we went in. He was alone. When he saw me I tried not to laugh -- we knew each other somehow. I heard a noise and went out and the whole place was covered in bubbles. It was flooded up high too? There was a guy with a dog and I took a photo. The dog was now Rover and I went up to him and took more photos. A blue van with bubbles pulled in. Mom was there now."
"3585"	"(2010-08-27 (19)) I went driving after midnight, going 90km/h on a 50km/h road. I slowed down because I was out so late as well as speeding. I got to a house which was like an apartment. I parked my car and could hear sirens and I called out ""Ryan!"" and Ryan Kwanten and Rutina Wesley were on the balcony and he called back to me. I said we had to go -- the cops were coming for him. He came down but the police got there and I tried to drive off, but couldn't. They asked where Ryan was and I said I didn't know where he lived and they eventually let me go."
"3586"	"(2010-08-28 (19)) I was planning the order of countries to visit on our trip to Europe. I was talking with some girls who said it was hard to take different airlines because of weight limits. I went outside and I had money on a brick wall. A girl walked past and told me to be careful with my money and then took some. I chased her and took some back. Some of my stuff was also on the wall -- a shirt and a pair of pants were folded with a gun on top. A guy next to it had a gun too. I walked past and looked back and he was pointing the gun in the other direction and would randomly shoot. Then he turned my way and I dodged a bullet and ran. I ran into a building which didn't have many people in it and went to the back room. There were some kids in there and I locked the door. I went to this office out the back locked myself in there, but somehow saw him smash into the other rooms. I broke a wall which lead to the entrance and ran out with him following me. Then Meg Ryan wagged a wallet in his face and he took it and left me alone. I thanked her and she said 'no problem, my father blah blah blah' -- she was a rich girl. There were cars burnt under the sand. I tried to take a photo of Simba but my phone froze and I complained, saying I needed to get an iPhone 4. I ended up with Jessica (True Blood) and her toes turned purple and this big muscly guy said ""toe toe"". I told her she had to get somewhere. There were people around that were like Sims and had wishes that you could complete. Jessica's one wouldn't complete and her new mission was to have sex with Tara (True Blood) and 7/10 fantasies. I dragged her into this place and said 'she will' and I heard a 'buh buh' sound."
"3587"	"(2010-08-29 (19)) I was watching Entourage. Vince was offered a part in a porno. Turtle didn't want him to do it. They went to this drug dealer (who I think was the director of the porno) and pretended to want drugs. One of them said he liked liquid. The guy said he could do that and took his belt off, tied it around his neck and vomited (off-screen). Ari was on the phone to Lloyd and said ""your dream came true of me being blown by space monkeys"" and Lloyd responded ""Space monkeys?!"" and it had something to do with a porno with monkeys. Vince did a screen test and then walked away and Eric was relieved. In real life, there was this 'robot' and you could choose its personality etc and then it would just look like a person. The trial version had limited opinions and didn't last long. Teen robots couldn't have romances with adults and some guy did an advert about that. A robot was chosen with 'good, easy romance' personality traits and it looked like Rhys Coiro. It lay in bed and disappeared after a few minutes."
"3588"	"(2010-08-29 (19)) I was at Nana's, in the dining room (with the bookshelves). She said Dad and Poppa were going to buy a car for me and I saw it drive up. It was small, but white old and only had one seat. It cost $12,000. I said I didn't like it or want it. There was a giant easter egg, in the shape of a bunny. Bryson and Aunt Sally came in. Then there was this 'good' monster, like a giant lizard robot. There was a bad robot too. It shot lasers out of its eyes and we shot at them. I hid in a level 1 room with some others. I ran out and looked around for the robot, but couldn't see it. I said we had to leave now as I ran back in. We went through this other door and we were now up high. We had to walk down and and we were wobbly and had to keep our balance. We eventually got back down. I saw the lizard and a guy went over to attack."
"3589"	"(2010-08-29 (19)) Ezra worked at this place next to a shop with clothes, so Mom often went there. I was somewhere at night and walked home. I was on Wanneroo Road next to Fieldgate shops and there was a speed camera and a booze bus after the turn off. The street was dark and I started to run. I was at a park and I could hear music coming from home -- my kind of music. A trailer was in the way. Mom yelled out asking if there was a guy out there and I said 'no, I'm trapped'. Eventually I got in. She was on some site which had old music playing and they were playing Mr Lee by The Bobbettes."
"3590"	"(2010-08-30 (19)) I was on Facebook liking various pages for Eric (True Blood). One of them involved people answering phones and pulling pranks saying ""we like Eric"". Darren put a cigarette into something [I can't read it, but apparently it shocked me] . Mom went to see Matthieu and he text her asking if the kids were coming because 'she still hadn't shaken off a bad feeling' so I opted not to go, though she dropped me off somewhere first. I was watching Inception and Tom Hardy sacrificed himself and fell through a window. It was in slow motion and it fell onto the road and splattered. Everyone died at the end. There was a bit with Michelle Forbes and some others on a lounge. She had a little coffee with sprinkles etc. She eavesdropped on a phone conversation on a recorder. I asked for a coffee but then saw Coke so asked for that instead because I don't like coffee. Rover was there."
"3591"	"(2010-08-30 (19)) I was driving fast and my car was driving well. Mom was with me and I commented on this to her. There were special lights on a shop to signal the green light, but I couldn't see it and when Mom realized she was like 'oh, you can go' and there were cars coming from the side but I made it in time. We went to a Bunnings like shop. There was a secret bit which had 'heads' and 'DNA' strips of paper. We had been there before and mine was there. I also saw Eugene's. I got some others including someone I knew called Brendan, but it was spelt as 'Brandan'. A fat girl came and stared at us and was possibly security. Then she left. We went upstairs and there was a colourful and quirky shop. There were lots of people and they were all talking to each other. There were books for family trees, but it was like interactive and I put in my name and it came up with The Young Ones. It had silver edges. It cost $1230. I thought I should've gotten the DNA strips instead. I ased why Sarah Michelle Gellar wasn't in there and they said they forgot. I was at Nana's watching The Simpson's. Ezra wanted to watch. Lisa was down in the sewer. I had seen it before but they'd changed it. I had a look to see what movies were on and Life is Beautiful was and I said ""Oh, I love that movie"". Blow Out was on in 30 minutes (at 2.45) so I decided to watch a bit of Life is Beautiful then that. Dad was there too. Poppa said something about the windows and curtains."
"3592"	"(2010-08-31 (19)) I was out the back of the old house with Mom, Ezra and some others. I think Eric (True Blood) was there too. I went to the patio and felt weird and I said to the others I was feeling weird. They came over and someone at the back door was lifted up in the air by an invisible creature. It picked me up too and covered my mouth and nose. Somehow I got inside and locked the door. I was talking to the others and when I went back one of the doors was unlocked. I locked it again. The creature could attach itself to stuff and kept going onto the key and getting side and poking me on the head. I threw the key outside. Mom asked where Cuddles and Gizmo were and they were near the pool. It morphed into a cat and became visible. I went out and threw something at it and it started to disappear, so I grabbed it and put it in the pool. I ran to Cuddles and Gizmo and threw them inside. The creature got on the key again and I got rid of it. Then it was a movie and they brought the key to this house and summoned it and burnt it. They had to choose something and shot at it twice. Someone said not to touch something or you'd get stuck with it again and become 'homeless'. I was then there and accidentally touched it and it showed up again and burnt the house down. A guy stole some secret thing and Anna Torv was undercover laying bricks inside a house. The guy got off to talk on the phone and she stole it. We ran. She unlocked the car for me and I pointed to the guy when she got in. We drove off. There was a Russian lady and she tried to get in the car but I locked it. We drove slowly because we couldn't get the car running properly. Then the lady was actually a good guy and was with a kid, but the kid had died and she was actually a ghost."
"3593"	"(2010-09-01 (19)) I was outside in the street with people from university and some others, including Ezra and Dad. I was driving a high car but had pulled over to the side of the road. I had to cross 4 lanes of traffic and then I missed my turn. I went to turn around and a big truck (with multiple carriages) drove through. I waited for it to pass, but then I was on foot. I looked away for a second and I heard everyone gasp and when I looked around a black car was upside down and completely smashed in the middle of the road. I asked what happened and it had clipped a car. A guy had flown out of the windscreen. Someone said it wasn't that bad and Dad was like 'He was decapitated and lost his hands and feet. How much worse can you get?'. A few of us were a step below and couldn't see as well. I took a peek and no-one was there. It was dark and completely silent. I saw a cop asleep on the side of the road. I used my phone to see and he woke up confused. We asked why they left us and why no-one else was around. We were trying to figure out what had happened when we saw this little blue buzzing thing (it was like round in the middle with two 'wings') hovering just above the ground. We were then in a bathroom and there were two of them. Wherever we were was similar to Dad's house, but different though it might've been his place. Then there was a spark of light and Dad touched it. It sparked again but it was 'nice' and pretty. Then I walked out and saw some monster outside. I ducked and waved at the others saying ""Oh my god, it's Cloverfield!  It's Cloverfield!"". I went into Ezra's room and said 'it's Cloverfield! Don't go past the windows, it can see you'. This other guy was asleep in the lounge room (I think it was the cop). I went into my room and heard someone in the bathroom. I went and told him to be careful. He freaked out and was goin on about Godzilla and I sent him to Ezra, but saw the monster standing at the door and I said to Ezra 'don't talk, it's at the door'. Then I was with different people and at the door was a girl who was part of a cover up. She left us alone in exchange for a 'peg' sometime. She left and I said we had to leave. She found us later though and Eugene and Darius had joined us. At some point I bought a DVD of The Room and started watching it, but it was different. I was laughing at the sex scene with Lisa and Johnny. The flower shop scene was different and there was randomly added dialogue. There was a closeup of the flower shop lady (who was different). I messaged Dad on Facebook saying it was different and ""now it is teh suckz"". There was another new scene with two girls, possibly prostitutes. One went into a shop and the other was annoyed."
"3594"	"(2010-09-01 (19)) I was at Seabird, staying at a hotel. A lady came to clean it. There were two babies. I had met the lady before. I packed up my stuff and there was lots of it. I was on a computer and Dad and Ezra were there."
"3595"	"(2010-09-01 (19)) I'm not sure where I was, but there were lots of people. There was a balcony with a cover. Someone got itchy and there were these bugs which was an 'infection'. We were outside and tried to close the doors to keep it from spreading. There were three doors and one was open from inside (so we couldn't keep it closed by sitting in front of it). Mulder and Scully from The X-Files were there. They tried to get people to sit in front of the doors, but no-one would. They got a girl to go lock the lock of the inside door, but this big dude tried to burn the lock off before she could. I called Mulder to help (Scully was in front of a door). Another guy had a gun and shot at me. Then they were at the other door and I came back. I grabbed a fork and stabbed the big guy in the hand. I ended up with the gun and shot at them. I killed one guy. Then I was in an office with Mr Billings who was writing a report on it. I left and the building was like a university and it was big and confusing. There was an elevator like a vending machine that was always next to toilets. There was a cat. I went to get my bag but remembered I hadn't been at university. I tried to call Mom five times. Then I tried Ezra, Darren and Dad and still no answer. I went on Facebook chat and sent Mom a message to pick me up. She kept saying no and sending me stupid pictures. I had no money and I think she eventually agreed."
"3596"	"(2010-09-02 (19)) Ryan Kwanten was in two shows on TV. He was not the main character in either show, though one was True Blood."
"3597"	"(2010-09-02 (19)) Ezra was supposed to be spending the night outside with some mates and came home early. They had some drinks. There was a girl who had this extra thing on her foot and was a bit retarded. Mom was also there.There was a video of an Asian girl in some water with flowers, but they were actually like beads that she was wearing. An Asian guy took her hand and they walked out. Then I was with them. We went into a building and there were steps to the top floor which was an empty room with two chairs. One had water on it, so I sat on the floor. The guy paid me to dance with him. I went out for a second and this lady came and she was like some government lady and she asked what was going on. I said 'some weird stuff' and ran down. She asked me where I'd been on the 4 June. I said I didn't know. She said someone had told her something and that I was there at some funeral and then went back to my place."
"3598"	"(2010-09-02 (19)) I was making a sandwich. I toasted the bread and was having chicken. Mom went into the kitchen and made three toasted sandwiches with baked beans and ham for im, her and someone else and I asked for one and she said no and I got annoyed."
"3599"	"(2010-09-03 (19)) Dad emailed a photo of him and his friend and mentioned me in the email. Some people were playing Sims 1 and Sims 3. I said my Sims games didn't work and a girl went to put a disc in my computer. She tried to force open the drive and I pressed the button instead. The fans were clear, but were pink/purple colour. Someone said they didn't want Sookie and Eric (True Blood) together and I thought 'neither do I, but I wouldn't mind me with Eric'. Someone on Restaurant City had a restaurant called Fangtasia."
"3600"	"(2010-09-04 (19)) I was in India or something. The father of some girl I befriended was in this hut and gave wishes. There was a queue, and she was before me. She asked for marijuana and he put his head down and didn't answer. I requested 'gay marriage and legalization of marijuana'. Mom was watching something at the old house on TV -- Rico (Six Feet Under) was talking to a black woman at a bench near the ocean. Ezra wanted to know what we were watching ""Six Feet Under"" and he said ""oh, you watched Psycho"". There were waves in the show and a voice said ""Florida"". Laer I went to a job interview at 9.30am. I was stopped at the traffic lights and a car hit me from behind. Someone got out and apologized but it only left a small dent and I said 'don't worry about it'. I got to the place I was going and went in and all the doors led to this classroom lab type of thing. I asked a guy how to get out and there was a floor 'wedge'. They climbed up this thing on the wall and then walked out the door. It led onto a balcony with stairs. There were some magazines from 1999 with Angelina Jolie on the cover."
"3601"	"(2010-09-05 (19)) There were zombies. I was doing an obstacle course thing. I saw zombies come running through the bush. I ran inside to go to ""the sun room"" which was a classroom in the shape of a sun. I let some people in and closed the door. It had no locks but the zombies couldn't get in. One of the windows showed a classroom with 5 year olds and Peter Krause was there. The zombies came and got them. Then it wasn't a classroom and it was this weird place with lots of people. The doors kept opening and I went around closing them and then noticed that people were missing. A guy there was sending people out to die. Then I was with Mom and someone else living in this small room. I was driving in a Ute with Mom and Darren. It was a Nissan. We drove down this path for a bit which had small trees planted across it. We were marking things down on a map so we knew where exits were. Then we were on foot and there were bushes to one side. Zombies came and we ran. They went back and I was confused, then realized they came from near our room. I didn't have a gun, just some melee weapon. I closed the door and tried to think of what to do."
"3602"	"(2010-09-06 (19)) There was an update on FilmForum to fix a bug that had been around for 6 months. Alessandro had a presentation of some features using movies he had watched as he went and I forgot what I had watched. There was a scene of a movie with Leonardo Dicaprio and Martin Scorsese at a table. Leonardo had to break in, but was welcomed. Scorsese was swearing and talking. The angle changed and someone's head got blown off from ""poison"" and you could see inside like a rubber mask and I thought it was awesome. Later I was with Dad and Ezra to get dinner. It was night. We parked and Dad and I crossed the road. A car was coming and I told Dad to stop but he said he was going to go. I was going to show him the scene after we got food. There was a little path with a fence and a guy asked if we could come with him but he seemed dodgy and Dad said no and he started to follow us and I was like ""Dad?!"" There was a door so we went over there and there was an empty room with no roof. The guy reached over the wall and I grabbed his arm and twisted it -- I was really strong. There was a place called '92'. Food appeared in the corner. I was talking about the scene and a young guy said ""he's gay"" and I asked what he meant and he said Scorsese's character was gay. I said I didn't get that at all and he said he was ""too emotional and human-y"". Mom was waiting there too. There was something about The Virgin Spring and Goodfellas. At the end of Inception, Iko Iko was playing but it was weird with sounds and laughter in the background."
"3603"	"(2010-09-07 (19)) I had a job interview [in real life I had one this day] . It was almost time and I went to get changed and Mom hadn't taken my clothes out of the washing machine -- I had a pair of dress pants and a collared button shirt that had blue stripes. Ezra had a shirt but it was too big. I went and the interviewer was a young guy. There were two other girls there. There was a busy room in like a sports club. He said 'why not come back later today' and there were jobs on slips of paper. A girl took one -- it was something about someone called George looking for a character to play. The other girl took one that was to blow up this sports centre. Stellan Skarsgard was the father of something and a girl said she had finally gotten a team for the place. He called the girl and asked her to abort. She asked someone for something and they said no. It was night. Then I was there and it was day. There was a fire. There was a room with my DVD's, Wii etc and a bookdshelf of my diaries. The DVDs were all burnt and I was like 'not Monty Python and Red Dwarf!' and grabbed my Wii and this other thing. The fire burned out. I opened a door slowly and moved a curtain out the way and the fire got sucked out. I left. The guy from before was walking down the street and said I could have the job. I complained to Mom about losing my stuff, but was happy about the job. I went to Red Rooster and someone blocked out the 's' and they had a weather sign."
"3604"	"(2010-09-08 (19)) I was at school. I had done a lab report but they didn't like my answer for one of the questions. Calvin was there and was going to copy, but I erased mine (there was something about a lion on there) and accidentally erased his too. I asked to go the library and the teacher said mine looked nice and she let us. There was a line to get in and everyone got checked."
"3605"	"(2010-09-09 (19)) I was watching Glee, but it was different and I only remember Kurt. They were in a gym. Then this blue guy was in the shower and a girl followed him in. He covered her back with a towel and covered himself up. A lady had told someone to call their 'dead' parent and say there were problems and secrets? Then Mom was getting her car back and I went back with her. Ezra and Darren went in Ezra's car. I sat on Mom's lap and the door wouldn't close. We almost hit a car who stopped suddenly. Later they went for dinner at Aunt Sally's. I got some Oreo wafer sticks and some chocolate snack out of a cupboard and she told me to give some to Ezra and called him the 'fattest'. I said I was the smallest in the house ""by 4am"" and Ezra said 'you sure' and I said yeah and she said ""3?"". Then I was back home and we went out and got that Asian soup but one had no veges. They were going to give that one to me and I told them to go down and get me another."
"3606"	"(2010-09-09 (19)) I was watching a Youtube video from the 80s. Jason Alexander and Robert de Niro were in it. Jason Alexander said he had a crush on him and jokingly kissed Robert de Niro."
"3607"	"(2010-09-11 (19)) I was at this building that was usually used for something completely different (concerts maybe), but had some event going on for The Room. Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero and 'Steven' were there. Wiseau was wandering around and was lonely. First I was outside and I was going in with Dad and Ezra. There was a huge, empty basketball court. I took a photo and said it was going to be very busy in a few hours. People eventually started to come. We got in and bought a ticket for a photo with Sestero, and got the photo taken. I asked Mom if I'd shown her the 'hi doggy' scene and she said she had watched the whole movie. There was an alternate scene of Lisa in the red dress, it was pulled up over her bum and she was walking weirdly. She walked backwards at one point and was flirting with some guys. I ended up befriending Sestero and he said he paid for a photo with 'Steven' and he got one too. It was like $60 for a photo. 'Steven' was actually an Asian and had a Mohawk and earrings in each ear. There were only three people in his line. I think he bent down and picked me up and could just carry my weight, but struggled and I had to put my hand on the floor to help. Then he left. I looked at the pics and I was cut out of them and the rest were all stupid. I complained to this lady and asked for a refund because I didn't know where he had gone. A black guy had just sat down for a photo and Sestero was going to pay for it. We got scratchies and hung them up and got them later."
"3608"	"(2010-09-12 (19)) I was at a place with ATMs, though it had something to do with 4chan and I didn't know how to use it. I was playing a game with a girl. I stole a car and had to read the manual. It was a smooth drive. People were shooting at me and I had to rescue someone who had been kidnapped by some people involved with drugs."
"3609"	"(2010-09-12 (19)) I was at university and part of one of my subjects was to this group discussion. There was about 20 of us sitting in a circle at a desk and were chatting about the questions the teacher asked us. We did a second one with different people. The teacher lady asked us all to say some stuff and I was annoyed I had to do it twice. Alejandro and Rodney were there. I wondered which group Eugene was in. We all got symbols and mine was a lion, so I got a plastic figure of a lion but it looked like a jaguar. Evelyn was then next to me and Calvin was on my other side. Evelyn said ""what do I say?"" and I said ""... hello?"" and then I sat back down and ignored her. We had to draw something and get the person next to us to hold the pencil. Evelyn drew a house and I held the pencil. Then I ended up somewhere else and I was quoting ""I fed up with this wurhld!"" and make a red button (which was a thing from The Room) and put it in the front of my desk and it bounced. I said ""Thank you Quentin Tarantino!"". Then it was a movie and this guy escaped from somewhere. A guy found him and asked him to tell him secrets and he got him into college. Someone asked him ""Princeton?"" and he answered ""San Francisco""."
"3610"	"(2010-09-13 (19)) I was on a plane and some others and I got trapped in it. Then it started spinning and it was going to be like that for '4 missions', which meant 'years'. Eventually it stopped and we got out."
"3611"	"(2010-09-13 (19)) I had lost weight and when I put my arms to my side, I couldn't feel any fat. I was thinking 'thank god that's done'."
"3612"	"(2010-09-13 (19)) There was some gathering thing at Dad's old house. The pool was iced over. Spaceman and Gizmo were sitting on it. Spaceman's bit of ice fell in and he kept sitting on it and kept dipping in and out of the water which looked funny. Then I jumped in and saved him. Gizmo fell in, but got out at the steps in the shallow end. A creepy black cat stared at her. Some guy decided to make me do a magic trick, so I needed a pair of pants with a zip. We were going to to the shop to find some. Ezra and Dad were there and I decided to go with them instead."
"3613"	"(2010-09-14 (19)) I was in a dream. I was at a house with celebrities including Bill Murray, who was in a coat and hat with glasses. I made breakfast for everyone but I had toast with a really red and tasty apple. As I left, Darius and some others went to the front of the house to get autographs. I got in the car with Mom and Ezra. Bill Murray took the bin back up and I pointed him out to them and said 'that's Bill Murray'. I told them this was a dream and we talked about it. They were very 'real' and seemed to actually be thinking for themselves."
"3614"	"(2010-09-15 (19)) I was at school. Will from The Inbetweeners was there and a girl offered him sex but ended up laughing at him and walking away. Another girl took him into this cupboard. Later, I found them in there and I was laughing and I told a lady who then told everyone and they all came and stood around. Jay had a ring on his end finger. Will came out later and was annoyed at all the people that were there and blamed me. The principal guy was there. There was a short blonde girl and he pet her on the head. She had a slight Southern accent. She put her arm around him and they were talking. They walked together and she said she was the granddaughter of someone's Dad. They got pizza and she ate this white one. Someone found something and asked her ""did you have an exchange?"" and she had."
"3615"	"(2010-09-15 (19)) The best movies of some director had some relation to The Room. There was a movie or something of 3 people driving up a hill. One guy was in a long truck. He stopped because some guy had died. He asked one of the people to bury the body and the other one to drive to go see his wife. The latter one went crazy and caused the road to come apart? Then I was there running down a hill. At the end it was completely vertical and I dropped down carefully. I ran away after and went into a room. There was a small room to the side and it said 'Stop'. I had a feeling of being trapped. There were holes in the wall and glass windows and it showed the front of someone's house. I yelled 'help me!'. A little girl nearby asked her mother 'what's 'help me?'. I broke off bits of something and then this duck was out the back and I was trying to catch it and tried to climb through. I was also then a 'duck'. A woman came out and I said I was human and she said she was a 'blackcoat' and I said I was a 'browncoat'. But she was bad and came after me and I ran. Later Dad and I were at a screening of The Room. Someone sent an email with a ""blood ring"" which was like a ticket. I forgot my shoes."
"3616"	"(2010-09-16 (19)) I was playing a game where you could pay cash to buy a special kitten. Mom had enough so I asked to use her account but we couldn't transfer the kitten to my account. Then it was real. Home was different. The kitten went outside and I heard it meow and I had called it Gizmo. I went out and there was snow. I called the cat back in but the door wasn't locked. I tried to get help but no-one could be bothered. I asked Ezra and I said ""I don't want a crazy murderer to come in""."
"3617"	"(2010-09-16 (19)) I was at university in a lecture with a young girl who wasn't really a science person. We left and Rebekah asked us if we would join her. I told her Samantha had already left and I didn't know where Calvin was. I didn't know why she was talking to me. I was outside and I heard Calvin talking. Some girl fell down a hill and slid into a building and was trapped. There was a 4WD next to my car with two guys in it and they reversed but then had to wait for a friend. My brakes were werid. Then Ezra was in the car. We got to a set of lights and this alarm went off. There were red lights and this robot was up in the sky. I put my foot down and drove. It followed me and I kept hiding in various places. It found me and I blew it up. We were going to hotels and on the top of each one and it was like the edge of a cliff. We would jump down and it would blow them up (but not totally). Then it was a movie and a guy went in and asked everyone to hide him and thye refused because of something he did earlier and he said ""I didn't know you then!"" and they didn't believe him."
"3618"	"(2010-09-17 (19)) I was at Nana's and Mom and Ezra were also there. I had to leave and lots of people were coming there. My car was a Holden V8 and it drove smoothly. I got to the road and heaps of people were coming in. I realized Mom was coming back in and I turned around. Someone was then trying to trick me so they could take something."
"3619"	"(2010-09-18 (19)) I was at school and had befriended this dude who was kind of goth [like Adam Ant style] . He had dark black hair, very white skin and rings etc. Samantha made a joke that I liked him and he had brought weapons to fight zombies with she went with him and when I looked up at him he took it to mean that I liked him and I was jealous. I said 'I was just wondering why I didn't get a weapon. I'm out of bullets'. I was in a classroom and a teenage girl was there and I went to the back and put my head on my desk. The guy was talking to Samantha and asked me if I wanted something and I said 'no, Samantha makes stuff up'. The teacher came and it was a drama class. She told everyone to take their shirt off and trade with the first person they saw. I crawled out through the door and she said something like 'Izzy has snuck out' and I tried not to laugh. Then the people had to change back into their shirts. There was this series of shorts called Window which was about zombies. They were in a few lists. The first one was good and was a bit weird. The second one had two guys in a car on a TV in the background but they were out of sync. At the end there was a 40 second scene which was creepy. Then it was real and we had a room. Then I was in a hall and there was a room full of zombies. A female zombie came into the hall and almost broke down a door trying to get in. We got her back in, but someone opened it up. I had one bullet left. I started whacking them with the gun. I walked to the side of the room and went through the window. Then people were doing an ad for TV with a black woman and a white guy. A guy was filming and kept pointing the camera at her boobs. When they played it back, they laughed about it. Then I was driving and was driving under 50km/h, but a guy was right behind me, so I sped up. Then I was walking but I had no pants on and was wearing bright pink undies. I thought it was a dream so I wished for pants and I looked down and I was wearing shorts. Everything became clear. I was walking around and it was quiet and no-one was around. It reminded me of a One Tree Hill episode [that I watched last night] . There was a path and I called out for Eugene. Because it sounded and felt so clear, I was worried about saying it out loud in real life. There was a big oval and a wind sound, but there was no wind. I heard someone start talking and it was Eugene. [I then woke up in real life because of people talking] ."
"3620"	"(2010-09-19 (19)) I was out with some people who were my friends. We went to Dome and I thought it was closed, but it was open [last night we went to Dome but it was closed] . People were ordering sponge cakes and mudcakes. I felt like a sponge cake. There were cakes on display. Someone I was with thought they were old. It was pink and moist and soft. I took a bite and ate it. I told them to go pay for it. We left and it was night. We walked towards a dark subway and saw a group of dark people coming and then saw some others so I started backing off, but more came and they surrounded us and asked for 'jewellery, money and phones'. I freaked out and didn't want to give up my phone, so I hid behind something. Then it was a weird movie and I got caught and sent down a drain. I hid my phone in a nook and a guy's head popped out of a sprinkler system. A young girl and her father were there and I asked them to get him out. There was a place with insects. I went back to the past to change the future and some were cut off so I cut years with scissors to continue."
"3621"	"(2010-09-20 (19)) I was friends with the people from How I Met Your Mother. Something weird happened and I had to do something and I ended up in the hospital and was told to do this group task and take some medicine which stung. There was a button which I had to press until the pain stopped. I left without the group and was hanging with Marshall, Ted, Barney and Robin. We were talking and laughing. There was a zip lock bag which was a contraption in pants and made it felt like something was missing? There was a show on the projector with a ninja and some other stuff. Then I found a note detailing Ted and I having a romantic moment and we had all had romances? This upset me. We kissed later. Then I wasn't meant to be 'out'. Then there were Nazi's. There was a crowd outside. Bill Murray was an animal thing and showed us the path to get outside but people didn't want to do that. Ted, Barney, others and I went to find some place. We had to line up for something. Then we were at a university. Rover was there but he wasn't allowed to be. This Nazi guy saw him and ordered for someone to put him down. I started to cry and shouted ""I'll put you down!"" and ran off with him. It was Mom who said that Rover was ""the dog""."
"3622"	"(2010-09-20 (19)) There was a girl called 'Repeat Paddy' and she got in trouble at school. I had to talk to her. Then I killed some guy? A guy friend said ""who can you trust?"" and I told her first. Another lady sat next to me and we later asked her to leave. I'd also made a movie about breaking into prison. It had something to do with her and I had to get her to sign some stuff saying there was no resemblance between her and the person in the film. I went to some guy's house. Outside there was a row of movies and they were all IMDb Top 250 movies and were marked off if they'd been sen. They hadn't seen The Great Escape and I said ""they've never seen The Great Escape"". Ezra and Dad were there. Dad parked Ezra's car right on the edge of this 'cliff'. Ezra bragged about his car to the guy."
"3623"	"(2010-09-21 (19)) There was something to do with kissing. A guy had been bad to his girlfriend? We told him off. A guy paid over $800k for a girl and someone said something about me. Owen Wilson was looking for some girl and four of us hid in a room. He opened the door, which was like a sheet, but he didn't come all the way in and didn't see us. He left and we giggled, but called him back and the girl came to see him and they united. I saw a car and realized it was Eugene's and saw him in it. Later, I saw his computer and wanted to go on it and see what was on it."
"3624"	"(2010-09-21 (19)) I was at a shop with my schoolbag. I realized after a while that no bags were allowed. I brought it to the front of the store and I took my book and pen out. I took a cheese and cracker snack to eat. The fridge had a freezer section with water. I took a guy to see some creatures in it before. I thought it was 2 years ago but it didn't make sense because they were too big to fit. There were ripples in the water and it was vibrating. I asked him if he saw it and he said 'feck no'. He put his face in the water. Then it was a movie and I was this girl and she said ""did you not hear what Manny told you"" and he slapped her. A door opened. Manny left and the girl screamed ""Manny!"". I was watching a video of Greg Sestero on his phone and the acting was really bad and I wondered if I'd seen this before but I didn't think so."
"3625"	"(2010-09-22 (19)) Ezra got a second job, part time at Bunnings. Dad had gotten him the job. I went with him for some reason. There was a 'forest' maze with green snakes and I walked around. I was annoyed that I didn't get a job there because I would get more money."
"3626"	"(2010-09-23 (19)) I was on Facebook and Greg Sestero [who added me on FB yesterday] posted the top 10 movies he'd seen this year. Seven of them were on my list, including Breaking the Waves. I was at a shop to sleep there and went into the wrong 'room'. I curled up on a lounge to sleep. Calvin came in asking where I was. He said ""this must be why you're a girl"" and lay down behind me, though I complained. There were water bottles in a fridge and filled some up. Ezra and some friends were there."
"3627"	"(2010-09-24 (19)) Rover was jumping around being hyper. Ezra was on his knees and Rover scratched his back quite deeply and drew blood. Mom said 'everyone over 18 in 2 years can come to [somewhere] with me' and then said 'I meant just Darren'. Later I was waiting to get on the train with Dad and Ezra. A girl got our tickets, but forgot mine and we had to do something to get it. Then we were on the train. Ezra started to cry. He took his shirt off and showed Dad the scratches."
"3628"	"(2010-09-25 (19)) The Kids Are Alright was actually about a couple where one was from the future and one was from the past. I wondered why I hadn't wanted to see it."
"3629"	"(2010-09-26 (19)) Ezra sent me a message to help him prepare for ""CAR men's"" birthday. I went to see him and questioned him about it. It was a guy he met on the internet? He was also chatting to people for 'sex' which was a joke and some joke about 'the 9 year old inside me' which was some pedophile site. I had email from the guy before. I had makeup for Ezra and was putting stripes on him. There was this Alain Delon movie similar to La Piscine, but a suspicious cop got to the woman. She got him to confess. They were in a bedroom and were on tape. There was also this movie with Romy Schneider and Tom Hanks."
"3630"	"(2010-09-26 (19)) I was at home and we were having this gathering with lots of people. Ezra, Roland and Mom were there. There were lots of other friends of Ezra there too. I went out to my car at one point and a CD deck had been stolen. There were some mice and Ezra pulled them out of something gently. They were all pregnant. One started giving birth and there were lots of little grey mice, some had no fluid on them and were already moving around. Others were dead. I was filming it. There were some that were brown and white, white and grey and black ones. Tigger came over and sniffed them and I shooed her away from them. They were walking in a line. I went into a room and my wallet was gone. I went to the car to put the video on some stereo, but it was gone too. I was angry and I saw a few dodgy people around."
"3631"	"(2010-09-27 (19)) I was at university. There was a room with steps and planks for chairs. My legs were close to the edge and I was worried I was going to fall. I was next to Evelyn. We got put into groups and I was with Eugene and Evelyn. I complained to someone that there wasn't enough room, and Eugene helped me pull out the 'steps' so there would be enough room. Ezra was there and I said I needed socks and he gave me red socks that were like my work socks. Eugene waited for me to continue moving the steps. He asked ""can I add you as a friend on Facebook?"" and I was excited but calmly shrugged and was like ""it doesn't matter, it's only Facebook"". Calvin was in the class too. He made a new Facebook account. The class ended and we left stuff under the seats for next time. I complained about having to ""drive all the way down"". We passed Alejandro and I asked him if we had chemistry labs today and he said no."
"3632"	"(2010-09-28 (19)) Mom was watching an Alain Delon movie and said it was ""very French"". He and this girl were romantically involved and having tea. At first it showed him looking old and weird, but it was a disguise. I said he was my favourite actor and I was thinking he was hot."
"3633"	"(2010-09-29 (19)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. It was night. There was a car behind us but I could only see the silhouette of a 4WD. It followed us. I went through this coop thing to lose it, but it found us. Then we had a few dogs and one was rare. He was after it. I was at this place near the sea. I had just watched my clothes but had to jump over the water and I fell in. When I put pressure on a bit where the clothes were they went into the water and I complained about it. I pretended this guy threatened us because he thought we would turn him in. There was a place which was the first place to let women drink alcohol. Dad got me a drink. I drank it quickly and felt weird. Ezra's mate asked me how to get rid of some drug. It was bright orange and gave you a sensation in your elbow. I just hid it. Then the drug people came asking for it. I renamed the label on it to cough syrup. There was a cinema which was circular and had one screen up high."
"3634"	"(2010-09-30 (19)) I was at a shop with Ezra and he was reversing the car. I was living at the old house and home and Dad's new house. I was at the old house and there was a water tower thing out the back. For Ezra's birthday they had done some experiments? There was an electrical short which affected the tower and brought it down. It would take months/years to fix. I was then at home and I asked Darren how we were supposed to survive summer without an aircon and I said ""I can barely survive summer with an aircon"". There were lots of bits of paper outside. Mom said I had to walk the rest of the way down a hill or the paper would get shredded. I didn't understand but did it anyway. The paper slowly shifted and I took a photo. I asked if this was a dream and she said yes. I went to Dad's and looked for food and movies. I couldn't find anything. He was talking later and said my diary would be affected. Later I was at a house with some people and people were getting killed. I think some of them were my friends. There was a bad girl and I chained her up. Cameron Diaz was eating food in front of her. She got close to her and she attacked and escaped. Quinn (One Tree Hill) and someone else ran up the stairs."
"3635"	"(2010-09-30 (19)) I was playing Runescape with Ezra and Ryan. In 'real life', Ryan, Lloyd (Entourage) and I tried to show Ari (Entourage) we were a good team. We ran to his office. There was chocolate and Ari ate some. There was a car and some girls said it was some colour and we said it was pink. The card said it was pink. I dropped my wallet and heaps of $1 coins rolled on the floor. An old lady was in her car and she gave it away. Then we were on Runescape and there were some new interactions and I was doing some to Ryan to get achievements. One was 'erecting'. People were after some French thing which I had something to do with and they chased me. I was hiding. I went to the shop with Dad and took a toothbrush. We went to the carpark and someone called him a ""toothbrush"". I said I didn't have one and then took it out of my pocket and threw it. He looked for it as we drove out."
"3636"	"(2010-10-01 (19)) I was talking with Evelyn and mentioned 4chan. Eugene overheard and asked if I'd mentioned 4chan and I said yes. I put pictures of Zoltan on Dad's wall. I went to the cinema and there was a sci-fi movie from the 70s I had seen before and it was bad quality. There was a magnetic storm that had been going on for the last 10 hours. We were sleeping almost outside and had shutters on the 'roof'. There were electrical things in the sky."
"3637"	"(2010-10-02 (19)) I was watching La Piscine and some of it was in English. People were complaining because of the way everyone pronounced something, like 'I am teh pool'. There was a scene where Alain Delon was going into the pool and Romy Schneider was going crazy. It reminded me of a scene from Christine and then I remembered that was a different movie."
"3638"	"(2010-10-02 (19)) I went for a drive with Ezra. We drove past a weird abandoned school and kids were in there. We went in and it was a game. We had to escape the kids and find the exit. We were outside and threw something that hit the wall and it bounced off and hit my car. Something got swung around? We went to my car and it was near a big round desk."
"3639"	"(2010-10-03 (19)) I had a boyfriend and we went to a house to have sex. The house was on a weird angle and we were on the floor. He couldn't work out how to get on top of me, though nothing was in the way. We eventually worked it out and we had sex. I kept hitting the wall with my feet. I was worried someone would hear."
"3640"	"(2010-10-03 (19)) I was at a cinema with Dad and Ezra seeing a Twilight movie. It was really bad and we left at one point but came back and it was weird. There was a guy at a table and something screamed like a monster. There was another strange scene with no music. There was a late season of Cheers with Jensen Ackles in it. He was really fat though and I couldn't even recognize him. I was then at some concert place with Dad. Ezra saw an ACDC concert then said we had to see it. There was some Beatles thing on the day after. There was also The Doors, Roxy Music and some others. There was a Tommy Wiseau movie which had something to do with Roxy Music."
"3641"	"(2010-10-03 (19)) I was watching something. Coach Beiste was in it and was a tough woman and she was complaining about stuff. She asked me if someone had a diabetes shot. We rounded up everyone (we were in a shop) and stopped the music to tell people about the diabetes shot. A guy did something near me that made something poke me in the head. She said she was giving away free shots at a place in the city. Some guy was like 'we don't have to listen to you, don't have a medical certificate'. Then she pulled a certificate out and he walked away. I went to talk to her later and this 'village' for all the teachers and students in Glee. She was in this little house. I told her to stop being mean. I said I was a well behaved student and was never in trouble and didn't speed because I was scared of police and said 'when you yell it makes me want to laugh and press stupid keys and be naughty' etc. I said 'here's $100 and 3 weeks break'. She laughed and said ok. Then it was Glee and it showed pictures of everyone on a door of a house. They were all around a pool. I only recognized Rachel and Finn. I was there too with no shirt on. The water started pouring in and was cold. I held something against me and someone said something to me about cold water. I ended up at some fancy house. There was a stage set up for a performance. There was a rope and Rachel swung to the ground and started singing."
"3642"	"(2010-10-04 (19)) I was in an apartment with some girl and we talked about black and white vs colour. The house was in black and white. She said movies in colour looked happier. She painted the floors yellow and bright. A guy came and was angry. We book stood up to him. Then he left and bad guys came. Alexander Skarsgard was there. I had coins in my pocket including some Swedish coins. He and the other guys came in. I tried to get past them and eventually managed to. I had to go down heaps of stairs and they chased me. I hid and then I was with someone else. They said 'assume that someone was looking for us there' so we went the other way but there were people in the bush. Wil Wheaton was one of them. Some other people saw us and we ran. We went into this building and there was a guy and girl with plastic suits on. Linus made a thread on FilmForum about all the movies he'd seen with stats. He'd seen The Big Chill 10 times."
"3643"	"(2010-10-04 (19)) I was at a house. Dennis and Charlie (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were there. There was a lady and I had met her best friend before. She had someone get 'H2O' and I asked her what she was looking for and she said Coke and I said ""I don't drink Coke"". There was a bag of pretzels and a packet of thin chocolate fingers. I was at a table and Dennis and Charlie liked the same girl and I realised it was me."
"3644"	"(2010-10-05 (19)) I was watching Glee. Rachel sang a song that I thought was catchy. Quinn was pregnant again but had slept with two guys. She and Rachel had sex with a guy. It was Rachel's first time and she was annoyed afterwards because she didn't like the guy. There was something on TV about Bobby Vinton and Blue Moon. I was like 'oh I love this song!'."
"3645"	"(2010-10-05 (19)) I went to the park with Mom and Rover. There was a weird lake with a tree and pink flowers on the water."
"3646"	"(2010-10-06 (19)) Darren went to the vet and they charged $225. He was short a few dollars and thought they were lying. Mom also commented on it. I was at university and I had to learn French or German. I don't know where I was but I went to the toilet. I could see the shadow of a person under the door and it was Calvin. I went out and he was talking and joking and a weird troll creature came in. I screamed and it attacked Calvin and I shut the door and locked it. Not all the doors were locked and more came. I ran down and Elijah had a pole and I grabbed one and we flung them away. We ran to the end of the room and there were more sharp, pointy things. There were two others with us and we put ourselves into a circle. There were eight of them. He said each person would get two shots. I was in a room and Darius was there. There was nothing outside, just a blue sky. He said ""that's me!"" and I saw a dog on the bed and I said ""hi doggy"" and we quoted The Room."
"3647"	"(2010-10-07 (19)) I was in a building. Dad had a letter for me and I was being accused of being a traitor. Bill and Sookie from True Blood were there. I was confused about what was going on thinking that I'd done nothing wrong. Bill told me to calm down and she explained that it had something to do with her and letting him into the country by water and something to do with mixing with a werewolf. He said ""oh we did that"". They had to pay a fine later and left the city. There was a big monster that was like a chicken with big wings. It was very big not quite as big as Cloverfield. The front of the building collapsed a little. I was hiding in the wreckage and Eugene was there too and we were dating. There was some kind of bubble that was limiting the air. Dad came and had a lid and we told him to hide. People came and caught him and some others but not us. They drove off in a little buggy. The chicken had made a deal with them to collect people and stuff for it. As they drove off we opened the lid and it made the sound of releasing air pressure. Eugene was confused and I kissed him (just a peck) and touched his face and he smiled. They came back and we couldn't get the lid back on so we just pulled it down. A guy came past and caught us. He had a blade that was short and that he could throw. More came out of the building with guns with other people (there were four of them). They argued and Eugene ran and I followed. We hid in a bush but they found us straight away. We begged them not to kill us and said we would do something in exchange. They had to collect a quota of these broken things that were in the ground. I agreed to do so and the others reluctantly followed. There was a lady at a pub and a guy stole her handbag down her phone rang and she came over and he was like ""Lynyrd Skynyrd"" reading off the phone and she said ""yeah"". He started hitting on her and asked her what year they started performing. She said ""1979"" and he said ""1976"" and she said ""they recorded in 1979 and released it in 1979"". Then they were at her house talking about her music collection. She had something called Ensemble from 2008. She said they thought they sounded weird. They put on one of her CDs. The first song was Rooty Toot Toot, which was catchy and the others were ok."
"3648"	"(2010-10-08 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I saw a character called Jef Costello and I got excited. There was an event on and I clicked to join it but the connection lagged and it didn't work. I found out that it was Alyssa. Her favourite movie was a random Arrested Development movie that I'd just seen. I was at work with Mom. There were lots of rooms to clean. She and Ezra were going to Africa some time."
"3649"	"(2010-10-08 (19)) I was at school. I was getting a reward plus I had $300. Someone told me this was the last chance to redeem. I went to a booth and there were two women. There was a soft puppy toy. They asked me ""what is your thing that no one knows?"" I replied ""I have no sense of smell"" and they said ""oh, that makes sense"". Some girl I knew asked if I wanted a job at the cinema and we went there for a test. The manager called Ezra and he looked like the principal from Community. There were lots of people and lots of food. It was almost like a shop and it had four hotels. There were three people in the food section and there was a table. There was a table with two Adam Baldwin's, but he was young. I was doing bits of the job. I was letting people in and showing them a presentation. I decided something else was better because they weren't drones. There were lines of people at the door freaking me out. No one else had seen them and I went out the other door. I chose a better trick involving drawing lines on the road and one of the ones I picked made people drive around and then have to drive all the way back. I got in a car and a car smashed into the back of another one. I left and was driving fast. I couldn't stop very well. Some of the red lights had speed cameras but I didn't get flashed."
"3650"	"(2010-10-09 (19)) Mom was watching Law And Order. Alain Delon was in it and I said excitedly ""Alain Delon!"" And she was like ""what"". We went for a drive to see an accident but there was a lot of traffic. A guy, who turned out to be a cop, came up to the car and recognised Mom. He said ""what accident"" and that it was over a hill. He gave us paper with houses where we could see it."
"3651"	"(2010-10-10 (19)) I had a boyfriend. I was sometimes with Mom. She left at some point and a guy was after me. I changed my shirt and I was then with Mom and some others. Then my boyfriend looked like Adam Baldwin and there was another guy who looked like a young Kiefer Sutherland. I heard something coming from a shop. Someone shot at me and Adam Baldwin shot back. I looked up and saw Kiefer. I snuck in. They ended up confronting each other and each other laugh. Then it was a girl and someone else. They both took their clothes off to see which one I would go to. I looked away. Someone went on their knees making a retard face and the girl saw and laughed."
"3652"	"(2010-10-12 (19)) I was at a shop. There were aisles of different horror things which I was doing for the challenge. I was watching The Sixth Sense in one of them. Dad was there, as was Leif. One of the aisles at the end had a John Lennon section. I went to and they played his music, though they also played Every Breath You Take. Other people came and were moping. Dad and Ezra also came and I took a picture of all the people. I was then playing a game where you get trapped in a room and you have to try to escape. Some were hard and took me a while. One of them was in a bathroom that was only the size of a toilet. The only thing in the room was a mirror with a cabinet and a big water section. I couldn't work it out and freaked out and started crying and screaming. They opened it and let me out. They said that that one and some of the other puzzles had no way out. I was then at home and had two pieces of toast with jam. I put in another for Vegemite. Mom said not to eat the jam ones."
"3653"	"(2010-10-13 (19)) I was at a Royal Show type of place. There was a rounded pyramid game and each bit had different prizes. You had to run up and grab something and when it stopped you would get that prize. There was one with a coin and you had to drop it in the slot at the bottom, then you had to get it out quickly before it started again. Evelyn was there. My pockets were small. Eugene and I were dating. We were walking around there together. There was a movie with Alain Delon and he was a rich guy. It was set in Il Gattopardo times. He tricked a girl into marrying him before changing stuff around, his clothes etc to make her think it was actually his father who she married. She was angry when she found out and confronted him, but he played innocent and said that he didn't do anything. Then it was back to real life involving someone's family life. They had a superhero costume that was part of a family tradition and they had to wear it every Halloween. I got a stick and was poking spiderwebs to take them off. I heard a ayell and saw Poppa pull up in a car. Poppers was there too and the stick scared him."
"3654"	"(2010-10-13 (19)) Nathan Fillion's Twitter said we was going to be downtown and working at some competition. I told Mom and ended up going by myself. There was a little forest section and a cave. You could pick your name and your skin tone. There were only a few people there and he was in the cave. You could get and lose points. There were some people in charge and I got their name wrong at first but I recovered from it. We hung out most of the day. Then it was night. There were rooms for each skin colour. There was a big square bed where two people would lie from the top to the bottom and two people would lie left to right next to them. Calvin and Genevieve were in my skin colour group and were working together. I wanted to change to Nathan Fillion's group but I couldn't find the people. There were spare rooms and Calvin called out for one and Genevieve was annoyed. Calvin called me over to the computer lab. They sat me down at one and I had a password and the name of a site from Nana. I entered it in and it was a news article about homes and it mentioned Barlow way had been caved in. All of my storage stuff had been there and I started shaking and crying. I eventually left and one of the rooms I passed was Mom's. I thought I saw Nathan Fillion in there and then I heard sex sounds and I was sad because I wanted to have sex with him. I went to his room to look for him but I couldn't tell if he was there. I kept walking past and then turned down a corner and saw Eric (True Blood) lying on the floor. I jumped and he wanted to know why I kept looking in there (it was his room too). I said that I was just checking it for the 'middle guy' and Eric added ""with the big puppy dog eyes?"" and I didn't say anything and he said he moved upstairs. I went up and saw Nathan Fillion there and was happy and then I remembered about our house and collapsed near the door. Dmitri came out a bit later and saw me and helped me up. Then I was still there but in a shop. People were doing Glee type of things and singing and dancing around. I turned off the lights and they passed by. I was hoping to get Dmitri in the dark to makeout with him. We turned off two each at one point and they were angry but they continued dancing to a different song. We then all had to get out of the place as it was collapsing. I got out but didn't see Dmitri and started worrying, but he was ok. Mom picked me up. We drove home and I mentioned the house and how important everything in there was to me and I started to cry again. As we were leaving I had texts come through from her and Dad about the house and this other thing. Dad mentioned something with Robert Downey Jr and said he was hilarious. There was some show with James Gandolfini, as well as The Sopranos. We were 'in' it. His last name was Gunn in the other show and he was a lawyer. I kept calling him Tony Soprano and he was looking at me in confusion."
"3655"	"(2010-10-14 (19)) I was questing on World of Warcraft. It was in space and people were floating around. Then I was with Dexter (Dexter). We were at this party thing and Eliza Dushku was with us. She used to be a dancer at this place with Britney Spears. Eliza and this other couple that we knew would scope the place out for people to scam. Britney Spears had been one of these people and had recognised her but she pretended to not know who she was. She had bruises on her. Dexter and I went around the corner and we pretended to argue and he beat me up to explain the bruises and nervousness and we got into an elevator and we kissed. Then it had been a girl that we were going to scam (Britney, though she was a black girl). We would go up to a random floor, find a room and use that. We got off at the second floor and left the elevator and waited for a family to come out of this room. We were going to use the room across the hall (we had been kept out of there for a while). I went in and Dexter started cleaning up. I locked the door but then he said ""please leave the door unlocked"" and I unlocked it and then this girl came in. She looked excited and happy that he had beaten me and that we had a house, as it meant that her suspicion hadn't been correct. She ran away excited to tell someone. We left the room and went down the hall which was the only way to get to this big area. There was a little bridge that we had to lie down on to get across. He said that next time we should have more of an adventure. He got on top of me and kissed me. I'd told him to be quiet in case someone heard us. I put my hands on his back nervously and he pulled closer to me and I relaxed and we made out. He rubbed against me a bit. It was very vivid and I really enjoyed it. Then I had this creature which would printscreen for me. It was like a little floaty jellyfish that would float on top of my finger. Then it was like a guinea pig. I couldn't remember what I had called it so I called it Alan. I was telling Mom about how awesome it was. I had gotten it when we got Rover so Rover had taken precedence. I wondered how I'd forgotten about it. She said it was because in summer they needed extra cooking and care"
"3656"	"(2010-10-16 (19)) It was Winter Veil on World of Warcraft, but it was different. I was in this white area was covered with snow. There were lots of quests and for the one that I was doing I had to get five out of five different things. There was a mini quest where I needed four of each. There were polar bears to loot. There was something with black eyes and I ran off. Some lady had been attacked by something. Mom and Darren were at home and I was worried they were going around to houses to attack people."
"3657"	"(2010-10-17 (19)) Dad, Ezra, Acquaintance-M-02 and I went on holidays. They bought condoms and Dad said that Acquaintance-M-02 had been having sex with his girlfriend but they wanted to have fun too."
"3658"	"(2010-10-17 (19)) A girl, her brother and their 'uncle' were reminiscing about their father that had died. He used to take them to a spot in the woods with some fish. They remembered about it and decided to go there. The girl went back for something but on her way back a guy slit her throat. The others waited hours before deciding that something was wrong. She ended up being okay. The girl was a teenager, the brother about 10 or younger. I was at a restaurant thing. There were lots of people there and I said I'd been playing this lame song a lot lately then it came on the radio - it was Lovers in a Dangerous Time. People complained and I said it was a good song."
"3659"	"(2010-10-19 (19)) I was at Aunt Sally's. She wanted me to redesign the dining area and the lounge room. They went to bed and I tried to decide what the best thing to do was. She came out at one point and I said I hadn't thought of anything. I was also at work at some point spraying the window on the rotisserie oven."
"3660"	"(2010-10-20 (19)) I was watching a musical and it turned out to be Rocco and his Brothers. It confused me that it was a musical."
"3661"	"(2010-10-20 (19)) I found videos and pictures that Eugene had uploaded of him in his room. He was now in a relationship with someone and I hoped that it was just a joke or something."
"3662"	"(2010-10-21 (19)) Mom and I were driving down a familiar street. There were cops coming down the other way, she turned suddenly to follow them but they pulled up at a closed shop, so she went back. A female pedophile put pictures of Alain Delon and Ashton Kutcher onto toddlers."
"3663"	"(2010-10-21 (19)) I was at school in assembly. They would usually update us on how we looked etc. I got down and this guy said that we would have to sit down differently and everyoneleft he said that's not what he meant and then everyone had to come back. There was a guy on a laptop playing World of Warcraft."
"3664"	"(2010-10-22 (19)) We had a school excursion at another school. For some reason I had to drive there and back three times. The carpark was 'squished'. There was a lollipop man who let us across. I wondered why he was there. I had water bottles and was drinking my third one by the second hour. I went to the toilet and the girl's toilet was only open on Wednesdays (It was Wednesday today). I went in but only a few toilets were in cubicles. Mr Stevenson and someone else came in and saw something in the sink. When I came out he accused me of whatever it was, jokingly. Ms Corbett was there too and said something about oranges and China and 'I thought that must've been why you knew so much about China' which had something to do with something that happened at school. Then I was in a bus. I was at back and Eugene and Darius were at the front. I think they saw me looking at Eugene and they moved to the back. A teacher who didn't like Darius argued with him and I took a photo. There was a big flash and everyone looked at me and I pretended like I hadn't known my camera was on. They moved next to me and I was squished. Darius was talking to Eugene about shoes that he'd had with an 'evil' horse on them."
"3665"	"(2010-10-23 (19)) I was at home and it was different. Mom had a different boyfriend who was younger and sort of hot. He flirted with me sometimes. At one point I was bending over, like leaning forward on a table reaching for lollies in a bowl (there were worms, ice-creams and pineapples) and he commented on my butt 'in the nude'. I was like wtf and Ezra said there was something odd about him too. The guy said he had sex with me in the shower. I argued with Ezra over the net about dreams and aggression in dreams. I'd also had a dream aout some guy with a last name like 'chemoprawn' and I looked him on Facebook and his name was slightly different and it had 2043 on the end. I thought it was weird. He was only 13 though and in the dream he had been 18/19. I did a quiz and there was a question about Eric Idle."
"3666"	"(2010-10-23 (19)) I saw smoke coming from the back of my desk and I turned off my computer and got Ezra. He had a look but couldn't find anything."
"3667"	"(2010-10-23 (19)) Mom and I were doing some test/game and you could die, but you could be resurrected. We were in a place with a lot of noobs and it was almost like a World of Warcraft dungeon except you could get close to the enemies without being attacked. There were threes stages/quests in the area. Someone was on the last one and summoned a huge dragon from the water. I quicky ran out. Then Mom and I did the next bit together. We had to go up steps and we had lots of platforms and steps to go. When we got the end, we then went back. One bit had a bunch of cows fall and then they ran across and one went the other way and I got stuck and left behind. I dodged it on the way back. I drove back and everything looked different. I was in a field where giant needles rolled towards where you were. Then I was on foot and alone. A guy was in front of me running backwards slowly and talking to himself (but no words were said). I ran towards him, but I didn't really catch up. I was scared and freaking out. I got to the 'end' and it said to not open the 'pressurized chest' until September. I felt a slight to open it but then I just wanted to leave. This guy had a white mask on, only showing his blue eyes which now looked red. It was then a girl. I asked if she was real and she said yes and took it off. I hugged her and I thought 'that's weird of me'. I managed to get out. Then, I had a small scooter and was with others who were on rollerskates and scooters. There was a big dippy hill and a girl was there with her daughter. Then a big truck backed up behind us. I warned them to move but it was slow. Then we got to the side of the road and it followed me. I got him to crash into a fence and he found a saw and laughed crazily and started cutting people up. We ran. I found a small deli with weird hillbilly types. There was a four lane road and lots of traffic. I waited until there was a red light and then crossed. A mall was on fire and there was a car with Linus's name and picture on it. I went to get help. Then I was at school. Mr Stevenson saw me writing my dreams into my book. He tried to get it and I snatched it back. Mr Noonan and some others were there too. I was up to April 2008. There was a dream with Dmitri and some girl and they both died, and Alain Delon was on top of something."
"3668"	"(2010-10-24 (19)) I was at some place like a cinema. There was a train involved too. Cam and Mitchell (Modern Family) were there. They did something and Alejandro and I stopped them for a photo. They joked and licked my face."
"3669"	"(2010-10-25 (19)) I was in this dome shaped room in a larger building. People started running to the door, then to a door on the other side, but I couldn't see anything and didn't know what was happening. Someone said that 'it' had 6 legs. I ran out of the place and then I saw all these small dinosaurs running around. I ended up back inside and someone else and I walked to the top of the roof. We jumped over to this thing on the side. A dinosaur came and it was a bigger one and it was blue. We stayed still and it jumped up to me and I quickly got onto this shelf thing. We then ran outside. Ezra and I ran to my car and got in and locked the door. I drove off and there were other people driving away and it was stressful. We went to this shop place sometime later and there was raw fish and the dinosaur things ate it. One came and I threw fish at it. Ezra packed up some and we drove away. We went to another place without the car. We cooked chicken. Two were ready and three had a few minutes left (but they had to do something else with them). Rover was there. We packed up all important stuff. There were mechanical things. We ran out and there was a robot like in World of Warcraft and it came up with the green arrow to get in. This other guy climbed up and I pushed him off. We got in a fight and something big was coming and we went the other way. At one point, I strangled some girl and pulled tight on the cord and it made a bone stick out of her neck. We had a place set up now like a village. At another time, we were in a clan and there was a picture of me with the dinosaurs. I got us out somehow."
"3670"	"(2010-10-27 (19)) Ezra and I were in the car in a carpark. A big dude picked up a car and threw it. Then he picked up another one and threw it right in front of us. I started up the car and drove away before he destroyed my car."
"3671"	"(2010-10-27 (19)) I was on FilmForum. There were two entries for Mr Klein. One with no lists and the other with a static 'worst of' list by a critic. I was wondering how since it won a Cesar award and had Alain Delon in it. I was driving around Northtown and Midvale. There were cops behind me and they put their lights on and I went to pull over but they turned down a side street. There were heaps of other cops and I realised something was happening. I had been going 60 in a 50 zone so thought I was going to get a fine. Midvale shops was up the road from Northtown High School and I ended up at the school. There were job notices up. People kept asking who I was and I was like 'I don't go to highschool or know anyone except Farrah'. I saw Farrah a bit later."
"3672"	"(2010-10-29 (19)) Mom and I drove to university (today). We stopped in the middle of the freeway (which was different) close to university and it was nearly time for my class to start. She had found some diet thing on the internet that Timmy was a part of and she met him and he was with some girl. I realised that I forgot my lab coat and books and I told Mom and we went home and I got my stuff and grabbed a jumper too (I had complained it was cold and she was wearing a jacket and said a book said to make the sleeves shorter. As I got ready to leave, there was some weird stuff and I turned around and Mom was in the passenger seat of Timmy's car and I was confused and she just looked at me. He got in the driver's seat and I went to the car and realised Mom was paralysed and couldn't speak. He started driving off and I opened the car and dragged Mom out. Then I was at the old house. I called the cops and he came and he was like 'how do you know she isn't faking it?'. She kept vomiting. I said I needed him to write me a letter excusing me from university today. Dad was there. I opened a cupboard and found Nice biscuits and 4 square Vegemite things. Dad and the cop talked in the games room and said 'child gets 1.5% of whatever' like in a will, and I was like 'is she dead?!' and they looked at me sympathetically and I went through the kitchen to the lounge room and she was lying next to the long lounge on the floor. She had a cigarette in one hand and it dropped on her and I grabbed it and shook her and she woke up like 'what's going on' and I said 'you almost set yourself on fire, you idiot'."
"3673"	"(2010-10-30 (19)) Ezra, Dad and I were in Russia as part of a holiday. It went back and forth between a movie and real life. The movie was called Watch Out for the Automobile but was not the same movie. There was a guy who was an American actor but I couldn't remember where I'd seen him. Dad said it was Matt Damon and I said it wasn't. There was a nocturnal bird and a kitten? I told Dad to check in on Facebook. Then it got weird and only a certain number of people were allowed on this ship thing. A guy got two more spots for his girlfriend and some girl, but they ended up dying. Then it was a game and it started out good and then you go on a spaceship and it got weird and hard."
"3674"	"(2010-10-30 (19)) I had a concert to go to. I got there and it was in a small room. The ban was called K'Um. I didn't know any of the songs except they played 1985. I wondered why I paid $100 to see this. The guy next to me had the same shoes as me. I left after 30 minutes. I went to the Royal Show and Seamus got a balloon for this young kid. I went to walk out and had to push this woman out of the show and then I waited for the traffic to slow down and walked across."
"3675"	"(2010-10-31 (19)) I was in the UK. Mom was there too. We were staying at this house. I was trying to sleep but there were no curtains on the windows and I had a hard time. I eventually fell asleep but I woke up to people talking outside. Mom and I went to the shop. The checkout was at the back and it was like a deli section. There was a fudge section and 2-3 rows of ice-cream freezers. A lady came up to us with a 1-2 year old daughter in her arms and said to Mom 'do you have a daughter? Why aren't they dressed in school uniforms?' and I said ""I'm in university"". She said oh and I added ""back home"". She still said she was unhappy with what I was wearing and I said we were practically wearing the same thing -- black shirt and black shorts (she was wearing pants though). They were her work clothes. I found a box of dark chocolate Golden Gaytimes in the ice-cream section. I was trying to find a single one instead of a box. They also had lamingtons, but not many. Then we left. An Asian lady at the counter asked what we were looking for and I told them and she said they didn't have them. I called Mom and she drove off and I said 'how am I supposed to pay for this?'. I asked a lady who knew me and she paid for now. Mom went to this house and said some Asian guy had mentioned me wanting to move there and everyone knew. Then I was in some group. We were planning something illegal (but for a good reason). We were in a place that was like a hospital. We saw nurses starting to trickle in and they yelled for us to surrender. River Tam (Firefly) was there and started running and I followed her. There were lots of floors with just beams and she ran easily but I had to go slow so I didn't fall. She led me to this guy and she said 'he's found a cure' and he asked something and I nodded and he kissed me on the forehead. He looked like Preston. He told me to go and I surrendered. We were out the front of this place during the day and the 'police' pulled up fast and in front of this cute cat and I said it was kind of mean. I was trying to work out who would go in what car. Then I was waiting in a car with Ezra in a carpark full of cars. Then there was water nearby with boats. Ezra asked if I saw the guy and I said I did and he was trying to guess what car he was in."
"3676"	"(2010-11-02 (19)) I was at home and I checked my calendar and it was the second week of November and I realised I'd missed my Forensics exam. I panicked and then found out another one was on today. I then decided it didn't matter because I was going to drop out anyway and I informed Mom."
"3677"	"(2010-11-02 (19)) I was out somewhere with Mom. She had decided to take Rover for a walk at the park there. We had my car, Dad's van and Ezra's car. Then Dad took his van. Mom wanted me to take Ezra's car. We went for a drive to find the way to get back without any speed bumps. I was like 'you left Rover alone there, now I have to drive you back and then pick you up'. I ended up at this place where highschoolers were doing yearbook stuff. There were shelves and one was made of cardboard. Ezra was there. Rover and Sam (Supernatural) were there and I was telling Ezra that Mom left Rover behind earlier and Ezra said to the other Rover that Rover was our dog and that he was named after him. The cardboard shelf fell apart. Later, I was at the old house. Ezra was there. There was this thing where something would come to your house if you won a competition and it was saying 'sex'. It was night. He ran out front and a group of people came to the driveway. Our cars were on the lawn. I thought something seemed dodgy. There were people with antlers and some were on the roof. It was hard to see because it was dark. Someone across the street turned a light on and saw them and a girl screamed. I realised some were inside and I went in. They could turn into puddles. I realised they were evil and they turned into puddles on the lino and lit them on fire with a lighter. Another one looked like Spaceman and I set it on fire and there was a note saying 'real pet'. I reset it and burned the other one instead but it didn't work. It turned into a person and wanted to make a deal that it would do something if I let it live and I agreed. I was then somewhere else, inside. Then it was like a movie and a girl went into a bathroom and in the mirror, it reflected this big 'pirate' head (it was like a mask) and it was the leader trying to trick us."
"3678"	"(2010-11-05 (19)) I was going on a trip overseas for school. I can't remember where the first place was but I was also going to Greece for a month or two. I had a daughter, who was about 3 years old, and she was Asian -- I had been dating a Japanese guy. I asked Mom to look after her and Mom said no and I got angry and yelled at her. I said I needed her to because it was too difficult to organise a passport for her. I got some guy I knew to set up the flight for me, but we hadn't organised a hotel yet. I asked Calvin what day he was going for the second trip. Then I was going on holiday, except Ezra and I were going. Dad and I went to the airport the day before. I forgot my shoes and I ran to get them. I went outside and I chased someone through snow which was freezing and I said 'Ocean Reef' and it went back to normal. I tried to get to Centerville Cinema but it was another one and weird. This bad guy copied this gay guy's outfit which was orange and yellow. Ezra and I stayed at a place and watched some weird show. Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and John Cleese were in it. I didn't get to sleep until 3am."
"3679"	"(2010-11-07 (19)) Dad, Ezra and I went to the movies and were seeing a Star Wars movie. Ezra wasn't feeling well. Nana worked there and she offered him a choc top. It was busy. The seats moved and had a tray underneath and I had to reach over and get it. The film started with some ghost train but then there was nothing else. Dad went to go see what the problem was. Stash was there with some boys. The movie just turned into Lord of the Rings. Merry and Pippin were in it and played by the same actors."
"3680"	"(2010-11-08 (19)) My 19th birthday was tomorrow and I had organsised with Darren to find someone to lose my virginity to. At night time Darren picked me up and we drove. I said 'can we pick someone up' and we agreed to go the shop. There was no-one I liked at the place. There were pictures of some celebs -- I remember Nathan Fillion, but he as in Switzerland. A lady showed me a picture of a guy and he was old and had a comb-over and I said 'ew no'. I eventually found a guy who I thought was ok. Mom didn't know about it. I also talked to Leif on Facebook and he asked how much I got paid and I said '$6' and some other stuff. He said 'it's like you almost speak another language sometimes' and I said 'you don't always make sentences correctly' and he was like 'fuck you' and I said I wasn't' being mean and that I wished I could speak another language as well as he could. Linus also commented on something. I went to the beach with Dad and the waves started pulling back and I ran to get away from the huge wave."
"3681"	"(2010-11-11 (19)) Mom was babysitting a kid who was about 3-4. We were at a big house. I was in bed and got up to see the kid crawling around. I called out to Mom and we looked for it. Eventually we ended up outside shops on a road and the kid was right near the road. I went near her and she walked in front of a truck and was decapitated. The body was still standing though and I was shocked."
"3682"	"(2010-11-12 (19)) My car was out the front of the old house (on the grass in the middle). There was a note on it left from these people who lived across the road. Dad left a note about Zalgo and the next day they put Zalgo stuff all over it (like 'he comes' etc). I went to work and Ezra was there. We finished most of it and then we started chatting and I realised I hadn't done the floors yet. I quickly got to cleaning them but the place was bigger and different and there was a small office room. Ezra left to wait for me and Isaak came out. He looked in the sink and asked if I had relatives here and I said no and then said Ezra was here for a bit. He said something about my car and the police. I ran out and there was more writing on it with 'fail' on the door. I went to some place with a bunch of people and some of them were in the group that did it. Everyone put their feet and hands on someone else and a girl asked to leave to take a pregnancy test."
"3683"	"(2010-11-13 (19)) Some guy was going across the USA to different motel. America was in the shape of a square. There was a place with a big shop called Northtown. He got to his final destination where he had a prostitute waiting, who was played by Megan Fox and I was like 'urgh, she's ugly'. Her boobs were big and there was stuff like tea towels between them and then she took her clothes off and then there was a montage of them having sex in various positions. Then he left with some drug people. The cops stopped them and found drugs and I was sad because he was a nice guy, but he had been aware that they had drugs."
"3684"	"(2010-11-15 (19)) I had a university exam. I sat at the front because Alain Delon was there. I finished the exam and went to leave but I went back into the hall and Alain Delon was there out on a break and I wanted to get a photo with him."
"3685"	"(2010-11-15 (19)) There were zombies. It was like a game and we had health and experience etc. We were running away outside. We tried to climb up on a roof which was the shape of a 'b', but there was a zombie there. I eventually ended up in this shop place. A guy ran out to help get something and instead went to lock the police out the front who were dropping people off. I put the lock back (in a book outside and it had a switch like they have for trains). I went inside and this leader guy told us to all go wait at the back of the store and I said 'no, you did that before and all the zombies went there'. Zombies came in and we were ripping their throats out. I cut the throat of an old lady zombie and then yanked out her throat. Eventually there were only a few left."
"3686"	"(2010-11-16 (19)) I was on FilmForum and watching an edit of The Room done 'properly'. I remember seeing Mark and Johnny and it was a musical too. I made a note that it was alright and Frankie had commented too."
"3687"	"(2010-11-16 (19)) I was at Nana's. The cops were searching for drugs. They said they found some and I protested. I ended up with some girl on the run from someone. There was a guy with raccoon eyes and he went into our place. We ducked into this abandoned shop. There was nowhere to go and I hid behind the counter. He came in with goons and looked around but didn't find me. We now had Kurt from Glee with us. As he went to leave he said something and two guys found us and tried to get us and we fought them and ran. There were guards outside. They moved and we left. We went into a shop through the back windows. It was a Muslim shop with food shops etc inside. They came in after us and had to make small talk with people as they made their way through. I bought water at one place. We went into a clothes shop and changed our clothes quickly (it was in a montage). At the end of the montage I was wearing a big black coat and high heel boots. The guys found us and we fought again. Then we all talked."
"3688"	"(2010-11-19 (19)) I was at university. I was in a computer lab or something like that, on a computer. This hot guy came in and I somehow found out that he was knowledgeable about programming. I asked him how to have a table with spry links and how to display results. He said he was in a rush but sat down and showed me. There was a mouse on the loose. I saw a rat and it had dried blood on it and then people said there was no rat but I could clearly see it -- it was a ghost. Mom made food and I went to shower. At first I was with a group of people but sometimes it was just Ezra. We were climbing across a scaffolding. Two people had to get there and they got a passport and went overseas to get away from some other guy. Once I got down I was walking and then I was in a car. A car stopped next to it and Ezra was in it. I waited for other cars and a police with sirens on came and then stopped on the corner. Then Ezra and I put on captain uniforms. Mine was dark blue and his was a lighter blue. We got in the car and changed into them. I ate and then they left. I hadn't gotten to park all the way up yet. I passed an electronics store with 20% of everything and Dad was like 'you should've bought a TV'. I went in and there were cheesecake slices for dessert and I stabbed this guy with a fork and then the police were on their way. Ezra and I cleaned the fork and fixed our uniforms up. I can't remember what happened but then I'd been downloading some game show. I watched an episode and Neil Patrick Harris and Matthew Perry were on it. It was from the early/mid 90s. Neil Patrick Harris was ""noted for his wit"" and they were actually really funny. Darren asked about my downloading and I said it was a freeleech and one of them was ""from KG, not yours"" and he was worried about ratio. I switched cameras and someone looked like Lydia. There was a Glee performance and I remember seeing Rachel and Finn."
"3689"	"(2010-11-19 (19)) I killed someone and the news people swarmed the house which was tiny and like a caravan. Mom made a lasagne for people but we had something else instead. I left at one point and ended up at a school. I had to go in and it was 3pm so everyone was leaving and everyone recognised me so I ran trying to get out. I had a pocketknife thing and I used it to make people get away from me. There was a guy and we ran through a dark tunnel. I used a LED light and my phone to help me follow him. At the end, he believed I didn't do it."
"3690"	"(2010-11-20 (19)) The characters from Friends were on holidays. They were in an auditorium thing which had a stage. Someone was gay. Jeff from Community was there and had a brother. Then they were at a house. Monica and Chandler had started seeing each other secretly and had slept together. They were kissing in a walk-in cupboard and the others walked in and caught them and Monica freaked out but they were all cool with it. They walked across train tracks and one was 'open' and the other had a train slowly coming. Then they were at some place and Chandler and I had organised the luggage. We put water bottles in the cupboard. Some girl was with us and we had to hide her. Someone was looking for her and I said I couldn't find her ""there are like 50 girls wearing white singlets"" but she decided to look anyway. The girl out of the little building thing she was hiding in and into some animal clinic."
"3691"	"(2010-11-21 (19)) I knew Castle and Beckett (both from Castle) and I was on a case with them. This guy was suspected of taking an ID of some other guy. There was as pic of the other guy and they looked very similar and had the same mannerisms etc. We were in an alley near a house and Beckett went down with a gun and said 'show yourself!'. The guy was there with his facial hair shaved off. We were in a car and the other guy was in the back and he gave himself up and looked scared. Beckett and Castle had to go somewhere later and she gave me the report and asked me to see if I could find out how they saved it. There was a picture of a clothes rack and dress? I went to Alexis and asked if it was because the dresses weren't on the clothes rack and she said yeah. She seemed shaken by the case. We were staying at the old house. Mom and Darren were there and asleep. Alexis had a nightmare about a guy standing at the door. I told her it was safe and that I'd had a similar nightmare. She ended up freaking out and I heard a car start. I went to Mom's window and called out ""Alexis!"" but she was driving off. Later, she came back with cash. We got food. I said something to Beckett and she said no but that something was in the lab report. It said something about pushing the clothes rack but people had been pulling it?"
"3692"	"(2010-11-22 (19)) I was in a carpark. Dad was with mafia kind of people. They were taking my car somewhere and they gave me this other car in the meantime, but there wasn't much space between cars and it was squishy to get in. Then we were at Midvale shops. I parked at the side of the road and checked the map book. I told people to go. I was then with characters from Friends. I was dating Chandler and Rachel was dating Ross. Monica was with someone too. Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, Ross and I went shopping. Rachel and Monica bought lots of clothes for their boyfriends. I kept leaving my wallet in random places. We were in the sleepwear section and Monica and Rachel were like 'oh we should buy the guys pyjamas' but the guys weren't interested. The pyjamas were folded on shelves and I touched one of them. It was soft and slightly silky and unlike anything I'd ever touched before and I called them over. The guys touched it and wanted one each. The girls ended up choosing this other one which was just as soft. Then they were shoes and they had pink and I chose blue. The pink one also had green and were very child-like."
"3693"	"(2010-11-22 (19)) I was driving on the freeway, which was different. I was going 70km/h so I changed lanes and sped up. I was approaching the tunnel and there was a cop with a sign. I realised he was doing breath tests so I stopped. I said to this lady, who was smoking, 'excuse me, I don't know if I was supposed to stop'. She said 'me neither'. I saw everyone behind me stop too. Elijah was there. It was then my turn for the test and they had to give you a needle that went between your hand and arm. I didn't want to do it. They also tested your heart rate. Phoebe and Monica (both from Friends) were there and Phoebe was pregnant. Phoebe got into a bed and I saw water on the floor and I said 'did you spill a drink or did your water break?'. It turned out her water had broken and I got Monica and we went to take her to hospital. At one point Ezra had my phone and he said he looked at my photos and I yelled 'DON'T!' as I was worried I had naked weight loss photos on there. He said Nana looked too and saw pictures of Joey and Chandler from Friends and I was like 'so what?'."
"3694"	"(2010-11-23 (19)) Mom and I were near a busy road. Spaceman kept wandering around and we had to run to catch him. He was near the edge of the road and a bus drove over his head and paws but it didn't kill him. He was limping and acting a bit odd. We took him to the vet and they said he might not make it and I was angry at Mom for leaving him and I was upset. There was a British Mission Impossible movie except it was called The Thing and it started off silent. It was made in 1974 and John Cleese, Michael Palin and Courteney Cox were in it. A goth/punk girl and two friends went into this person's house. The lady was asleep was on the lounge. They were just sneaking around, but the lady woke up and saw the girl. She knew she would tell her 'supervisor' and so she ran outside and stabbed her with a metal star knife thing, but everyone saw. She got into pretty big trouble and I thought it was silly because it wasn't really her fault."
"3695"	"(2010-11-24 (19)) I was at university/school. Classes were sets of seats near edges. There were these balconies all across and in the middle was nothing. One of them had a fat kid sitting in front of someone else and it blocked their view of the lesson. There were two groups and one needed a stick to pick up loot and the other was mine and we could just pick things straight off the floor. But I still had to pay $1 for a stick. There was a letter from a Macedonian church saying something was free. The teacher lady thought it meant stuff related to this loot business."
"3696"	"(2010-11-25 (19)) I was a spy, along with the most of the main cast of Friends. Ross didn't know about it and was an engineer and was checking something out about something he had built. While he was there, terrorists took over. A guy was in a pool and went under the water and pretended to drown but then actually drowned. Then we were at this house and a guy said the guy had died from a Japanese disease linked to some machine. This guy had been Japanese and had cut out his eyes. Then I was watching Chuck and Jeff dreamed about Sarah and it was in slow motion and focused on her chest. Then Joey (Friends) had once been really high up in the spy world, but then had become like he is in the show. A sniper saw Ross in the building. My phone was there and I wanted it back. I called him and I was now his sister and I explained some of the stuff. I told him how to escape and that the terrorists were watching him. Then I was home, which was different. Ezra came home late at night with food. Mom was confused and he said he drove and Mom was angry and he got upset and said 'I thought you'd be proud'. I said 'by breaking the law?'."
"3697"	"(2010-11-25 (19)) Dad and I went to the UK just to check out something -- we could do a 'quick' flight, and it would often land in front of this building near the sea which was near an embassy. Right next door to our building was a huge pet shop. There was a big exhibit in the middle with lots of cute brown puppies. There were ducks and geese there. I told Dad that some of the characters in Friends had a duck and chicken as pets and they were cute. Then it turned into a zoo. Some koalas and another kind of animal had all been packed on top of each other. I thought it was mean. I ordered one and told them to deliver to some address. A guy put the koala in a plastic bag and laughed. Then I walked away and I was like 'slice him open, slash his face'. I heard them do it and then I was carrying the plastic bag and dropped it in the middle of a park. The koala ran and went up a tree. I was thinking I would call it Chandler or Joey."
"3698"	"(2010-11-26 (19)) I was at the old house with the characters from Friends. I only remember seeing Rachel, Chandler and Joey. Joey was trying to pick someone up. I was dating Chandler. He was sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor of the lounge room with someone else. Rachel wanted to get pregnant and started to cry. I offered to do it and she said ok and we went to my bedroom and I started clearing the bed. She then said she couldn't and I said it was ok. We went back to the lounge and then we'd been up all night and it was early morning outside (like 5am). Chandler woke up and we kissed (just a peck) and he made a joke about how good the sex was on the couch (we hadn't done anything). There was a zombie movie with a group of people. At the end, someone put the infected into a microwave. A girl walked past and it exploded. She was ok, but some got into her mouth. The director/writer was a girl."
"3699"	"(2010-11-26 (19)) There was a FilmForum get together and I walked there. A lady with a dog and a weird accent talked to me. Leif was on the other side of the road. I got there and had a deep cut on my arm -- it started about halfway down and was about 10cm long. A girl asked if I'd seen this new porno and I said I hadn't. I played some game that was an hour long and was going to play it again. There was a little carpark and you had to stand in front of a parking space and place a light and then park the car. George Clooney had a 'fold up' car. I was watching Friends and Chandler was the one who liked to cook."
"3700"	"(2010-11-28 (19)) Dad, Ezra and I were on a plane. Ezra and I were sitting next to each other and Dad was behind us. A guy was willing to swap but then I couldn't be next to the window. Then we were in America. We were stopping there for a day or two, then going to the UK. I took a photo of a street sign. There was a koala and I said to Dad that I had a dream about a killer one the other day. Then just Dad and I were in the UK. There was a building where they had shot Friends and pictures of the cast were all around the walls. Lisa Kudrow was outside having pictures taken and I took a photo. Then Matthew Perry came out and I was excited and got a photo taken with him."
"3701"	"(2010-11-28 (19)) I was in the UK. The police were chasing me and someone else. We pulled up into a garage and they didn't see us. Granny was nearby and I went to her. She said she was tired and I had to take her to some place to sleep."
"3702"	"(2010-11-29 (19)) I was driving down a two lane road. Two cars behind me were going the other way. Then it was like a movie. They got out and walked down the island in the middle of the road. There were two cars and two girls. They were like 'is it weird I feel drawn to these cars'. They decided it was their destiny for them to take them. They were worried that it could be a trick to make their lives worse. Then it was years later and they were all successful. One of them had just got a part in Friends and was given pot. They all met up and had a smoke and hallucinated. One of them saw a leopard and a dead baby in water. They all ended up dying. A guy reset and things went differently."
"3703"	"(2010-11-30 (19)) It was nearly time for me to go to work, so I started getting changed. I lived with Ezra and some of his friends. I took the train to work and I was late. When I went home, there were two mice in my bedroom. They had round ears which meant they were wild."
"3704"	"(2010-11-30 (19)) I was at a party. Matthew Perry was there and I got a photo with him. Someone showed me some photos they took at the zoo with Jennifer Aniston and she looked like she hadn't wanted to have a photo taken. There was also another character in Friends who was an Indian guy called Vikram."
"3705"	"(2010-11-30 (19)) This girl and I killed some people. She decided to kill this guy in a ditch in front of this house. There was a 'door' and a room behind it. The police turned up and arrested us. We were allowed to pack our stuff up."
"3706"	"(2010-12-01 (19)) I was watching Friends. Rachel and Chandler got drunk and slept together. They kept it secret for a while and then they just blurted it out to Monica. She was upset, but stayed with him."
"3707"	"(2010-12-01 (19)) I liked this guy, though he was dating someone else. I think he did something that made me think he was interested in me and I kept trying to get him alone to flirt. We were in a car and sent everyone else outside to look after some stuff and I got closer to him and was like 'soo...' but then they came back. Another time I sat right next to him and he moved over a bit but our legs were still touching. Then there was snow. He was in a little hut thing and we were discussing what we were going to do (as it was my first time with snow) and I said 'oh, we're alone'. The TV was on. This girl came in and I was annoyed that we still weren't alone. Later we were near a river. The guy wished for zombies and some came out of the river. We ran. There was a 'balloon' baby and a guy was holding it and it snapped at others. It followed me to the toilet and I kicked it under the door. Then it got bigger and was huge and I ran. A girl said ""Alcatraz man"" and someone said 'Candyman can'."
"3708"	"(2010-12-02 (19)) Tanita posted on Facebook something like 'omg The Walking Dead is awesome' and a reference to some place they were going to on the show. I commented saying 'lol I can't wait until they get to that place. That was my favourite part of the comic'. Then I was in show. Kelly, Dmitri and Alisha (all from Misfits) were in it too. We were in a group along with Rick from the comic and some other people. There were two kids. We were in a house. Another group found us and they were bad guys.  They wanted to talk to this guy and his kid (but didn't realise there were two). They argued over which kid would go. Eventually Carl and Rick left, but it turned out the people weren't so bad. A black guy in our group betrayed us. I was telling two girls what happened while I was putting my shoes on. Then people started trying to get in. We couldn't open the back door as it was controlled by a computer and we didn't have someone who could program it. We did manage to open it and we ran. It was night and I was very slow. There was a strange grass field on concrete (like a small park). We lay on it, but the people found us easily. They shot one of us and questioned the rest of us. They asked why I didn't run and I said ""well, as you can see I'm overweight, unfit and have a dodgy knee"". They asked what was wrong with my knee and I said ""I don't know, I think it's hereditary"". They let me go and now the group was huge. I sat at the end of this long table where everyone else was sitting. Alisha sat next to me, chewing gum. Dmitri was at the desk behind me. Then I came later, running in saying there were zombies and we needed to run. They all aimed their weapons at me but then we all got guns and ran. We were shooting zombies as we ran away. I ended up in this building with two others. We had to climb through this duct and they said it smelled. We dropped into this big office. Something in the light had busted and smelled. We looked out the window and there were a few zombies around, but we saw people that we knew across the road. They stood still and the zombies passed by them. We did the same thing but this person we were with whistled and ran and hit the zombies with chairs. We met up with the group again eventually and were in cars. I ran into a fitness shop at one point and Dmitri was watching me."
"3709"	"(2010-12-03 (19)) I was at a school. I had taken this dance class for university and I could've done it externally (just theory) but I went in anyway. This was our last performance and I was chosen as the 'lead' dancer. This guy and I were supposed to dance together and I didn't want to do it. At the start, we weren't dancing together and I copied other movements. Then as he started to go to the front, I ran. There was an area under the building where I went to hide. I lay on the sand but they saw me as they walked past. The teacher threatened to fail me and I protested saying that I'd done well until now, I had been chosen as the 'best' etc. They eventually gave in and I ended up with a B grade."
"3710"	"(2010-12-03 (19)) I was at the old house. I was with two others and we would kidnap a random person and torture and kill them. We had this girl with her hands tied up in my room. I was talking in Dad's old room and I saw she had untied her hands and was sitting on my bed, naked. I ran and jumped on her and she grabbed a pair of scissors and I got them off her and stabbed her in the chest. I tied her back up and got ready to go to bed."
"3711"	"(2010-12-03 (19)) Some others and I had to go downhill after something exploded or something. There was a video of it happening and this guy I liked had reached his hands out to grab me and this other girl. I had reached out and then pulled my hand away. This girl was like ""you're so lucky"" and it turned out he liked me. I was then in a cafe place. There was a big 'exhibit' full of cakes and chocolates etc. The currency was in pounds. I got a cheesecake. The guy asked this girl to 'read' me and to see if I was enjoying it. It started off not tasting like cheesecake and then was warm and sweet. He got angry and left. We waited for this other group to come and we left. Ezra was there now. Then this young fat teenager wanted 15c from this gay guy. He gave him 16c and he wanted more. Then we were near the gay guy's house and we walked through it and he said people weren't gay friendly so no-one knew he was gay. I said that the guy might cause trouble for him. Then we were at a rodeo thing and the guy came around a corner on a motorbike, really fast. We ducked behind a wall and the guy was after the gay guy. The guy started talking loudly and found us. I trapped him in a fridge and the guy filmed it. Calvin and Samantha were there and he gave her oral sex outside."
"3712"	"(2010-12-04 (19)) I was watching a movie with Alain Delon in it. He had a nose ring that went over the bridge of his nose and it annoyed me. He was also sort of Asian looking and I was thinking that my favourite actor was Japanese. He said something and I said 'You're Le Samourai' and Mom seemed to recognise the name."
"3713"	"(2010-12-05 (19)) Amelia was turning 5 and still couldn't talk. Mom insisted she could but I said it was just noise. Later though, she said something and I was like 'ok now she's talking'."
"3714"	"(2010-12-05 (19)) I had a brother who was around my age (or older). Later, I went into a room and some people came. I hid in the bathroom. It was an old fat guy (like 50-60 years old) and his daughter. My 'brother' was his son. The guy and his daughter had sex and then my 'brother' came and joined in (having anal sex with his father). Then Greg Sestero was there and was doing the daughter from behind but then they saw me in the reflection of the mirror and I was like 'ok what the hell is going on?'."
"3715"	"(2010-12-05 (19)) I was at home but it was different. Mom had bought heaps of these thick red socks. Leslie and Valerie had taken a few. Dad had been seeing this girl and he said she might come over asking for money and I was to tell her to go away. She worked at this place which sold epilepsy pills and was a drug addict. She pulled up on a motorbike and Mom turned off the outside light. She came to the door and Mom refused her money and she said ""of course not"" and left. She was actually super crazy. Later I was staying at Dad's. I watched some Alain Delon movie from the 1980s and he was old. It was a weird horror film. We fell asleep and I woke up to the video player opening and I looked up and saw someone outside wearing ""superhero clothes"" and then ran off. I saw the door unlocked and open. Dad locked it and shut the curtains. Later, Mom and Ezra were there too. This bench top had a weird texture and she wanted it. She sent us a video."
"3716"	"(2010-12-08 (19)) I was getting married to Eugene. I had reluctantly decided to have a wedding. It was in 2 days and we were getting ready for it. I was wearing a wedding dress and I decided I looked too fat and refused to wear it. I wanted to see Eugene in his tuxedo, but was thinking of asking him if we could do a casual wedding. We were spending this time apart. I packed up my room, which was different, to be left for a day or two. Mom was helping me."
"3717"	"(2010-12-09 (19)) I was at the old house. Ezra was in the study. I asked ""one, where's our mother and two, why is this here?' and pointed to a lit candle in a birthday cake. He mumbled quietly and I asked him to repeat it and eventually he said he didn't know. Mom finally came back with Rover and she said she'd been in an accident in my car. She'd had to slam the brakes on. I was angry because the front of the car was smashed in. I took photos and said that I'd never let her drive my car again."
"3718"	"(2010-12-09 (19)) I was watching a movie that was set in the past, but it was kind of weird and not accurate. There was a house that had a circular room that could spin. Jim Carrey's character went into the room and then got excited that the room could spin. Breckin Myer had a small part in the film and George Clooney was in it too. Then I was there and Jim Carrey was following me around like a puppy and I was trying to get away. Sometimes we liked each other. The doors wouldn't lock. I went outside and the back of the house was like a barracks. There were notebooks that I used as diaries. There was a guy with a big ring on his second finger and ring finger and I slept with him. People were coming after me and I ran. Jim Carrey met me behind this wall and had a bear costume. We held hands and skipped back, then ran. There was also a movie with John Cusack in it and he got a letter from the director saying ""please do not use your real hair"" and to wear this cornrow wig. It also had the words 'fuck' and 'cunt' in it and ended with 'Wolfman'. Then it was World of Warcraft, but in real life. I was driving back from 'Azeroth' which was in Norway, which was near us. I was then on a bus and it went to turn right at the lights and I realised I was on the wrong bus. The girl in front of me called someone and said she was on the wrong bus and I tapped her on the shoulder and asked if I could go with her and she got annoyed because she was on the phone and I told her not to worry about it and that I'd call my Mom. I tried calling Mom but she wasn't answering. I got off at the next stop. I went into this building and outside I could see huge waves. There were boats and trains nearby. I asked how to get back downtown and this guy said I had to get hit by the waves a few times. I said 'I got here on land, I can get back on land'. I ended up with Robert Sheehan and this girl was helping us. She invited us to a cafe. He ordered 'pseudo spaghetti' and I didn't want anything, but there were chips and I ate some. You could buy carrots for $7. His dish came and it was spicy. It was also rude to not eat all your food at this cafe."
"3719"	"(2010-12-10 (19)) I was at Nana's for Christmas Eve. The lounge room was slightly different and Dad and Ezra were down there, along with Eugene and his brother Rodney. I wondered how they knew them. We were watching TV and I moved to sit on the floor next to the TV. We had all been talking together and I was wondering how to 'get in' with him. Later, I was in the house alone and I was just sitting on a step and I looked up and Eugene was in the hall and I said he scared me. Then I walked out and went into this new room and everyone was in there. I sat in the corner on a seat next to Poppa and Ezra. Eugene joined me. Then we were in another room and Ezra and I had a huge fishtank each. He had a piranha and I had a normal fish. There were big groups of little fish for the piranha to eat and it was practically jumping out of the tank. Ezra got it and put it in my tank by mistake. I freaked out and got a net and tried to fish it out, then he tried and managed to catch it and put it back. Then my tank was low on water. I ran to get Poppa. There was a rabbit cage which had a little pipe. I said 'they're going to die!' and he quickly got a hose and filled it up. Ezra's was going down too. We had to raise the tank and it was full and started to spill. Poppa was also impersonating the Marx brothers at one point."
"3720"	"(2010-12-10 (19)) I went to the shop. I was in a car/motorbike with Ezra, a guy and a girl. Ezra and the guy went in and we waited. Two guys were trying to seduce us and she went with them. Then I was in a church and she was a cop and was Torres from Lie To Me and it was a set up. Then it was One Tree Hill and some of the characters were in a car. Nathan thought it was a set up, but they started walking and he jumped out in front and fell. He got hit and ended up with a pole through him and a big snake wrapped around him."
"3721"	"(2010-12-11 (19)) I was watching Supernatural and Dean and Sam were with an old guy."
"3722"	"(2010-12-11 (19)) Eugene and I were living at this apartment place. He was hiding out and was a writer. Some new people came and didn't like us. This guy threw our ball and I went to go get it and it landed in an empty lot. He was annoyed because it meant I would come back soon. Morena Baccarin was a prostitute. There was a guide on how to level up quickly on World of Warcraft and it said to make a money you had to have a baby at level 1. There was a new 'race' and it was seals and they were the strongest."
"3723"	"(2010-12-12 (19)) I was at a video shop with Ezra. I had a list of my top 20 movies and I told Ezra to give it to the guy behind the counter. We waited a while and he came back and said he found 11 of them. I said 'let me see' but when I looked at them he said he had rearranged the list a bit, but had actually made his own list of 21. He said ""you like cool movies"". He asked us what we thought of Sean Connery and I said I didn't really care. He said that James Bond films needed to be studied. I asked if they had any Alain Delon movies there and he didn't know who it was. Then he said ""have you seen Le Samourai?"" and I was like 'how can you have seen that and not know who Alain Delon is?'. Carl Weathers was then with us. I said that I felt like rewatching Arrested Development and he started singing 'it ain't easy being white'. And I said '... black'. Everyone else asked what we were talking about. Then this weird stuff happened. There was a reddish liquid on the floor. It Cortexaphan and I said 'oh no they di'nt'. There was another liquid that glowed green. It turned out the guy behind the counter was dodgy. There was a lab out the back. I said that I knew something was up because he didn't know who Alain Delon was. Then he was Alain Delon and I was watching him in his lab and he was watching me and had a knife. I said 'I'm just watching'. Then we were outside and he used the liquid and sprayed it with water and he explained (in a French accent) that it kept the wall in a different 'plane of existence' so that the water wouldn't stay. I asked 'so if it was used on a human, they wouldn't age and their eyes wouldn't fail' and he said yes. Then he was actually a 'good' bad guy. There was another bad guy doing other stuff. Alain Delon stood on a little step and yelled at the guy and I was thinking he looked really hot. I started checking him out and was staring at his butt and was thinking that wasn't like me. Then he said that ""it's now"" and the liquid was going to explode. We lay down, as did the bad guy. Then he told me to run for it. As we did, it exploded and there was red smoke. We walked through a highschool and people were leaving and not even paying attention. They looked very 80s-ish. We walked away and he put his arm around me."
"3724"	"(2010-12-12 (19)) I can't remember how it happened, but a black guy was lying on the side of some water with heaps of bullet holes in him, but he was alive. A friend and I were there and she decided to drown herself. I jumped in to save her, but I started drowning and someone saved us both. He was wearing a hoodie etc, so we couldn't see his face. On the news it said that it was Mike Bailey. It became a famous event and was all over Youtube etc. No-one believed that I was one of the girls there. I found a video with a close-up of me lying on a rock and coughing. Mom was telling me to straighten my hair to talk about it on the news but I didn't want to. Later I was in an audience. A guy asked for people to participate in a game. Evelyn and I volunteered. People commented on my white skin. We had to go underwater to find stuff. The second one was in Morse Code and was a list. I took a waterproof radio and we sat at a bench trying to work it out."
"3725"	"(2010-12-13 (19)) I was in a desert-like place. Someone found something with a 'neverending' supply of orange gems. Some others and I went there. We went through a door and Rick from The Walking Dead show was there with a black guy. A kid said he wasn't his father and left and Rick was sad. The place collapsed and a big door went down and we got trapped. It talked to us and said we were stuck forever. But then it decided to give us 515 days to get some stuff done. There was a party. The black guy proposed to his girlfriend. I drank alcohol and was lying on the floor pretending to be asleep. Ezra was dancing in a hoodie, which was a fashion thing he was into. The black girl from before was saying the wedding was expensive and fragile. Someone asked this other girl and I what our favourite part of the cake was and I said 'the nice bit with the hard chocolate bit'."
"3726"	"(2010-12-14 (19)) I was at university doing the first lesson in a new course. We had to pair up and I ended up with this girl with curly blonde hair and a weird mousy face. It was boring and had nothing to do with the topic so I was playing on my phone. A guy complained about it. Then it was school. The desks were really close to each other and some faced the wall. I moved my desk back a bit. Dad was in the class too. Ms Eckert was the teacher. There was some activity where we had to take letters out of our name and that would be your name in some weird place. Mine was Lamp and Eugene's was something like 'eathinin'. They were on a sheet in a 'museum'. Then I was in a house. Jensen Ackles, Alexander Skarsgard, another guy and some others were at a table. Someone was making me write up a list of 'love' for them (ones that I had dated?). I had those three left, but Jensen was next and went to do something quickly."
"3727"	"(2010-12-18 (19)) I met this guy and we started dating. He wasn't overly attractive and his name was Mac. There was a photo of him and Alexander Skarsgard in a magazine. I pointed to him and said something like 'I like that guy. But I'm going out with him so whatever' and Ezra looked at it, confused. His sister was mean and didn't want us to be together. Then it was a movie and the actor's name was Daniel Ekslay. It was a sequel and based on a real story. He dated this dark skinned girl with short hair. There was also a blind girl and her sister had to walk with them everywhere. Someone killed them. There were pictures in this book and one was hanging from the roof and the room was covered in blood and they had separated the girl's vagina into two holes. Another girl had her face beaten and there was a graphic close-up. Then Dad, Granny and I were watching a movie called 'Devil in the Dark' and I thought it was the same movie and I said I liked it and Dad said it was ok. Then I said I meant the sequel. Granny gave us an ice-cream on a stick which had chocolate bits on the side and mint and vanilla ice-cream. She kept falling asleep."
"3728"	"(2010-12-19 (19)) A bunch of us went to a party. Santana and Brittany from Glee were there. When you hovered over someone with a mouse, it came up with a percentage and first it was like a compatibility score, then how much you had done with them. Sexual energy was high. Brittany said ""this isn't a smile"" and just had a blank face. She was then trying to do a crazy smile. Santana ended up naked and lay down on the counter and began to hump it. This other girl whose name began with M was wearing a black dress and had a vibrator with her. I liked this guy who looked like Judd Nelson. Some random guy kissed me. The Judd Nelson guy and his friends were talking to me and they mentioned something about a first kiss and I said it already happened and that ""a guy shoved his tongue down my throat"". We were supposed to sleep in cages and we were involved in something that I think was a set-up. I went into a bedroom and as I left, Judd Nelson came in. There was a cupboard next to the door and he kind of flirted with me and got close to me. I got around him and said we should get a room across the road in case it was a set-up. But then we were called outside. We were guests there and as people sat down, the numbers on this screen increased. We had to run across this lake. Then I worked somewhere until about 4am [last night I had to go out at 4am] and I walked home. There were lots of joggers and cyclists, so I started jogging but I started sweating and felt tired. I ran through a school and it was usually empty. There was a class of just guys. I talked to this guy and he said his daughter made $2000 in a week doing some 'low' level job. I got lost and then remembered where I was. I went to this shop and then it was Lie To Me. Lightman came out and said ""hello Izzy"" and then Torres and another person came out. Everyone looked at me. Then Lightman was like ""pay up"" and the other one was like 'damn' -- it turned out they bet that when I came back I would kiss him. He was wearing a wedding ring and was married to this dark skinned girl that he had been friends with before. This girl was married to Andy from The Office. I said I hated being away because everything changes."
"3729"	"(2010-12-20 (19)) I was at the old house. I had a small grey bird called Andrew Bird and it came when you called it. Ezra was out the back looking worried and drunk. Dad said this girl he slept with was pregnant and we were shocked and saying that he'd ruined his life. Iinet had different internet bandwidth graphs that were squiggly and told you the percentage of download from each person."
"3730"	"(2010-12-22 (19)) I went through McDonald's drive thru with Ezra, Selena and Lorelei. First we were walking and then we were in a car. It was night, but we got breakfast. I had a burger too. Ezra's patty was red and mine had egg in it. I grabbed them and went inside and complained to the manager. She said it would be best to talk to the person who made them and it was Kayleigh. I said 'I know you're friends with Ezra'. She called Paul and after one ring and no answer, she hung it up. She listened to my complaint and looked sorry. I said something about Mom and she remade my patty. A guy in there mentioned to Ezra that he liked me (saying that I was hot) and Ezra teased me and the guy about it. Ezra filmed on his phone and got the guy to say ""will you have sex with me?"" and I said ""go away""."
"3731"	"(2010-12-24 (19)) It was last night and I couldn't sleep [I also had trouble sleeping that night] . I ended up taking a swim in this pool. Everyone was awake and got confused. At 6am I asked Ezra and Dad when I needed to get up for Christmas but they didn't know. Then I was at school or work and I was cleaning and my shoes got filled with white stuff and I kicked them off and people laughed at me. Eugene was there too and we were sort of friends. There were other people there and they were laying on the floor and people were pouring alcohol into their mouths. I also did it. Eugene was trying to tell me something (that he liked me) but I kept waving him away."
"3732"	"(2010-12-26 (19)) I was at Nana's. They had these beds with sheets and we all had our own bed. Uncle Wilbur was in his bed. Ezra and Dad's were next to his and mine was at the end. Then I went to a Jetts Gym to check it out. There was a line on the floor (which was tiled) and I followed it. This girl climbed up this thing and fell. It was fake and was a special effects demonstration. There was a very big treadmill and I was looking at the buttons. This guy got on and it was really fast and I slowed it down. After he was done, I got on and it kept changing speeds and was faulty. This guy said they would have to recall them. They asked if I wanted to join the gym and brought me to this office. He said he would call me on Monday to sort it out (it was Friday). I told Mom when I got home. Then we had ID chips in our ears that could be scanned and mine said I was married to Robert Downey Jr."
"3733"	"(2010-12-27 (19)) I was at a shop but then I was in a hall at a house and it kept going back and forth. I was dating Robert Sheehan and his name was something else and his last name was Brown, but he was basically Dmitri from Misfits without a power. I thought someone was following me and I screamed and he came but there was no-one there. Then we were at a shop. We found this pile of dead bodies in this toilet cubicle. This guy who looked like Ben Mendelsohn was an old friend of someone in our group and was an interior designer. We ended up getting attacked by a killer. They had these leprechaun/elf things. They had a few powers and we went to run outside and Dmitri grabbed some chocolate mints. There was a car that would only run if you were eating chocolate mints. We were waiting for it to register us eating them and the leprechaun things were coming closer. It finally started and I was driving (though I was in the middle of the backseat and was reaching over. We went to this beach and there were heaps of people and they all turned around. We ended up getting out of the car and they attacked us again. Later we were at a party and this guy mentioned the Ben Mendelsohn guy and this guy said 'oh yeah, I remember [different name] , he's a [different career] ' and we were confused. He went over and said 'sorry about the divorce' and Ben was like 'yeah, I came out 5 years ago'. Later, he was married to this guy and then realised he was straight. He kept talking and then he realised we caught him out as the 'goblin king'. We trapped him in the car and said 'in 2 minutes there's going to be a car accident and you're going to die'. We left and he just sat there. This guy who was the brother of someone in the car (which was a 4WD) was driving towards it. Ben 'teleported' out of the car and in front of the guy driving towards it and stopped it. This caused him to kill these other people because he now had control of him. He shot down these dancing kids and their parents."
"3734"	"(2010-12-28 (19)) I was playing World of Warcraft. I was in a place with lots of lava. There was a dire dog and it growled at Ezra and he ran. Then it attacked me and I ran and jumped up high onto this cupboard. Then something happened to cause the whole place to implode and then rebuild. Then it was real life. I went to this shop place and Justin Bieber was there and some guys were making fun of him and I filmed it."
"3735"	"(2010-12-29 (19)) Something had made me and someone else see everything bigger. We could also see these floating islands in the air. We were in a forest. We did something and ended up on a spaceship where I did something. Later I had to do the same thing again but I couldn't remember it exactly. Ezra wondered if they wiped my memory. Dad was talking about Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson and said it seemed like they didn't like mess as they wore suits everywhere. They had a new live show."
"3736"	"(2010-12-29 (19)) Some people got powers and it was a well-known event. I could read minds. I was driving with Dad and some pale people were standing in the road -- they were vampires. We went to some place and there were some vampires there. We got in the car and locked the door. I went through the wrong set of lights and there was a big hill which was fun to drive fast on. Then I had to walk back because it was quicker. I had to go over a bridge. This guy did an apprentice thing from 11pm-1am which would later lead to paid work and he said 'it looks promising'. I got a box in the mail with a work uniform."
"3737"	"(2011-01-01 (19)) I was married to Eugene. We had a fight and I went to get a divorce. Granma and Uncle Gabriel were getting one too. The Oscar nominees were getting announced on the TV there. I changed my mind and went back. I had to climb through this pipe to get to this room. Dad came to get a key, but I had changed my pants and they were in my other pair which were on the floor. I sat on the lounge next to Eugene and it was awkward. We went home. We had 7 kids. Mom had bought each a Labrador puppy. I didn't remember being pregnant or having any of them. This American guy was around and I sat outside on a step. He huffed ""What is it with y'all and steps?"" and I said ""What is it with y'all and 'y'all'?"". It was smoky outside. Mom wanted us to get started on the next kid. She was buying the Labs off a friend for $3 each. I said that the dogs would be dead before the kids were adults."
"3738"	"(2011-01-02 (19)) I forgot about The Oscars and I woke up as they were announcing 'Best Supporting Actor'. An actor announced it and the winner was Geoffrey Rush. A woman I'd never heard of announced 'Best Director' and 'Best Picture' which were both the same and it was a lame 'cartoon' [like, new cartoons] sequel. I also announced an award."
"3739"	"(2011-01-02 (19)) I was in a place that was like World of Warcraft. Some others and I walked to a place called Fae to get to the flight trainer. I ended up with George Clooney and we were running away from someone? I think it may have been the police. At one point, I was on Princess Rd and I heard a cop siren behind us and I pulled into the carpark next to the sports centre and drove around. Then I was at a shop place. There were zombies or something. We went in. Each door had two people and we had to pick one and they were like 'magic'. For one of them, we chose ""the Asian"". One of the doors was called 'Night Watch'. We put some animal in a container full of carbon monoxide and took it in the car as we were on the run. George was in the driver's seat and was like 'why the hell are you bringing that?'. We left other people behind. Also, Leif joined the FilmForum Facebook group again. He posted on a conversation between him and I, and Linus called it a ""bullshit convo""."
"3740"	"(2011-01-04 (19)) I was at a shop with Eugene and we were dating. I joked that we should go outside and pretend to have sex to annoy the security guard, but we didn't. Two other friends were there and we were using our iPhones and a headset to communicate for some game. Some guy had drugs. He gave us these sticks of marijuana and some other drug. We used a 'tube' of pasta to snort it. We liked it and kept taking it. I was then at a house. Dad and Ezra were there. A girl knocked on the door and Dad said it was a girl he slept with and not to answer it. But she said she was just here to do something that I can't read. She had a weird English accent (Northern) and she was young and blonde. There was a notice on a board for Greg Grunberg having a party. There was a new Tommy Wiseau movie about the war. I watched a trailer and Neil Flynn, Zach Braff and other fairly well-known people were in it. I was then driving and I got a call from the guy with drugs. He asked ""Where are you?"" and I said ""Stirling, near Target"" and he said ""Good, come over"", ""Where do you live?"", ""Just come over"". He just kept saying that so I drove to the shop where I normally saw him. I think he actually lived there? He said he didn't want anything and I asked ""Well, what do you want?"" and he said ""Dunno""."
"3741"	"(2011-01-04 (19)) Isaak gave me Chicken Treat [as in, the store] . The other people who worked there (all different) and I tried to work out a schedule. I said 'it's my birthday in a few days/weeks'. Then it turned out it was actually January 27 today and I was like 'what the hell, I thought it was the 4th!'. I posted on Facebook saying 'It was my birthday 2 days ago and I didn't realize'."
"3742"	"(2011-01-05 (19)) Bryson had heard me talking about the list of movies I was working on and he decided he wanted to do it too. Aunt Sally had made a spreadsheet which had all of us so we could input our details. Nathaniel was dissing Bryson and Braden in a room and then turned to me and said ""your body is overweight"" and I said ""only 5kg"" [actually, it's about 10kg, but I was lying] and Braden was like ""6"" and I said ""5"" and then ""I'm on a diet and am still losing weight, so that's good"". Then I was watching TV. There was a movie called 'I Killed [name] '. Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Shaun Micallef were in it. The police chased Micallef out to a car and he was talking to the NAV system to tell it where to go as the cops just stood outside the car."
"3743"	"(2011-01-06 (19)) I had work, but before that I went to the movies or something with some girl friends. I ended up a little late. My pants were ripped at the crotch, so I changed them. I then realized I had no shoes and it was now 5.40pm. I told Isaak and he went to the shops nearby to get some. I said I was a 10.5 in men's. He got work shoes though and I said ""I'm an 8 in those!"". They were way too big. Chicken Treat was different, by the way. I helped a little without going out the back. I still got paid for it, but I wanted to go home."
"3744"	"(2011-01-07 (19)) I was driving and had to pull onto a fast road (110km/h). It was very busy. I got onto it, but then missed my turn off (which was on the right) and had to turn around at the end. It was a house. I went in and it was supposed to be the family from Christmas Vacation, but Chevy Chase was the only one I recognized. The wife was vacuuming the lounge and assumed I was there to help and told me what to do, so I followed along. There was a thing to wet the lounge with (like, soak it). Then I had to do the dishes and they had a tiny sink. Chevy came in and was like ""Wow, you look hot"" thinking I was his wife and she was embarrassed. I knew it was a dream, but in another dream and I was 'forcing' this dream [not a real lucid] . The wife left. I was in a hall and Chevy came and I kissed him. I told him it was a dream and then we had sex. We had an affair for a while. Then it showed the wife with a guy and she told him that she loved him and they were actually bad guys. I was thinking that was good because then she was out of the picture. Later, I was at a shop with Ezra, Emery and some of his other friends. They started playing 'my' music and a song by The Beach Boys came on and they covered their ears and I was like ""Yeah, because this is REAL music, not noise!""."
"3745"	"(2011-01-08 (19)) We were out the back of the old house. For Ezra's birthday, Mom bought him a $350 chair, $135 pair of 'remote control' shoes and 'dream boots'. The dream boots were like a soft pair of thongs which also massaged his feet. He seemed to like it, then let me try them. He tried the remote control shoes. Mom controlled them and then he just stomped out the front. I yelled at Mom saying 'why the hell did you spend all that money on him and you just give me $150?!"". I followed him out and he had thrown bits of the shoes around. I picked it all up and there was a small square bit of cardboard that flew off. It flew up over the roof, so I ran out the back and asked ""You can't take it back without that?"" and she couldn't, so I walked around to find it. There was a big park behind the house. I walked to the other side of it and I saw it stuck between two bushes. I went back and said ""you better be able to take it back""."
"3746"	"(2011-01-09 (19)) Porky had been in Iron Man. There was a photo of her and Robert Downey Jr. She was with us and was foaming at the mouth and she had AIDS. We figured that was how Simba had gotten AIDS. Mom was going to get them both put down."
"3747"	"(2011-01-10 (19)) There were a group of British guys (they may have been brothers) who were around 25, and were trying to find wives. One girl agreed to marry one of them, after she had decided she would never find love. One of the girls was called Izzy and had been with the guy for 4 years. Ezra watched It's A Wonderful Life and wanted to stay in a hotel room that James Stewart stayed in. Darren organized it. I was then at work. I accidentally put a metal plate in the microwave (the boss had called for me, and I had quickly put it in there) and I was like 'I'm an idiot!'. I said that I'd only done it once before; the first time I used a microwave and I didn't know you couldn't put metal in there."
"3748"	"(2011-01-10 (19)) I was watching a movie from the 1910's. It was about a Disneyland theme park. There was a shot of a part from the 1966 remake with ""Christian Bale"" who I then realized was actually James Brolin. I played the 'girl'. The Dad was mean. Her bed was outside and the Dad sat at the window, inside, with a lamp on and watched her. She wrote in her diary. He got angry at one point and I locked this door thing. He stood there and pushed it open. I had studied something and was spouting information at him. He came in and I ran. My car was outside and I ran to it and got in. I locked it, but then thought I unlocked it and did it again, and he opened the door. I started the car up and put my foot down. I got 'images' of people on the streets."
"3749"	"(2011-01-10 (19)) I was at Nana's. There was a party? There was food and stuff outside but we had to cook as we ordered (it was set up like Chicken Treat). They had a 'run' which had different sections, all enclosed, with lots of grass and bushes that had a yellowish colour. I went to the end and there was a dog tied up. I walked back and I saw a sign saying ""Snakes like walkthroughs"". I then saw a black one with white bits looking at me. There was a log in the middle of the section with a small purple snake on it. I was trying to use the top of the cage as monkeybars, and then the snake left. I picked up the purple one to throw it, but it latched onto my foot. I picked at it, pulled the back of it off, but it's head and 'stinger' stayed. On my way back, I had to crawl through a section. Everything felt weird and I told them that I had been bitten by a snake. People were like 'ok'. Beyonce was a table talking to people about how ""I have sex and touch myself"" and I was like 'what?!'. Nana took me up to the granny-flat. Poppa was walking around."
"3750"	"(2011-01-11 (19)) I was dating Eugene and he was the future creator of Facebook (it was before Facebook existed). Some people were after him because of it. We were in a building trying to get away. There was a hall with little nooks with paintings or doors at the end of them. None of the doors would open. One of the nooks had an Inglourious Basterds poster and a secret door, which opened, and we went in. There was a statute of 'Hamlet'. There was a soft wall in there with a room on the other side and I thought it was a theatre. It was darkish in the room. We tried to work out what to do. Sometimes we would time travel and try it again. Eventually he said he was going to make an announcement over the PA and he wanted me to stay here. When he was done he would travel back? He managed to make the announcement and as I listened, I was proud of him. Then it was the end of school/university. We were like 'we're not going to forget today!'. I put a book away and Elijah was standing next to me. I was then standing with Eugene and some others. His rival came over and touched my butt and I kicked him in the nuts. Nobody saw and I was annoyed. Also, at some point I was on the FilmForum group and Linus made a forum post like 'most handsome man' and I posted a list in alphabetical order. Tommy Wiseau was in there and I was confused as to why he was in the list (I thought maybe I'd put it in there as a joke, but I didn't remember)."
"3751"	"(2011-01-13 (19)) I ended up at this place where they were doing an Absolutely Fabulous live show. Jennifer Saunders and another woman were there, along with their husbands. Adrian Edmondson didn't look like himself at all -- he had hair, which was grey, and a beard thing. Rik Mayall joined them and he looked very Rik like. There weren't many people in the audience. I left and Mr Ripley was outside. He said I should ask for some detective to 'partner' up with for work experience. I was like 'ok...' and I figured someone had told him I was doing forensics, but I couldn't be bothered telling him I wasn't anymore. Mom called him asking whether I wanted her to pick me up and I said that I drove here myself. We went to a bakery and I wanted some hedgehog slice or a brownie but there weren't any. There were a lot of chocolate-y things though, including mudcakes."
"3752"	"(2011-01-13 (19)) I can't remember properly, but I was having sex with someone. It was my first time and I couldn't get to the climax and he told me to go on top. We ended up like, both sitting and we were face to face. I was thinking of the song Laid."
"3753"	"(2011-01-14 (19)) A boy and a guy climbed up the wall of this building to break in somewhere. They were good guys but needed to do it. It was day. The cops came and all went around the outside of the fence. One went inside the fence. The guy from before was now Seth Rogen and he pretended to be retarded (the area was known for retards) and watched the cops and then walked off around the corner. I was watching from his point of view and I could feel the adrenaline as he walked away and then when he was out of sight, he ran."
"3754"	"(2011-01-14 (19)) I was playing a game. I turned into a rat and went through the sewer line. The level I was at allowed me to build a place where all the sewers would link up. I built a pet shop (which was a cover). Then I was a rat again and I hid in a 'doghouse' at my boyfriend's house and he came to say hi. I can't remember why I had to hide."
"3755"	"(2011-01-14 (19)) I was at the old house. I woke up to Ezra getting organized to be taken to dads [also happened when I woke up in real life] . Everything felt weird. Then I was at this weird place with halls. One had this curtain and there was a hand behind it -- it was the 217 lady. I tried to scream but no sound came out and my throat was sore. I ran and she was walking down the other hall. Then I was home again. I found my phone and called Mom, but Ezra answered. I said I was hallucinating and that someone was trying to break in -- there was an Asian girl outside trying to pick the lock. I said ""I thought it was a dream, but it's not"". I went to my room and packed up my externals to go to dads. Then I woke up. An Asian girl was at the front door and she was naked. Rover barked at her and Mom told her this was the wrong house. I said 'I dreamt this last night' and Mom was like 'of course you did, these Asians are always doing this'."
"3756"	"(2011-01-15 (19)) I was at someone's place/hotel. It was small and apartment like. A new season of Dead Like Me was playing on the TV. Ellen Muth was the only remaining cast member and the new girl characters were really lame. It was very serious and dark. She was no longer a reaper and was living, but had been called on to do it again. Then some others and I were in the show and we had to go down a toilet to get to some place. A lady caught us in there the second time and I panicked and went down. But it hadn't been activated so it was just a normal toilet and it spat me back up. We paid her and she activated it. Ellen's character liked this guy and they were on a bed covering each other with blood and fleshy bits. I had no idea what was going on. The next day I watched an episode with Dad and Ezra. I complained that it was too serious and he said he liked it more this way. I said it used to be quirkier and that it was created by ""Bryan Fuller, he does Community or Modern Family [actually Pushing Daisies] "". On Facebook, people were wondering what the names of the kids of a character in Modern Family were called. Someone mentioned me in a comment. There was a character called Jacqueline, but people would interchange it with Izzy."
"3757"	"(2011-01-16 (19)) The sun was doing to die and then we were going to get a new, lesser one. It was happening today. We weren't really worried. Mom and Darren were with me and we were looking out the window to check every now and then. The last movie I watched was called 'Last Day on Earth'. Dad watched this new sci-fi show. There was a new one starting soon with Brad Pitt in it and I wondered what he was doing on TV. I looked outside and it was pitch black. We were like 'it's so weird, I didn't know what to expect'. We checked a few minutes later and I saw a ball of fire (the sun) and then nothing -- we died."
"3758"	"(2011-01-17 (19)) I was watching Le Samourai but it was different. It started off with Alain Delon working in a sushi place. There was a long fresh spring roll on a plate and he pointed at it and said ""Le Samourai"" and he sounded Japanese. A friend of Dad's on Facebook said it was awesome and said that he 'kind of wanted to have sex with Alain Delon'. He also ranked the 'of the Deads'; Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead (original), Night of the Living Dead then Dawn of the Dead (remake). I said Dawn of the Dead was one of my favourites and that the remake was good too. There was a movie with Eduardo Noriega and Vera Farmiga. Dad complained about Farmiga. We went on our holiday and I felt like orange juice. There was a lot of it around. There was a self-serve machine but the cups were like, folded up paper and I spilt it. I put some chocolate in my pocket and went into a shop. A security guard asked me about it and I pulled it out and they asked me to leave it outside."
"3759"	"(2011-01-17 (19)) We were friends with Tommy Wiseau. I was at home, but it was different. I went to my room and my computer and bed had been taken; only my desk ad cupboard remained. I had only been out for 5 minutes. I knocked on Ezra's door to ask him, but he hadn't noticed anything. We found Wiseau and he had gone crazy? He chased us and we ran into my room and locked the door. The door knob was round and had a lock on top of it. I could see his shoes through the bottom of the door. He was going to release some ""prune juice"" into the air -- which made it smell and hard to breathe. I put my head at the window (against the fly wire). Ezra wanted to leave so I said to get weapons first -- I grabbed scissors. He also had tongs which had been heated up. We opened the door and Wiseau had foil on his hands. The scissors were blunt and I couldn't cut him. I grabbed another pair and dooped him a bit in the stomach. Then we were at an airport and he got caught. There was a small rotating thing with socks on it. We drove past school and I yelled out ""rapist, animal killer!"" and the people there had a cat. Mom was driving."
"3760"	"(2011-01-20 (19)) Selena, Lorelei, someone else and I were trying to get away from someone. Selena was the leader, I think. We climbed through a building, through the windows etc. We smashed some other windows to trick the guy we were running away from. To get through something, we had to masturbate? The people gave us vibrators and mine was purple and jelly. I went off to a room and felt uncomfortable about it, but then I did it. I then realized we had to leave now, so I went and told the others."
"3761"	"(2011-01-20 (19)) I was staying at this big house for the night. Mom and Darren were there too. My room was huge and had a backdoor and had stuff like, a table and a lounge (it was kind of like a hotel room). Light came through the windows in the morning. I put curtains up and closed the door. Ezra came home 'from his job'. He was talking outside my door and I complained saying that I was trying to sleep. Later, during the day, Bill (True Blood) was looking for something. I said 'before you do my room, give me time to hide my private stuff' and he agreed. This girl was planting memories in another girl so they could be friends. I went somewhere outside where she was and we were standing on sand with green stripes on it (originally was a tennis court?). Then it changed to water and I was trying to run before her power took over. I got to my room just as Bill got there and I said I wasn't ready. He said 'I would've come for you' and said he'd wait. I put my pads and diaries in a bag. There were new True Blood characters; 3 guys, who were supposedly attractive but were muscly and square jawed and ugly. Two of them were family of the Stackhouse's. I was watching an interview with Robert Downey Jr. and his 'wife' (who was born in 1985 and he was born in 1959). Her ex was a creepy Indian guy with gaps between his teeth and back teeth. He was friendly though. Michelle Williams and another girl had been with 3 others (?) and one had died and she cried, and I cried."
"3762"	"(2011-01-22 (19)) Mom was babysitting a baby. It had no teeth and was chewing on something and crying and screaming. Ezra was like 'is that how our screams sound when we are older?' and I said ""all babies sound the same"". Mom had been in a movie with Brad Pitt, called Children of Heaven [Deepak had commented on the real movie on Facebook yesterday] . It had a low rating on IMDb and it was supposed to be from the 30's. At the start, they all turned into weird plant monsters and were talking about weird alien stuff. They realized they had squashed someone and they came out of the form (caused by drugs, I assumed) to help him."
"3763"	"(2011-01-23 (19)) I went to France with Dad and Ezra. It was hot. I thought something weird was going on; it had something to do with the sun. We ran into a building we thought was safe."
"3764"	"(2011-01-23 (19)) Mom and Darren were looking at buying another house. A guy said we could get $330k for this house and they had paid $400k. I told them not to make any decisions without permission from us."
"3765"	"(2011-01-24 (19)) Dad and I were doing something and the TV was on in the background. David Lynch was announcing music. It sounded like Killer Klowns From Outer Space was going to play, but they tricked us with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head but then it did play. I was in a shop with people later and someone did something naughty and we all ran. I saw a bunch of police, so I started walking and slipped into a food shop. They walked past me. I had no money, so I left. I was watching some movie. Someone cut off a small pigs head and a girl was convinced that we had to put it in a container so they wouldn't die in vain. This guy pretended to be another guy to get close to the girl. She saw the real one and realized he was dodgy. Alan Tudyk was in the movie too. There was a Joss Whedon show with Lee Pace playing a soldier. It was about this girl was actually a guy called Beverley. I thought the show looked lame and most people wanted him to do a show based on Lee Pace's character."
"3766"	"(2011-01-25 (20)) I had a job interview at Bunnings. It was different. I had to shake hands with heaps of people and then shake fingers. A lady gave me a uniform and I accidentally dropped some keys into a chute, but they didn't go all the way down. On my first day, I forgot the uniform and she just gave me a spare. She got me to sit at a closed register and said to read 'mobile network' books. Elijah was there as a customer, but then he was working on the front counter and said ""I just had Bob Dylan [as a customer] "" and everyone was like 'What? Why didn't you say anything?'. Mom made fun of the uniform. It was a darkish green and the shirt was quite stiff and the shorts were short."
"3767"	"(2011-02-02 (20)) I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We went through a drive thru and there were kids shoes on the road. I saw two small animals hopping over the road. I sent Dad a text and post on Facebook saying 'It's my birthday, I'm straight [hair] '. Lots of people sent me birthday messages, so I removed it. There were lots of animals around. I went to Red Rooster and a girl ran to help another girl. The aircon was blowing right on her. Someone was cleaning the toilet doors. There was an Asian movie and this girl talked to a guy talking about her boyfriend and saying that when she was younger she hung around with other people and slept with this guy she liked. But she was actually still a virgin and a guy called her out on it and said 'pathetic'. Someone joked that she needed to do it. She pinched some guy's butt but he thought it was the guy sitting behind him."
"3768"	"(2011-02-03 (20)) I was watching Misfits and there were zombies. In the last season, Dmitri had fallen in love and become boring. In the first ep of this season he ditched her and he and some others escaped from some house. It was spreading through the air or something so pretty much everyone was turning. I was then there. We left a building and I followed Dmitri and we ended up in a car. I said 'what are we doing? Where are we?'. We went to a house where there was a young girl. He spoke to her and said 'this is Izzy' and she said 'oh. Dmitri's girlfriend'. He had secretly been talking to her for a while. Then we were driving again and a car came around a corner and hit us and sent us straight into a pole. Zombies came out to us and opened the doors and took us. They took us to a house and outside there were lots of flies and Dmitri said it smelled really bad. The people there looked really dirty."
"3769"	"(2011-02-03 (20)) Ivan was different and had left them as a teenager. There was a story in That's Life saying this guy came back from the dead. He had died, but not really and it was him. He visited us. Then Chuck (Chuck) was there and he turned into a robot and exploded. Mom came home and Ezra went to the door and was confused and she said 'he didn't turn into a robot' and he said 'yeah, how did you know'. Chuck returned as a girl and she touched this strong glass and it shattered and everyone was shocked. Then there was a big guy and security came and he just ran away and I wondered why."
"3770"	"(2011-02-03 (20)) There was a sickness going around. A guy said he thought it was spread through children. A young black girl sat next to me at dinner so I moved and ate somewhere else. Years later, it turned out that it had been spread from kids. A brother and sister who had been kids then were now teens/adults. This guy had worked for their parents and they were rich and he was now infected. His face was splotchy. The sister was talking to him and kissed him and then there were splotches on her ears. They had been secretly dating since she was 17/18 years old."
"3771"	"(2011-02-04 (20)) I was watching an episode of a show like Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction. This girl was outside her house and her dog didn't let her come back inside or put her shoes. She had hurt her leg. She lived next to some bush area and she dragged herself down the track with the dog. It turned out there was a snake in her shoe and in the house and it would've killed her. It turned out to be a true story."
"3772"	"(2011-02-05 (20)) I was with people from Community. We were in groups and had to perform a short scene. Mom was there. There was a performance for everyone and one for just the crew. Pierce kept a recorder in his bag. I went to the toilet and sat on the toilet and talked to someone. Pierce held the bag up and Shirley was like 'he's recording, as he does'. He was grinning. In the scene we were doing, someone looked like Frank Whaley and he was playing the lead for their play. Ezra said he would probably be good. Alex (One Tree Hill) broke up with this guy and she ended up with a chipped front tooth. The guy met her in a room to propose sex with her and she took her clothes off. Her boobs were weird looking and she had this gold belly button piecing in her belly button and it was like a bell and really gross. The guy went down on her and then it cut to the guy walking in and she was touching herself."
"3773"	"(2011-02-05 (20)) I was at Nana's. There was a broom placed across the ramp to the back door. I asked why later on but I never got an explanation. Dad said he noticed the shoes had been put away and I realised I didn't take my shoes off before coming in. Someone was singing 'The Way It Is' and I went down the ramp near the granny flat. The geese and chickens were there and I squealed. Poppa was there and he tried to scare them away. I went inside and Ezra got a guy to call Uncle Vic (who was there) and tried to sell him something. There was a thing on TV with Alison Brie, then a thing with Chevy Chase and I said 'he's everywhere'. I said something to Ezra like 'I'm Chevy Chase and yeah, no"" in an American accent. I tried to rewatch Juno and it was different and not as bad, but still bad and I said 'I can't watch this'. Mom and I went to a petrol station and I asked for a chocolate. The security guard got in the driver's seat and messed with the lights and we were confused."
"3774"	"(2011-02-07 (20)) Dad and I went to a shop thing and he ordered two Kitkats each, but they gave us two altogether. We went to a stationery shop and there were no notebooks left. We ended up at Raquel's and she had a different mother and brother (who was young, fat and big with curly orange hair). At one point, I said he was 'gay and stupid' and his mother yelled at me for using the word 'gay'. I said 'it's just a word' and she carried on and I said 'in this generation, it is not insulting and homophobic, it's a word. It's people like you that make it homophobic' etc. Then she told me 'get out of my house'. There was a fridge outside and I had to get 5-6 trays of cakes and things. I took them back to the car but they were empty -- they had fallen onto the grass, so I just left. Abed (Community) was with us and he told me to turn in to a carpark and then go to this deli place. I went in with Dad and asked if I should get a new Kitkat. There was a phone near the door and I said 'is this Ian's [Community] ?' and Dad said yes, that he used it to bill him as a joke. I replied to something on Facebook from my phone and it said 'from Steve'. I left and Abed came back from where he went."
"3775"	"(2011-02-12 (20)) I at was at Nana's. She told me a story about the fish. Mom was there too and sometimes it was our house. We fed the chickens, which were weird and made a noise like 'brr woof' which was them copying Rover's bark. There was a party or gathering. I left and saw some guys hiding in the bushes. They saw me and chased after my car laughing evilly and I put my foot down on the accelerator and I started crying. Later, they had attacked the party and had tied Rover up and killed all the fish etc."
"3776"	"(2011-02-13 (20)) I went to some food place with Mom, Darren and others. We met there with some people I didn't know. There was ice-cream and chicken. They ordered for me and basically got me nothing with no ice-cream and I asked for chips and they said there weren't any. Then they said it was a long wait. I was angry and annoyed. I watched a movie on a DVD player on a TV and Mom watched a bit and thought it was interesting. Russell Crowe was in it. Then the movie was real and this guy a girl needed to get somewhere quickly and they dressed up as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to get to this place. I had to get through this level and at first I fell through some stuff. Then there was one with apple bits and it was hard to breathe. I was then with another girl. There was a squares game and I had to do 4 of them and I had to go first. This lady said we had to do something, but she got interrupted. They caught on that we were lying and we had to run."
"3777"	"(2011-02-14 (20)) I was with others in the bush. This guy lead me to this empty patch and told me to take a step. It turned out to be this invisible house with an alarm. They had parts like a camera/phone and I had to plug in a cable and download from it? We had to do something to get in and this guy came and we made up a story about why we were there and tried to keep him away from seeing the open parts. But he saw them and we tried to make up an excuse. Then I was at a shop, at a table with some guy who was the Mexican from Kiss of the Spider Woman. I purposely left something facing him so he could learn the truth and then he gave me money to get a water bottle. There was a big bottle of Mount Franklin. He came into the shop while I was at the counter and the lady was counting my coins. Then Chevy Chase was on our side and was in the movie playing on the TV in the shop. His character was called something like George Stromapolous.I called him and he answered in the movie so I talked in code. I watched some of the movie and there was lots of boofy hair. I thought he was hot in it. I needed to buy some stuff, including a USB. This guy motioned for a brush. I joked that it had 'been on your head'. I called Chevy again and said ""where are you"" and he said ""I'm-"" and then I woke up."
"3778"	"(2011-02-15 (20)) I could teleport. I was at a clothes shop with Mom and I said I didn't like the look of the store (the style was country like [like that shop at Brookland] ). I was rolling around in a wheelchair and went to explore the rest of the shopping centre. A guy in a wheelchair talked to me and was with a group of wheelchair bound people. I got away from him. There were three different toilets -- male, female and any. I was dressed as a guy so I went to the male toilet but there were only 2 cubicles free so I left. I couldn't find the female toilet. The 'any' toilet had some that were totally enclosed and others were in a group. Most of the dirty. The only clean one was with a bunch of others, so I left. A girl was on one and a group of girls were waiting."
"3779"	"(2011-02-16 (20)) I was staying at this hotel thing. The rooms were small and there was just a bathroom and a little bed with a tiny bit of space. Before we'd come here, Dad and Ezra had discussed places they wanted to stay for something to do with tea. Then we were at the old house and Dad left the car running outside. Some kids went into it and I started banging on the door yelling at them. Dad ran out and turned off the car and it rolled down the hill. He ran to the house across the road to stop it. Nana and Poppa drove past. Then we were at the hotel again. Alexander Skarsgard was there and his hair was wet and down and he didn't look as hot. Then he looked normal and we were secretly seeing each other. Mom was in the room too. When she wasn't looking, he would kiss me or touch my arm. At one point, Mom bent over next to us and he pinched my bum. We went into the hall and he held me against him and the wall and kissed me. I heard Mom coming. My hands were on his chest and I pushed him away. The others left to go somewhere. He went to leave and said that he forgot his coat and he came in and held me and kissed me again. Then I was at Nana's and Poppa asked if I'd gotten rid of 'that friend' and they meant Calvin. I said I hadn't spoken to him in ""a year and a bit"" but we were friends on Facebook. He said he was the devil. Nana had a cold and I said I was just getting over one (I still sounded like I had one). There was a movie called Dead of Night, but it was different."
"3780"	"(2011-02-18 (20)) Someone's dog had killed a sheep. The people who owned the sheep decided to kill the dog. Mom and I drove them to the place (they were friends of ours or something) and we stayed behind. We had a poodle dog and called it to make it follow us. We went back to the car and drove to the people's house just around the corner. There was a black lady and we told her they were killing their dog. We brought back the dead dog and sheep and put them together. I was sad. Then someone peed on their lawn, which was covered in snow and it all turned yellow."
"3781"	"(2011-02-19 (20)) Dad and I were on holiday. I checked a map to see where we were and it said Jakarta. I zoomed out a little and it was next to Manhattan. There were lots of Asians around. I zoomed out more and it was in England. There were toilets where you had to pay on the way out and you had to pay more the drunker you were. People were lining up and I decided not to use them. Dad peed and gave them $2.52 and I gave them 50c. Then we were on the street and there were shops and a beach below us. The tide came up high. We waited for a while but then Dad decided to walk through it but I didn't want to get my phone wet. There was an episode of The Young Ones which had lots of explosions and stuff and had good effects. Vyvyan was doing it and looked at the camera with a smile. Then there was a building surrounded by hedges. Some bad people came and I hid in the building, but they saw me and I tried to get out. I lay on a floating platform which was wobbly and scary. I peeled glass off the window and tore the flywire and crawled out. I ran along the hedges and had some plan to get them but I can't remember what it was."
"3782"	"(2011-02-22 (20)) I was at Comic-Con, which was different. There were lots of guests and they were all split into different locations. Morena Baccarin and Nicholas Brendon were there. James Masters and someone else were in another spot. I got there early but they weren't coming out until later. There was a movie playing and as it ended, I snuck out. There was a long line to buy tickets, but it was moving fast. I didn't know what to do so I asked if we had to buy them now and they said no. I walked past and then I realised I was supposed to, but I'd already gone. Someone asked me what my dog was called and I said Rover. Spaceman was climbing on me on the floor. Morena Baccarin stroked him and accidentally touched my face. I posted a status on Facebook about whether I should get her autograph. Some random person commented saying 'why don't you make the decision yourself' and a long comment. Nicholas Brendon had a starshaped piercing. I was hanging with them. I was trying to find an ATM and asked Morena but she didn't know. Someone gave me a stamp. James Masters was at his booth signing stuff. Nicholas Brendon had to leave, so he was replaced with Matt Morrison who joined us. I left to find an ATM and found one backstage. There was a horse and I said 'do you own a horse? I disconnect'. I opened a door and it moved and looked more like a pony. I said the horse escaped and they chased after it. There was a shop and a black woman swiped a key card and got money out."
"3783"	"(2011-02-24 (20)) We knew Greg Sestero a little. We went to his house for some reason. He seemed to want me to leave after a while. I packed my stuff up; I had my phone, water and some other stuff and went to the carpark. There were 4 red cars in a row and then another a bit further away. Greg came out and got in a car with other people and they took off. I took a photo. Samantha was pregnant and made a post on Facebook. I found out I was pregnant too and then we were in the True Blood world. I was seeing Eric, but had had an affair with Sam, which is why I was pregnant. We asked for someone's advice and they asked how I had gotten pregnant and Eric said 'she had an affair' and seemed annoyed about it, but didn't really show it. There was a game with a hose and a water slide and you had to use the hoses to climb up while reading out lyrics. I forgot the lyrics to the song and a hose fell and then another one did too. I tried to work it out and get out. At one point, Sam was bending over and he was wearing tight jeans. Ezra had a smoke which was made from acid and no-one seemed bothered."
"3784"	"(2011-03-01 (20)) I was at university in a computer room playing Spider Solitaire. I had an achievements window open. A guy had used hacks to get them all. I found a phone sim that had everyone's birthdays on it. University was big and was like a shop on the inside. I walked to the carpark and there were lots of red cars. I realised I was in the wrong section because I had gone to the shop section. I went back in and then I was with Ezra. There was a zoo section with big tigers. There was a shop and the clothes were all like 2XL+ and Ezra was trying on 6XL and when he came out the shirt was nowhere to be seen. He reached up his shorts and it was there. We got food with Dad. We got some meat and I had fish with tomato sauce. Mom watched a clip of a re-enacted scene from Community with Chevy Chase. I told her to go to the proper one. There was a place at university which people from Firefly -- including Nathan Fillion and Adam Baldwin. Meredith (Grey's Anatomy) was on top of a cupboard. I took a photo to upload to Facebook."
"3785"	"(2011-03-02 (20)) Mom was pregnant and pretty far along. I drove her somewhere and we got into this big argument and we yelled loudly and I got angry. Then it was a movie. These 4 teens/young adults were at this house. There were dragons in this building across the road and they could talk. They had to sleep on this 3 layer platform outside. Three moved to a lower layer and one left and went inside. It showed a dragon stabbing a blanket and then it showed them sleeping underneath. A guy inside came up from a trapdoor to the basement. There was a hologram of these nerdy collector cards if you took this carpet away. He ended up finding out all this information about it and got armour and special powers. He took some others to this bridge thing. They had to hold hands and touch this thing and hold their hands up high and aim at the bad guy (who was fighting the good guy). It was hard to keep your balance though and they lost the first time."
"3786"	"(2011-03-05 (20)) Mom was pregnant and went to get an abortion. I told her to roll the car after getting 3 random numbers. I also used a syringe to take a small amount of fluid. After rolling the car, we stopped in at a drive thru place. This guy said we didn't have to do the car roll. Ezra was in a shop and he came out and asked if they did anything to her and she said no, that she did it herself and he said 'I'm so stupid' as he had told the checkout girls and they weren't allowed to say anything for a certain number of days. On Facebook, Ezra sent a private messaging saying that a friend of mine had sent him pictures of me drunk and I said 'I've never been drunk, or drank alcohol -- it's not me!'."
"3787"	"(2011-03-06 (20)) I met Javier Bardem and he had been interested in me so I had sex with him. We had also spent a bit of time together. Some people and I were hiding out somewhere. Someone else and I went to a police station to check a file. A policewoman came into the room and was like 'did you check the conversation in the file?' and we said no and she saw paperclips in the wall and knew we were lying, but she was friendly towards us so let us go. Later, we were near a school at home time and got into a fight as kids streamed out of the classes. We called a hospital and there was a code we needed to get an ambulance. A guy and I tried to swing out legs around this tree but we couldn't. The guy pulled a log thing out of the tree and hurled something down this hill and a car almost hit it. Four of us got onto a bike."
"3788"	"(2011-03-06 (20)) Foxtel had heaps of music channels. Some girls had been watching TV. Ezra and I took the remote and I saw something on Jean-Luc Godard. I said to Ezra that he wouldn't like it. The girls changed the channel, but I had the remote so turned off Foxtel. They left and I put it back on. The music channels played You Spin Me Right Round and In Dreams and I said 'ooh! Roy Orbison!'. They also had Electric Light Orchestra and OMD stations and sound bites from A Fish Called Wanda. Mom said she wanted to get another dog and I joked 'is Rover not good enough for you?'."
"3789"	"(2011-03-08 (20)) I was in my room and Mom came in with some muffin things. They were long and rectangular. I ate it and Ezra said they were stronger than his ones and I asked if they were space cakes and she said yes. I said that I had work later and she was like 'so' and I said that I couldn't drive high. She told me to take the bus and I said that wasn't the point. I started to feel hot and my heart started racing fast and I kept shivering. Some time later I was at work. I was there a few hours early, so I had a different job to do. I was cooking in the back area, which was different and bigger and had a second storey. I had to go to the toilet and it was in the middle of the floor. Isaak told me to use the other one on the stairs which had this see-through sheet which you had to lower. I couldn't work out how to go safely so I left. When I came back it had been taken down. I used the middle one instead and I had my period so I put a cup there and then peed."
"3790"	"(2011-03-09 (20)) I went back to highschool to redo it to change my course at university. Darius and Eugene were also in my class. Darius sat next to me and a short time later, he and Eugene were talking about something that I couldn't hear but it turned out they both liked me. They more than hinted that at this girl sitting in front of us. I whispered something and she told me to shut up and I yelled at her. I was in a car later and she smashed a rock on my bonnet. I got out and smashed her phone and hit her in the stomach with a rock and drove off. I went to this place in the forest and asked Darius to lie and said that she smashed her phone and I only hit her once after she threatened me. She overheard me and said he didn't have to lie. Then I was at a resort place with Eugene and we were dating. I followed him to our room and was searching through everywhere, opening cupboards and I was touching his clothes. There was a folder with school work and something that he'd written mentioned 'homosex' and I laughed. He said 'I love you' to me. Then this girl was having an affair with this old guy. He turned into a fish and then it was a movie and it was shot like Zelig. At the end, he turned completely into a fish and was on the floor. She put him in a bowl."
"3791"	"(2011-03-10 (20)) I was at a school. There were two schools there and the other one got angry at ours for some reason and they started fighting. People had knives and people were dying. I hid in a toilet and there was a hole in the wall and I snuck out. Everyone came around the corner but I didn't know who was who. A friend of Eugene's was dead. I said there was an island we could go to to hide. This guy threatened us with a knife and we put our hands up and watched him but he just left. To get to this island, we first had to go to this small island which had a river thing with a waterfall and a house. We sat in a boat and were sprayed with water which would teleport us. At some point, I had a son and a husband but I chose to get rid of them to be with Eugene."
"3792"	"(2011-03-12 (20)) I was at a house with Dad, Eugene, Darius and Jeremiah. Eugene had this video in a dodgy lounge for safe keeping. It was from some really hard achievement in a game. If he lost the tape, he would lose everything. He had a photo with Joss Whedon who had been at a book signing and I was jealous. I said I almost got one with Nathan Fillion once, as I'd met him in a doorway at a nightclub [I was thinking of a previous dream] . I leaned on the lounge and fell back, but the video was ok. He told me to be careful. I did it again, but barely touched it and it all fell apart and I fell over it and hurt myself. The video tapes shot out and Eugene came to check it and they were bent. He looked devastated. We weren't friends, but he didn't yell or anything. I sent a message apologizing to him. I cried at one point because I was sad for him and because I'd probably lost any chance of being with him. I was talking to Jeremiah on MSN and he said to not worry about it and that it was just a game and that Eugene places too much importance in it."
"3793"	"(2011-03-12 (20)) I was driving home and went past Kingsway shops and there were police. When I got to the traffic lights, all the power went out and it was pitch black. An ambulance was coming down Hepburn Ave and I figured something was happening there. The lights were out the rest of the way home. Then I was walking and it was dark and spooky. There was a laundromat at the back end of some shops and this guy walked out. He followed me and asked me where I was doing and I said 'just up there'. He seemed dodgy so I started walking the other way towards this female hospital which had lights on. I told him and he was like 'oh, that's clever'. They had a big bus and he had a knife and threatened to kill us all (there were more than 50 people there). We crowded into the bus and he was like 'do you feel safe up high on something that collapse at any second?'. And this girl said 'I know who he is, his last name's McArthur'. He was the son of some guy who had died and a girl had taken his building and left it, but the stuff was old and collapsing. He fought to take it and restore it/knock it down. We got there and we lay on top of these shelves. There were magazines like silk. This lady offered me a collar and lead for a dog which was from some houses I'd applied for."
"3794"	"(2011-03-13 (20)) I was at Nana's, out the back. Uncle Wilbur showed me a video of when I was younger, hopping around in an animal costume. I went on the computer and Mom was with me. There was something about a movie on the wall that Dad and I saw and it said that it had been mailed to Ulrich Thomsen. I explained to Mom that he was in my second favourite movie. She asked why I hadn't invited Nana and I said that we did and that she was sitting right there, but she couldn't leave. Dad and I were then in Amsterdam and Dad wanted to break into a hotel we were staying in to check it out before having to pay to stay there."
"3795"	"(2011-03-14 (20)) I was with Casey and Sarah (Chuck). We were in a carpark and had to get into some place. Casey had to put on an accent which sounded really bad. Sarah and I were like 'for once, we don't have to put on an accent'. We got in there and there was a computer which scanned fingerprints and illegally had spy information. Casey put his finger on it and it came up with his file. He went to leave and a lady saw it and went after him and caught all of us. We were brought to this torture room 'for the Aussies' and it was a heat room. It was very hot in there, but we got out somehow. Later, I was with a girl and she flashed some guy saying 'he won't let you in otherwise'. We got to the door of this pub/club and he let her in but not me, so I flashed him and he let me in. It separated into 3 sections and only the middle one was open and it was crowded. This girl collapsed in a pool of blood and died. She had just gotten married. There was a young guy at the bar and he said 'there's a bad Christmas flu going around. I developed a cure, but sometimes it kills'."
"3796"	"(2011-03-16 (20)) Ezra and I went to see Battle: Los Angeles and it was directed by Michael Bay. I said that I hated him. It started off boring and then it started to turn into a disaster film and it had ok effects. There was a big tsunami thing and buildings were collapsing. This girl tried to make a guy stay with her and drown. He grabbed this thing and survived. There were lots of wooden boards floating around to save people."
"3797"	"(2011-03-16 (20)) I was in a room. I had a bed, TV and I was lying on the floor with a pillow. I was dating a guy who looked like a young Rupert Everett. I thought he was gay but he came in and we started flirting and kissing and we had sex. I was then at Nana's. I was rolling around on the floor with a pillow, thinking about him. Nana walked by the window and I thought it was zombies at first. It got to 2pm and I said that I had to go home because I had a test. Dad and Ezra were like ok. I asked Nana if the internet was fast enough for Youtube (it wasn't) or if the scanner worked (it didn't). I panicked and said we had to leave. It got to 2:50pm and I said I'd just have to do the test here."
"3798"	"(2011-03-17 (20)) I was at home, but it was a new house. We used to have an outside fridge which I had lollies and other things in. It was gone now, but Mom had just moved the lollies which I later found in the lounge room. Granma came in and I said ""oh... hi"" and she mumbled unhappily about it. There was a picture of Chris Colfer on display, as well as many others. She asked 'do you think that guy is gay' and I didn't know which picture she meant and then when I realised I said yeah and said that we met him, then he kept being over all the time but I wasn't inviting him over (Mom was). She made a joke that he was dating Ezra. I remembered a video I'd made with Cory Monteith talking to me as I filmed it. This guy was in love with a rat. It got hurt and he was angry at it. It could talk and stuff, but it was a bit weird. The rat crawled to the door and he told me to close it. I got a person to say these 'dying words' and the door opened and it died. He put it in his pocket and we tried to convince him to remember another way."
"3799"	"(2011-03-18 (20)) I was at home, but it was different and possibly a new house. My room was big and had a desk and a bed. It didn't have carpet. Cuddles came in and a small slug dropped off her. There were heaps of slugs around my door, including this big brown snake thing. I told Mom and she told me to spray this stuff everywhere. It ate through things so I had to put the LAN cord and all my cords up high."
"3800"	"(2011-03-19 (20)) I was at the old house in my room. Ezra was watching TV in bed, across the hall. Three zombies came down the hall and I used these long metal things to stab them. They kept coming and it was like a game and they had to be stabbed with certain things. A later level was in the living room and some needed to be stabbed with a long pole and others with something else and I had one in each hand and twirled and killed them. Later I was with a group of people and I said I had been on my own since then and they let me go to finish killing them. I killed two hard ones and then there was a 'ghoul' and it required a weapon that I didn't have, so I ran and almost ran out of health. They were annoyed with me after that."
"3801"	"(2011-03-20 (20)) I was watching something with Ezra. James Spader was in it and was wearing a tight red jacket and looked really hot. I thought he seemed gay and then he kissed this other guy and I was happy about it. Ezra said he didn't want to watch it and I said 'it's the 80s, it won't be graphic', but he left. It ended up being quite graphic for an 80s film with a graphic sex scene."
"3802"	"(2011-03-25 (20)) I was watching The Amanda Show, but it was actually with Drew Barrymore who hosted it from the ages of 3-10. Drake Bell was 13 and had had a kid at that age but separated with the mother until he was 'of age'. I told Mom about this in the kitchen. Then I was in France with Mom. There was a shop and I found Alain Delon related merchandise on a shelf. There were also his personal belongings. There was also a diary I liked. I realised there was a queue behind me, so I took the diary. Mom said she only had $20 and no Francs. I said I had money and the lady behind the counter said that she could convert the currency. I told Mom to 'shut up' and the lady behind the counter said I should shut up too and I said she'd been driving me crazy. I realised I had grabbed the wrong diary and I went back, but it was gone. I got an alternative and she said it cost ""2x5"" and I said it was too expensive. I was walking with Dad on a big road. There was a bridge with a huge drop. Cars were driving vertically down and I walked behind Dad and we had to hold hands to walk down."
"3803"	"(2011-03-26 (20)) There were slow zombies. There were patches of people still alive. I was at a school place and the kids there weren't helping out. This lady called a meeting and everyone ran to this room and sat down. The door to the room was saloon like (it was a kitchen) and it didn't close. The zombies got in and I was near the door. I told everyone to be still and the zombies just walked past, looked around and kept walking. When some of them passed, everyone scattered. A few others and I sat at some desks. The zombies just walked past again. Later, only a few of us were left. Analisa was there and I asked her about the stopover times for America and the UK. She said it was as few days for America and 15 days for the UK. Then I was in an area that had something to do with science. The rooms were full of medicine and stuff. We looked outside and lots of zombies were coming (we were like the last ones left). We went into this freezer to hide. Then it was a game. Ezra and I had this thing out the back of the old house. It was sort of like a vertical bullet and was like a TARDIS inside. It also had this tight spot with a pee box and a big toilet. People would come sometimes to trade stuff or they would just steal. We discovered a way to beam up to space. There was a call from some official people, including Poppa."
"3804"	"(2011-03-27 (20)) I went into work for a bit as Isaak had called me in. A guy I didn't know was working there and he couldn't remember what I did there and I left out the back and it was still light outside. My car was out the front near the road. This guy had a gun and I ignored it and got into my car. He came over and I locked my door and started the car and left. Then I was being chased by the cops and others. I drove to some hard to find building and went in looking for someone."
"3805"	"(2011-03-27 (20)) I was at Nana's. I got splinters in my hand and 3 on the edge of my left thumb. There weren't any tweezers because she had 'sold them at 11.45'. I found some big, dull tweezers and tried to get them out of my hand. They were under raised skin and it was easy to grab the edge and the splinters would just slide out."
"3806"	"(2011-03-31 (20)) I was at Sorrento which was different. I went to a restaurant with friends. I was dating a guy and we were there with another couple. I had now become interested in Ryan Cartwright who was a friend of mine, and another girl was interested in my boyfriend. I was at a table and my chair was close to Ryan's and our legs touched. I got up and sat at a table with some other people. A homeless guy was asking for money and I said ""I literally have no money"". Then I was there with Dad and Rover. I got this sausage with ham in it and gave it to Rover. I was then walking with Ezra at night and I said ""but we forgot Rover"" and he said it didn't matter. Then the girl from before told me she liked my boyfriend and I said I didn't know why we hadn't 'swapped'. I think we eventually did. There was a movie or a TV scene where I lay on top of this guy and kissed and rolled around. There was a list of all the guys filling in and it was 16 or so different celebrities."
"3807"	"(2011-04-02 (20)) I was watching a movie set in the future. This lady was the boss of this company. There were lots of bottomless drops between desks and sections. She yelled at everyone about something. Some people had devised a plan to steal her pills. I was there. Everyone brought me stuff as a cover to get the pills. Kevin (The Office) had a piece of paper with a name on it and I said 'what am I supposed to do with this?'. There was a round container with pink mesh on it and this girl had two of them; one was to stop her period. I took one to give to the guy to look after it. Adam Baldwin played a character in it and had a daughter called Alex. This girl collected animals in a car for something and it crashed. Someone decided to save the baby animals and they were upside down in the car. Then I was with Mom and Ezra at a shop. There was a game where you had to look for this lady with the lights off. I crawled to look. There was something to do with Emma Thompson. Then Rover was on the floor and Jensen Ackles was next to him and I said to Ezra 'you just wanna touch Jensen'. Dad couldn't find the lady and made us leave. Nana wanted to play Runescape."
"3808"	"(2011-04-03 (20)) Mom and I went to a screening of The Room. It was the 2nd April and that was the anniversary of the first release and we all got DVDs. They showed weird ads/short films with Paul Rudd first and I was confused."
"3809"	"(2011-04-03 (20)) I was at school. My seat was next to Eugene's. Ms Solomon started writing up codes and numbers for us to copy. She checked them and gave the people who finished this hot, flaming tea. She asked who lived in Midvale and Eugene put his hand up. She gave me a list of people for him to seek out to give information. There were big pieces of paper and lots of stuff was written on it. Darius got up and was being silly with it. Then I was with some people at a basketball court a while away. Some people from another school came and had these little marker things and were creepy. Then we were in a different class and I was still next to Eugene. I had to climb around the back of his chair. He was wearing a Spongebob shirt. Then I was at a shop and there were zombies. A baby was turned and it started talking and went rabid. No-one wanted to kill it."
"3810"	"(2011-04-04 (20)) Hoyt (True Blood) came through a drive thru. I was thinking that he knew of something? Dad served him and he asked him if he could call me. Dad asked me and I said yes. We organised to meet at some point. We met up and were chatting and flirting, then he came up behind me and turned me slowly around to face him and we kissed. We stopped after a while and he just held me. I was thinking that he was adorable and that I was happy. I talked to someone about animation and I said I liked Spirited Away but no other anime. I watched Ren & Stimpy but it looked different with crappy animation."
"3811"	"(2011-04-06 (20)) I was at a school. Usually I'd leave at a certain time to get to work. People were distracting me and when I checked the time, it was 5.15pm and was late. I was already dressed, but panicked and said that I'd never been there later than 5 minutes early. This guy kept annoying me. I couldn't find my keys. He came up to me with my keys and it turned out he had taken my car. He said he just took it up the road and 'Angela' got in and kissed him. I ran to my car and it was now 5 minutes from start time. I called Chicken Treat and it was the wrong number and some music store. Isaak called me saying ""Izzy?"" and I said my car had been taken but that I was leaving now. They called in another guy to help me. Outside there was a tree with fruit in baskets and some were rotten. Chris O'Dowd and some others were there. One of them said something about something we did last night -- a 'drunken adventure'. There was a video of Chris blowing himself up in a car (though not really)."
"3812"	"(2011-04-09 (20)) I was with some people and there was a group of people dressed in green who decided to come after us. We ran down a street and this guy and I ducked into a hotel building. The people went back because all the buildings were closed. One of them came in to the hotel and followed us. They confronted us on a balcony thing. We ended up getting away. Then we were running up stairs and they all looked the same. Every floor above us had people waiting. I said to the guy we should duck into this room. They opened the door and I waited to hear the cock of a gun but there was none; it was just a guy reading something and he said it was boring. We ended up in this big gym like room. One guy was Timothy Olyphant. There were 2 doors and 2 cops came through. There was a ladder up to this area which had another door out. This guy went up and I couldn't reach, so I put my arms around the guy from before and he climbed up. The door led to these air ducts which were made of tent-like material. The guy from the room caught on fire. I grabbed something in the duct and it collapsed and they shot the guy and put him in the fire."
"3813"	"(2011-04-11 (20)) I was in a building and there were evil people trying to kill us and keep us in there. Elijah was there and we escaped and ended up in the 'wall between the elevators'. We hit the buttons and I had worked there and led us to this spot, but then there were no buttons. We opened the door and we were trapped."
"3814"	"(2011-04-11 (20)) Two years ago, Lilja (Lilja 4-ever) was put in a time machine and it looked like those water things they have in offices. There was a lever hanging off it which was supposed to open it, but only at certain times, but someone said it would make it explode. Ezra and I were outside with it. I said 'she's been in there for 4 years' and gave it a little push, but it started to fall and the top of it popped off. They tried to find a way to open it and had to call a place. Then Mom and I were trying to go somewhere by jumping a fence. Mom made noises as if she was hurt and a group of people, including Jeremiah and Eugene, were hanging around. I laughed and called her a noob. I easily got over the fence. She had taken her shoes off too. There was another drop to some train tracks. I told her not to follow me. I went back over to get her shoes. I opened a way for her and Eugene described how to beat the boss -- there were shelves of chocolate biscuits and it would put them to sleep. We filled them up fast."
"3815"	"(2011-04-13 (20)) I watched half of the silent Napoleon film and thought it was ok, but couldn't remember it very well. I discussed it on our Movies 2 group on Facebook."
"3816"	"(2011-04-17 (20)) Someone turned into a werewolf (An American Werewolf in London style) and I knew that's where the inspiration came from because I heard Moondance playing, then Bad Moon Rising. I climbed to this top shelf and hid behind some containers. The werewolf came in and I accidentally knocked a container and it ended up eating Mom. Then I ran and went into this room and jumped on these beds and knocked all these things off. It was now a dog. I was at a party and Teresa was there and mentioned something of mine and I didn't remember putting it on Facebook. Then I started a conversation with Benjamin and Vikram. Benjamin said some movie was horrible and Vikram said he thought it was ok and Benjamin explained that he meant 'horrible images', but it was a joke. I hated it. They mentioned Amarcord if it had been directed by Kurosawa."
"3817"	"(2011-04-18 (20)) I was at the old house and I had a boyfriend. Something happened and he left and I followed him, pleading him to stay away from the car and he broke up with me by saying that he was 'busy for a year'. I was upset and went back in. Dad and Ezra got into an argument and Dad said he saw what he did with Emery last night. He called Mom saying he wasn't a virgin and it turned out he had had sex with Emery. Ezra was quiet and upset about it."
"3818"	"(2011-04-18 (20)) A guy took his girlfriend and ran off and people were sent after him. Then it was me and this girl. It was night and we were jumping over walls and then it was day. We hid in a university but this cop came. The girl was sleeping and I told her to run. I walked out the door with an American accent and pretended to be someone else, but this guy stopped me and knew I was faking. There was an argument and the girl ran off and I followed her. We went to a park with a 'magical' forest and she was tired and saw elves, which carried her. The guy found us again."
"3819"	"(2011-04-19 (20)) I was talking to Benjamin on MSN. I mentioned I was watching this movie and Linus said he loved it and it affected him deeply. It got to 2.30am and I went to bed. The next morning, the chat log showed us talking for longer and he decided to go on mic for about an hour. I didn't remember it at all. I told Mom that we had been chatting from 8pm to 4am. She was getting a cold off me, as well as Darren and Ezra. I gave her the cold and flu tablets. I told Benjamin I didn't remember speaking last night and he said he had recorded it."
"3820"	"(2011-04-19 (20)) Dad had auditioned for a part in a movie a while ago. I went along with him to another one which was outside. ELO walked past and I went to Facebook it and saw Robert de Niro and Al Pacino and other famous people. I went inside and went to this room and started chatting with this other lady. She asked me what my favourite genre was and I said 'science fiction and horror... that's it'. Then I was at home in bed and I woke up and Anastasia was in my room and I said ""why are you in my room"" and she said sometimes she needs to apply her heat transfusion bag -- which was a chest thing. I opened something on a rack and the mirror fell off. It reflected another half without me in it. My phone vibrated and I had Facebook notifications from Benjamin and Samantha making a joke about the transfusion bag."
"3821"	"(2011-04-20 (20)) This fat girl called Katie somehow pressured me into taking her to Nana's with us. She disappeared and I realised she took my car and bought something with my debit card, and said she'd give it back. After finding her name, I tried calling her and she hung up. I was worried and angry and Dad said 'you're the one that brought her here'."
"3822"	"(2011-04-20 (20)) I was at a house which was Dad's, but not. I was watching a Russian movie with Benjamin over MSN, and there was a girl with me too. I didn't know her very well. She started throwing these little yellow balls (like Bingo ones) and I told her not to because Dad won't like the mess and had recently vacuumed the floors. She ignored me. Then Timothy Olyphant was there and was Mickey (Scream 2). I wondered why I had the killer there. I pushed onto a table and climbed on top of him and kissed him. I wondered why I was doing this. On Facebook, Benjamin wrote Leif and Arnie' names into a song by The Police he didn't like. I thought the lyrics were Sk8er Boi. He made a joke about 'gasming'."
"3823"	"(2011-04-21 (20)) I was forced to go to a Lady Gaga concert. It was very small and there were seats placed around. I yawned and fidgeted and told the person next to me that I had to review it. Before she came on, they played a 2 hour weird movie. I saw Calvin in the audience but he seemed normal. We played this 'game' to pass out from alcohol. Some time later, there were new words on my shirt. After the show there was something related to a game or movie that cost $16 and Calvin wanted to buy it. We called someone and they said the password was 'Bald', but he ended up not doing it. I was then at home and everything seemed weird. I was talking to Benjamin on MSN and he asked if I like his posts because they're cute or 'make you want to put the cat down' or because they were funny."
"3824"	"(2011-04-24 (20)) It was night, around 9pm, and I decided to go to the movies. I drove to Centerville cinemas and it was different. I was checking the times, then Ezra was with me and we were going to see some 'bad' movie, but we decided to see this other one. Then I was with a guy and he was 3 or 4 years older than me, but really short. He looked younger than me. I liked him though and I was worried that people would think I was dodgy if we dated."
"3825"	"(2011-04-26 (20)) I woke up at 8am and Benjamin and Blaine were going to watch a movie. I asked if they had started and if I could join. I somehow met up with Benjamin and another British guy to watch a martial arts movie. There was a row of recliners on the side of the room. Benjamin was filming it and was better looking in real life and his accent was cute. The movie was silent and weird. We played a zombie shooter game. I watched the video and he had been filming me and my legs. I went to a fast food place with Ezra and some of his friends. There was an Asian guy that I knew from somewhere. I accidentally threw Ezra's burger at his face and he said 'I hate you and said he'd had enough and would kill me, but was over it after a minute. There was a video of Mom taking off an earring that was supposed to be funny."
"3826"	"(2011-04-27 (20)) I was watching the last season of How I Met Your Mother and it was as 12-parter with a huge budget. Barney woke up to their apartment being half blown up. He jumped into some water below and got electrocuted by a TV and made a 'shoot' joke. They said Ted's wife was Robin and saying 'just because you are gullible'. There were waves under the sea which had something to do with milk getting mixed. Later, Benjamin had a long rant about it. I think we were dating, but hadn't actually made it official. We kept saying 'moo' to each other. Gunnar had commented on some posts. Benjamin made a joke about some nudity saying 'if that doesn't get you off, you're on your own'. James posted too and said #17 was beautiful. Benjamin said 'Yeah, I kind of wish she was here with me now lol' and I was sad."
"3827"	"(2011-04-28 (20)) I was at a shop with Mom. She got cheap clothes and also wanted this baby outfit (it was like for the Royal Wedding). A lady said it came with a gold bracelet and I said it was disgusting. She asked if I meant the bracelet and I said I would rather hang out with a child molester. Someone thought there was a bomb at the shop. I hid down near the checkout. Then I was home and tried on a white shirt that was way too small. It was made of netting so had gaps between parts. My other clothes had holes in them. I was talking to Benjamin on Facebook and he pasted something about Edinburgh and I said we were going to Scotland and that we should meet and he agreed."
"3828"	"(2011-04-30 (20)) I was at home and my room was smaller or had more stuff in it. My bed was next to a robe which had drawers. I was talking to Seamus and he mentioned a conversation that me, him and Elijah had all paid $127 a month to hang out, but never did. I had cancelled it not long ago. I went out and talked to Mom. She said (maybe jokingly) to invite him over. I did, in the hopes he would refuse, but he accepted and then I remembered I had to work. It was 6.30pm and I really didn't want to. I got a call from a woman asking if I could do something, saying ""quarter 25 now"". I told Mom that I wasn't going to work and she got angry about it. I had a shower and Seamus opened the door while I was standing in a towel and I closed it. Mom said he was sleeping in my bed and I said ""what's wrong with the lounge?"" and he said 'I don't want to'. I went to my room and my bra and underwear drawers were open and I was annoyed. I was trying to work out what to do. Ezra was on some site like Facebook and posted about my 'geekiness' for watching movies and keeping stats. He made a joke about Seamus being my friend."
"3829"	"(2011-05-01 (20)) I got a letter saying that I had a dentist appointment at 9pm tomorrow and it would cost $87. I also had something else to go to at 10.40[m. I went to some place and checked my phone for the Movies group and Dad had posted and I asked why he was in that group. He said Gunnar invited him. Then Dad was with me and we went out to the car. Rover and a black dog were there and it kept going in my car and then lying on top of Rover. I tried to get rid of it and it somehow 'fell up' into my car. I waited for the owner to come out and then it was tiny and in a bottle. There was a greenhouse type of thing and the door was thin and wiry, but started to crush me. Ezra and his friend were there and were ignoring me. I couldn't breathe and then managed to get away. Benjamin was then there. I was in a car with him and Mom and it was awkward. He said he was getting messages all the time recently and Mom was like 'oh, because of Izzy, she's always checking her phone' and he said he doesn't go online with his phone."
"3830"	"(2011-05-06 (20)) I was at a shop. A little kid held my leg and I had to drag him along. I was then with Dad and Ezra. Then I was driving with someone and they wanted to stop at Centerville cinema and it was totally different. We went in and it was really quiet. Then she was Emma Roberts. Then people were dressed as characters from Alice in Wonderland. They closed a curtain and put on a dance. Emma Roberts went up herself and she was good. She did this backwards smooth very smoothly. We left. Our car was blue. She had changed settings on something which annoyed me."
"3831"	"(2011-05-07 (20)) I needed to go to university and Mom wanted to pick Ezra up along the way. I was annoyed because it wasn't on the way there, but I had to pick up some clothes anyway. It looked different and fancier. The beach was different too and there were lots of shops. I went to the movies and saw an animated film with Mia Kirshner as one of the voice actors. I mentioned it to Benjamin later on the Movies group. I was then at the shop and there was a weird bird thing with a baby and you had to let it sniff you or it would attack. It kicked my leg. I left with Dad and Ezra. Then I was at the shop with Mom and there were broken ornaments. Mom asked a lady why and she told us about these people who brought them back saying they were broken but had come back months later admitting it had been their fault. They were back to try and become friends with her to get something out of her and she cried. Jake Johnson was at a shop offering people free samples and called me out and gave me a Snickers."
"3832"	"(2011-05-10 (20)) I was at a party. Benjamin was actually 18, though I thought he was 20. I wasn't sure how I felt about him being only 18. I don't remember the party very well, but afterwards the house was spotless and I was impressed at how well they cleaned it up."
"3833"	"(2011-05-12 (20)) I was with Mom and Darren. I had my stuff in the car but had to go back to this hotel thing for a bit and they drove off without me. I asked someone to use a phone but none of them could call mobiles. I went on the forum and there were posts about the Turkish mafia films."
"3834"	"(2011-05-16 (20)) Tanita was at an AC/DC concert and bought tickets to something where she'd be 'next to a running TV'. She had posted this on Facebook and no-one had commented on it and she was upset. She got them to stop the concert and call someone for her. Gunnar knew her. She had said she had cancer and Gunnar was annoyed at this. I was leaving this place at night, walking through the carpark. I got into my car and locked my doors and wound my window up. I was driving down the road, which was a dirt path, and there was a guy with a gun. I went another way, but there was another one and I had to keep driving around. Gunnar was there and helped me. I was really scared."
"3835"	"(2011-05-17 (20)) I went on the forum and it was different. Someone had made a joke about Benjamin and I being married. Arnie had left and had closed his account because Facebook was screwing up too much (they were combined somehow). I asked Benjamin about it. Then in real life, Benjamin and I were in a big, old house with no windows (like post-apocalyptic like). We each had a gun and heard a noise and we were sneaking around trying to hide. There were 3 girls and a guy and then we saw more, so we gave up. Later, Benjamin and I were in bed which was just a mattress on the floor. Then it wasn't us and this guy kissed her shoulder and she pushed him away. He did it again and she didn't resist. She then blurted out that she wasn't a virgin, using some word like 'skag''."
"3836"	"(2011-05-20 (20)) I joined a group on Facebook for FilmForum and it had less than 10 members. Raquel and Leif were friends on Facebook. I wondered who she was on FilmForum and thought she was Mary Rose for a second, but then remembered she wouldn't have seen more films than me. There was something being filmed outside. I had a microphone that was like a flat map and I realised the person hadn't filmed lots of things. There was a kid on some rocks near the water being interviewed. There was a zoo which a mouse creature. I had a big lamington and it kept grabbing at it. It had a long nose and was weird looking. I was then with Mom and I finally got to the and ate the lamington. I offered some to Mom and she said 'ew, lamington' and I offered her more and then remembered she didn't like them. I ate half and then gave her the rest."
"3837"	"(2011-05-27 (20)) I was at Nana's and people were after us. I was outside and realised bad guys were coming and I went inside. I went to a room at the back and hid in a cupboard. I heard them tell Poppa that they had everyone and he said 'what about the dog' and a guy turned into a dog and sniffed around in the room. They found me and pulled me out. Later, I was on my computer and I had sent an offline MSN message to Benjamin and he had sent a weird reply. He said his uncle did it and suggested we talk on this game via inbox instead. He had two messages from his family and one of them was from a cousin in France. Nathan Fillion added me after seeing that I was a fan of him on Facebook."
"3838"	"(2011-06-01 (20)) I was talking to Vikram on MSN, then went to make food. The house was different and had a big kitchen. There were sandwiches and cakes on a plate and they kept getting taken. I asked Mom and she said it wasn't her. I went back to my room with lunch. I was in the lounge room at the old house and there were ads for Chicken Treat and Chicken Treat stuff all over the room, including a uniform. Then I was at a shop. There were shelves with bed sheets. I grabbed one and pulled off something that was eating it and I was surprised. Someone pulled a light green one off the shelf and then it was Arnie. He sat at a bench next to mine, then Vikram joined. Arnie asked Vikram something and he replied and I felt weird, then I remembered I hadn't heard them speak before. Neither had much of an accent. Arnie said 'don't make fun of my accen't and Vikram said 'that's part of the fun' and I said 'what about mine, that's going to get some laughs'."
"3839"	"(2011-06-01 (20)) Benjamin, Gunnar, Vikram and I used to regularly go to this restaurant where they served 4 meals at each table. Ours was Hababam. I had Kaldi, Benjamin and the first one, Gunnar had Tatilde and Vikram had Uyaniyor. Vikram was the only one who was always the same, the others kept changing who they were. I sat next to Vikram and across from Benjamin. On the day, they changed the theme and we were annoyed at requested Hababam meals anyway. One had a long piece of cucumber."
"3840"	"(2011-06-04 (20)) Mom was having people over. She asked me to get these mats to put up on the windows to keep cool (like small window shield things). I wanted to watch the lamest films first for our mafia watching. We watched Vuk and left it because Benjamin liked it. I played a game called Fockle which was a word game based on a TV show."
"3841"	"(2011-06-06 (20)) I woke up late for an exam. I got to the train station and the next train was 10 minutes away and each station would be another 10 minutes. I asked Mom to drive me or I'd be late. I got there when there was only 40 minutes left of the exam."
"3842"	"(2011-06-08 (20)) Benjamin and I went to the movies. I was in the car and realised I didn't have a bra on and put my jumper on and my bag in front of me to cover it, but realised you couldn't tell. He bought tickets and put change into this thing which gave out things. He put in a few dollars and got a tiny chocolate that we split in two."
"3843"	"(2011-06-09 (20)) Benjamin and I were leaders of this secret group. We invited someone else to it. There was a bunk bed and he climbed into the top bunk and shared with some guy. Benjamin and I shared a bed. I was at university, which was different, and I got my results and had passed altogether, though had failed 2 units."
"3844"	"(2011-06-11 (20)) I met with Benjamin and his parents. His 'grandfather' was asking me questions about my feet and health and said 'well you two should get started on some grandchildren'."
"3845"	"(2011-06-13 (20)) I was talking to Leif on MSN and sent him a message Benjamin had sent me about Linus, then thought maybe I shouldn't show it. Then Benjamin came online and we talked about Linus. Mom was in the bathroom getting ready to go out. Rover and Spaceman were on the floor and Rover was barking nonstop so I went out to see what was going on."
"3846"	"(2011-06-17 (20)) I went to the old house with Mom. A guy broke into the car and took my laptop and some other stuff. We went back and got something back but the rest was gone and I realised it was Quincy who had taken them. I said that I'd ruined Darren's chances of getting a job unless I got it back. Ezra was there. Quincy was on the phone and yelling saying 'she's telling the truth' and that he'd already gotten rid of it. I said I wanted money then. He said ""I'll give you $50"" and I said I needed at least $300-$400."
"3847"	"(2011-06-17 (20)) I was at university and Dad introduced me to Audrey Tautou who he had met there. They were hanging out. At one point she was talking to Ryan, who also went to Westland, about how Amelie was originally not going to be a film, talking about the script and 'talk' and she said ""not the right... what's the word?"" and I said 'medium?' and she said 'median'. Later, Dad gave me this wine in a fancy bowl/glass and mixed them together and it exploded."
"3848"	"(2011-06-23 (20)) I watched Dr Strangelove with Ezra and some others. The end was similar, but different to what I remembered and they found it funny and I said I didn't anymore and brought it down a rating. They had accidentally started the countdown but had stopped it, and then the guy was on the bomb. Ezra and I were outside on the grass and I said I'd been outside heaps lately because of reading at Nana's. Uncle Wilbur and Mom were there. She made a joke about him being single and in his 40s and said that I'd be copying him/beating him and I said 'that's what I wanted'. Queer as Folk had different endings. There was one that people said was ""like 2004 style Queer as Folk"" and Stuart had an orgy with 3 guys. This black American woman moved in with 2 gay guys who owned a business that allowed people to move in with gay people. The room for them was soundproof. She said 'I spend most of my time caring for this child' and was very posh. She said 'as long as the latest you go to bed is 2am, it should be fine'. Brian showed up there."
"3849"	"(2011-06-24 (20)) I was going to go on holiday by myself the weekend before our holiday started, but I forgot and it cost me $1500. We lived at the old house and Nana was over and she said she'd pay for it. She bought me a new ticket and I missed that flight too."
"3850"	"(2011-06-24 (20)) I don't know where I was, but there were big steps going to a school. A fat guy could hear thoughts and was trying to get my attention but I didn't notice. There were lots of toilets and 2 were for marriage and the rest had sex. I went to the marriage one and he followed me in. I was peeing and couldn't stop and tried to shoo him away, but he wouldn't leave. Then I was playing an online game with Bernard and Benjamin. Bernard kept killing me and they had killed over 2000 people and I killed about 4. They stopped and I got to level 2 and could change my title and species. There was an eel type of thing which was better than my current one. Murlocs looked like little fish and I was collecting them. I went a bit further and there were lots of lollies and biscuits etc, all going to a vending machine. Benjamin got the guy who ran it to put some in a container for me."
"3851"	"(2011-06-26 (20)) I reorganised my room, which was big and different. Mom and Darren had stuff in there too and wanted to look through it. I said I was going through my private stuff and they had to wait. I was later on the computer talking to Benjamin and he said he got a girlfriend and that he hadn't dated since he was 12. I was annoyed and wished it had been me and sighed. He said something like 'it's so perfect' which implied he didn't have a girlfriend, but then I wasn't sure if he was joking or not."
"3852"	"(2011-07-06 (20)) I went to the cinema and saw about 10 minutes of Tree of Life. Casey Affleck was in it as Jesse James and was like 'this is my land' in a gravelly droning voice every few seconds and it was really annoying. The cinematography was nice though. The next session was starting but our plane was in 2 hours. Benjamin and I found 2 dogs and a few children dead with their heads cut off. I thought Rover or another dog did it, but then this bad CGI purple rock type humanoid monster came and finished them off. It talked to us and teased us, eating any people that came and we hid in a building. We then ran out to a car. It ordered pizza and ate the delivery man. Then after a while it silently took the car doors off and turned out all the lights. I closed my eyes, scared, and waited for it to kill me."
"3853"	"(2011-07-09 (20)) There was a sign mentioning Calvin doing some dance/show thing. There was a video called 'Tubby' and Benjamin, James and someone else were in it. Mom saw it and thought it was funny. At some point people from FilmForum were around and I asked if Poopsie was there and she asked who that was and I said 'James' and she knew who I was talking about. She said he was good-looking and that there was another good-looking one and I was like 'ok...'. The tubby thing was like a Tiny Teddy cartoon. Benjamin had written a bunch of short stories which featured me (and others). These alien guys came down and they had been in one too, but they got in trouble or something so had to come and fix it (we didn't know they were real). The stuff in the books was coming true and they had fixed some of it to come true and I realised they were going to kill me, but Benjamin hadn't clicked on yet. He eventually did. I started running through the house and they chased me. I ran into a bedroom and tried to open the window. It had a little latch, which I opened and jumped out; sliding down the side of the house. There was a car, but the doors were locked so I kept running down the street. I came across a bunch of bikes and took one and started riding. I ended up fairly far away, but then my friend, Vinny (who was now the guy who had written the stories) - found me and told them my coordinates. I dumped the bike and looked for somewhere to hide. I found a nook in the ground with a bed and stuff (gypsy like) and lay there. They walked past it but then one of them stopped and found me. Vinny was there and had an earring and was all douchey looking and he said 'I need the money'."
"3854"	"(2011-07-13 (20)) It was Harry Potter like - me (Hermione), Arnie (Ron) and Harry were in a building, which I think was our school. I was near a window and someone suddenly and calmly said 'there's a balrog' and everyone started running and screaming. It said it could smell Harry and wouldn't stop until he was dead, so we ran as well. We ended up in these tunnels and there was one that went underwater. Everyone was going in there. The building started falling apart and I went alone into the underwater tunnel, but there were 'spies' there so I went back up. We eventually got away and went to sleep under a tree. We tried lying down, where Arnie would be touching me slightly but it didn't work, so we sat up close to each other and Arnie was leaning on me. Then later it wasn't Harry Potter like anymore. We went to a cinema which was weird and had shops and arcade games everywhere and even a conveyer belt thing like at airports. Then we were at a house. Some stuff had happened that I can't remember and someone said that Arnie was in his room getting stoned. I went in there and he seemed ok, but a little down. We talked for a bit and then we had sex. It 'faded to black' though and the next thing I knew I was waking up with him in bed."
"3855"	"(2011-07-14 (20)) I was being held hostage by two people who i knew, sometimes it was Ezra and a friend. We stopped at this shop place, and at first I was driving this little car thing (they had a gun to my head), but put it down here. They wanted me to drive straight through this crowd of people and I argued it would draw attention, so we went the other way. We were then walking and went through a security check and it beeped for me because I had my phone, money and a thermometer thing. They let us go. At one point, I stole the guy's keys and ran to the car to get away. It was slow to take off and they jumped in and stopped me before I could get anywhere. Later, I was at school. I was called up to the office for news we (Ezra and I) wouldn't want to hear; Darren had died drinking a ""ratty beer"". I wasn't sure whether to be happy or annoyed at this news, because this Darren was a 'bad guy' and I was worried about what money we would survive on."
"3856"	"(2011-07-16 (20)) While we were in London, we decided to go visit Leif in his country. Soccer or something was on, and they gave me a Macedonian scarf to wear for it. I couldn't work out how to put it on and I said I've never worn a scarf. They said I didn't have to wear it if I didn't want to and I said I would, but I'd prefer a local one, so they gave me one. Leif and I went to see Klovn, but it was a different movie to his one. It was in English as well and Aidan Gillen was in it. It was based on something that had happened in Leif's part of the world. There was a celebration thing and then afterwards this room had been trashed - monitors had been scratched on, smashed etc. It was based on some kids who had died. Eugene was there in the cinema. He was from a Scottish background. I thought that was weird."
"3857"	"(2011-07-19 (20)) Some others and I had been kidnapped? We were being kept in this old place and were like the equivalent of Jews in World War 2. We escaped and the guy had been our teacher? Benjamin was there too. I went to class and there was a package with stuff for me on my desk full of in-jokes. Benjamin left and I followed and jokingly asked if he needed a lift. He did, so I gave him one. He had an earring. Dad was in back of car and the brakes weren't working properly. I couldn't stop at a set of lights and crashed down the hill. I got out, but Dad was still in and acting weird."
"3858"	"(2011-07-20 (20)) Mom and I were driving down a road. I was in the back. A guy turned a corner and flipped onto his side. He got out and slammed his car onto the other car. I filmed it, and he looked back and saw me. He chased us. I can't remember what happened but then a girl was after us. We were in a shop. After a while, I got this long knife but couldn't cut through her skin. She grabbed a serrated one, so I did too and cut her head off. But then she was still alive and came after me and then her head fell off and she died. I placed her at the accident and tried to hide the evidence. I walked past the scene a day later and police were there; we knew one of them. Then Benjamin and I were walking around this place looking for somewhere to have sex. It was like a giant house. Some people were having sex outside against a wall. We went into this house where the person had a lot of kids and had just had a baby. We went onto the lounge, but got interrupted. We went onto the table and were interrupted again. We then found a small bed and began having sex [I woke up during the 'end'] ."
"3859"	"(2011-07-25 (20)) I was talking to Leif on Facebook and said that if someone interesting offered me sex, I would be interested. I was on holiday in this weird country. I went to take a photo and a lady told me I had a bug in my arm - it was sticking out the back of my arm, and was serrated so I couldn't pull it out. I went to this guy who could get rid of them and he put sewing stuff on and then said he wasn't 'good with Chabrol'. There was a list of all the guys who could get rid of them and their 'strengths'. Feargal Sharkey was a 'Chabrol' so I went to him. He put it underwater and then just easily pulled it out. Thre was a little bit left alive - the first bit was meat and the second was skin. There was a guy who was invisible and a drug dealer. He could appear for a while sometimes and could float. A guy came looking for him and he floated out of the way. His girlfriend heard a girl in his room and was listening to his voicemail, and knew he was there too."
"3860"	"(2011-07-28 (20)) I was at the beach. The waves were getting bigger and bigger and I started walking away. They were massive by this point and I started to run. Dad took us to his house and I said it wouldn't be safe and that I had had dreams before of huge waves. There was a big window and we saw the wave come crashing through. We started going down these stairs, which were flooding, but we found our way down. We were going down the street. More waves were coming our way. Someone hosted some party which was all painted and fancy, but there were stingy rooms. An old guy complained and I explained about the waves. Apparently aliens were stealing our water."
"3861"	"(2011-08-05 (20)) I went into this school place. Acquaintance-F-09 was there and she was a physicist or engineer and was really smart and playing some games. There was a game with a house that you had to protect from bears. You had to build a fence and then bears would come and you had to reinforce the fences by placing them around the outside. If they broke in, you had to click on them to kill them. It got really difficult later."
"3862"	"(2011-08-06 (20)) I lived in a dorm at a school. I think it may have been in the UK, but not sure. Someone said something bout Benjamin. There was a voicemail from Benjamin saying he was going to get laid. Arnie said something like 'oh, you're finally meeting up with Izzy?' and it had 5 likes. I was annoyed at the voicemail. I left the dorm at one point and it was difficult to get back. There were stairs at the other end and bridges. There was a guy trying to find money from his kid and asked me where I kept my money. Someone suggested my bedside table and I said ""no, that's my underwear"". They pulled out the drawer and it back. He asked again and I said ""in my wallet!"". I talked to Benjamin on MSN and he was seeing some Irish singer guy at a concert and said he liked Irish music."
"3863"	"(2011-08-09 (20)) I was back in the UK for a bit. Benjamin made his profile picture a picture of himself. We met up for a bit and it was easy to talk to him this time and we actually talked. We met again and went to a water park. We went through it collecting 'peanuts' which were park currency and you could hand in anything leftover at the end to get turned back into money. We got food and I couldn't decide what to get and I asked if the meat was spicy and they said yes and to go with the roast chicken, chips and tomato sauce. I had a small water. I made a joke about making decisions. Then I went there with Dad. We had some fruit stuff and then it was time for dessert. This lady with her daughter said we should line up behind them. We asked why and she said that she had to be somewhere in 45 minutes. We said we didn't care. I argued that there is a queuing system in place and she was being a bitch. We got back in front of her. I went to this stall with strawberries and sorbet."
"3864"	"(2011-08-12 (20)) I was at Midvale shops with Dad. I had this music thing in my car that was expensive. This young Native girl followed my car asking for directions in Subiaco. I tried to show her the bus/train map. This white guy with scraggly grey hair approached and tried to steal it and it was hard to get him away. I went into the shop as it was just closing and they said I had to tell them what I wanted and they would get it, but I forgot what I wanted, so I just got this big block of white chocolate."
"3865"	"(2011-08-13 (20)) There was this obstacle course thing at this theme park. Ezra said it was good exercise, but it was expensive and not open all the time. Then there was a game where you had a maze and could delete parts of it. I didn't know what to do and realised you had to delete things and then draw a path through it. Then I was in the game with Ezra and there were rooms with puzzles. The first two were easy. One was super dark and I had to use the light from my phone but it didn't really help. We wanted to give up, but no-one listened to us and we fell asleep. In the morning it was light again. We worked out what to do and Ezra left. There was milk and cookies on the table with a card for Santa. The next room had some David Lynch thing which was from a movie I had watched the day before. Aidan Gillen was gay and was with his boyfriend and another guy. They said we should have sex first and I asked if he was serious. I followed Aidan Gillen to a room. He got undressed and put a SARS mask on his face and a condom around his body because his boyfriend had AIDS. I was a 'mole'. I took my pants off and the rest of my clothes and lay on the bed. He got on top of me and kissed me, then we had sex."
"3866"	"(2011-08-14 (20)) I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Izzie was wheeling this closed off thing with a patient in it, who turned out to be Karev. He stopped it though and got out and kissed her and they were happy. Then it was real life and I was her and he was the guy I liked. He got out and Mom and Darren were in the room which was like a big warehouse shed with nothing in it. He kissed me and then did a 'drop' thing and kissed me hard. We kissed for ages and then Mom said 'cake' and there was a weird yellow cake with icing. Then I was on Facebook or something and Benjamin mentioned ""his small son"" had added some favourite movie to his list. He had mentioned the kid before, but I said that I thought he had been joking. I was upset."
"3867"	"(2011-08-20 (20)) I called Isaak to ask how many hours I had and he said not many because it was busy. I went in and talked to him and he said he had hired 3 new people and 2 of them were Seamus and Samantha. I said I was friends with Samantha when I was 15/16 and hung around with Seamus as well."
"3868"	"(2011-08-22 (20)) I was at the old house. Benjamin and Ezra were there. Benjamin was staying for a bit and it was awkward. We were dating though. Mom's car was in the driveway and it was dark red. I had trouble locking up. I tried to call Mom but there was no answer. I said I was going there to get my car. Benjamin was in the passenger seat. We went to this cinema place. There were horror movies with different themes, one of them was food. There were appetizers in the shape of rings and I was happy that no-one got them. Then it was a movie about World War 3. These bombs were aimed at this island where the main characters were. It was a little bomb and they ran. They survived, along with one other person and had just been far enough away to avoid getting burnt. One of them had a kid."
"3869"	"(2011-08-23 (20)) I was getting married. I was with a bunch of people the night before, getting drunk, and someone was unhappy about it. On the day of the wedding, I was worried I would get my period. There were people making jokes about the 'wedding night'. Mom and Nana were there. I went to the toilet and Kurt (Glee) was a part of it, and we were good friends. Some people were bullying him and he was upset. I walked past and there was a group protecting him."
"3870"	"(2011-08-24 (20)) I was talking to Benjamin on an instant messenger. We were joking and flirting and knew each other in rea life and were possibly dating. I sent a message joking 'why did I sleep with you last night?' and figured he would send back a love heart. It showed that he hadn't read it yet, then he sent a love heart and I giggled. I was telling Mom later about his uncle who was rich and famous and had ties to royalty and had brought the Stonehenge to his wedding, but then they said it was the wrong one -- they had wanted a fake one, so had to send it back."
"3871"	"(2011-09-02 (20)) We had seen pictures of some snowy place in Switzerland so had gone to the place in the picture. Then I knew Alexander Skarsgard and we had sex. It was very vivid and he was on top of me and close to me and going slow. It was my first time. I also knew Benjamin and I was thinking that I felt like I was kind of betraying him. Mom had to get a passport for her course and they asked me about my holiday and I said I had passports for two countries. I was part of some secret thing. There was an elevator that went really fast and you had to rate your experience before going down. If you chose something wrong it could sometimes go wrong and you could be killed. One day this guy was near it, eating and it hit a 7, so had heaps of time. This guy was Scottish and we got talking and joking about the guy eating near the elevator was spooky."
"3872"	"(2011-09-09 (20)) I was at work and it was different and there were lots of people working there. Isaak was getting me to fill out a form for a uniform. I heard someone crying in pain and I walked out this door to a hall outside, which led to the inside of a mall near a McDonald's and there was a girl on the floor holding ice on her leg."
"3873"	"(2011-09-10 (20)) FilmForum 2.0 had half been released. There were notifications when someone commented on a page and you could see all the posts people made and I was worried about the forum. We could also see a breakdown of genres and stuff that we had checked."
"3874"	"(2011-09-11 (20)) I was friends with someone in a European country over the net. I was on webcam and his parents were in the background watching. They were not attractive. I didn't have my webcam on though. They were laughing and teasing him in another language."
"3875"	"(2011-09-13 (20)) I was at the old house. I went to go to bed and Uncle Gabriel and Granma were in my bed and weren't going to move. I called Mom to ask if I could stay the night there. My car was on the lawn and I carefully drove out. It was about 3am and I saw police and I was worried they would pull me over."
"3876"	"(2011-09-14 (20)) I was at work with two other girls. Isaak wasn't in and they decided to leave for a bit. I went with them as one of them was in charge. We got ice-cream and some other stuff."
"3877"	"(2011-09-14 (20)) I was at some restaurant place and this room was part of a big building. People from the forum were there and a bunch of us were told to wait outside. I knew bal3x was there and I wondered which one he was. I sat on a chair and there was a wall in the cinema in front of me with a mirror on it, and I could see Benjamin sitting down behind me. He looked into the mirror too and I looked away. I put my feet on the wall and this lady yelled at me, like 'don't put your feet on my belongings'. I moved to a chair so that I was facing the other way. Benjamin was moved and told to sit next to me and he sat 2 seats away. His friend came and was Neil from The Inbetweeners. They joked about us not talking. Benjamin and said Neil didn't like my profile picture and that 'he liked the one with sin' and sin was some Scottish word. Neil said Benjamin and said 'she looks so normal'. Benjamin said 'then I met you and thought you were the most not-normal person!'. We laughed and continued talking."
"3878"	"(2011-09-16 (20)) Benjamin came to university with me one day and I had to organise stuff. Someone took a photo of me as I looked up and around and it was a weird picture of my neck. There was a cheese camera and I was confused as to what it was and Benjamin was annoyed and said 'a camera wrapped in cheese' and I wondered why he was so angry. We went to the cinema with Dad and Ezra. Benjamin was fine with them but was angry with me for some reason."
"3879"	"(2011-09-16 (20)) I was with Benjamin and we were dating. A friend of his made an in-joke and Benjamin explained to me that it was 'just an annoying in-joke'. This guy did a Peep Show quote and Benjamin said I'd seen that. There was a little nook like kitchen with the cups down low. Then I was at his university, but it was like a castle and near water. Someone delivered a note and it was written by Poppa saying that some family member was dying and it was sent hours ago and they were following up thinking I had ignored them. I had trouble getting to the office to call them."
"3880"	"(2011-09-24 (20)) I got on Facebook and Benjamin was back on [yesterday he said he wasn't doing Facebook anymore] , saying that there were so many hot girls at his university, but he was worried about the other guys still. He was saying there was one girl he really liked and he was in the same class as her. He was rating them and I was really annoyed and asked why he was telling me."
"3881"	"(2011-09-30 (20)) I got a message from Benjamin on the forum. He said he watched Summer With Monika and liked it and gave it a 9/10. He said he was going to post that comment on Facebook and I hoped he was returning to Facebook but figured it just made a mistake. Then it was night and I was at work. This guy was fixing something for inside customers. I accidentally took the tomatoes with me and then Darren ordered some of them for dinner and I hold him not to and was worried I would get caught out."
"3882"	"(2011-10-01 (20)) I went to the shop with Dad. We were in the clothes section and I saw Jason Segel and Seth Rogen and I pointed them out and walked past silently. I wanted to ask for a photo but felt too shy. Dad seemed to know Seth Rogen personally."
"3883"	"(2011-10-04 (20)) I was at home which was different. There were people across the road and I heard Scottish accents so I listened closely and there was a curly redhead guy. He said his friend was ""local-ish"". His sister came out as well. This guy said 'fitba'. I was thinking that I loved the accents. Then I was in a car with Benjamin and two friends in the front. Farrah came and gave us an invite to her birthday on the 22nd October. Ezra was there and said 'happy birthday' and so did I, but it got drowned out. Emery and someone else had gotten back from a holiday and we went over. There were nice biscuits from Canberra. They had really neat hangers on the wall."
"3884"	"(2011-10-16 (20)) I was at Nana's. They weren't there, but a bunch of people that I knew were. I went into the kitchen and there was a trail from the fridge going underneath the cabinet. There were big dead spiders and other creatures. Gunnar was there too and was talking to Mom in Nana's room. Then he left and I asked what they really talked about and she said a movie festival, the law and water bottles. Lafayette (True Blood) and I decided to look under the fridge and we shined a light to see something big in the middle. We focused and there was a huge spider with 3 minions in front with angry/evil faces. We screamed and ran. I got someone else to take photos and we killed one without the evil face."
"3885"	"(2011-10-20 (20)) I arrived in London to stay with Dad and Ezra. Dad mentioned that he was leaving in a few hours and Ezra was saying for a week. I started to panic about being alone and wondered what accommodation to get. I ended up befriending this girl and we got a room for £20 (I said ""20 bucks"" and then corrected to pounds. There was a bed big enough for 7 people and it was just us two. The next day more people were coming and it would be more expensive. We found another place which was more expensive. There was a room with 5 beds. There was one bench with 2 beds next to each other and 3 were on the floor next to each other. The place offered live-in jobs, but only for 16-18 year olds."
"3886"	"(2011-10-22 (20)) There was a ghost guy at this place. Someone saw a vision and we went around the back and smashed this wall in. They found the kid frozen and dead in this concrete. Then I went around the side and my boyfriend/husband was lying there and I lay on top of him and kissed him and rubbed up against him. I took my pants off and pulled his pants down and grabbed his penis, which was hard, and started rubbing him. Then I got on top again and put his penis inside me and started having sex. I lay down on him and kissed him, but later we were sitting up having sex."
"3887"	"(2011-10-28 (20)) A bunch of us ended up in this building which was a house or a school. This guy was chasing us. I ended up with this girl and we hid in a room. He came and we climbed through a small window, which I was surprised I could fit through. I ran ahead and then she called out for me. I went back for her and the guy was in the room. I ran and later she was upset that I didn't help her. The guy was diseased and similar to a zombie. He bit one of us and they turned into one. We bashed them to death. There was a hot guy in our group called David. Eventually we ended up being able to get out and David asked for our wallets to get our details. Mine had bra size and said '14DD', but I was thinking that I was a 16. His wallet said he was a 14 and I was confused."
"3888"	"(2011-11-07 (20)) I was watching Community. There was a naked lady in a pool and a kid was taking photos. Then it was Abed's mother, though she was white. She said 'Charlie' was bad. Charlie was actually Jeff and he was the kid. There was a fire in this building. He went in and there was one guy in a cinema and he took himself and Jeff and put themselves into a typewriter and I wondered what had happened to the show. I was then at some big market/farm thing. Brantley asked where some stall was and I said to follow me, but I got lost and ended up in a cinema. I walked up heaps of steep steps and lost him. There was a lady right outside and I asked if Brantley had gone in and she said she thought so. A friend and I went to get desserts. Eugene was in there and I got a mudcake and 2 chocolate mousses."
"3889"	"(2011-11-16 (20)) I went to the John Cleese show and the room was small with only like 10 rows of seats and I was at the back. There was a small stage. There were other acts and one had Frank Woodley. None of them were very funny or made sense. During the break I went to my car and this other girl was there. A couple went into this shop and started shooting. I snuck off but they came after me. I went into this other shop but no-one was there. I went through lots of doors trying to find the way out. Then I think they had some disease and their skin was falling off. Nana bought tickets for the Wakakiri and I thought I had to dance so was going to cancel, but then realized the ticket was just to watch it and I decided to go."
"3890"	"(2011-11-26 (20)) I had witnessed a murder by a gang. Mom got me and Ezra to stay with some friends that were high up in the drug world. We settled in well. One day I went into an office and was talking to them and someone turned on the police scanner and they heard they were coming to this street and going door to door pretending to be a charity. They quickly hid us in a basement. There was a window with blinds and Ezra opened it a little but I told him not to. There was a lady in sunglasses. A guy was naked and standing in front of a window. Then we were actually in a car and under a seat. There were 4 cars. The lady thought something was up and opened the car next to us and there was a guy in it and was confused. She said she was as cop and he pulled a gun out to shoot and she shot him first. He died and this other guy came out and shot her. There was a big shoot-out and everyone died. Ezra and I got out and decided to run home. There were police sirens in the background. I got my phone out and took photos. The house was on fire and there was lots of smokes. We ran and I took more pictures. We got home and Mom was there. I said 'they're dead, everyone's dead'."
"3891"	"(2011-12-06 (20)) I was living in London. There was some David Cronenberg thing happening at Benjamin's university, so I went up to Edinburgh to see it. I was sitting on the floor between chairs and Benjamin came out and saw me, but ignored me ad talked to this other guy. Then we got sent out as it was not on or had changed the time. I went back and people were posting about what they were watching and it was now on and I was sad that Benjamin didn't speak to me at all."
"3892"	"(2011-12-10 (20)) I just got back from our holiday and later that day/night we were leaving for a trip to Africa. Ms Solomon was at this outside deli thing and saw me and asked how my rabbit was and I said it was dead. I was using the same luggage for Africa. Dad and Ezra were there. Then I was watching Castle and Castle and Beckett slept together once and she got pregnant. They decided to keep it and then they got married (or seemed like they already were)."
"3893"	"(2011-12-18 (20)) I was at home alone at night. I heard a noise and saw 2 neighbours trying to break in. There was a girl and a guy and I'd seen the guy before. I got their attention and they took off. Later, they were there again and had opened the door. I called the police and they did as well so the line was engaged. I got through and they left again. I was a little scared, but mostly annoyed."
"3894"	"(2011-12-19 (20)) I was at the old house and checking Skype on my laptop whilst sitting on my bed. There was an on-going call and I joined it. Arnie was talking to me. There were babies over crying. I had to go somewhere so I quit the chat. There was a movie where a guy had sex with a dog and people came over but the dog penis got 'locked' so he couldn't get it out and I thought it was weird."
"3895"	"(2012-01-08 (20)) I got a flirty message from Benjamin and it had two links to his favourite sport scenes but saying 'this is when my love for you grew over 24 hours' or 'I like this less than you' etc. I was then at the back of a zoo thing and Mom was like 'this looks so different' and there used to be lots of trees but now there were none. There were elephants in the exhibit. Some Natives snuck through a hole in the fence and sat at the top of this hill. A young boy came down and took a can of cat food out of our bag. I grabbed it and said 'that's ours' and he tried to grab something else and I said no. Then the mother came down and ended up grabbing Mom's food and shoving it all in her mouth. I went around the corner to ask for the police and they sent a lady who dealt with Natives. Then I was playing a game. I heard an alarm but didn't know what it meant. Rover was on a platform near some water and I saw it break and I remembered the alarm was for a giant octopus. I called out to Rover and he just looked at me and a tentacle grabbed him and pulled him down. The game reset."
"3896"	"(2012-01-16 (20)) I was talking to Benjamin on Skype but we lost internet. I could still talk for a bit and I said I was going to my Dad's to go on the internet. I had to go somewhere first, and had to climb these 'steep' natural steps. I had some paper in my pocket and my phone but I was worried they would fall out so I put them in a zip lock bag. There were some mountains and stuff in the distance and it looked cool and I wanted to take a photo but I had to move out the way. At the top there was an office where I had to do something. I went on Skype on my phone and told Benjamin I'd be 30 minutes or so. I got to Nana's and went on the net to talk to him. Then I was sitting outside my car in front of a school. The people from the car in front of me were having an argument and they said they should start charging people to listen. I was like 'well, I'm going now' and went into another red car on the other side of the road. Benjamin was in the passenger seat. I told him what happened and drove off."
"3897"	"(2012-01-17 (20)) I was in a building, possibly an office. There were 'zombies' but what was actually happening was people would get sick and either die or turn into controlled 'robots'. You were likely to catch it if you went near them. A bunch of us were hiding out in a back room and went out the front to have a look. Some people got sick and us others went into a small booth and they fell down. Aliens were doing it? Their 'car' came and they could kill anyone by pressing a button (we all had a number and if they chose yours you would die). They hit a few and some people dropped."
"3898"	"(2012-01-27 (21)) Anastasia asked a friend about a job for me and brought a menu with my name on it to say that I got it. I called her friend to confirm (her name was Julie) but she was busy. I went to the restaurant and the guy there welcomed me and he was weird. He stared at me and said ""you're beautiful"" and stuff like that and I was confused. The others didn't seem to react. Grady and other people I knew were there. He plugged in a microphone and started singing Dear God and we laughed. He wrote down that we laughed and seemed upset. I said I'd laughed because I liked the song. Someone told me that he was not the actual boss and brought in to be like this as a test. I then got to do a trial and wore a trainee badge. I followed one of the girls. She served some customers and had to put sauce on a pizza. There was a lot of it and she had to do it slowly and carefully to draw a pattern. The John Cleese show was at 9pm and I took off without saying anything to get there in time. Mom picked me up and I realised I should've said something. I called to explain. My battery was almost empty."
"3899"	"(2012-01-29 (21)) I can't remember properly, but Arnie was staying with us. Home was different. He was a huge perv and would often stare at me and come into my room. One day, we ended up kissing and he pushed me onto my bed and got on top and started kissing me again and started kissing my neck and going lower. I just lay there wondering what I was doing but just decided to let it happen since I didn't want to be a virgin forever."
"3900"	"(2012-01-29 (21)) I was playing a game. I escaped from this farm and jumped onto a horse, while an evil horse was trying to escape. I had to run next to lava and 'beat' the lava a lot. Then I was in a street in real life. I was with Benjamin and talking to a lady when I saw a car fall (like following a direct 45° angle from the ground), from the sky. No-one saw it. Then it suddenly came headfirst down into a tree near us across the street. I said 'maybe someone strong threw it' and Benjamin made a joke about The Hulk but then we saw this giant rock/clay monster roar and we ran. I hid behind a pillar and some steps but Benjamin said we needed to go high. We ran into a building across the road and up steps. We could see the top of the monster's head from the window. The roof had these 'monkey bar' type of handles to swing across. There was also a game, like a card game going on. We watched for a while. Then we had to hide and went into the other room, which went lower. Someone pointed out this giant snowman in the window who was smiling (a fellow monster, but a nice one?). Then I was in Benjamin's apartment sitting on the lounge with him. He poked my knee and I complained and he did it again and I said 'you're as annoying as my Mom' and he kept poking and we started wrestling playfully. He also stroked my leg and put his hand up my pants but I let him."
"3901"	"(2012-02-06 (21)) Mom was reading a newspaper and there was a picture of a guy and she said he did something bad. I was talking to Benjamin online, but sometimes it was in real life. He mentioned this 'bad' uncle of his and it turned out that it was the guy in the paper. He had gone to jail and his name was Eric. I told Mom about it. In real life, I'd written some comment like 'follow a Scottish guy around for his babies' and something about wanting flowers. Benjamin saw it and looked thoughtful (like he realised it was about him and that I liked him). I pretended not to notice. He had to leave for a bit and left me with the house keys (it was in his house?). There were keys to a locked drawer. I opened it and it just had envelopes and stuff. I closed and locked it as he came back in, but it wasn't closing properly and it stayed open a little. He said 'I don't even know why we lock that drawer' and shut it. He said something like 'my granddad might not like that you know a South Korean [if we dated] '. I was still fat and wondered why he was interested."
"3902"	"(2012-02-08 (21)) I had a dream within a dream and was slightly aware. I was on a bed with Benjamin. He was behind me and I was pressed against him, but I didn't know why. My shirt had ridden up a little and I could feel a belt or something on my back. I wanted him to touch me, but he didn't. Then the blanket was 'aubergine' and I decided I wanted 'pancake', so it changed to a pancake coloured blanket, which 'smelt' like pancakes. When I woke up in the first dream, Mom and Darren were trying to work out what some pancake phrase meant -- I had written it in my sleep. I put on a bra and my right boob was 2x bigger than the left. I told Mom I needed to speak to her privately, but she was like 'just tell me' and I started to cry and made her come into my room. I told her and she was trying not to laugh and was like 'ok'. I had to get braces as well."
"3903"	"(2012-02-10 (21)) I had met up with Benjamin a few times (with Dad too). Every time was awkward. We were in a hotel room and Benjamin was in the shower. We went in the bathroom for some reason and I could see the back of him from where I was. He didn't seem to care, although I tried not to look. He turned to get a towel and I peaked, and his penis was really small (like a kid's one) and I was confused. Later, we were talking a little bit, but conversation was still much better online."
"3904"	"(2012-02-14 (21)) I was in the UK after having moved. Dad was with me. I was texting Benjamin on my phone until I realised I hadn't gotten a UK sim yet, so I stopped. I had messaged him about my accommodation and house mates and he sent back 'what about me? It's my turn!' and I was confused and wondered if he was somehow asking to share with me and I hoped he was. An old lady offered me a room in her house so I didn't have to put up with a roommate snoring."
"3905"	"(2012-02-18 (21)) Some people from Lost -- I remember Charlie -- and I were in a group after some apocalypse had happened. We were staying out the front of home. Charlie and I ended up in a car to sleep because everyone else took the space inside. He touched my leg and I didn't react so he ran his hand up more and then stopped and went into another car. I was thinking it had something to do with Ben. The next day, I saw a car with my licence plate and I pointed it out and they were like 'typical Izzy, only noticing something small like that'. Ben was there. I also got a call from Rohan and I couldn't understand it because of bad reception. It was apparently a threat, but he was laughing and sounded like a 12 year old."
"3906"	"(2012-02-21 (21)) I lived in England, but somehow ended up just wandering over to Edinburgh. Nana was also Benjamin's grandma (?) but we weren't related. She was living there for a while (and had done before). I was at a shop and using an iPhone app to find nearby restaurants/cafes. I went to visit Nana and Benjamin came downstairs. I was playing on my phone on a lounge. He called out my name, but I wasn't sure if he was actually calling me or just saying my name, so I ignored it and then he called out again and I said ""what?"" and he said ""Come here"". He was close by and there was a guitar. He said it had 'five' [notes?] and I said ""yay?"". He said something I didn't understand and I asked him to repeat it and he said ""did you just say 'yay' in your language?' and I laughed and went back to my chair."
"3907"	"(2012-03-01 (21)) Benjamin asked to meet up, 'do you want to go out?', and we went to the beach near Dad's. We actually managed to talk, but he looked different (I didn't actually notice that in the dream though. We went up to see Dad. The place was different and all of it was inside (joined by halls). There were lemons for $5. There was a lady at the counter and I said I'd get some later, but I wasn't going to because it was too expensive. Ezra had to wait for the neighbours to leave before he could leave because he'd annoyed them by being loud."
"3908"	"(2012-03-14 (21)) I was in a pub type of building and there were two floors. Benjamin was there, but I was on Skype and went to send him a message and it said something like 'user doesn't exist'. I decided to not send him a message on the forum, but instead leave a note. I asked the bartender guy to tell him he had a note and it said ""Did you delete Skype?? WTF. Thanks. P.S. We need 1 new member to hit 500, I count it"". Then I left and got in my car. I could see him through the window and saw him reading the note and he looked like a young Jeremy Davies. He took out his phone and mine was on silent, but I pulled it out of my pocket and he was calling. He looked at me through the window and he said he didn't delete it and mentioned that he was doing an assignment (which was why he hadn't been online). I started driving out and then I was walking and a guy flew over this hill and kept spinning around and bouncing off the ground and I was like 'oh my god, oh my god!' and hung up when the guy stopped. A bunch of people ran over and picked him up and straightened him out. He looked screwed, but he was alive. I called an ambulance."
"3909"	"(2012-03-26 (21)) A young Jeremy Davies was confused about something and I said 'Spanking the Monkey' to help."
"3910"	"(2012-03-26 (21)) I was a monster? At first I was just hiding in a bush, as me. An alligator or dinosaur and a blind woman were around and thought they heard something. I was friends with the woman's grandson. I hid in the bush, and the alligator thing smelled me, but she called it away before it found me. I decided to find somewhere to live and ran through the neighbourhood during the night. I stopped at a kid's house and it started to get light and people came out. There was nowhere to hide. This family invited me to eat with them. I was trapped in another time/universe or something."
"3911"	"(2012-03-29 (21)) I was out with Ezra. There was a lecture on that I went to attend. It was packed inside and we had to go to the opposite side of the room for a seat. The seats were labelled like 'boring and nice' and I went with a boring one on a row by itself. I forgot to bring paper, so I went down to get my bag. A guy sat in my seat as a joke, but I said I'd just go to the row behind it. They showed 4 different scenarios and you had to pick which one was true. There was one about The Sims. I was bored. I went online and there was some lady obsessed with Christian Bale. I think she was Asian. She was married, but also liked women? She hadn't updated her profile in over a year."
"3912"	"(2012-03-31 (21)) Mom went to someone's house. There was a cute guy there, but they said he was 16 and I was like 'ergh, pedo'. His name was Alex. Somehow we spent some more time together and he liked me. He was nice, but he was 'bad'. We needed to hide from some people. We were with some others and they said that we had to go into hiding for some years and I said no and they said we had to go to Disneyland. We went to this huge house. I was by myself and it was night. I walked in and locked the door. I went to the kitchen and there were 2 dogs and a cat and I said hello and pet them. I kept walking and then I saw Alex hiding around a corner. He flirted with me. There was a cleaner lady there. He kept trying to corner me and kiss me and I tried to go somewhere else. There was a wall next to his bedroom and he leaned up against me and went to kiss me, but the cleaner walked by and he pulled away. She finished and left the house. I walked off into a bathroom. I sat at the end next to the counter and wall. I could see the mirror and saw him coming this way. I got up and he was still flirting and I said 'you're 16!'. We ended up back near his bedroom and he talked very candidly about sex and referenced a guy I had gone out with, but I couldn't remember if I had gone out with him or if I'd slept with him and I assumed not. Alex was being pushy and I tried to resist, but he got me up against that wall again and kissed me and we went into the room and had sex. When I woke up, there was another guy in the bed too. I hid and Alex told him to leave. Then he left and the guy came back and saw me and realised what had happened. He grinned and left. I was feeling weird about the age difference. In an alternate version, he drowned 'me' and then opened my shirt and touched my boobs. Then he jizzed in his pants and was like 'damn it' (but it was actually a movie)."
"3913"	"(2012-04-05 (21)) I was at home, which was different. There was a giant spider and Ezra had it trapped in the aircon and it was hanging outside it. He pulled it off and it looked dead and dropped on top of a kitten called Sarah. Then it grabbed the kitten and went backwards under the lounge. We pulled out the lounge and it moved back and Ezra killed it. The kitten was ok. Then we remembered about this giant snake that was also in the aircon. I went up the hallway and saw some of the aircon vents were bent. One of the rooms had bits broken off and mine were bent inwards. I saw the backdoor open and closed it, but thought nothing of it. Mom and Ezra checked the rooms for the snake. I mentioned the door being open and we went outside to check, but couldn't find it. Then it was a movie and this detective was questioning someone and saw the snake shadow behind them and shot it."
"3914"	"(2012-04-06 (21)) I was at a shop with Mom. I was looking at the movies and you could tick your favourites, so I did it with a few. Benjamin turned up and said hello to Mom and me. I ignored him, not even looking at him. I remembered he had mentioned shopping here before. He said goodbye and left. Then we were at a Science Museum type of place. I was alone and went into this aquarium bit, saying to myself that it was my favourite part. There was a turtle walking on the path and I took a photo. I was taking lots of photos and was thinking to put them on the forum, until I remembered about my silent protest. I saw Benjamin there and I tried not to look. I could 'see' his thought; 'ok, just ignore me and don't talk to me'. I thought 'that's the same thing I thought when he ditched me'. I was happy that he felt ditched as well, but was still confused why he did. Then I was at a food place. He and a friend sat in front of me and I still avoided looking. An ugly girl started dancing and Benjamin was staring at her with a 'pervy smile' and I wondered why it was always the ugly ones. I hoped that he would notice me once I lost weight."
"3915"	"(2012-05-09 (21)) I watched a Finnish movie called Lichtenstein and it was really good. I was watching The Big Bang Theory and Sheldon did something 'bad'. His father yelled at him. He took his shirt off and held a button out and Leonard said to Penny 'he wants you to do it' and it was a symbol of kindness? She took her shirt off. I said to Ezra that 'Sheldon was like me at the beginning, now they've just turned him normal'. I was secretly putting on foundation. It was over almost all of my face and was red. It was going a weird green colour and was scaly. I washed it off and got some on a towel."
"3916"	"(2012-05-12 (21)) I was in a line of prisoners. A guy behind me joked about him and his boyfriend having sex. Somehow I got out and ended up in this sandy place like a town/village. I was with a girl. I saw this guy who I'd seen earlier shoot and throw his hands up. Nothing happened and he told us to come with him. We tried to run up this big sand hill which was impossible to climb. He ran 'into' it and then stairs appeared -- there was a secret button? It didn't reach to the top, but we went as far as we could. He had to get some peanuts. Then we were sitting on a small round disc on the top. The stairs were gone. The police came and saw us eating on there, but I don't know how we got there. His name was Common [something] but later he said his real name was Windy Bags, which I thought was weird."
"3917"	"(2012-05-15 (21)) I was at Comic-Con a few days early. Joan Rivers had a food stall and made me sit and eat chips with lots of tomato sauce. I left and there was a monkey with long dirty hair and I brushed it. I sat down but it ran away when I finished. I found it again and put it in my car, along with a guinea pig, because I was collecting one of each animal."
"3918"	"(2012-05-17 (21)) I looked on the Comic-Con site and Adam Baldwin had cancelled but Nathan Fillion was replacing him and I was really excited. But the next day he cancelled. Then I woke up and it had been a dream. I checked the Comic-Con site and Adam Baldwin had cancelled and I was annoyed. [I woke up in a panic and had to check the site -- all was good] ."
"3919"	"(2012-05-22 (21)) Magic Mike was actually a Billy Wilder movie with 50 Cent. It was poorly done. I watched it, except it was 'real'. There was a delicious muffin/cake. It was weird tasting, but it was the most delicious thing I'd ever tasted. I was trying to convince a friend to do something with it. Then Charlie Chaplin was a friend of mine. I can't remember what they wanted me to do, but I had to get next to him in a cinema. There was an old guy next to him and lots of old people were in the cinema. He got up to pee and we giggled and I went over. He had a big hat and I took it and put it on. Then I gave it back. It went over his eyes and he had another floppy hat on which held it in place. I had to kiss him and I was uncomfortable about it and realised I liked him. I can't remember what happened, but I think I did kiss him."
"3920"	"(2012-05-25 (21)) There was a weird zombie-like disease happening to animals that would make them attack you. I was in a room with some of them and I ran out. I tried to hold the door closed. Outside people were getting infected animals to attack us, so we ran. I got chased into a building by a fat lesbian/bisexual. She asked us questions about sex in slang. One was about blowjobs and I was like 'ew no'. I climbed up a ladder where I found this little helicopter thing which I'd dreamt about previously and I got on that and flew away."
"3921"	"(2012-05-25 (21)) There was a new season of Castle. Castle and Beckett were acting the same as normal but she was flirtier. They were investigating a crime scene and she flicked her hair while Castle wasn't looking. The case was weird. She was calling him Henry at one point and he got really annoyed. There was a teen called John Huston and had an Aussie accent. He was cute. They were at a highschool/university where he was in an acting class. He was a suspect, but he was nice. Later, there was a video hologram thing of him dancing. Beckett moved to parts of the room so it looked like she was dancing with him. She got out and found Castle. He had a twin but they weren't identical, just very similar, so that was how he managed to do whatever he did. Beckett found an old Castle interview where his alias was Henry and that was where she'd gotten it from."
"3922"	"(2012-05-29 (21)) I was at the old house and the neighbours were across the road. I went into the study to see this fat, old, Native woman lying on the pouffe thing. I yelled 'what are you doing here? Get the hell out!' and she waddled out. The window in the lounge room was lifted up and there was no lock. A lady was trying to get in and failed and left. Two guys with uniforms on were at the door. I was suspicious and kept asking them questions. I went to get something and came back to see them trying to get in. I tried to hold the lock down but somehow it got pushed up. I'd grabbed a knife and I threatened them with it. I think I cut one guy and he pulled out a gun and I didn't know what to do."
"3923"	"(2012-05-29 (21)) It kept changing between a slasher film at a party and real life. I thought the killer was this girl -- for no reason other than she didn't seem like the killer. Two people had sex in their parents' bed. I was helping someone in my class learn French and I couldn't read this French thing properly."
"3924"	"(2012-06-01 (21)) It kept going back and forth between reality and the Game of Thrones universe. I was a new character and later in the books I got married to Jon Snow. Kit Harington and I were friends in the real world. I think I was flirting with him and said I was looking forward to it and I think I asked him to ask me out. He lived in this village (in Game of Thrones) in the common area. There was a tunnel and you got richer as you went up. I was on a raft with Jon and others. There was another raft ahead. Joffrey and Cersei were standing up ahead and Joffrey liked me and hated Jon. He called out and said he wanted Jon and two other 'good looking' guys (he said their names but I figured that was the connection between them) to swap rafts. Jon obeyed and rubbed my shoulder. I tutted and made a face going past and Cersei told me to watch myself. Then I was back at the village. There was a really peaceful and pretty park. Kit asked how the ride was. Then it got weird. I was alone in the park, standing up against a tree. Two girls came to 'check my weight' and I was 53kg and they bullied me and were hurting me. Then it was only one and she'd been doing it for some time. After some attempts, I got the better of her. I held her arm out and stabbed her wrist with a pencil. I did it to some others and then I went back and dragged the pencil down her wrist so she would bleed out. She died and collapsed. I text Kit saying 'come to park NOW'. He turned up 25 minutes later and I had disposed of the body but he had seen it all and helped me take care of the other bodies. Then I had pretended to be dead as a joke. Then I had a baby in the park. Its head and name was on a box and it was called 'Chander' and I wondered why we called it that and how I misspelt it. Someone came with an Aussie accent. Kit said it was a baby of my favourite [something] . He looked at it and there was a pic of me and Kit with the baby, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's head on it, and he took it off. I assumed he knew about the murders because of this, but I don't know what the connection was."
"3925"	"(2012-06-02 (21)) There were pictures of famous people and I had to write down their names. Kit Harington and a guy I didn't recognise were there. I wrote 'Kit AWESOME Harington'. Then there was a picture of Katie Holmes and that was the one we were working on, Kit Harington was also naked in it, just his backside."
"3926"	"(2012-06-03 (21)) In Game of Thrones, Tyrion got killed. It was half off-screen and I was like 'what they can't kill Tyrion', it looked pretty final though [the last episode it looked like he died] . Joffrey was killed too. His lifeforce was in a sword and Sansa was going to smash it. His mother was different and she came and she couldn't smash it. I was thinking they would find Tyrion hiding out somewhere."
"3927"	"(2012-06-09 (21)) I was at a video shop. I was looking at the horror movies and counting the ones I'd seen, only 5-6 I hadn't. They had Children of the Corn III on VHS. Ezra was counting the ones he'd seen as well and he'd only seen lots of new ones. Grave Encounters was there. One movie was called Absolum: Mega [something] . I had had a dream about it and Donald Sutherland was in it. I thought it was weird and told Mom and showed her the dream over the phone. They had the Demonic Toys soundtrack and I said ""oh another movie with Daniel Cerny""."
"3928"	"(2012-06-09 (21)) I went to the cinema. There were people in front of me talking (the movie hadn't started yet). I recognised a girl's voice and I suspected it was Ramona. The chairs were movable and the cinema was eventually packed full. The screen was like a TV. They made us move to the sides and I sat on the edge of the middle set of seats. Then it screwed up and they told us to leave. There were lots of people outside. I started walking and a guy in a car propositioned me. I said no and he said 'good' and continued driving. I couldn't find my car and kept walking. I saw it reversing out. I opened the passenger door and said 'what the hell, get out of my car'. This guy just looked at me and continued reversing. I reached over and pulled out the keys and stabbed him in the arm with them. There was a Ute nearby. The guy who had flirted with me earlier got out of his car and helped me. I called Nana and said some guy was stealing my car and she said she would call the cops."
"3929"	"(2012-06-12 (21)) I woke up and heard Mom complaining to someone about a guy who was coming over. He was a drug dealer and preferred sexual favours over money and also gave better drugs for them. He came over with his wife and kids. I went out and he flirted with me. He was really dodgy. Mom went out and it was just me and him alone and he raped me, but I didn't mind. His wife and sister had a ranch up north and wanted us to go there for some reason. We went up and it was the day of the storm [there's supposed to be a storm today] . Mom said we should stay up there to be safe. There was a llama that liked me and kept nuzzling me and putting its paws on me. It ended up curling up on my lap. I didn't have a car so borrowed a horse to ride back (sometimes it was the llama), but didn't tell anyone. I was nearly home and stole a car. I got back home and grabbed some stuff and then drove to this block of flats where I lived? I thought we'd be safer at home but it was too windy outside. There was a grey cloud coming from the south. Cars were getting blown into each other. There was a girl and a llama in one of them and I helped them get out."
"3930"	"(2012-06-14 (21)) This guy murdered women and he had a daughter. Then it was my daughter. I went to the shop with her. Some work friends suggested this store because they had costumers for her to have some fun. I told her to get a costume and she picked this stupid pink princess dress and I was annoyed. There was some chocolate and I said ""ooh, chocolate"" and they had Skittles too. They were all years out of date. I bought a bag of Skittles which had 'Tom Conell' written on it. There was a little kitten in a shelf and I thought it was dead but then it opened its eyes. I helped it out. Then there were a few kittens. I named them Spaceman and Powder. We told the girl at the counter to make sure they were looked after. Then there were puppies too and one was small and dark brown. Then some time later Rover had had puppies with that dog."
"3931"	"(2012-06-22 (21)) I had my first stocktake job. It was at a supermarket and I was about to scan the first item and then we were told to evacuate because of dodgy people in the building nearby who might break in. We went out the back door and ran to hide under a hill. I went to another job and was scanning and I made a mistake. People treated me like a noob."
"3932"	"(2012-06-26 (21)) I was playing Minecraft [I started playing it last night] except it was real. I was in it and everything looked normal but I could shoot blocks out. My home as similar to the one I built in a cave. I had trouble with the door when the zombies came at night. Then people turned up and tried to steal everything, but I convinced them to join up with me instead."
"3933"	"(2012-06-28 (21)) I checked my email and I had to schedule an induction for a stocktaking job. I was on the phone and there was an entry fee of $500. There was a boot camp with pictures of an island place. I still had to do my exam and it was a few hours before my induction. I watched a movie and then had to leave because it was getting late. For the induction I had to weird stuff, eg write down 5 things we want to do (I wrote down 5 movies including The Adjuster and Foolish Wives). We had to take 5 things out of our bag to show our personality; I had magazines, movies and a puzzle book. This guy said I had no personality. Then my bag had different things in it and I was confused and everyone was like 'that's what you came in with' and I said it wasn't. I said ""don't pull this Matrix stuff on me"". There was a broken thing and I grabbed food out of it and threw it at the wall. They came to stop me. Then I was back home, but something was not right and I realised it and it was another trick."
"3934"	"(2012-06-29 (21)) Our house was different and joined with the neighbours. There was a door between them. I'm not sure of the whole story, but I had a boyfriend and he somehow got stabbed. I rushed to drive him to the hospital because it was peak hour and I couldn't call an ambulance. I was on the freeway. I kept yelling at him and hitting him to keep him awake. I think he died. Then it changed to a guy in a wheelchair who got stabbed. He was a quadriplegic and his mother drove him to the hospital. They saved him and they did something to his foot and he felt it and he could use his arms. The doctors were shocked. Then Rover ran off and we went looking for him. People speared him and he died. Sometimes what had happened was Mom had accidentally stabbed him with some glass. I was really depressed about it and crying all the time. I woke up (within the dream) crying, and had a dream he was alive and woke up crying again. People were over and didn't seem to care. Mom was on the lounge and she said that I was crying out 'fat puppy' in my sleep. I collapsed on the floor, face down, bawling and saying that I hate waking up. A retarded guy was over and asked me to make him a sandwich and I told him to make it himself."
"3935"	"(2012-07-06 (21)) There were people in a park. Something started happening in the sky, like a split, that was getting lower and chopping things up and people were dying. A girl yelled to a group of people to get down low and they lay down on the ground. She got close to them and they asked 'how low' and it cut the girl's hair. One lady had the top half of her lead cut off. A building sunk and disappeared and then reappeared a bit differently. A few other things changed too, like an instrument that had been lying on the ground. They realised all the world was dead. They said they needed to find more survivors to make it fun. There were some more around the corner, including the girl's boyfriend and another guy that she had recently started dating as well. I was then her and I kissed him on the cheek as a greeting. We went into this building and then it was kind of half time travel and half parallel universe. We went down stairs and there was a gladiator fight. There only one good looking guy in the first group of people. He chased some big guy and went out a door and got trapped against a car. There were dead people everywhere and he got killed."
"3936"	"(2012-07-08 (21)) Dad, Ezra, Tyrion (Game of Thrones) and I were going to some religious place in Italy to learn priesthood stuff and become maesters. Dad and Ezra got dropped at one point. I was in a fancy-ish hotel. I drove and Tyrion took the bus. I followed him to make sure I got to the right place. It was #999. I went in with Tyrion and he dropped his glasses case and I picked it up for him. The glasses were very round and fancy, but old. I wondered where I was supposed to go."
"3937"	"(2012-07-09 (21)) I was in Red Dwarf and it was sometimes just me, but sometimes me, Lister, Cat and Kryten. It was very boring when I was alone. With the others, I found a thing to travel back in time and we went to Rimmer. He was packing stuff away and I said ""Rimmer"" and he looked at me and I told him what to do that day so he wouldn't die. Then he was with us in the present. Lister said to me 'you brought back Rimmer?'."
"3938"	"(2012-07-09 (21)) I was at a Comicon type of place. Leonard and Sheldon (The Big Bang Theory) were there. There was a small game stand and I walked past them and kept walking through the store. I was walking with no real purpose, but walking fast. Then I suddenly wondered what I was doing. I began counting the stuff I had. I had a biscuit that cost $2.50 and then I went to the games stand. Then I was leaving the place and it was dark. I started going down the steps and saw this guy below me and I tried to scream but he suddenly ran up 2 flights of steps and put his hand over my mouth. I pretended to pass out and he took me with him. I planned to scream when we walked near somewhere that was lit up."
"3939"	"(2012-07-12 (21)) I woke up and got on my computer to discover Malcolm McDowell had died. I posted on Facebook saying that I loved him and that it was sad. Then I discovered another celebrity I liked had also died."
"3940"	"(2012-07-12 (21)) I was at a school type of thing at an old house. We were put in pairs and had to have a baby or something. I was curled up on a lounge waiting for people to come back. Alexander Skarsgard and a girl came and saw me and approved. They wanted the names Tiffany and Tina for a girl and apparently they were very picky about who they accepted. I went into the games room and pulled out Monopoly, but it was not the British one. We didn't say a word to each other the whole time. We started playing and I rolled 21 and I had trouble counting then had to just skip to 21 since each side was 10. The lot was orange, but should've been green and then I ended up in jail."
"3941"	"(2012-07-13 (21)) I was at school and had classes in different suburbs. I had one in Como. Then they all just at the same school and I was looking through my phone to find my next one which turned out to be discrete math. Vikram was also in my class. The desks were all close together and Vikram and I sat next to each other. Eugene was in front of me and Jeremiah sat on the other side of Vikram. As soon as the teacher started talking I got bored. A black friend of mine had to do some test. We weren't allowed to do have drugs or weapons and she gave me her lighter and cigarettes beforehand. My pockets were bulging. The packet of cigarettes had a picture of a section of the eastern part of the country highlighted with 'Bob Geldof' written there and a pic of him in the top right. Then Bob Geldof was with me and said to me 'I wanted to see what kind he smoked and if it's one of mine'. I said my pockets were full of smoke and he said 'and you won't ever smoke them' and I said 'I won't'. My friend finally joined us. Bob said he was addicted to cigarettes. I said I'm addicted to chocolate. I said I loved chocolate fingers and said they were so delicious I ate an entire pack in one day. Then I was in a big room with lots of people. Kevin Spacey and Chris Barrie were there. I tried to get a picture of them with Bob. I walked through a shop and looked at puppies."
"3942"	"(2012-07-14 (21)) I was watching Red Dwarf and it was like season 7 (eg, drawn out jokes and not funny). Kryten lost his memory and found Lister on a raft and he didn't remember who he was and it went on forever. Lister also said something like 'work, slave, sleep, work'. I woke up at home because Amelia was singing along to some AC/DC song that they'd put up loudly. I was tired and annoyed. Then I had this life-size cardboard thing and it had a list of old TV shows that had been cancelled but were coming back."
"3943"	"(2012-07-19 (21)) I was on a boat with a school. I was in a bottom compartment and it had seats like a bus and windows to the sea. It suddenly started spinning around really fast. I looked out and realised the boat was sinking due to a storm. It stopped and we tried to work out what to do. There was a doorway leading to stairs that would take us to the top. I left to see where it was. I held my breath and went under water but a little bit of water got in. I saw a shark and it had a smile and on one side of the mouth the teeth were always showing. I quickly went back. I realised we were going to die and some of us decided to breathe in this thing which would suffocate you. I died and then a girl realised how to get out, so I reversed it so I wouldn't die. We were then on at the top of the boat with all these control panels open and on top of the water. I got up to it and it had been going fast and straight. I couldn't slow it down and it hid bridges and boats and finally crashed to a stop. It felt good to be back on land."
"3944"	"(2012-07-26 (21)) A wife found out her husband was cheating on her and she banned him from seeing women. He was frustrated because she hadn't been sleeping with him. A friend said to her 'he's not so much as looked at another woman' but when he was left alone with her one day, he gave in and slept with her. This new girl came into his life somehow and he wanted to be with her. He ended up snorting cocaine out of her vagina."
"3945"	"(2012-07-26 (21)) I was at the old house. Mom was in the kitchen and I was talking to her as she made this ice-cream thing. She melted chocolate onto it. This guy was at the door to see Mom about something. He was a little chubby, but kind of cute. I let him in and he took my ice-cream and left. I went back to my room and had an odd feeling that he liked me and I went to lock the front door. Suddenly he knocked and pushed the door open while I was closing it. He said 'I just wanted to look around'. He looked at my computer starting up and nodded. I was thinking of posting on the forum and I felt confused."
"3946"	"(2012-07-26 (21)) I was watching the last episode of House. House and Wilson ran off together with a baby. Wilson explained how it happened and then it showed House in a car saying a phrase over and over to himself, and Wilson was in the back and he was telling him to keep repeating it. His face was bruised."
"3947"	"(2012-07-27 (21)) I was with a group on an excursion thing at a place similar to Hillary's. Once I got in, I realized I had no money. There was a drinking fountain with cans on it, so I took a handful after a guy friend I was with urged me to. I bought a ticket with 50c pieces. Then we went to this thing for water. I gave a $2 coin to the lady and said 'that's $2 a night' and she looked at it and wondered. She saw that it had some Olympic thing on it and she asked where I got it. A tracking thing said it had last been used at their water fountain. I said I found it on the ground. She started questioning me and said I needed to go talk to someone about it, but I ran. They chased me and I climbed over a fence with those sharp circular things and got to my car. She chased me down the freeway, which was very busy and different. She got pulled over by the cops as her car had 'stolen goods' in it (which they were going to use as evidence of my crimes), so she got caught and I was let go."
"3948"	"(2012-07-28 (21)) I was watching Game of Thrones. Arya and Gendry kissed and made-out. Arya was only 10 and I thought it was weird, but I liked that they got together."
"3949"	"(2012-08-05 (21)) Alexander Skarsgard and a guy we sort of knew got into a car with us. I was on the left and Alexander Skarsgard got in after me and sat in the middle. He was touching me, which I was excited about. I got my phone out to try and take sneaky photos."
"3950"	"(2012-08-06 (21)) I was with this guy who was very serious, but hot, in his 30s/40s. He was like a bounty hunter. We were looking for The Hound (Game of Thrones), who had been captured. We found a grave that said 'The Hound' on it, but we thought it was a lie. There was a water park and we had to go down a slide to reach another part of it."
"3951"	"(2012-08-07 (21)) I was at Red Dwarf live and I was sitting at seat C9. It was at a bar place. My seat was on the side and in the first row. I thought we could get to the back of the set, but a girl and I went outside to do something and could barely see anything. Cat came on and sat in a chair and said ""We're dirt poor"" and he kept going on about it and he said he was going to write a note to remind him how he felt. He put the note in his chair, then sighed and took it back out. Then someone in the audience said ""this sucks"". A kid coughed and there was hardly anyone in the audience. It started filling up after a few minutes and people were still coming in throughout the show. Rimmer came out with no shirt on but he didn't have the same voice. Him and Lister did something weird and then were running and dancing with sparkles. There was a bin on fire and I was confused. I took some photos with my phone. Rimmer went to the row behind me and took this girl's brownie and took a bite and she giggled. A bit later he ran back out and we followed. He needed a phone and everyone chucked their phones at him. I took my phone out and took a photo. I tried to lock it and put it away but I accidently called someone and I had trouble hanging up. Then he asked me for my phone so I gave it to him and I was excited."
"3952"	"(2012-08-14 (21)) Morgan Freeman and someone else were at a park. There were bouncy horses made of grain and Morgan Freeman went on one. There was a company called Slush. The name was an acronym for something and they did catering for parties."
"3953"	"(2012-08-18 (21)) I was at home and Raquel was over. She asked me where to find Winrar and some movies and I asked if she used torrents and she said no. I said we used Pirate Bay 'like Google'. We watched a movie called Psycho Killer. She left a note in my room. Uncle Vic was having a 52nd birthday party. He lived in Oceanside and I was going to stay the night there. Roland and Ezra were also coming. Everyone kept making jokes about hangovers in Oceanside. We were buying alcohol."
"3954"	"(2012-08-19 (21)) There were sets of tables and chairs for the cast of Game of Thrones, then there was a gap and then tables for other people. I was dating Kit Harington so we walked in together and we were at the back with this interviewer guy. Dad had sat down too and tapped Emilia Clarke on the shoulder, saying 'Daenerys' asking her to move. They asked us to move further back because more important people came."
"3955"	"(2012-08-22 (21)) Jayson was still friends with Ezra. Due to something that was happening I agreed to hang out with him one night. We went to this restaurant/hotel which was near the beach. We sat on a high wall with food and it was actually pretty fun. We were talking and joking most of the time. It was the 22nd of January and he suggested I come drinking with him on Saturday. I said I wasn't sure and it was my birthday in a few days. There was a quiet moment where I looked around and I could feel him looking at me and I felt uncomfortable. We made a house made of matchsticks. The lights around the wall got turned off and he said 'I think they're telling us to leave'. It was about 10 or 11pm by this point. We jumped down and walked past the restaurant. We were outside but it was undercover. He stopped under this archway and I kept going and he said 'stop' and I said why and he said 'because I want to kiss you'. I said no but it was a no out of confusion. He asked why I came out with him and I said I didn't know. He came closer and we kept walking and he was still flirting with me. I got home and it was different. I was happy and I looked forward to seeing him again."
"3956"	"(2012-08-25 (21)) I was playing a game. I occasionally joined up with a group of people for some post-apocalyptic stuff. Some of them were Game of Thrones characters. Sansa was in a castle. A guy had just been injured and she rushed to the bedroom to see him, saying 'oh please, let me marry him'. There was a Korean guy. Eddard was at the bed and told Sansa to be quiet in case someone heard. I was with the group from before wandering the streets. We were looking for a bad guy and we turned the corner and saw a huge guy standing there, and it was the guy we were looking for. He roared and ran towards us and we ran. He jumped up and turned into a giant. Some others and I organised to find a tall flat surface. The giant said it was for me and a guy to have sex on and gave us a few minutes. We hid behind stuff as he walked past (he was like a skyscraper). He tried to make a guy eat an orange but he was having trouble. I shoved a bit into his mouth and told him to hold onto me tightly. We grabbed this kid and went to the edge and I told them to hold on tight and jumped. I woke up in bed with the guy there. He said it worked but it wasn't perfect as they hadn't eaten all the oranges. Sansa and Arya joined us. I came back later for an exam. I asked where everyone was and it turned out someone had died and Arya was captured."
"3957"	"(2012-09-10 (21)) I was watching Game of Thrones, but it was different. I was talking to Benjamin on MSN at the same time. Arya and Jaqen were talking on a path and he left. I was thinking 'a man is gone'. Arya started to leave but returned and then there was a test. She held her sword out then a lady came and told her to follow her. She led her to a door which was a portal to somewhere else. Then it was me and I went through the portal. There was a stage and Eric (True Blood) and I went to climb up, but my legs started to feel like jelly and I fell. Eric asked me if I was ok and I said yes. I tried to stand up but couldn't so he picked me up and carried me. I had my arms around him touching behind his shoulder. I was trying not to blush or giggle, but I was excited. There was wine and alcohol. I couldn't remember which was which. I asked a girl to sniff them and she told me which was which. The wine was nicer. Eric gave a boring speech and I waited to see what happened next."
"3958"	"(2012-09-14 (21)) I was at some place that had a little deli/cafe place at the front. I went down one section and there was a bus sinking in water. In the main shop they had a bunch of green apples and they were in lots of 5, but only 1 was ok. I was with a guy and a girl and we used a knife to cut the apples into sections to check them. We found the right one. The guy came over to use the knife to do something. He then walked back and said something implying that a bum had been a murderer. He still had the knife so I suspected him and pointed it out. He came at me but I got a knife and stabbed him. Calvin was there and a girl who I hated and who hated me. Calvin went another way and there was a big open area with a window to the sea. I went on a balcony and looked down at the bottom floor. I could see a little bit of water lapping at the shore. The girl was annoying me so I grabbed her and slammed her against the wall and threw her to the floor. I ran before her other friends could do anything. There was a game with locked doors everywhere that were techy looking. People started coming so I grabbed a gun and hid in a cupboard. They came in and I shot and killed them all."
"3959"	"(2012-09-23 (21)) I was on the forum and a thread derailed and Benjamin posted about how he had a folder about how his future wives should look like, called 'Wives'. He said they were all sizes 10-12 and 12-14. He said he planned on trying others and the next one was the 'fat one from The Spice Girls'. It turned out he meant Sporty Spice and I said she wasn't fat and that she was ugly."
"3960"	"(2012-09-28 (21)) I went to this P90X boot camp thing. It was free, though you were expected to have already bought the DVDs. There was a free package which had weighted gloves and resistance bands and I couldn't lift level 2/3. Tony Horton came near me while I was looking through the package. Later a group of new people asked a girl to get something so they could measure their weight. She refused to show them and Tony called to me. It weighed you and showed everyone your weight, but I did it anyway."
"3961"	"(2012-10-07 (21)) I was at a video shop with Ezra. I was in the horror section and had seen most of the ones there, but found a few interesting looking ones. We left and I saw Spaceman and Rover and put them in the car. I drove off and it was raining. I ended up in a lake and the car sank right to the bottom, but we managed to escape just before that. I got back to the shore and then remembered about the pets. I swam back and found the car and got them out and pushed them to the surface."
"3962"	"(2012-10-15 (21)) Ezra, someone else and I went to see a sequel at a cinema. A later session was the 'premiere' but we went with this one instead. As we left, Bruce Willis drove up and parked right near the door. He said hello to us and followed us in and sat in the back of the car. I accidentally locked it, then unlocked it. I tried to take a photo but my camera kept screwing up. Dad went to the later session with Ezra and a friend."
"3963"	"(2012-11-07 (21)) I went to McDonald's for a job interview. It looked weird inside and the desks were cirlces and looked like sushi. I said I was there for an interview, and I felt confident and was smiling and speaking well etc. This guy took me to a table and was asking me questions. It seemed to be going well, then he said something about people pretending to be friendly and confident etc. I pretended not to notice. Then he asked me about poetry and I said that I hated it, laughing. He said that someone in the back loved it. Then he scrunched up his face and said '10'. Then he just got up and left and I saw a clock behind me and I realised that the interview had to go for ten minutes. I was shocked and a bit embarrassed and just left."
"3964"	"(2012-11-08 (21)) Ezra had fallen in with a scam where he had a job doing roulette but he had to pay them. He ended up $100k in debt. We ended up outside this abandoned building. A big truck came and they were shooting through the windows of the top floor. Mom, Ezra and I were there and we hid behind something.  We were shooting back and they said that I'd shot at the truck so we had to run. I ran to go hide and they ran into the open and started shooting. There was only one guy left, but he killed them both and I was upset. I picked up a hammer and went upstairs. I shot at this guy and we both ran out of bullets so I hit him with the hammer. Then I was watching a movie and this girl fell asleep on a bed. She woke up with other people in there and they weren't threatning her, but were probably not going to let her leave."
"3965"	"(2012-11-09 (21)) I was at home, out the front. There was a big van and I was poking around in the back and I took some stuff out. They went to drive off but the back wasn't closed and I ran after it trying to close it. They were heading towards the church and I was sitting on a log at the corner of the street and I was thinking if someone hit them I would die. The car slammed into them and it flipped over. I was shocked and I went and told Mom and Ezra. They went to go sort some stuff out. Then it was night and I was at home but it was different. I went out to the lounge room and it was dark. I turned the kitchen light on and it was flickering, then I turned on the dining room light and it flickered as well. I realised I was in a dream and I closed my eyes and blocked my nose. I opened my eyes again and the lights were on and there were 2 TVs and a big gaming console. Mom and Ezra were walking up to the front door. Later, I was at a shop and some people were acting dodgy. A girl and I escaped and she forgot her purse. A door was closing downwards and I quickly kicked it out. She left it and we ran. We got in a car and this girl (who was one of the bad guys) was standing in front of the car. I accelerated and hit her and her head got stuck under the wheel. There was blood everywhere. I got home and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to go to England."
"3966"	"(2012-11-13 (21)) I was dating Jason Segel. There was a weird place which involved a stereo speaker where you would go onto a 'pixel' which had a little squishy bit of sand with water. He took me there and we lay down and he got on top of me and kissed me. We hadn't had sex yet. We had dated in secret for a while but some old guy worked it out and started hinting about it to other people. There was a pregnant lady. We were with some people later, including Mom. She invited me and Jason Segel for pancakes and he was making jokes. For some reason they thought I didn't want to eat pancakes. I said that I did and we went."
"3967"	"(2012-11-25 (21)) Benjamin was talking about something that he'd gone to with his ""love"", but he'd broken up with her and was now dating someone else. I was helping Ezra with a quest except it was real life. I did it recently and it was in this haunted house and you had to put torches up to stop spiders spawning. There was a staircase and we had to mine blocks and replace them with paper and climb up. We had to stand on the sides and it was hard. We had to use the walls to lift ourselves. Then we were fighting the boss and we didn't realise we had to poison him to kill him. We killed him then we had to donate something to Morena Baccarin who was the hero of the quest. Ezra decided not to though. I was then at a shop that was closing. I had two water bottles but one was an empty Mount Franklin and was warm, and a half full Pump. A lady was saying the shop was closed but it was like, the freezer was closed and the counter was open. I just left. The doors were closed but opened, shaking slightly. Eugene was there and he was chubby and with a girl. He saw the shaking door too but no one else did. We got to his car and he was worried about it but got in and left. Two guys knocked on the passenger window and gave me contact information for some collection."
"3968"	"(2012-12-01 (21)) It was the day of my flight, except it was night. I hadn't packed anything and I didn't have a suitcase. I had that light blue bag and a plastic bag and I was putting my stuff in them until I realized I couldn't fit my clothes. I called Dad to ask if he had a suitcase. It was almost time to leave for the flight and I started to panic and wanted to cancel, but tried to stay calm."
"3969"	"(2012-12-04 (21)) I was doing an errand for Matthew Inman. I had to go into this shop and write how much he bought one of their comics for. I didn't know so I wrote £1000, then I went back and changed it to £2300, then I found out it was actually £30. Ezra called to ask about some mail which was something to do with first aid from Fruche. I told him to keep it and he said Poppa opened it thinking it was a scam. Mom was watching something on TV. It had Jason Segel in it when he was young and I said that he was quite slim when he was young, then he got chubby, then suddenly got slim again. I was walking on a pier with Kit Harington, but his name was something like Tom Woczyk. The air tasted weird and it started getting stronger. The water looked weird. I choked and passed out. He said that he knew CPR, but he just opened my mouth and blew into it; then he did it properly. We went away from that area and some bottles of Sriarcha had leaked. Two friends walked into a closet and saw something. A lady held them back and they said ""I didn't see anything"" and she said ""you can go"". Arnold Schwarzenegger was there and he said to me ""You must be Phil"" and then I said ""... Izzy"". We shook hands and swapped something."
"3970"	"(2012-12-06 (21)) I was following Benjamin around. I was right behind him in a queue at one point. Then I started keeping my distance. He went into a shop and kissed this girl and I realized it was the Bulgarian girl. I started to leave and they saw me and started following me. I ran into an auditorium and went down to the floor and sat. They didn't see me. I asked a girl next to me if they had seen me and if they left and she said that they hadn't. I thought she was lying and went to move and they saw me. Then there were terrorists. They set the place up in flames and there were a few survivors. Midge Ure was the leader of the group I followed, with another guy. Another two guys were leading another group. We had to hide and a guy and I went into a lake. We went under a jetty but then saw they were looking at us. The girl had replaced a manifest and some birth certificates but they noticed straight away. Then it was like Far Cry 3 and I ended up with a gun and was taking people out. I mostly used a sniper rifle. I was at home and Mom made some pot cookies. I had some and felt weird after a while."
"3971"	"(2012-12-09 (21)) I wiggled my tooth and it was loose and then I found a few more loose teeth. One of them came out and there was a tooth underneath. I made an appointment for 6am the next day. I got to the dentist and they said because my regular dentist wasn't there it would cost extra. I mixed up the time and I got there an hour later than I was supposed to. It cost $2300 for the exam and $3000 for being late. I was depressed to see my bank account down to only $3000."
"3972"	"(2012-12-27 (21)) I was at a party or a gathering at a house. It was like the after party of a big funeral or something. A guy in the family, who was about my age, was a bit weird and someone suspected him of doing something dodgy. I found some bombs in some bins and I moved them into one bin next to the house. My car was a few metres away and I went near it and wondered what to do next. I heard a noise and saw that a small bomb had gone off in the bin and the other bombs followed. The house caught on fire and an explosion ended up throwing my car over the road. I ran around the corner and started filming it on my phone. I turned another corner and everyone was screaming and running around. Then it was a movie and 'I' was calling out for my mother and found 'my' mother and checked if she was okay. Then 'I' was part of the conspiracy. I was talking to someone about it and they were saying there could be evidence so I should stop filming."
"3973"	"(2013-01-03 (21)) I woke up and went on Facebook to see a million posts about Kit Harington having died. He had been in a 'fatal car accident'. The headline on an article was 'Kit Harington dies a brother' -- his last word was apparently 'brother'. I was worried about the future of Game of Thrones and also felt weird and sad about it."
"3974"	"(2013-01-16 (21)) I was watching Detention 2. It was like a 'choose your own adventure' story. There was a guy that Riley (Detention) liked and a chubby guy that she kind of liked who also liked her. Sometimes Riley was me. I was in a restaurant and I sat down at a dirty table and said that my Dad worked here and organised stuff, and the waitress looked at me impatiently so I just gave her my order. Two guys sat down with me. At some point there was something chasing me somewhere. Every time it ate something or moved, it mutated (sometimes only slightly, other times a massive change). It was huge. It would jump and try to land on me. I had a bow and arrow to attack it with. I ended up at this place which was maybe a school and now Cinderhella was chasing me. I went outside and everything was covered with snow and it was freezing. The cold hit me hard. I was wearing shorts and a shirt and had no shoes on. I found 3 taxis and got into the second one. I was now Riley again and it took her to the guy she liked and he asked her to prom. Then it was 5 months later and Cinderhella attacked her again. Then it went back to the taxis -- the first one would take her to the guy who liked her too and the third had a taxi driver whose family was being taken hostage by Cinderhella and he had to take her to them. Then it was me again and I jumped out and run back to pick another one."
"3975"	"(2013-01-19 (21)) Hugo was on the forum. He had been for a while, but we had never mentioned it. I sent him a message about something and when I was him at work next, he mentioned it, saying he had been too uncomfortable to bring it up and was glad that it was out in the open (or whatever). I laughed nervously and agreed (it was something irrelevant to anything, like a forum list). Then he suggested we go on a 'double date' or get something to eat or something and I was confused. Later, I was out with Mom at a shop. I felt sick and threw up a little bit."
"3976"	"(2013-01-26 (22)) Somehow, Tyrion (Game of Thrones) and I were romantically involved. We would sneak off to these other castle buildings -- there was a big castle thing which was the main place and then there were lots of little buildings around. We were sitting in one, holding each other and talking. He wanted to give up his inheritance to run off with me. Later, we walked out of the castle together and people were watching, so I said ""I'll go walk around and meet you"" and smiled. We split up and I walked to the right to walk around the buildings and go through a back entrance. Some people followed me though."
"3977"	"(2013-01-26 (22)) I had a job at 4.30am. I was telling Mom that I needed 'Aero Grad' and a thing to kill bugs. Darren was in bed and saying they would get some and I was like 'before 4.30am?'. Mom was getting ready to meet someone. I realized it was 6.30am and that it was too late now. Then I realized the job was actually next week. We lived in an apartment block and there was some dodgy guy on the roof and the police had the building surrounded."
"3978"	"(2013-02-01 (22)) I woke up with my tooth loose in my mouth. I ran my tongue over my teeth, but couldn't work out where it had come from. I looked in the mirror and half of my bottom teeth were missing -- on the right side, I had a back tooth and the first non-molar, and on the left side I had random gaps. I couldn't feel any difference with my tongue though. I went to Mom and was telling her and I broke down, crying. She hugged me and seemed visibly distressed for me."
"3979"	"(2013-02-03 (22)) I was at home, alone, at night. I heard weird noises and caught a glimpse of someone out the back. I text Mom and told her to hurry home. I was sitting on my bed. Then I heard more noise and a guy came into my room. He was quite tall and blonde and was wearing a silver wedding ring and had big hands. He crouched at the bottom of my bed and said he wasn't going to hurt me. He started talking about something random that seemed vaguely familiar. I heard Darren's scooter pull up outside and he asked what it was and I asked if I could check if the light had gone on outside. I opened my curtain and said that Darren was back. He took my mouse as a 'hostage' and walked off. I pulled it out of the computer as he walked away so it wouldn't pull and said 'no, please'. He went out the back and said he needed to stay for a while. I went out to greet Darren. The guy turned on the back light and walked outside the window in the back room. Darren didn't seem fazed. He stayed a while (days or something), and he was kind of cute and I would keep looking at him and he'd look at me and I'd look away. There was some tension there. One night he kissed me and I resisted, but he kept going and I gave in and we had sex. There was some movie set on this boat. The people finally managed to escape and got onto a lifeboat and started going towards this thing, but someone shot it and it exploded. Some people landed in the water and they got trapped by this spiky defense mechanism."
"3980"	"(2013-02-09 (22)) I was at the shops and it was busy. Nana was there, but she was going senile or something and kept staring into the distance or would just walk off. I kept losing her. We went down to the carpark and I tried to get her to stay in the car. Then I was home, but it was different. There was a pink and nicely decorated letter at the door for me. It was from Zander. I then had a 6 year old daughter, which I'd had with Zander -- we had had sex at school and I'd had an abortion by taking a bunch of pills, but somehow the kid came back. Some guy was wearing a shirt from The Mercenary. I thought it was cool and was talking to him outside."
"3981"	"(2013-02-17 (22)) I was at a stocktaking job at an IGA. I had done this one before but didn't realize until I went in. There was a muffin shop next door and there was a guy dressed as a muffin and dancing around. Esther joked that this job would take 30 hours. We had trolleys to take around with us. Elijah was there. I went to an aisle but had forgotten to put my stuff down and get a scanner."
"3982"	"(2013-02-23 (22)) I was at Leederville IGA [I had to cancel the job which was tomorrow] . I was having trouble with my sore arm and after 2 hours I was still stuck on the same shelf and kept knocking stuff off. I was having problems with the ladder too. Calvin was there. I went to get Co-Worker-F-02 to ask her to go home. She was upstairs at the back of the store. There were bedrooms and hers was empty and the light was off. I heard a noise and went back to the stairs but then she came out of one of the other rooms in a costume -- it was Halloween? She said she would normally cover up with makeup when she was dressed up, but this costume covered up her face and I said ""it saves time"". I explained to her about my arm, but she just got some other people to do my shelf and I was unsure of whether I could leave or not."
"3983"	"(2013-03-01 (22)) I was working at the bar, which was different. A guy asked for a Corona with lemon, and it was actually this weird thing that I had to mix with baked beans, but I think he just wanted lemonade and a cake. The queue was building up and I saw Cute Irish Guy (Kieran) there. He had a name badge on saying 'Lincoln F', which I thought was a weird name for an Irish bloke and wondered what his last name was. I finished making the Corona and left it. I gave Kieran his Budweiser and as he gave me a $20 note, his fingers lingered on mine. He said his usual ""thank you very much"" and walked off without his change. I put it aside. There was a gambling thing going on upstairs. The guy hadn't come back for his Corona thing and someone said he'd won the jackpot and left. An Asian lady told me to follow her through what looked like a ventilation system. I tied my hair back and people queued up behind me impatiently. I started climbing through and some parts squished my head. Climbing down pipes was easier and then it was like a game. I got to the bottom and then the lady was like 'just up here' and it was a long way up. I couldn't be bothered with it and 'paused' the game for now."
"3984"	"(2013-03-05 (22)) I lived at a house with Mom near some woods. Outside we had a self-serve petrol station. It was night. I pulled in and filled up my tank. The neighbours across the road were outside in groups complaining to themselves loudly about our porch light. We turned it off and yelled out 'you could've just asked us, retards!'. Then they left their porch light on. Later, we were both in bed (we were sharing a bed) and Rover was there too. I heard a guy outside talking with a young girl (6 years old or so). I nudged Mom and told her the window was open. She didn't get up, so I finally got up and closed it. The voice was Stephen Merchant's, but it was the past, before he got famous and he was kind of insane. He was saying that he was going to let everyone know the difference between 'a condor and a girl getting raped'. Mom didn't stir and I thought that was weird. I thought about offering myself up because I wouldn't mind getting in bed with him, but then thought he might be violent/crazy etc. At one point he said he graduated here with comedy honours."
"3985"	"(2013-03-14 (22)) I was at a shop or something. Trey Parker and Matt Stone were there, signing stuff. Someone had a Cartman plush toy and I had the same one. They made fun of my accent. Dad was elsewhere and I was waiting for him."
"3986"	"(2013-03-14 (22)) I was on a beach and I was thinking about getting in the water, when there was a tidal wave. It started getting higher and higher and Ezra and I climbed up this big step thing. Waves kept coming higher each time, and we climbed up higher. Eventually it went right over us at the top step. I climbed down and ran to these steps attached to a building which were surrounded by glass. I realized I was trapped there, so I got down and tried to find a car. I found a golf buggy, but it was really slow. A girl was following me. I got off and there was a tent on some grass. There were two weird looking babies in there with big heads. An insane lady grabbed one and bit out its throat and started eating it. Blood went everywhere and I ran. The waves were finally over and I started looking for everyone I had been there with."
"3987"	"(2013-03-21 (22)) I was part of an underground movement during World War 2 and the SS were looking for us. The leader guy was basically Hans Landa (Inglorious Basterds) (his personality was very similar), but looked different. He had a wide nose. Calvin was part of the group and we went into a house where there were lots of old people. It was well furnished and looked of the times. We saw him come through the door and we got on our knees and were crawling around trying to find a way out and avoid him. He found us though and took us outside. He told me to dig a grave in the snow for Calvin, who was now someone else. I was wearing a shirt and shorts and had no shoes on and I had to use my hands. It was very cold and I started scooping it. I was a few feet away from him and I chose a moment to start running away. He followed me, but walked. I never stopped running, and went through a field with lots of abandoned, ruined castle looking buildings. I ended up in a building which was full of stuff and had lots of shelves and I ducked in between them trying to find a way out. He followed me in there, still calmly walking down the middle of the building. I climbed up some shelves and boards to a door leading outside (but it was like the equivalent of a balcony). I climbed down a ladder down the side and ended up back in the room. Any exit I went through was a dead end or brought me back to the room. The guy said something like 'you really want to live', but was getting annoyed with me. He ended up cornering me and held a gun up to my head and I was saying 'please don't, I'll do anything' etc. He seemed to hesitate and I was hoping he would have some respect for my will to leave from having escaped him so long."
"3988"	"(2013-03-22 (22)) I was staying at Nana's, though lots of other random people were too. Kieran was there. He was sitting on the lounge across from Dad. They were talking and I heard Dad call him Andrew. I was staying in a room down the hall. There were 4 single beds. I got in one to go to sleep, when 3 other girls came in and said they were sharing the room. They weren't ready to go to bed and were talking and messing about. I was annoyed."
"3989"	"(2013-03-26 (22)) Dad still lived at the old house. I was staying over. Ezra and Roland were there too, along with Stephen Merchant. We were out the front. Roland said he could hear a noise from the woodshed and said that 'someone was in there', but we ignored him. Then we were out the back sitting at a table. Stephen wrote on a bit of paper and signed it Stephen MerchanT -- the S and T being significantly bigger, especially the T, and I said 'the T's almost as tall as him'. He laughed. Then we were out the front again and Steve said he heard something in the woodshed. Dad went to check it out and came back with a bruise on his face, saying 'he hit me'. Apparently there was a family of around 20 Chinese people living in there. There was a hole in the laundry window that they came in through. I went to look and saw a lady using the sink in the laundry. I screamed. I went to the living room and another one came out and put her hands on my face. Someone said it was some ritual and so I stood there, stiff, and she made me kneel, then she bowed and I bowed back and I was thinking 'I thought that was a Japanese thing', but just went along with it."
"3990"	"(2013-04-02 (22)) I don't know why, but I was in bed and had a vibrator that was very penis like, and was giving it a blowjob. I was thinking it was not as bad as I expected. I put it under my bedside table and fell asleep. I woke up with stuff on my chair and desk that I assumed Mom put there while I was asleep. I was worried that she had seen it. Later, someone was asking sex questions and Mom and Darren answered one about 'most boring sex'; they had been trapped in a car on the freeway during a storm and got bored. Also, you could collect this alternative money, which I was thinking as being like EVE from BioShock and you could purchase upgrades with it. I had about 3000 and bought two things worth 1000 each and then thought I shouldn't have spent that much (most things were around 15-50)."
"3991"	"(2013-05-15 (22)) This guy and I had some friends. I was going down a path at some point and Ezra and some others pretended they were zombies and then I was like 'you're slow', 'you can't touch the pavement' 'you can't climb' etc as we walked away from them. I climbed these ropes which were stretchy. One felt weak and it was really high so I got off. The some girl friend of ours went crazy and all these people were after us. The guy was now Leonard (The Big Bang Theory) and we ran. We ended up in this house with cats, kittens and this fat, hard cat in a wardrobe and I think they were sick. We got to this place and Leonard said we had to find this game called something like 'huku fuku hakka nad' and it was a GameBoy game. We found it and it had a picture of the Hulk on it. We had to assemble the player and win the game to defeat the bad guys. They attacked us and I ran into a small room with was like a safe room and emptied all the parts onto the floor. Leonard defeated them and then came to the room and I told him to get in and we assembled it together. It was a very tight fit. We finished assembling it and I tried to Google how to win the game but then they came again. They got us and I hid the game between my butt cheeks. Then it was some time later and we were in their community. At the beginning, Leonard had written a shorthand message to me but I couldn't read it. It kept expanding on a blackboard until it basically spelt out the entire plan before I understood. We pretended to fit in with them. They were a similar race to Macedonian and I pointed out that I was too. Someone asked if Leonard was my boyfriend and I hesitated wondering what the best response would be and then I said no, but she said 'so he is' and winked. I asked a security guy for a smoke and he gave me an extra butt and it made me choke and it tasted horrible and made my mouth dry."
"3992"	"(2013-05-21 (22)) I was staying in a hostel thing. I opened my suitcase and a girl saw my stripey pink pants and made a comment and I said they're soft and she tried them on and agreed. Dad and Ezra had a fight at a museum and knocked over a zebra and lost 8 bones. I had some Turkish food for dinner and then ate back at the hostel. I had a diary protected by a key which also needed answers to questions. People were desperate to see it. I knew Ted (How I Met Your Mother) and was in love with him. At some point Lily said that she 'noticed how cute Ted was, and had to go home with my toothbrush for a bit'. We were lying on a bed and heard a hiss. There was a big yellow snake that he called an 'adder'. The girl said 'don't act scared', but I threw the blanket over us and we lifted it up and the snake climbed on her. I ran and she followed. It was night and I was outside in a park with a bus shelter. I ran down one side and she ran down the other. The snake ran down the path towards her but ate a lizard."
"3993"	"(2013-05-31 (22)) I was somewhere where there was lots of water with various things to climb on. I got quite far and there was a congested tunnel. I waited for people to push through so I could go through myself. I heard people screaming and someone said there was a shark. We all hurriedly swam back and tried to climb on something. The first thing I found was too low down so kept going. The next thing I found was wobbly. I finally climbed on something and someone else was a bit lower. We saw a shark fin come and went towards the the person on the lower bit. The thing we were on lost balance and wobbled. It got distracted and I managed to find another bit to climb on. Then later I was in the car with Mom and I was telling her about it being a dream and it was a crocodile and she said 'and then it [did something] and something to do with Amelia' and I said 'yeah, how did you know' and she refused to answer but then finally said I talked in my sleep. People were making short films and I went to this place to watch one. We got into a 'cage' and then it was swinging and chucked us to the other side of the room (it was a ride). Ezra was there too and I laughed because he'd probably be freaking out. When it was done we left and I realized I'd forgotten my jacket which had my wallet and keys in it. I went back and had to run into the employee area to get back to it. They didn't mind. I bought a chocolate and it was £6. Later I was at a park. It was pretty and there was a huge water area which was green-ish. It was only like 1cm deep though. I was eating lunch. Sailing on the Seven Seas was playing on a radio and Mom and Darren said it was lame."
"3994"	"(2013-06-19 (22)) I held a school reunion at the old house. Some people there were people who were strangers, but I'm not sure if I knew them in the dream or if they were strangers to me in the dream. Dmitri was there and looked really hot. Eugene and Bradley were also there. People were sleeping over too. I put a glass in the fridge and there was a countdown from five and it exploded. Dad yelled and said to never put a glass directly in the fridge. Later, I went to the toilet which was facing 90 degrees counter clockwise from where it does face and left the door pulled to. I peed and went to wipe, when Dmitri started talking to me and someone else came along as well. Later, this girl and I got into an argument and she was being bitchy to everyone. Her friend was also bitching with her. Everyone was then gone except those two, and she was still carrying on and I turned around and started yelling at her calling her a bitch. She got up angrily and I had this butcher knife and I hit her and her friend with it, and then ate them. I went out to Dad and said I ate them ""not in a weird sex way"" and he started helping clean up the evidence. They had been on a mattress with blankets and had left some spots of blood. I put the blankets in a basket. I put her suitcase and stuff together. Dad went out to do something. There was a knock on the door and some salesmen were there. They gave me a card and a paper bag and left smiling. The card said 'to Izzy' and then had some crap about donating to poor people. They returned not long after and I gave it back and said 'sorry, not interested'. They were bothered by this. The girl's phone on was the bed and kept vibrating because a friend was ringing. There was a voicemail from me, which I'd left earlier, of me yelling at her. I took the suitcase and a bag outside, and got a few houses down but then I saw people from the reunion across the street and the salesmen coming back, so I left it and went back. The salesmen had gone inside, but I couldn't find them. Then there were kids in the house demanding donations. I was thinking this was ridiculous and that we weren't going to get away with this at all now. Then it changed to a father and young son. He had 'made' friends, but they had died. Then they were escaping from something, and the kid got new friends and a dog (all created) and then they walked away happily."
"3995"	"(2013-06-27 (22)) I was with The Doctor (David Tennant) and we ended up at this place where there were these mini volcanoes in barrels over the water. We had to win to prevent the volcanoes going in the ocean, which would be even more dangerous. We needed 11 and we had 11, but still had to answer questions. There was a buzzer sound and The Doctor pointed out that it was ""from Pointless"" at the same time. They asked what most people said came after 'Twinkies'. I said roll, because I couldn't remember what they were and she looked at me in confusion and said 'no'. A black guy called Nate asked me out and I agreed and then changed my Facebook status to 'in a relationship' and then I was like 'I don't even like this guy' and cancelled it and unfriended him. I was with Benjamin later and we were either dating or just flirty."
"3996"	"(2013-06-29 (22)) I was at a shop (it was big; smaller than Westfield, but it had more floors) and then I left and went to find a car. I couldn't remember where I had parked. Then it was like a game and zombies suddenly appeared. They were weird and green and slow. Then I was in a pub. Lots of celebs were there. Martin Scorsese was one of them. The guy behind the bar made a joke to me but I couldn't remember who he was. I saw Nathan Fillion and I said 'ooh, can I get a photo' and he was like sure and really chilled about it. He put his arm around me, tightly, and I took a phot, but he was out of shot. I went to find someone else to take the photo. It took a while to find someone else and Dmitri was dancing to the music. After they took the photo, this girl was like ""I LOVE him"". Then I turned to see Alexander Skarsgard with 'nerd Eric' hair and I asked for a photo too and then I woke up."
"3997"	"(2013-07-24 (22)) I was at The Janitor's (Scrubs) house, and there was like a party but in this shop area. He collected old books/art and fixed them up. He kept offline records of things people bought/what he spent (he also owned this shop thing) and noticed he was spending too much and he announced to everyone that he was quitting his job of being a janitor and doing something else instead. Then there was like an explosion and a panic in the streets. People were trying to get in and we tried to keep the doors shut. Then we either got on a train, or it just changed to being on a train [note: I watched Snowpiercer recently] , which was owned by The Janitor. There were a few other friends/acquaintances on there. There were about 8 carriages and they were separated by sliding doors. Each carriage also had a door to the outside which was open and zombies were climbing in; even though the train was going very fast. The Janitor knew of a way to shut the doors so they wouldn't open from outside. There was an emergency latch to the right of every door and we had to pull it towards us. There were 5 of us and I said that 3 of us would go through and start clearing out/closing the carriages and told one to stay behind and the other to trail us. It was mostly easy and then there was a whole bunch in the next carriage. A guy was standing right at the door and we told him to move because there were lots of zombies and he was being cocky and then it opened and they surrounded him. He got out, but I think he was bitten (or maybe just scratched). We only had these guns which shot arrows and they had a slight reload time. We were shooting them in the head, and had good aim. We cleared the carriage and kept moving. The carriage at the end had humans in it -- a teacher and children. We saw them climbing in. I yelled 'get off our train' but then a female 'friend' of ours was with me and opened the vent and said that they needed to close and secure the door. She somehow got in there and started doing it and then something pulled her up through the vent. I was like 'holy feck' and then a dog came in and it started attacking the group, but then I saw it coming towards me and I ran. It was getting through these holes below/above the doors. I got to the first carriage, where everyone was armed and waiting up high. I climbed up and waited with them."
"3998"	"(2013-08-07 (22)) Our IMDb film credits were up. There were lots of associate producers. Benjamin's last name was 'Demon' and listed above me so I was annoyed. There was also a guy called Philippe."
"3999"	"(2013-08-07 (22)) There was a new movie with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Frost's last name was also Pegg (which wasn't 'real' but was like a nickname that had happened before they met). It involved time travel. When Frost was a kid he had a toy called 'Pegg' and it was something that he liked and that was how he got the name. Pegg went back in time to stop it and see what happened but he died and then it showed Frost as an adult 'die' and Pegg was upset and crying and everyone was saying it was like the most depressing movie ever."
"4000"	"(2013-08-10 (22)) Benjamin came to London and we met up the same day. I was talking to him with no issues and was like yay it's finally working out. Then out of nowhere, he had a girlfriend who was American. She was blonde and wore lots of makeup. I didn't like her at all. I put up with her, but when she came and they went to kiss, I just walked on ahead and didn't look back. Then they started getting really into the PDA and I just walked off. We were in a shop or something. Benjamin dissed me for playing Pokemon at some point and I said it was only because he hadn't played it. There was a weird thing with ropes and you had to climb to get to different shops and displays. I did that for a while and then checked my forum messages. Benjamin sent me one saying his girlfriend had broken up with him saying that it was my fault and she had sent me a message saying the same thing and said 'yes, you guys might be perfect for each other and you might always be interesting to him and he'll never be bored, but blah blah'. I messaged him saying I never said anything to her and I thought she was a 'personality-less bore' but was perfectly polite. I thought he'd chuck a spaz over that, but he didn't. He didn't seem too upset."
"4001"	"(2013-08-10 (22)) Lydia posted a status on Facebook saying she got in trouble for having lesbian porn and videos of her and her girlfriend having sex on a USB. I thought it was TMI. I was watching Supernatural and Dean's girlfriend was crying at him. It was an emotional scene and she had to sacrifice herself for something. She had to become a vampire. It turned to day and she was burning and threw herself in a fountain, falling a few levels to the bottom. I don't know what she had to do but then I was there too. People were coming in and we went outside and she wasn't a vampire anymore and hid behind a statue. I climbed up to the roof to lie on this thing sticking out, but it wasn't hidden enough so I climbed over a fence and went out the front again. Then I was at some performance thing. I was sitting with people from school at a cafeteria. Lydia was there and had found out I like Eugene and she had pretty much told everyone and I was avoiding him. Then I was with Benjamin and we went to the performance. We were sitting together at the end of a row. Colin Mochrie was in the row next to us and there were some other famous people. Some people from FilmForum were there too. SuperGuy was behind us -- he had dreadlocks and gold teeth and looked sort of like an early 20s drop-out addict -- then someone was next to him and then FlyingSquirrel was supposed to be sitting at the end, but a girl was there. She got up and then FlyingSquirrel came back and he was kind of hot. Benjamin was pointing out some of the others, as well as Local and Gunnar. People got umbrellas out and I wondered why there were umbrellas and then I saw the show on the screen with umbrellas and water came from the ceiling. I was wearing my orange beanie and I laughed and Benjamin ducked under another umbrella."
"4002"	"(2013-08-18 (22)) Stephen Merchant married Rose Byrne and I was peed off about it. There were pictures of them kissing and moving in together. They hadn't been dating very long and Stephen had asked her and she said yes. I was thinking 'I knew I hated her for a reason!'."
"4003"	"(2013-08-31 (22)) I was at this like 'camp' and we had a hotel thing, but it was in the middle of a village and it was run by the same people. I think I had bought the McDonald's? Except it was like a supermarket and I owned like half of it/invested in it or something. We had to line up and we were at the end of the last queue and I said ""I thought it would be a good idea to invest in McDonald's, because you know it's not going anywhere"" and joking about having to line up. There was something weird going on there, like people were going missing. I was with Dan Palmer, and we were investigating. We went into one building where we thought the dodgy stuff was going on. I can't remember why, but there ended up being a lot of severed fingers [reference to Stalled] - I think there was a 'rite of passage' and people were turning into something else and part of this was having their fingers severed. We managed to escape from there and went back to the hotel. One lady kept going on about needing lights in the bottom row of the store and continued going on about it even at the hotel. We went back to our room, which was next to their room. Dan got into bed and I reached over him to reach something and he grabbed me and I laughed and jumped back. I got onto the bed and leaned over and started kissing him. I went on top of him and I felt him get hard. We took our pants off and started having sex. I heard some noises and could see shadows of people behind the door and I tried to tell him, but he waved it off and we continued. I woke up part way through."
"4004"	"(2013-09-05 (22)) I had this box thing and the only way to open it was using high temperatures. I was running and then I jumped into the water. There were all these danger/warning signs because it was hot there. I started swimming to the cooler side and stopped when it was tolerable. A friend or something came to help me and then I died. Then it was 2 years later and I was like a ghost. Apparently what I'd done had something to do with work and Howard wasn't letting me out of the contract. I complained to someone that I'd died and he was still keeping me here and he heard and I went invisible and walked away as he started yelling at me. It was Independence Day and I realised I'd forgotten and had also forgotten my birthday the day before. I was at an office building which had a weird elevator with multiple sections. I ordered a water from a little booth thing."
"4005"	"(2013-09-06 (22)) I had another job that I went to two times a week. There was a small platform for the tube with only one carriage door. It was always late. I got to the place where the office was and Howard was there and said 'you're here early' or something and was wearing his Pink Floyd shirt and I said 'I have the day off' and he said that he had a 'job interview for the first time in years' and he walked into McDonald's and I went up the escalator. I went to eat and asked for this salad but the lady said I should get the chicken because it's healthier and it was like £9.80, but I said ok. I ate it quickly and then ran to the office and was like 15 minutes late. I signed in and someone asked me when I got there and they said 'you should've been here early, you missed [some amusing incident] '. I said the tube was always late and he said that he knew. It was a place where they made all these inventions. One was a scent detecting lock. Another had a cupboard that looked like it had shadows on it, but it opened to nothing except shadows (I think it had something to do with invisibility). I sat at my desk. Each desk had a curtain that could be pulled 3/4 the way around. I had a pink rabbit vibrator in my drawer and I put it in my bag to take away. I got up for a bit and later it was gone, as well as some other stuff. Someone had put a bunch of stuff in a fridge/freeze and it was in there. I quickly took it before anyone saw. There were also a few other things in there. The girl that had done it was sleeping and I wondered if she had been sleepwalking."
"4006"	"(2013-09-15 (22)) Had a text from Kiersten saying 'hey chic' and said Beatrix had said I was really noisy after 11pm. I also got a message from Benjamin saying something like 'I should've told you by now but I'm still a virgin'. I thought it was an odd comment but I was glad that he was and wondered if he'd told me because of that."
"4007"	"(2013-09-19 (22)) I went to a second 'FrightFest'. I had a full pass but it was a different image. There were not as many films and didn't go for as many days. I was seeing Stalled again. The cinemas weren't enclosed and it was like a screen, some chairs and then two rows of chairs right at the back. I saw Dan Palmer and some other people involved there. There was a girl second from the end in the first row and I sat next to her, but didn't sit entirely on the chair. I asked if someone was sitting there and she said no and she seemed friendly. I got comfortable. Something was playing on the screen but it was like trailers and interviews. Something happened and Dan got on a bike and was chasing after someone. I had something and he took it off me and I was squeeing inside and Christian James and the girl started recording it -- he recorded with his phone and she recorded with her iPad. A fat guy was there too. Somehow I got involved with the short film and then it was edited and done. We missed the film though. Dan was walking up to me and I was getting nervous and excited. He was just chatting to me about stuff. They also got my name for the credits of the short and I was excited about getting something else on IMDb and being right under Dan's name on the short."
"4008"	"(2013-09-23 (22)) I went to this place with a group on a tour thing. There were footprints in the wall that were massive but were David Bowie's. There were hands of celebrities as part of the decor as well. I went to the place where they were filming Stalled except it was like a classroom. They set us up so we were sitting along the wall. I was looking for Dan Palmer. Somehow later, I was talking to a lady about a project and she said yes and then I went to a place and opened the door and went in and Dan Palmer and Christian James were there. I said 'she said yes' and we all sighed with relief and it was a producer for a film/TV show we were doing together. The place was empty and square with a rectangular shaped kitchen to the side. Christian James got a blanket thing and folded it up in a corner like a bed, then got this sheet and stretched it over the kitchen. I wanted a bean bag for the corner."
"4009"	"(2013-09-24 (22)) Bullfrog was my boss. He had recently taken over my work (which I think was a supermarket). He was really tall and slim and bald and spoke perfect English with an English accent. He was always mean to me and had cut down my hours so I was barely working. There was a poll about who the killer in Friday the 13th was and 60% of people had voted for Jason Voorhees and I complained because it was his mother and Bullfrog started attacking me for some reason. I fell down some stairs and was lying on my back. I was shouting at Bullfrog and he stabbed another guy. As he was pulling out the knife I was like 'just do it!' and he stabbed me and chopped my head off."
"4010"	"(2013-09-25 (22)) I found a short film that Dan Palmer did. It kept becoming real life though and Co-Worker-F-06 was in it and she was with her boyfriend. We were using this room, playing music which was The National. I was playing GTA V on the TV. There was a pool just outside. Some other people came and looked like they were going to turn the music off and I said ""don't even think of turning the music off"" and this black guy looked at me like 'whatever' but I just stared angrily and his face softened. They didn't do anything. Co-Worker-F-06 stripped down and went for a swim. Later, she was talking to some guy with her boyfriend and he asked her who he was and she said 'my brother' and he was like 'what'. It was her breaking up with him. Later I was going back to somewhere and went in and there were zombies everywhere. Then it was back to it being a short and it had been a really tense kind of build-up and you wanted to know how it ended and then it just turned to zombies. I really liked it and gave it an 8/10 and favourited it on FilmForum. Jordy had watched it ages ago and had posted a positive review. The short had been made years ago but was only recently added to IMDb. I was thinking that those guys really loved their zombies. There was also a glimpse of Stalled at the end and Dan Palmer looked really hot and I was excited about Stalled. Also at some point I was on the Eiffel Tower and you had to win tickets from games to get higher. I got a burger and it took me 2 hours to eat it. When I realised how long it'd been I wondered how it was still warm. People kept talking to me and annoying me."
"4011"	"(2013-10-01 (22)) Dan Palmer joined the forum. His username was Dan Palmer. He posted on the Welcome thread with a nice little introduction and said his birthday was 7 Jan 1978? Maybe the 9th. Anyway, he posted on a few threads and I was worried about him seeing my posts about him. Benjamin sent me a message on Skype saying like 'he sounds like you' because he'd said 'I'm awesome' and similar stuff in his intro."
"4012"	"(2013-10-02 (22)) There were zombies. I don't really remember what it was like but we'd had some massive fight against them where we felt like we were safe and went to sleep. We were in this big building which didn't really make any logical sense, because sometimes it was like a massive mansion or an office or a mall. I woke up and heard people. I looked outside and saw normal people just doing normal stuff. I went to find my friends. I looked in a room and saw a hand lying on the floor from behind a desk. I went in and Hank (Breaking Bad) was lying under there sleeping. I shook him and he said like 'that was the best sleep ever' and I nodded and grinned and then said 'there are people outside'. I opened the curtains and outside were tons of people coming into the building. It was like there were no zombies/nothing had happened. He went to find his mate by opening the drawers of the desk. He wasn't in there. Two cupboards were at other side of room. I opened a drawer and he was sleeping in there - it was Simon Pegg. He jumped out and we explained and went to investigate. Outside the room it was now a mall, and tons of people were coming our way. I was doing like karate poses when they came near but realised they weren't zombies. People were running shops etc. We went to one shop and Silas was yelling at the lady about a 'doll rack' in the back and she was like 'how do you know about the doll rack' and I said exasperated 'someone told us about it, please would you just check if it's there' and she went and checked and said yes. I didn't know what the relevance was. Then there was something about a 'vampire' thing and there was a container of these like bottle holders, but they were squishy and had like bubble wrap on the inside. One had fangs on it. They were like £53 pounds or something though because it was some charity thing. I wasn't sure if that's what we needed but I was like 'too bad it's so expensive'. Someone said that centuries had passed after the zombie invasion had died down but I didn't think that was right because no-one was acting like a zombie invasion had happened."
"4013"	"(2013-10-15 (22)) I was at a table in a restaurant (like a big one, ball room type of thing). It was a place where some play or something was going on. The other people at the table were the actors in it.  I think I was friends with one of the actresses. Then I was at home and I lived with Dan Palmer and we had a son who was about 5. We were in bed and I was waking up. I was on my back and he had his arm over me, sleeping. It was our son's birthday or something and we were in his bedroom and Dan was joking around as you would with a kid and then gave him a Caramello Koala from behind his back which was apparently his favourite chocolate. And I continued joking around like 'gasp, he doesn't like Caramello Koala's' and then I pulled another one out from behind my back. The kid was really happy about it. Also the Caramello Koala's were more like small Easter bunny chocolates with just tons of caramel in them. Then these 'officer' types came and demanded to look inside and we let them. They looked for 'illegal' animals, like you needed permission for all the animals on your property and I was like 'what if a random animal just wanders in', but apparently that was ok. I looked out the window and there was this bizarre lizard creature, it was like two animals together; one was this lizard thing and the other was brown and had a long neck and a sort of ET looking face. The lizard had an iguana-ish face and would drape itself over the brown thing and it would like carry it along. I said 'we don't own THAT' and they were like 'yeah we know'. Then there was this species of chicken which was pretty but dumb. They gathered us all in the backyard (which was massive and there were a bunch of other people but I don't know who they were). They tossed forks in front of the normal chickens which picked them up and the stupid chicken just started running around like a fool. They wanted the other chickens to attack it, and they started chasing it around. I was like 'I don't want to watch this' and gathered my son and Dan and we went and placed ourselves in a position to not see it. Another lady had done the same with her son and on the way to the place to sit she looked at us in disgust and was like 'I'm not subjecting my son to this' but I was too sad to have a go at her. I had the feeling that the son was confused and not bothered about the whole thing and I was thinking 'I hope he doesn't end up a serial killer'."
"4014"	"(2013-10-16 (22)) I somehow ended up in one of those crop plane things with someone else. Either he or I was the only one who knew how to land it. We were messing around for a while when it started getting really windy, so we put it down. In the distance there was a bunch of smoke. We landed on a strip that was near this like cabin thing (like in horror films when they stop in at a petrol station or something in the middle of nowhere, it was that kind of look). There was just sand everywhere too, no roads nearby. It was dead quiet and there was no-one around. The guy was now Dan Palmer and we were suspicious, so hid behind this thing in the middle of the path leading up to the cabin thing. There was another building to the right and I saw a zombie stumble out from behind it. It started coming towards us and we moved around the thing we were hiding behind and as it came near I think I wrapped my arm around it and broke its neck. Another zombie from near the cabin saw us and started coming towards us and I did the same thing. We moved closer and Dan was peeking out and I said 'stop, don't move' because this big green monster (which I referred to as The Hulk) was lurking behind the cabin/near a tree. It was just a little taller than the cabin and was slim-ish, not like a massive thing like Hulk. It saw him anyway and I think it just left. I can't remember what the deal was but I had to chop off someone's hand and I chopped off their right hand and there was lots of blood; it was quite graphic. Then I had to chop off Dan's hand and he said to get rid of the left one and I found an axe and started chopping it. There was lots of blood and it was fairly easy to cut through although it took a few hits. I also chopped off some zombie's head with the axe. Then I was at some like beachside town and there were jetties and whatnot and stuff decorated for Halloween. I saw some kids wearing costumes and I realised it was Halloween. It was dusk and I was on my way home and I thought I might come back down to check out the festivities, but needed to get some movies watched for challenge first."
"4015"	"(2013-11-05 (22)) I went to see The Lords of Salem which was actually a live show. Rob Zombie was hosting but he didn't look like him and he also had a Northern accent and mentioned he was from Yorkshire. The show was held outside in a field thing. There was a big stage. I can't remember what happened at all, but it was pretty fun. There were lots of lights and stuff. Then it was inside. There were lots of kids in the show. Something weird was happening and they were taking people? I either went on stage or was talking to Zombie and he took my wallet? I went to leave coz I thought they were going to take me and I went out the exit and then realised he had my wallet. I went back in and wondered how I was going to get it. I was with the kids and they seemed to think something was going on too. A lady came and said they were looking for Eleanor or something similar to that, which was a codename thing. I said confidently, 'It's me,' even though I knew it meant they were going to take me (it was to save the kids??). She said to follow her and we got to the edge of the stairs at the stage and she said they'd be a while and asked if I wanted to sit. So I did. I also needed to pee. I was trying to work out how to make a run for it, when I realised they weren't even guarding me or whatever, so I walked out. I started running for the tube station (it was night) and the lady came running after me. I think I tripped over or ran into something and they caught me. They took me to this place and made me stay outside. It was fenced off and guarded by this one dude. The lady, who was now Jeb, told him to not let me through. I was crying and saying let me out and he started crying but wouldn't budge and said he had to follow orders. The only thing outside was one of those small rectangle plastic bin things, so I grabbed that to use as a pillow and curled up, trying to sleep. Then the guard was talking to another guy, so I got up and slipped out and he gave me a look like he'd done it on purpose. I ran, and they didn't follow. I got to the tube station and you had to scan the Oyster card and then your ID. Another guy was having problems with it, but it finally worked. I did mine but my ID said 'CONNED', and I realised they tricked me with a new licence thing. I had another one in a pocket, so I used that. I ran to the elevator and a fat guy was behind me so I tried to keep it open but he just stood there, so I went in. I ran to the first train I saw but I didn't recognise the next stop and realised I had taken the wrong line (a lady said it was the ""Green"" line). I got out and tried to work out where to go. It was like 1.30am so I wondered why the tube was even running."
"4016"	"(2013-11-07 (22)) I was watching How I Met Your Mother. Lily and Marshall were getting a divorce or something and she and Ted decided to give it a go. Ted had inherited the 'property' of something and had this small, but nice, house in a quiet street. It then cut to him and Lily lying in bed after 3 days. He was right next to the wall and obviously not interested in her. She complained they had nothing in common. She stormed out of house and he followed and then was shown whispering to Marshall who was waiting outside. It was a set-up so she'd go back to Marshall. He caught up with her and they seemed happy to see each other. Then I was there and there was a car waiting. As they were coming back he said 'run', and I struggled to lock the door and then ran. The doors were open and he got in the left side and I got in the right (though the car was facing us). We were driving for a while and then The Mother was in the front. She was wearing a white, fitted dress with white heels. She got up to change stations and had to bend over and Ted perved on her. She turned to us and saw what I was wearing and went off, like 'what the hell are you wearing?', 'you need to change' etc and I yelled back saying 'I'm wearing what I'm comfortable in and I am comfortable. You're dressed like you're modelling or going to a ball, I don't need to dress for attention every second of my life' or something. I realised I hadn't put my shoes on and we pulled into a shop to get some. They seemed to be out of clothes everywhere. The Mother dissed my clothes again and I was like 'I'm just wearing jeans' and saw I had a hole, then saw they'd been like slashed across the front and back of the knee and at the bottom. I was like wtf and accused The Mother. She didn't deny it but I didn't know if it was actually her. I was looking for jeans too. Ted seemed to be getting annoyed and I was annoyed and worried that he was going to ditch me for her. She ended up buying me this little fish. She gave me the bag and I saw the fish (it was red and white) but then it was gone. I couldn't find it and she took it back and there was also a Korean family staring at the fish and we assumed they were going to eat them. The Mother went to this old lady and came back with my pants 'fixed' - the lady chose between 'bringing the fish back' or fixing my pants. I was annoyed but like I didn't need a fish and I was going to get new pants anyway."
"4017"	"(2013-11-19 (22)) I went back home to visit. Mom, Dad and Granma greeted me. I was friends with Dan Palmer and we were somewhere. I'm not even sure where we were, but it was inside. He had the Stalled hat on, and he was near me and I took it off and put it on."
"4018"	"(2013-11-23 (22)) I went back home for a bit. It was hot and humid. The air-con wasn't really working. The cold air-con was the only thing helping. Home was different. Mom, Darren and Ezra were there. I said I'd have to stay in lounge and have a 'movie marathon' to keep cool. I decided to play games instead. I was telling Mom I'd have to go back soon because I couldn't handle the weather. Also there was a movie which kept changing to real life, where some weird stuff had happened and this lady was saying a spell calling 'Cloverfield' and then it showed this bridge and a giant foot step on it and start walking that way. We were going the other way through a tunnel. Clovie got there and it was actually a dinosaur and big, but not as big as Clovie. Then I was actually there and it roared at us and we ran and hid, but it found us and we continued running. Then I was at this house. A person gave me a key and said it was for the door in the kitchen -- there was a trapdoor in the ceiling. A clone of this girl was there. There was something to do with Lost."
"4019"	"(2013-11-27 (22)) I was staying at a hotel thing with Granma and others, but I was sharing a room with her. I walked out at one point and then came back in and saw Simon Pegg leaving looking a bit dishevelled. I went to walk down some stairs and I saw Stephen Merchant. He was very tall. He was with a lady and picked her up and carried her down the stairs. I took pics and was excited about seeing him. I ran to the room and got the number wrong - went to 140 - and knocked and then quickly ran to 145 and knocked. A lady came out of 140 and looked around and went back in. I went into the room and it kept changing between Mom and Granma. I told her about the people I'd seen. I also saw Robert Webb at one point and there'd been some scandal video thing - someone told me that some actress had given him a blowjob, but I looked it up and it was actually him being forced to give another guy a blowjob. He started crying during it and I was like 'how is this porn, this is a torture video'. Then Mom had a room there and we could see into it. I had a flask thing that was steaming. Granma was like wtf and it was some illegal thing, so I tried to give a signal to Mom and she realised. Granma realised and called me like a traitor. I went on Facebook and was looking at photos of Dan Palmer and there was a comment by a girl called Christine Murray saying 'I'm his girlfriend' and my heart sank. I was looking at her photos and there were heaps of them together and also check-in's in London - at her place, I assumed. There was also this weird little frog and when I waved at it, it smiled excitedly and then jumped on me. It was then a frog-cat thing and I was wondering when it became possible for those to breed."
"4020"	"(2013-12-01 (22)) I was on Facebook and someone had commented on a status saying something about me liking Dan Palmer, Kit Harington and Benjamin - but not quite so obviously and then Dad posted saying something like 'you like Dan Palmer, Kit Harington and Benjamin at the same time?' but had tagged Dan Palmer and had also said something about the number of people. I untagged Dan Palmer and it showed who had seen the post and he hadn't and I was like thank god. I went to add him to people who couldn't see the post but he didn't come up. I went to search for him and he didn't come up. I checked my friend count and it was 61 (one less) and I realised he must've deleted and blocked me and I assumed it was because of that and I was really annoyed."
"4021"	"(2013-12-05 (22)) I was out with Benjamin at like a cinema, or a place where there was one cinema. He had found some film club which was like £100 a movie that he wanted to go to. One was on today -- it was Les Miserables. I was annoyed because I didn't want him doing it. We were in a building but just outside the cinema thing, eating at a table. He got up and was gone for ages and I went into the cinema to find him. I couldn't, so I went back out and he came back like what's up. I felt silly. We went to some cafeteria type place which had lots of tourists. They kept moving the tables and chairs around. I sat down and Benjamin was still standing and two girls started talking to him. One sat next to me and started talking. He asked where she was from and how long she'd been here. She said '2 weeks and for 6 weeks altogether'. I said I'd been here 6 months and she asked if I had a passport and I said yes and she was like 'oh you're lucky'. Eventually, Benjamin and I sat together somewhere. He signed his name with his right hand and I was like 'why are you using your right hand'. He looked at me incredulously and said he signed his name with his right hand, but it looked like he was embarrassed about being left handed? We were talking and joking etc. At some point we kissed but nothing seemed weird and we were walking around flirting and messing about. It was nice and I was happy."
"4022"	"(2013-12-13 (22)) I was at a cinema or bar thing. I might've worked there? But maybe not working at the moment. A group of four guys came in and stood in front of me, looking nervous. They had hats/sunnies on. I recognised them - one was Bradley Cooper, and the other three were famous friends of his. I waved and joked about them looking dodgy (though it was something witty). I chatted to them and said there was a little booth thing away from everyone else and showed them where. They started messing about in there. It was dark, but I tried to get a sneaky pic. Bradley Cooper got peed off at some point and stormed out. Someone suggested it was because I took a pic, but I showed them my phone which was on the forum and said I hadn't (they believed me - though I actually hadn't managed to get a pic). On the way out, I saw Richard Ayoade and a bunch of people said his name in this weird way as some kind of in-joke. I went outside. A lady was walking around and one side of her face looked weird, like she had a really sagging eye. Someone called out 'Deborah [something] ' and she was an actress who had been in low-budget horror films, one was a cult favourite that I hadn't seen but had heard of. She was still young though. Someone asked if it was her and I said something about Dan Palmer having said something about her. Then Dan Palmer was there but I didn't recognise him at first because he was dressed up like a goth/tranny? It wasn't until he started talking that I realised it was him (the 'r' impediment). Also, I got a text from Kiersten saying the room had been booked and was really nice (we staying somewhere overnight/couple nights). There was one big bed and then on the other side of the room there were two smaller, but slightly bigger than single, beds. Lukas also text me about it."
"4023"	"(2013-12-14 (22)) I lived in a weird house with Julian Barratt and two others (one was a girl, but I can't remember the other one). I had a huge crush on Julian and everyone knew (including him), but he didn't seem to be interested. There were also these people who sat outside my window all the time, two were dressed in animal costumes (a cat and a fox?). They creeped me out and I always kept my curtains pulled to, but each window had its own curtain and it didn't fill the entire window. Mostly I just ignored them. My room was big and had two single beds over each side (one next to the windows and the other one next to wall, where door was). One day something happened and we had sex, but I think he was forced into it? We didn't speak about it and kept on as usual. Two of these people were girls, one who did stuff for me and one who was nice and perky, but she kept flirting with Julian. One day I got sick of it and I told the other girl to get rid of her. Then these chimes kept going all night, so I had to take them down and put them away. I also talked to the people outside once and asked why they were here. They said to monitor the relationship with Julian? The guy in the fox suit was called Tom. I went out and walked down street and hadn't really paid attention to what was around before. There was this big gelato shop with weird flavours and stuff was around £2.50-3.00. Some blue ice-cream, other weird colours and flavours. Nothing really interested me though, so I left. Back home, Julian was complaining to one of the girl's about something and I walked in and was like what and he was like 'I NEED TO FUCK' and he seemed frustrated and annoyed. I was thinking like 'dude, I'm right here and up for it'. He then seemed to realise and started motioning for me to go into my room."
"4024"	"(2014-01-16 (22)) I was with Ezra and someone. We were in a car and Mom was driving. I was in the front. I was doing some project where we had to ask people for stories and determine the theme. We knew Michael Fassbender somehow. We pulled up at a house and Ezra asked him for a story and he started telling one but it sounded weird and Mom picked up that it was a joke or film or something. I was then like 'oh no, it has to be about balance'. They all went back to the car and I was still inside with Fassbender. He asked me a few things about the project. My question was to either write about a western or a Yoshida film (it wasn't the actual Yoshida, though I went on Skype later and was like 'guess who I have to write about?'). I walked back to the car and went around to the passenger side and Fassbender went to the other side and I asked if he wanted to sit in the front and Ezra said 'yeah' and I said 'I'm not talking to you', but Fassbender was fine being in the back."
"4025"	"(2014-01-17 (22)) I was on Skype with Benjamin and he changed his profile picture to one of him which he had taken with his laptop and at a low angle, with a weird smirk on his face and looked a bit different. Behind him was a cupboard/shelf thing with a few bits and pieces on it -- one of them was a trophy of a hand giving the finger. Later, the picture changed to a video in real time and I clicked on it trying to work out what was happening and it tried to video call him and I cancelled it. Then it changed to this film he had been in. It was set in older times with farmers. He was in those ratty farmer type clothes [Hobbit-like] and he was lying on the grass with one of those wheat things in his mouth talking about how great the day had been. There was a girl lying next to him. Then it was real life, but it was in the present and I was there. He was talking to these two girls and I kind of walked off, but he re-joined me. It was night. We walked for a bit and then I was suddenly in this long dark hall at the door. Benjamin was outside on the porch and knocked. I looked out this little slot in the side but saw there were these two ghosts. They were cartoonish but had armour and swords. He was fighting them off and I was too scared to let him in. I saw this furnace in the door and switched it on and they melted. I let him in, but it was pitch black inside and spooky. I found the light and then we went into this room and there were computers and computer parts everywhere, as well as books. At some point, I realised it was a dream and was looking at this shelf of books and noted how similar they all were -- they also all had the same title, but I've forgotten what it was."
"4026"	"(2014-01-19 (22)) I was a hobbit? I was with some other hobbits or whatever and we were at the place they meet Bard in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The boat was there and we went into the water and hid behind a ledge, but when he came he saw them and started swimming out to them. I stayed hidden and when he came past, I grabbed him. He was heavy and bigger than me so I had trouble and kept falling underwater. There was an underwater tunnel that the others went through and I pulled him through with me. Somehow he realised I wasn't going to hurt him but he was still cautious. We were in this underground little house thing. I was sitting with him in a bath (both clothed) explaining that we needed him to help us and he agreed to help. We left and walked up this big ledge thing and had to jump to the other side. One guy did and missed and fell but was ok, even though it was high. I grabbed the ledge and pulled it down and landed on the ground and flung back up. It was then a game which was like an advert I'd seen on TV that was set on a beach. One side had this pecking bird thing and has three holes where some animal thing would pop its head out and you would hit it. The other side had a cat which would hit them with its paw. It said you could win money, though I figured it would be like 'you win this much if you sign up with this site and pay money'. I did it anyway and it said I won over £100 (I had a bunch of them to hit, maybe eight, and each one said the amount I earned; I saw £30 for a few of them. I opened the thing to get my prize and it was all coins. I was with another person trying to work out how to carry the money -- we put it in a bag, which we put into another bag."
"4027"	"(2014-01-19 (22)) John Cusack and I were in some group of thieves or something. Catherine Zeta Jones was also part of our group. Cusack was supposed to grab like $78 million for us, but he took it and ran. Sometimes it changed into a movie and there was a scene of him driving down a road in a car at full speed and then leaping into another one, with the old car crashing. We caught up with him at this place. We searched everywhere for him but couldn't find him. Finally we were at the last place to look. There were two playgrounds, but they were like houses. He wasn't there. The guy that was in charge was getting angry. In the smaller playground, we found Cusack's 'wallet', and the guy got excited and thought he found cash but it was just cut outs of puzzles from newspapers. I saw a ladder leading up to a window in the house next door. I wanted to wait until the others left before going up, but they seemed determined to stay and search the place. It got later and I heard old video game noises (pew pew pew) coming from the room. I gave the impression I was leaving and went behind this thing and then climbed up the ladder into this boy's room. He asked if I was looking for the other person that had climbed through and I said yes and he said he was in the basement under the bed and was bleeding. I lifted the carpet up and slid under it and went under the bed to find him. But then it was just under this bed and he said hi. A younger kid came in and said ""What are the shadows doing? I can't sleep"" and we tried to be quiet. He asked if the others knew he was there and I said no. I saw blood under him. There were pads and I opened one and he said they were noisy and I tried putting it on the cut but realised I had it around the wrong way. Then I heard a noise like people climbing through a window. We were now downstairs under a bed. He jumped up and walked to the front door. He looked out the window and saw them. It was now night. He got ready to open the door and we ran out -- it was now day. They shot at us and we ran for this van thing. I yelled asking how to get in and he said 'the window' and I shouted 'which window?'. I smashed one and tried to jump in (it was in slo-mo) but my boobs were too big to fit in, so I unlocked the lock and got in. He drove off. I was bleeding from the broken glass. Then it was raining and I was washing away some of the blood. He said 'you're not going to die, are you?' half joking and I said I was fine."
"4028"	"(2014-01-22 (22)) I was on PirateBay but it was the freeway. There was a guy advertising his game, not a torrent, but for like $6. I watched a trailer and it was a racing game so I wasn't interested, but then I saw it had Diddy Kong Racing characters, so I bought it. There was a bit where you race these hovercraft things over water and then a giant lizard tries to get you (the 'boss' was called Swamp Thing 2). At the start of the game you are in a room with shelves and empty boxes. The game was all happening in real life. The lizard attacked and the controls were weird. I killed it and then nudged it, but it was just sleeping. Then I had to tiptoe through a room full of dogs and cats sleeping. I got outside and a kitten came up to me. It looked sick so I was careful patting it. I talked to Layla and she said she had played it and it was hard. I was messing around with the settings and then Mom came running out in a towel saying 'you're up?' and ran into this dark building/room which was a bathroom, and threw her towel off and ran into the darkness. Then it was real life and I was near a store which was called Svengen. There were mailboxes and I'd left some Maltesers in one. I went up to it and it was number 361. A guy was opening 360. I pulled out the Maltesers and he handed me a $5 note and I went 'huh?' and he smoothly put it into his box and said 'what, I'm just putting $5 into my box'. I said ok and left. Julian Barratt was my boyfriend and I went up to him and he said it was probably a drug deal and said to be careful (to 'act natural' because the guy looked dangerous). We had an arm around each other and we were talking and giggling and he kissed me a few times. The guy was nearby and I felt uncomfortable. We went into the store and walked to the other side and then heard it was getting held up. A guy was talking about how he'd rape some woman 'even though she was Native' and I was worried they would rape me, so I ran to this door and ran out. I ran down one way but then back tracked and snuck past. I had no pants on. Julian was still in there and slowly edging towards the door and I wondered why I left him. I was walking past the first road I'd been on so I didn't walk past the front of the store and get the guy's attention. I saw a bunch of people run out of the store and realised they were free. They kept running though. It was getting dark (dusk-ish). A cute, but odd-looking, guy was walking down the street. He stared at me with a grin and came over to me. I started panicking but then I saw Julian at the end of the street and he ran towards me and the guy left. We hugged and I apologised for leaving. Then I was at home which was like the old house. It was dark and apparently a murderer was around. I found Mom's head and a brain in the microwave. I assumed it was fake and was looking for a trickster. I found Ezra and I told him and he looked at them and the microwave was on and he stopped it and implied there was a murderer around and that they were real. I freaked out and grabbed a knife from the kitchen. There was something to do with a horror film which was fairly popular and well-known within the horror crowd. It was playing on TV. Ezra cut out some carpet and found a hole full of horror movie posters selling for £70. We weren't really talking because Ezra said the killer was probably around. We got split up and I text him saying we should meet somewhere to talk. I got a text later from 'Lukas' saying we should meet at Svengen, 'it's where everyone used to meet before Facebook' and I was like wtf. Then I had another text from an unknown number about something related, but different. I assumed this meant either Ezra was the killer or the killer was taunting me by having many people's phones (having killed them). I was hiding in my room and all the lights were off now and it was very dim. The door kept getting gently pushed open. I was really scared and started crying. I got the knife ready and the next time it happened I stabbed them and got them. They started crying out and it was Ezra. I opened the door and he'd gone into Dad's room and was sitting on the bed. I kept stabbing him and he kept saying stop and then the lights came on and he had stab wounds all over him and one big upward gash across his stomach/chest. He said he thought I was the killer and then there was a creepy laugh in the distance and a light turned off and I realised he wasn't the killer and I'd just injured the only help that I had. I had an intense feeling of dread and fear."
"4029"	"(2014-01-26 (23)) I got a message from Dan Palmer all in lower case like 'after that naughty post you need a spanking'. I was confused. I was talking to Benjamin on Skype and said I got a bizarre message but he ignored me and kept talking about Spain. I tried to post on Skype crew and no-one was replying and I didn't know how to respond."
"4030"	"(2014-02-04 (23)) I went to The Room screening [going to one this week] . I got there early before the movie to get autographs and photos. I got Tommy Wiseau to sign my stuff and Dad's stuff. I had a photo with him and he had his face pressed against mine and drooled on my face. He was really strange. Later there was a big crowd and Greg Sestero wandered in. I was stalking to him and gave him Dad's stuff to sign -- Wiseau had written 'happy birthday Dad!' and Sestero copied it. I gave Greg the book to sign. James Spader was on the cover. He started tracing his face quickly and also wrote 'James Spader' and did all this weird stuff to it. He was joking around and laughing and then Mom came in and I told her who he was and she said 'oh yeah, The Room sounds good'. I said it was. I was making jokes about that and laughing. I wanted to ask for a photo but I felt awkward now."
"4031"	"(2014-02-22 (23)) I was out with Ron and Hermione from Harry Potter, and someone else. There was a waterfall with water going 'in' (it was going straight down, but then there was a gap and then more water). There was also some rope going across up high and I said I dreamt I walked it. There was a fruit section and I put a fork in the bit where the prices go and ants started climbing all over it. I went 'urgh' and chucked it away and told Hermione. She said that's where the ants came from. Somehow I got her and Ron to realise they liked each other and they had this long stare and then as we walked back to the car she pecked him behind a bush. We got in the car silently. We were all sitting in the back. Another person was driving. We took off and they took their seat belts off and started making out. The person in the front saw and was shocked but didn't say anything and I tried not to laugh. Then he told them to put their seatbelt back on. Then Dad and I had a month left in the UK to do stuff. I was annoyed because I had nowhere to stay. We were walking around and I forgot my suitcases. I kept telling Dad we needed somewhere to stay and he was like 'we can just keep walking around'. We went to the Prince Charles and it was different. The Room was still showing. The place was massive and I had heard The Evil Dead was playing soon and I wondered if we'd be there for it. I went looking for my suitcase and found a plastic bag outside a flat with a power cord in it. A lady answered the door and needed to go to the hospital so we took her. She thanked us and said she'd found my suitcase and kept it for us and would let us stay with her."
"4032"	"(2014-02-28 (23)) The Queen and the rest of the royal family were staying at Target. I was in there for some reason and talking to Harry and for some reason we liked each other so he asked me to stay too. I can't remember the exact details, but I met the Queen and was just casual with her. Later, someone had planted a bomb. I got out and ran and got in a car and drove off and then in the background this massive store collapsed."
"4033"	"(2014-03-01 (23)) Dan Palmer announced on Facebook that he was moving to the USA with his fiancee/wife to start a family."
"4034"	"(2014-03-02 (23)) I stepped on this thing and it hurt my foot. I was screaming in pain and Mom pulled it out and it was just this little hook on a metal rod and she asked why I was crying so much. Then she pulled out more and it turned into this big metal grabber thing [I watched Doctor Who last night, the episode with the metal things] . I wondered what I'd stepped on. I was later in this room with a few bees. I built a fake bee hive outside to draw them out but someone opened the door and they came in. I tried to get the cats away so they didn't get stung. I was looking after a bag of GBCS ID's and someone put them over the important bee thing and when I took it off more came. Hector was around."
"4035"	"(2014-03-02 (23)) I found a poster for Frozen 2 -- which had ice, someone hanging from a chairlift and Rover standing on the ice. I showed it to Mom and she was like 'oh yeah, he was shy' etc. I wondered how Rover got involved but didn't end up asking. The cast included James Van Der Beek and Joshua Jackson and Mom said I should get them to sign it and I said 'just because our dog is on the poster doesn't mean we're going to get invited to cast parties'. But then I was in the movie. There was a farmhouse type of thing in the middle of nowhere. I was there with James and Joshua and this girl. We were in a bedroom chatting and laughing. They had found me and we had already known each other but they were helping me out or something. The place was attached to a clothes shop. I heard bad people coming. They told me to put my shoes on so I did. I asked if anyone had a spare coat or something because I had none. I looked around the store for something, but I couldn't find anything and we had to leave. I ran out and ended up at this church thing. Mom and Dad were there. Dad was in the 'pews' (it wasn't a real church but looked like it, with the pews and the thing at the front). Mom was at the front and she was showing everyone how to wash this shower. I think she was bluffing to trick the bad guys or something. I was sitting with Dad. Mom made hamburgers but gave me one with a bun. George Clooney came in and joked around with me for some reason (his voice was very distinct and clear) and when he came back around he gently kicked my leg and I grabbed his leg with my legs and pretended to wrestle. He laughed and then said we should get a meal later. Dad was like you should do it and I was confused."
"4036"	"(2014-03-12 (23)) Somehow I was in the inner circle of some US Government thing and I was having an affair with Obama. At first it was like his son and he was in his 30s, but then I think it was him. At one point I was meeting him in this hotel room and I had a key. I knew people were following me and all the locks were greyed out except for the last one and it worked. There was a just a bed, lounge and a TV. It was very basic (even the colour scheme was blah). There were people outside looking, but they left. Obama came and I said 'go' and he said to meet somewhere else and left. I was then somewhere else and he was on a stage with his wife and kids (he had 2 daughters and a son). I was talking to his wife and mother about stuff. Then I was on the stage too. Then I was someone else who he'd appointed vice president but then there was some lockdown thing happening because of a possible assassination and they chucked 'me' out and I was like 'you can't chuck out the vice president' but they were all like 'I'm the vice president now' and made me leave. They said I could take one item and Obama heard the ruckus and gave me this drawing he'd done of her/me one night. There was a flashback with this person who had purple and yellow paint down half of their face and all of their body. The left side of their neck and chest had thick black hairs, very spaced out and I was weirded out."
"4037"	"(2014-03-18 (23)) I was at Hillary's, but it was different. Lots of the shops were hiring, and were all clothes stores. I applied for a few and went to check my mail (still at Hillary's). There were two for me -- there were cushions inside with a sticker saying 'you suck' on them (and no to the job obviously). I went to university, which was different. It looked like a mansion thing. A lady said university was closed -- it was Easter Monday (which she called 'good Monday') and I'd forgotten it was closed that day. I went back home and realised I was working today at Cannington. It was almost 4pm and I started hurrying to get ready and told Mom and Darren I was leaving for Cannington and they were like 'oh god, you're going to be late' but I said I started at 5.30pm and they said 'oh you have plenty of time' [IRL, I'm working at Cannington tonight] . People on the forum were giving me directions. Quizzleygirl said there'd be a sign saying 'Quizzleygirl's 4 [km] ' and to turn there and the rest of it would be on foot. I did so. Then people from the forum were there. FlyingSquirrel had a disguise on and I was out of the room and he was talking to me, then took the mask off and he was like 80 (he looked very old) and I tried not to act surprised. He went back inside and I saw everyone sitting stunned. Benjamin was there and he looked at me through a window and I mouthed 'FlyingSquirrel' and he was like 'oh my god'. He came outside and then he was The Doctor (David Tennant). FlyingSquirrel was outside too, just a bit away from us. I thought something was dodgy. Something happened and he got younger (about 50). The Doctor hinted it was The Master again. Then I was his companion and was saying he couldn't kill him and there was a dead bird and the Doctor looked vengeful but picked up the bird and it came back to life; suggesting what he'd do to the Master. He also said something like 'remember, I didn't kill him') [IRL I'm rewatching Doctor Who and watched the Master episode last night] . I wondered if it meant FlyingSquirrel had been killed and the Doctor thought so."
"4038"	"(2014-03-30 (23)) I was at home or something and there was a massive spider thing skittering about. It had a 'tail' which dragged along. Someone else and I were on a bed and too scared to go down. It had a head on it that like had a human head inside it (an image, I think). There was some other creature as well which was rubbing its head on the spider. I grabbed this tennis racket thing and they grabbed this other thing and we hit it. I felt bad but we kept going until we thought it was dead. We tied rope around its head. Then it turned into a person and they were dying. It looked like Bill Bailey and he was a friend of ours and he confessed his love to me and I had just started going out with his friend who we worked with. We thought he was going to kill us or something, but then he was ok and we were in the shop we worked at. I knocked over a thing of flour and went to pick it up, but it spilt and I got flour on my hands. Bill Bailey was walking out and I deliberated on what to do and then went after him and tapped his back -- he was wearing a denim jacket -- and said 'it doesn't have to be weird'. He said 'I have to see you and [the other guy] falling in love every day' and I went silent. We went to this deli to get ice-cream -- I got a chocolate vanilla Cornetto thing. He tried to pay by card but they wanted the expiry date of this thing and he didn't have it. I had no money or anything on me either."
"4039"	"(2014-03-30 (23)) I was with The Doctor (David Tennant). We were close and possibly going to take it further. We had some other girl with us temporarily as well. We went back to the 40s, during the Nazi era. There was this blonde lady (about 40) who was evil and running some thing. She wasn't meant to be there, so the Doctor was trying to fix it. We were outside at night around these buildings and a market. Then we were in this underground lair place. We got separated and I got tricked and trapped in this room with lava. There were some places to stand but it was sinking. I was calling out for the Doctor and panicking. I jumped onto this lower platform and managed to get out of the room. I ended up with a lady and others following me and I ran and opened this door. The Doctor came and through and I realised he must've used me as bait. We got trapped somewhere else and she had this thing there which was like a red light preventing the sonic screwdriver from being used. There were blocks on the wall and they were all black except for a white one in the corner. It was Minecraft like and the screwdriver would work on the white one, so he pushed it back and we climbed through. It led into this hall and we climbed up a wall into this big room which was like a museum. The lady confronted us but didn't try to kill us. The Doctor was talking to her saying we had to take what we wanted and leave. I was wearing a coat and it got caught I considered leaving it, but I liked it so I unhooked it. The lady looked stunned and wanted to take all this jewellery, but couldn't. I didn't know why he was taking her with us. We opened a door and it led into the TARDIS, which looked totally different. It had a curved entryway and had a window which looked outside and was underwater. Apparently the TARDIS was parked underwater somewhere but this was a portal to it. Outside, two stingrays were swimming towards each other and the Doctor said they were mating. Then we left and the stingrays joined together and began mating. Then it was beavers and there was a sort of comedic British voiceover describing the mating and birth. At a certain point in the pregnancy, their heads changed and they looked like they were wearing a pointy white mask thing. Then it would fall off and she would give birth by swimming upwards and the baby beavers would just pop out, followed by the placenta."
"4040"	"(2014-04-05 (23)) I kept having nightmares that would go longer each time I slept. The 217 lady (The Shining) would appear and I would try to scream and nothing would come out. She would come towards me and eventually I would wake up. I was too scared to sleep."
"4041"	"(2014-04-06 (23)) I went to a forum meet-up. We were in a regular cinema seeing some movie but I'm not sure where we were. Quizzleygirl and Bignose were there. Initially I sat next to Big and I said 'hello, Bignose' but he ended up moving. I sat in the back row in the middle and no-one else was there. Benjamin was supposed to come but hadn't arrived yet. At the halfway point, he turned up and went staright to an empty seat next to Quizzleygirl. I was annoyed. Later he and someone else moved next to me. He was talking to the other preson and his arm was resting over my leg. I wondered what was going on. He moved it and later said a few words to me. After the movie, Quizzleygirl drowned or something. I took her out of the water and I was alone and I thought about just leaving her, but I thought I might as well give CPR a go and she came back on the first breath."
"4042"	"(2014-04-09 (23)) We had a group meeting but somehow we all forgot [have a group meeting today] . We accidentally bumped into each other at university (which was different) and we were like 'oh feck, the meeting', but then we were like 'let's do it tomorrow'. I distinctly remember Classmate-M-02, Classmate-M-05 and Classmate-F-13 (she asked me something). Classmate-M-05 was talking to me about something. We were outside near a car. Then later I was inside somewhere for work. I needed to get changed, so I went up an escalator to find the toilet. I went to go to the toilet and saw Classmate-M-02 and he went into the other toilet. I realised I'd gone into the men's and walked out as he walked out of the ladies and he laughed and said something like 'no I didn't, Izzy' and we went into the right toilet. I went into a cubicle which was large and the doors were up high. A girl and a guy outside could see in (they were young, like 13). They wouldn't leave and I ended up chasing them out and kicking the guy in the butt (gently-ish). There were lots of people in the toilet, it was very crowded. Later I kicked someone in the balls (jokingly, not hard) and they 'pickpocketed' me and took my wallet. I grabbed it and kicked them again and they took my phone. I took my phone back and was like 'my brother used to do that to say like 'don't take your eyes away from your stuff or people will take it''."
"4043"	"(2014-04-10 (23)) I was with Dad and he was taking me to this really posh shopping centre to meet his friend who owned the whole thing. It was very fancy and I was worried we'd get chucked out. The guy ran a clothes shop in there as well, so was in the office for that one. We went in and a black security guard stopped us and asked if we had an appointment and Dad was like 'we're friends' and we went in. The guy was Robert Downey Jr (not actually him, but he was 'played' by him). We sat down and said hello etc. Later, we caught him kissing a woman in a car. He was married as well so we were shocked and didn't know what to do. We interrupted him and the woman left. Then it was a movie and I was now a young girl who he'd been helping. He gave her a hug as his wife drove past and she assumed he was cheating on her with 'me'. I tried to tell her it was just a hug."
"4044"	"(2014-04-10 (23)) I drove to this restaurant thing and the first floor had collapsed, but second floor ok (no-one was on second floor). It was day time. I looked in at all the people stuck in the rubble and went back to the car. I heard giggling and a group of young people came up and said 'is Valerie in there' and I was like 'I dunno' and they said thanks for picking us up and I said I didn't and she said 'you will though' and I said 'I won't' and she said 'you will'. It was now night time and I turned on my lights. I locked my door and drove off - and saw them holding on behind. I drove crazily but it didn't knock them off. Eventually it did, but they followed and kept turning up. I was trying to find the freeway but didn't know where I was. I ended up near a hospital and called Mom and she said she was at Dad's and I said I was being stalked but she didn't have any suggestions. I got out and went into the hospital, and it was now day again. I was trying to navigate but it was difficult. There was an area underneath the hospital which had like airport shops."
"4045"	"(2014-04-17 (23)) I was in the Game of Thrones universe. Jon and Bran were there. Bran could walk. There was a castle thing. I was then in real life and some weird thing was happening. I was out the front at home at the curb near my car. I wasn't sure what the problem was, but something felt off. I kept seeing something in the corner of my eye and when I'd look I could see this creepy white kind of face making a noise like The Silence. It was fuzzy and would disappear when I looked away. It would only be visible sometimes. I went back inside and noticed it was silent. The house was different. There was a big screen door to get out the back and I could see 'shadows' of people who I kept referring to as 'the villagers'. They'd been 'taken'. I could see blurry colours and faint outlines of people but nothing substantial. I found Mom and was glad I found someone. Then the house was something else and there were a few more people. Someone touched one of the shadows/white things and an egg appeared in the air. I grabbed the egg and a purple splotch came out. Later, I touched one and there was another purple splotch. I noticed a shadow that became more real looking. I came across it again later and I realised it looked like clothes I would wear and it 'came through again' and it looked like me but had a tiny, badly cut fringe. I said 'you're me' and she said yeah but that she'd taken liberties during 'editing'. She couldn't be seen by everyone yet though."
"4046"	"(2014-04-21 (23)) I was at university having a meeting giving feedback about Genetic Engineering. Ms Foucault was hosting. There were only a dozen or so people and we were sitting on the floor. Everyone said there should be questions and learning objectives. Then I was in a study area thing. There were lots of long desks (2 chairs per long side and 1 on the ends). Stephen Merchant was there and did the 'boobs' calculator thing. I started laughing and couldn't stop and was like 'I'm studying genetic engineering right now and I'm laughing over 'boobs''. Later, I was in an office. It was dark outside, but was apparently morning. It was dirty -- there were lots of crumbs etc. The owner was complaining and asked where the cleaner was. Their assistant tried calling them and the owner went into the cleaning closet. They came back out and then the cleaner came out of the closet -- she was Hispanic and old-ish and I thought 'there's a stereotype'. She started cleaning and we realised she was blind. We were all kind of fascinated by this. The room we were in was like a waiting room with lounges and a coffee table. Later, Stephen Merchant came back and we were having sex on the lounge. He was on top of me and I came and he checked that I was done and then he kept going until he came [this 'followed through' IRL] ."
"4047"	"(2014-04-28 (23)) I was at home, but it was different and I think I lived with Dad. Something went wrong with the lock on the front door and it wasn't locking. It had been like that overnight but I'd only just realised. I said we had to get it fixed straight away because I was working tomorrow and wasn't going to leave it like that. We called over a lock dude. He was young (about my age) and chubby, but average looks. I was doing all the talking for some reason and taking care of it. He said he could do some today and come back in the morning to finish it (it had to 'set' or something). He was sort of flirting with me (though I wasn't sure if he was) and then he asked me out. I said no and he was just like ok and left (I was polite and he seemed ok, though hurt). The next day he came back and I'd written on my calendar two lines from the exchange and he was near the calendar and I thought 'feck, I don't want him to see that'. He didn't seem to notice (though I think he was pretending to not have seen it). I was paying with Dad's card and was at the computer/ATM thing with the guy. I needed Dad's account number and pin, so I called him to ask for it. He said his pin was like 1420 but it started breaking up and I couldn't hear him. I think I went to look for him and it turned out he'd been killed by the lock guy. I was like 'why did you kill him?!' and he said he thought it would convince me to go out with him and I was like 'you killed my Dad because you thought it'd make me go out with you?'. I then wondered if he'd read something of mine where I'd said I thought serial killers [in films] were hot. He did seem more attractive though. I ran away and he followed - but didn't seem like he was going to hurt me, he just seemed sad. It was dark outside now and I ran back to the house and turned on the light in the lounge room (it was like Dad's old house now), but it flickered and didn't come on. I tried turning on the other lights and nothing happened. I then thought it must be a dream, so I started shouting 'Turn on!' over and over and the light started getting brighter and then they were on. But then I 'woke up' within the dream and was telling Mom about the weird dream I just had where 'this guy was flirting with me and then killed Dad to make me go out with him'."
"4048"	"(2014-04-30 (23)) Portal had alternate endings. It didn't actually matter what you did, it would just give you a random ending. It showed up on a blackboard like in Antichamber which endings you'd seen. For one, the lab was on a spaceship. After Chell broke free, the engines/gravity thing were turned off and it began falling to Earth and would take 30 seconds. Then she woke up in bed and was young (maybe 12-ish). She had two sisters and a brother. She was trying to work out if this was a dream or if Portal had been a dream. People kept showing up in blue and orange clothes (sometimes it would be a person wearing both colours, other times it would be two people together). Then I was her and I'd recently watched Wishmaster 3 and 4, though it wasn't actually the Wishmaster films. Each sister was scared by a different film. I told them I'd recently watched them and one remembered a naked guy in her 'scary' one and I said it was the third one. In the third one, some weird stuff had happened and this naked guy ended up with this 'frozen' bit of jizz in the shape of a plate and was riding on it over a waterfall. Then I was at university, doing a film course. I had to do accounting and economics as 'essential electives'. After accounting, I was sitting with some friends. A guy came up to me and started talking to me saying his name was Kenneth (?) and had sat next to me in accounting. I was like 'yeah, whatever' and didn't even look up at him, though I didn't remember who had been sitting next to me. He was apparently flirting. He stayed friendly even though I ignored him and then left. My friends Facebooked him and he was 17 and Turkish. They said ""he didn't look 17!"" and I said ""yeah, and I'm not a pedophile"". There was also a movie which may have been Clerks 3, but it also kind of wasn't (didn't really follow any continuity except for Dante and Rosario Dawson's character being together). She had a nose piercing (between nostrils, like a bull) and was really scruffy looking. There was this whole story about Dante's childhood crush and best friend, whose name I've forgotten, but she moved away during early adulthood and drifted apart. She returned and so did his feelings. She obviously liked him too. At the end he was being sad in his room and sort of crying and she turned up at the window and said ""I love you"" and he said ""I love you too"" and I can't remember what happened next. Then it showed this 'after the credits' thing where it showed Kevin Smith revealing carvings on a floor that had 'his name <3 her name' and dated like 30 years ago or whatever and it'd been based on a true story."
"4049"	"(2014-05-02 (23)) I was at home, alone, late at night. There was a party going on next door, but it was weird. People kept turning up out the front trying to get in, or going out the back. Most realised it was the wrong house and went next door. One group of people tried to break in, even after they saw me. Then there was a guy - either we were sort of friends, or he had just come to help - trying to help keep them out. There were some lollies and chocolates - it was Halloween I think - and we'd been eating some of them. I noticed this snake and large centipede thing coming out of a cupboard. I dropped a bag of M&M's and they split open to reveal bugs inside. There were bugs in all of them and we were trying not to be sick. I text Mom at some point saying someone was trying to get in. Later I heard someone coming through the front door, so I grabbed a baseball bat and turned the corner and whacked the person on the head - but it was Darren, as they had come home as soon as they got my text."
"4050"	"(2014-05-03 (23)) In the audience for Stephen Colbert, but it was like a stand up thing. I think I knew him or worked there. He called me up on stage for something and I was wearing patoonkis. I sat on the stage like |_'- (or whatever you call that). He was doing some long quiz thing - he handed it out to everyone, including me, and we had to fill it out. It had random questions and basically wanted you to give funny answers but I couldn't think of any. I had recently started going out with this guy called Jeb? He wasn't really typical of my type, but he was decently attractive. There was an Asian restaurant thing that was only open for breakfast. It opened at 4am-9.30am I think. I was there at 5am one morning because I couldn't sleep. I was there with Mom, but then I was there with Jeb and maybe others. When I finished my food, I cleaned up my table (I think it was a recommended thing to do) and one of the ladies working there commented that everyone had cleaned their tables and saved them a lot of work. At some point, I hadn't seen Jeb for a while and was getting worried that he was bored with me. He worked with/knew Colbert, and I mentioned this to him and he talked to Jeb for me. Apparently he had just been busy and was also having trouble 'restraining' himself from going further and I was like 'I don't mind if he doesn't'. I met up with him later and we were in a store, going up an escalator."
"4051"	"(2014-05-14 (23)) I went to see Grayson, whose office was at Westland University. I went past his office and he wasn't in there so I kept walking but turned back and then he was. He looked completely different and I was thinking that I didn't remember him looking like that. He had very short brown hair. I knocked on the door and wasn't sure if he heard me so knocked again as he looked over from his chair (his desk facing outward). I said I wanted to get another work shirt and he said there was a special on to get 2 for cheaper so I said ok. He asked my name and I said 'Izzy Conell' and he didn't seem to recognise the name at all and I thought that was weird. He said ""are you sure you're a medium?"" and I said I'd try on the shirt just to make sure (I wondered why he assumed medium). I took it and went to find a toilet to change in. I was walking really slowly and had trouble moving. When I went back he asked a question like 'if Jesus said he was going to come back in 4 days and [something that I misheard as 'because the world was ending'] would you keep working?' and I was confused and said if there was work to be done, I'd do it. He wrote something down and then I left. I was telling someone about it a while later and they said he'd been asking it to everyone and the question was actually 'if Jesus said he was going to come back in 4 days and give everyone millions of dollars..'. No-one understood why he was asking."
"4052"	"(2014-05-17 (23)) Portal 2 had a bunch of randomized endings. You had to 'roll' for them and each one had either a good one or bad one (eg, in one version you'd die, in another you'd live). I can't remember it very well, but the one I got (it was all text btw) had something to do with Wheatley's insides? I think his insides were getting put into something else and I was thinking 'I wouldn't mind Wheatley's insides, what the hell am I thinking?'."
"4053"	"(2014-05-17 (23)) We were at home, though it sometimes wasn't. Layla said she needed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (book) for something for school. Granma gave her Alice in Wonderland and she was like wtf and I took it and gave her my copy of Cuckoo's Nest. Then she said the thing she was doing was about courage or something and I gave her the Alice in Wonderland book for her friend. Later, I think we were at Nana's. Mom and Dad were both there. Nana gave me some McDonald's and said 'hopefully it's still warm' and I said 'when did you get it' and she said 'yesterday' [she had heated it up] . There was a 'graduation' for the year 12's of my year going on in one room but I didn't want to join them."
"4054"	"(2014-05-19 (23)) Brienne (Game of Thrones) was being forced to work at the gallows? She didn't like it though. It was at a castle which I didn't recognise and I was there too. Jaime came on a horse and had a fight with Cersei and then left angrily on his horse. Had to wait for gates to open and then took off. I was later at an outside area, which was undercover, next to a river thing. Restaurants etc. I was sitting at a bench next to the river doing something. I had my laptop with me as well. This lady told me that they had better Wifi on this side and that between certain hours you could download as much as you wanted. I was like ok, but she kept hassling me. Eventually I left with two friends of mine and got in a car (who sat in the front), and we picked up two strangers (a couple) as well (who we had met briefly, but didn't know). We drove for some time and were going through some country road with mountains and stuff. The wifi and car began to sputter and the driver said to lock our doors (apparently this was a 'common-ish' happening. People using EMPs to stop cars and then mugging the people [EMP thing possibly reference to Godzilla which I saw the other day] ). I realised the two strangers hadn't locked their doors and I thought it was suspicious but I leaned over and locked it, she unlocked it and I said to the driver that it was ""an inside job"" and he said ""I know"". I grabbed my laptop bag and another bag I had and when the car stopped I got out. Everyone else heaped their stuff into a pile for them to take and I started walking. They were like 'where do you think you're going? Put your stuff over there' and I said 'no'. The guy started coming towards me and told me to give it to him and I said ""I would rather kill you than give you my laptop"" and he pulled out a 'knife' but it was actually a plastic fork. He kept coming closer to me and I reached for it and snapped the top off (it wasn't a perfect fork btw, it was wide and had big forky bits). He just looked at me confused and I tried to stab him in with it but it barely did anything. He laughed and said you had to make more than a surface wound. So I sliced it down his arm and then started cutting into his face. Then I wrote 'I am 69' on across his forehead and on the top 'DOOM' and I think I wrote 'gay' on there. Kept cutting into him and stabbing him and then he was just bleeding from everywhere [I rewatched Scream last night, possible influence] . Then I was at a shop and it was about 6-ish and I bought this ice-cream which had a cool name like 'fluffy bunny' and it was round-ish. The guy from before was following me and he made a reference that it was a real bunny, so I took a big bite of it and made a 'so there' face. I pulled the bunny bit out of my mouth to check though and it was just like a little fluffy bunny toy. I thought it was a weird idea for an ice-cream, but it was soft and delicious. I kept walking and he was sometimes following. I found a Donut King and was looking at their donuts [yesterday I really wanted donuts] and the two girls behind the counter were talking ignoring me and then just turned it all off. Everywhere was closing. At the end of the store was a Big W and I saw Ben & Jerry's ice-creams but their lights were turned off and they were closing, so I walked back to leave. When I got back in my car, it was then like a 90s video game. I was driving and had people following (people who were angry about me killing this guy, because they didn't believe it was self-defence and they loved this guy for some reason) and were trying to stop me getting home. There was a map on the corner of the screen showing where I was and all the other dots for the other people (lots of them). The controls were annoying and it was hard to drive, also only had the four camera angles. I wasn't sure whether to drive home because they'd know where I lived, but as I drove I realised this game only had one location you could drive to. They kept trying to run me off the road. Then there were flashbacks to before I killed the guy; we had an AI called EDI [been playing Mass Effect 2] and she was talking to us in this room with a container thing in the middle with swirly light in it (my mind is a blank, like a 'core' or something). She seemed cautious about the guy, telling us in private, but then when he was present she 'jokingly' referred to him as 'Mr Doom' so I started calling him that. The core or whatever was unstable and the surrounding power started to glow and I yelled at EDI to fix it, calling her Wheatley at one point."
"4055"	"(2014-05-22 (23)) I was going out with Stephen Merchant, though he was younger. We went on a trip with Mom, Ezra and a friend of his. Everyone kept changing around though, sometimes Ezra's friend was a girlfriend, sometimes Steve was my girlfriend and sometimes Mom was 'her' mother. Anyway, I can't really remember where we were or why we were there. Mom made these muffins and she went off to do something and we were eating one each. I had a chocolate one and I said it was really dry. Ezra and his friend had a bag of weed and stuffed some into their mouths. They gave me and Steve a pinch and said it wouldn't really do anything and went off laughing. Steve and I looked at each other and were like *shrug* and ate it. We hadn't had sex yet but wanted to and planned to try and do it on this trip. We went off to the bedroom, but it was two bunks. Ezra and his friend were wrestling on one bunk. Steve and I kissed, but then next thing I knew, I woke up to Mom checking our hair and mouths crazily (looking for pot). I was on the floor and Steve on the bunk. My head felt weird and I just sort of looked around confused. Also, earlier there had been a 'pop-up' to choose between one thing or a free meth lab (think like Tropico 4), and I chose the meth lab because it was free. Steve, who was then not really Steve, was unemployed and poor etc. He was using the meth lab to try and get some money. There was a big bag of powder which he said he had 'found' and I was worried it had been stolen and people would try to get it back. Later, I was working somewhere on first shift with Esther and Hector. I had to park near the staff parking, which was underground and near a pool. I walked up and there were a bunch of photographers waiting for something. Esther and Hector were there and I joined them. We had to watch some announcement before we could go in. There was also this big ball that had been found on Mars and people had unravelled it (it was like metal strings) and it turned into a piano."
"4056"	"(2014-05-26 (23)) I had been out and came home at night. I pulled up in driveway in Mom's usual spot and then apparently fell asleep. I woke up some time later to Mom checking on me. I got out and was saying that it was pretty dangerous and stupid of me to fall asleep in my unlocked car, but then my bed was outside, next to the steps and this was normal. I got into bed and Mom was talking to me still. I briefly thought it was strange that I had my bed outside, but didn't think more of it. Ezra was there too. Three Hispanic looking guys walked past the house and up the driveway to the house behind us, looking at us through the side. We thought it was weird, so went inside. I was walking down the hall and then saw them running through the gate as Mom slammed the wood door shut. She said ""oh my god, one of them has a knife!"" They were banging and trying to get in. I went into my room and called the cops. I was speaking really calmly and I was worried they'd think I was lying."
"4057"	"(2014-05-26 (23)) I went to some nightclub thing. It was a bit strange though. It was near closing or past closing and we were still in there. There was me, Mom and Ezra. We went to the toilet and the doors were all closed, but they'd just been pushed to. Mom went into a cubicle and I went to the one next to it. Ezra decided to go to one as well. Then a lady who worked there came in and I put the lid down and stood on top of it because I thought she was dodgy. Mom made a noise, but the lady ignored it and went straight into my cubicle. I ran out. We all got back together somehow and I was saying that I'd read about something or other where it's a maze to get out of and they 'take' you. This place didn't look that difficult to get around so I wondered why this would be the place, but then the lights flickered and went out. I'm not sure what happened next but I was captured as well as a friend of Ezra's called Cody something. The people were saying that originally we were going to be paired together, but they swapped us around so that I would be with Stephen Merchant (who they had captured a few days before). I kept asking why we were paired up but no-one answered me. I was thinking 'well, I might die but at least I get to be with Stephen Merchant'. We got moved to some place where a whole bunch of us were crammed in and walking fast. Stephen Merchant was there and I was asking him what happened to us and where they were taking us but he said he didn't know (also, he looked a lot younger). Then were in a big cabin thing in the woods. There was a big room full of beds and lounges. We each had a bag of stuff and had to pick a bed. I waited for Steve to walk over to a bed, and he went with this soft one near the window in the back of the room. There was a paired-lounge across the wall. He put his bag on it and started taking stuff out when this guy put his bag on the bed and I said 'that's our bed' and he was like 'I was here first'. I jumped on the bed and said 'no, he just put his bag on the lounge which goes with this bed and we were already taking our stuff out so we were here first' and the guy begrudgingly left. I was still trying to work out why they needed us and why we were paired up with someone. Some theories were they were going to 'breed' something, sacrifice us, use us as food or combine us."
"4058"	"(2014-05-27 (23)) I went to the Prince Charles (though it was different and like outside). Stephen Merchant was standing outside for some event and I took a picture from far away. People were going up to him for photos and stuff and I wanted to go up but was deliberating because I was nervous."
"4059"	"(2014-05-29 (23)) The XFM shows were recorded at this place overlooking the ocean. It was a see-through booth, and I'd go every day and sit next to them and just stare at Steve. I think it was only Ricky and Steve there. I wasn't sure if they even knew I was there because they never acknowledged me, so then I wondered if I had actually been going there every day or if I just imagined it. Anyway, on this one particular day, Ricky left and Steve started talking to me about Die Hard. He said he hadn't seen Die Hard 2 and asked me what it was like (although in my mind, I was thinking of Scream 2). I said that I liked it, but the first one was better. I then realised they were still on air as well and I got nervous and didn't know how to speak (my voice was coming out really weird and monotone)."
"4060"	"(2014-05-29 (23)) I still lived at Dad's old place. I was home alone during the day and just messing about in my room. I heard this weird noise and got up to check but didn't see anything, so went back to my room. I heard it again and again, found nothing. The third time I heard it, I happened to peek into the laundry and saw a man coming through a cat door (we had a cat door in the laundry, but on the side next to where the freezer was, and one on the back door). He had tufts of curly grey hair. I started shouting 'what the hell do you think you're doing?' and he saw me and quickly backed out and ran off. I banged on the door, still shouting. I grabbed a phone and couldn't remember the number for the local police and then I was trying to decide whether I should just call emergency police in case he came back or if I should call Mom or Dad. I went back to the laundry to find him coming in again and I again, started shouting and he backed out and just stood there. I opened the door and tried to find something to scare him with, but picked up a piece of broken glass and slit his throat with it. He fell to the ground and died, blood everywhere. I dropped the glass and went inside. Then there was a knock on the door. There were two men claiming to be from a phone company, but they looked dodgy and had a van in the driveway with no markings. I told them to 'fuck off' and slammed the wood door. I called Mom and asked if she was home and could come round but she wasn't. I said ""I heard a noise and there was a man coming through the cat door in the laundry, so I slit his throat. There are two dodgy guys hanging around outside."" but she didn't seem to really care.  They started making their way out the back, so I went back to the laundry and grabbed the glass and slit another one's throat. Then suddenly the other guy fell back and I saw a guy standing near the shed, who'd thrown a knife at the guy. He said he was a vampire and would take care of the bodies. I was confused, but said ok and went back inside."
"4061"	"(2014-05-30 (23)) There were these big bubbles and I was filming Spaceman eating them in slow motion. They were thick bubbles, so it took a few seconds to burst. Then, it was Rover and he was trying to get this bug in the corner of this ledge up high. Suddenly, this bat grabbed his head and latched on. I was freaking out and poking it with a stick and trying to get it off."
"4062"	"(2014-06-05 (23)) I was having a dream within a dream. I was at a beachside type of centre, sitting at a table on a deck facing the beach. There was a bird 'humming' a song. Each time it finished, it would start again and the song would be slightly more 'complex'. Eventually it had lyrics etc. In the dream, they were very clear and I was thinking I had to write them down as soon as I woke up [but I forgot when I woke up] . It was only a short song, like a verse and a chorus. I 'woke up' at some point. There was a video of some teens at this old temple type of place and one fell through a 'window' onto this big statue and knocked it over. They were screaming and then he jumped up holding the head and they all laughed. Was back in London at my flat. It was different though and looked like our old place in Parkville. I was there temporarily to gather my stuff and they were letting me stay there for free. I could hear Kiersten and Lukas arguing in the room next door. There was a girl staying there and apparently didn't get along with Darnell. She was really weird and seemed to spy on everyone. She was subtly making fun of me and started singing some 'embarrassing' song I had been listening to and I just shrugged and said I liked it. Later, I was somewhere else. An Irish guy called Nils was talking to me and we were trying to work something out. Dmitri was there and I mentioned that I used to like him. He then asked me ""what is your Nils like?"" and I asked 'what?' and he repeated it but was speaking really fast and I couldn't understand what he was saying. On the third repeat I said ""what does that mean?"" and he said ""you know, the guy you're shagging?"" and I said ""he doesn't exist"" and he said ""really?"" and I said ""yes, now let's get back to this.."""
"4063"	"(2014-06-09 (23)) I was at home, though it occasionally flipped between looking like the old house, looking like it does and being slightly different. I had two sisters (one was Haley from Modern Family [been watching it lately] ). Ezra was there as well. We could hear some weird noises and looked outside to see these flying things whooshing about. I kept looking and one started coming towards us and it was a hot air balloon full of teenage girls. They pulled out their cameras when they saw me and I quickly went back inside and locked the door. They landed out the front and came up to the door trying to get my attention. I told everyone to ignore it and they would go away. Darren opened the door and said hello and chat to them briefly. One girl said they were looking for ""a down syndrome"" and I thought they must've been doing a checklist thing. Mom and Darren left to walk Rover at around 9/10pm. We had a big mattress in the living room (it now looked like the old place) and the sisters and I were sitting on it, talking. It got later and later and they still hadn't returned. We were starting to get worried and I questioned calling the police but didn't. Then it looked like home again and it had been hours and I decided to go for a quick drive around the block just to check on things. I started walking towards the door when I saw a light and car coming up the driveway and I said 'Or not, they're back!' and felt relieved. But then I looked out the window and saw that it was a white limousine. I was confused, but thought it was strange so went up the hallway to my room, turning off lights. I said 'this is the strangest night ever'. I tried peeking out my window but couldn't see anything, then I heard a scream. I went back out (and now it looked like the old place again) and Haley said that a guy had come around the back and looked through the kitchen window at them. We could hear him doing stuff around the back, trying the laundry door etc. I dialled 000 and the guy asked what I needed and I said 'police' and he asked if it was urgent and I said 'uh, well not really but kind of' and he said 'no, then?' and said he couldn't help me and I said 'but there's a guy trying to get into the house and my Mom has been gone for hours' and he said he would send links to my phone on what to do. I started panicking and could hear the guy fiddling with the laundry door. Then it was back home. I grabbed the big knife at some point and went back to my room. Oh, when we were at home, my sisters were lying in Mom's bed and Ezra was nowhere to be seen. I heard the front door open and I crept out and saw a man walking towards the back room. I snuck up behind him and stabbed him. I was shocked and didn't know what to do now, then Darren walked in the front door. He seemed battered and not really upset, just happy to be home (this wasn't regarded as suspicious, just thought he was oddly calm). I asked what happened and he said they'd been attacked. He said he'd been looking for Mom for hours but couldn't find her and that she was limping (he acted out the motion of dragging one foot) and it was harder before because she had twins - which I took as meaning she was with Rover. I was relieved they were ok, and thought we should go for a drive to find them when he said that Rover had been hurt by the people and taken off and he'd run after him, but he got hit by a truck. Then he looked distraught as he said he tried to help him, but it was too late. I started crying and howling and it got worse every time I thought of his puppy-like innocence. Not long after that, Mom turned up as well and then we were all crying, but then we were like 'let's go to bed'. By this point it was early hours of the morning and wasn't that dark outside. I couldn't sleep though."
"4064"	"(2014-06-18 (23)) Not sure what was going on properly, but I went back to London. I was with a group and we were split into two and given rooms. I wandered into one and someone said I'd picked the wrong one because the other room had a big comfy bed and this one had crappy bunks. Then, I was with Benjamin. We'd somehow been put into a group together and still hadn't spoken and were on friendly enough, but awkward terms. We had also slept together in the past. Our room was quite big and had a big fancy bed in the middle. We were lying on it and it was day time. I stared out the window and saw that Gherkin building and sighed. I wasn't sure what I was doing here, but was hoping that I'd be staying here this time. Benjamin and I were talking and giggling and it still felt weird, but a bit more comfortable. He was sitting up against the bedhead and I was sitting on the other side, with the blanket over my legs, but facing him. We kind of looked at each other at one point and he moved closer and started touching my leg. I fidgeted but let him and he got closer, moving his hand further up. I started to resist, but gave in and lay back and he got under the covers and on top of me and started kissing me."
"4065"	"(2014-06-28 (23)) I checked the Big Brother website and Marlon and Ash were both evicted in a double eviction. People were saying that half of a boy band had been evicted."
"4066"	"(2014-06-28 (23)) I looked outside and there were these weird dark grey clouds coming towards us. Tried to get the cats inside, but Gizmo and Sapphire were still outside somewhere. There were these moths and one grabbed Cuddles and lifted her up. I started whacking it and it died. They were a little larger than normal size moths, but they were strange."
"4067"	"(2014-06-29 (23)) I was watching Big Brother. Kim was on this platform thing and Chris was sitting below with sunglasses on. There were tons of other people around though and it was noisy. Chris said to someone that he ""likes her ass"" and she was like 'what? What did you say"" and he said ""I like your ass"" without flinching. She seemed shocked that he just outright said it [oddly, the episode the next day he said that he liked her ass] . Matthew had cerebral palsy and that explained all his weird twitches. He was always bleeding from his head/face and looked really sickly. Someone got me this flat thing in London. It was like a house, but in a group of them and it was only one storey and small. It felt empty. People were having a lunch party thing outside. I was checking the locks and they were all unlocked. I had to find the key to lock them. I was looking in the dishwasher when a lady came through my back door and I was confused because I thought I locked it and then I wondered if she had a key."
"4068"	"(2014-07-01 (23)) I was in London with a friend. Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais were doing some live show nearby that we were going to go buy tickets for. The place it was being held at was just around the corner. We went to a cafe and was looking at the different chocolate drinks when I saw Stephen Merchant walking into the store. I squee'd to my friend and tried to keep my cool. I picked a drink with Oreos and they made my friend's drink and then Stephen just held up a bag of bread and water bottles and handed the money over to the guy. It was really rude and I was a bit disappointed. I got my drink but it wasn't as nice as I expected. I walked around the corner I saw Stephen go around and he was at a door a fair way down but he turned and looked in my direction and I turned and went away."
"4069"	"(2014-07-05 (23)) I was still at university. I went to some chemistry based class and sat down. Marvin came in and saw me and then I was worried because I'd told him I wasn't studying anymore but then I couldn't remember who I'd said that to and I thought it was odd since he went to State University. I think there had been a zombie apocalypse thing. Some others and I were in this school building which was quite dark, but it was still early evening outside. We started going down into this store room thing when someone told us to get out. In the shadows were these maggot/worm looking things (they weren't solid, they were like a lighter part of the shadow) and they were called the Unsleep - the only thing that killed them was sunlight. We had left the door open and the shadow started pouring in with them in it, and we threw stuff and shone a torch on it but nothing happened. Then the clouds moved from the sun and the sun shone in and the whole shadow disappeared. I quickly shut the door, but one was left out. The sun had gone away though. Someone said we should leave now. We didn't really know where to go, because we didn't know where the Unsleep had already infected. We drove around looking for somewhere to go. I found a few 'weapons' that would kill the Unsleep, one needed pineapple juice and like nails or something. We already had a pineapple, so we were looking for other bits. Eventually we made one (it was like a gun), but then we found this military base type of thing which was all lit up with fake sunlight."
"4070"	"(2014-07-10 (23)) I went to the cinema that was at a shopping centre. I took my shoes off (as did most people) and when it finished I started walking back to my car when I realised I didn't have shoes on. I ran back and they had been cleaning the cinema. I asked someone there if they'd found any shoes and they said no. I went back to my row and couldn't see any shoes. I found a black pair of sneakers in another row that fit, so put those on, but then went back to my row and looked underneath my chair and found mine. I put them on and thought maybe I should get some black sneakers for work while I'm here but I wasn't sure where the shoe shop was. Somehow I ended up losing my shoes again and went looking for them. I had a dream about Big Brother and it involved Ashleigh, Helen and Mark (who was a director in the middle of making a big film) and I posted on Facebook instead of writing it in a note on my phone. Everything was shortened and the grammar was really bad and Dan Palmer liked it and some other people as well (Ashleigh's 'brother' for one). Later, we were parked in North Midvale carpark and I was in my car and Mom was in her car. It was dark and was creepy. I looked in Mom's window and she turned and had this like giant blue snake tongue and zombie like eyes and face. I ran back to my car and didn't know what to do."
"4071"	"(2014-07-16 (23)) I was at university (I don't know what I was studying or what university it was, just one I made up), and something had happened like a battle. I'm not sure exactly, but there were lists of all students who had been involved and 'killed an enemy'. Marvin also went to the school and we were sitting next to each other on computers in a computer lab. I found my name on the list and his name as well. He was sort of following me around at one point and sometimes I was following him [similar to at work] ; there was a small cement platform thing outside that had steps going up to it from all sides (it was kind of a pointless feature and not that big either) and we were standing on it. He just kept kind of tagging along behind me. After the computer labs, we finished up at the same time so I followed him out. I couldn't remember how to get out of the building anyway, so just kept following him but then he went to the toilet. I went into the girls' toilet so it wouldn't look awkward, but there was some kind of problem so I just left."
"4072"	"(2014-07-16 (23)) I was at home and it was like the end of the world or something. I was pregnant and my boyfriend/husband was with me. I got hurt somehow and I was sitting on the grass dragging myself to the car. I got to the top of the drive way and then it was just me. I was making my way back to the house when some people came through the gate with guns. They wanted to come in and I refused. A guy pointed a gun at me but I didn't back down. Then my 'brother' was a friend of his and my brother had like taken off to the streets years before, but he told the guy to back off and they got into a fight. I went inside and ran to my room and called the police. I was whispering and saying there were people outside with guns, but an automatic message thing kept saying that I was speaking too quietly."
"4073"	"(2014-07-21 (23)) I had this pet lion and flew to Malaysia with it for some reason. Aunt Sally and co also had something to do with it. I was with the boys, but I only remember Nathaniel specifically, and she was coming on another flight. I had to give the lion up to a zoo or something and I can't remember what happened, but it was then a film and at the end it showed the main character and a 'baby lion' (which was actually a fluffy Labrador) on a lounge."
"4074"	"(2014-07-21 (23)) I was at the old house, sitting in the living room. It was night and there were people outside. I was a serial killer or something, so just calmly sat as they tried to get inside. I walked into the kitchen and took a sharp knife, putting it into my pocket and sitting back down. I text Mom and said 'come', but I thought that they might have her phone so I didn't say any more than that. Then I was in another country. There were these aliens who were taking over countries or cities, taking people and killing the rest. I'd come across them a few times. I was in the street (it was night) and there were lots of them marching around, doing their thing. I ducked in and out and around, trying to find something. There was a pile of bricks that I was hitting and they were falling apart like Minecraft blocks and I was taking the things that fell out. I needed to find certain coloured bricks to make this weapon. I ended up in a building where the 'leader' was and she was like 'you again'. She made no effort to do anything to me and basically said that she liked having me around. She warned me that they were blowing the place up and showed me the way out."
"4075"	"(2014-07-22 (23)) I was watching Big Brother and someone had written some stuff on a piece of paper and it was in the corner of the screen but I saw it had Stalled written on it. I was thinking of posting it on the Facebook group, but decided against it. I somehow came across a video of supposedly Dan Palmer, but the guy in it didn't look like him. He also had piercings and lots of jewellery and I was grossed out and trying to work out if it was actually him. When he spoke, it sounded like him but I couldn't work it out. I was annoyed that he wasn't as perfect as I thought."
"4076"	"(2014-07-23 (23)) I was at a shopping centre after hours and there were a few others around. I was under the impression that we were all spending the night. Later, there were people after 'X-Ray' who was Dexter Koh and I remember running up this staircase after him and he ran off (I think we were friendly)."
"4077"	"(2014-07-23 (23)) Work was slow, so I had taken up odd jobs at a place I used to work for/have some affiliation with. When I got there I saw GBCS people and I was like 'oh, stocktake!'. There were about 10-15 people. I saw Esther and she called me Hugo, before realising her mistake. I told her I didn't even know this job was available and that I hadn't gotten any emails for ages. She said she'd talk to someone about it and gave me this weird hug."
"4078"	"(2014-07-23 (23)) There was a movie or video game with zombies that I'd used to somehow accidentally create zombies. I was filming a film using the real zombies as the zombies. There was a small room with shelves of DVDs and food and stuff and we had to get people from both ends to push so they'd come together, but we were having trouble getting it to fall properly. Then a group of zombies were coming near the door, so I tried to close the door but the wood door didn't even fit and close. I shut the other one, but they were already on it. Lots of little baby ones at the door too. We just ran and eventually got to a car. Outside this building there were military people and stuff."
"4079"	"(2014-07-24 (23)) I woke up to discover that Steven got evicted, but Big Brother pulled a twist so that he stayed in and someone else would get evicted instead. I was fuming."
"4080"	"(2014-07-25 (23)) I was at a shopping centre with Mom and there was a rack of stuff that I somehow noticed was infected. I put some stuff on it to stop it and we left. Then I wondered if it would actually stop it and if there was infection anywhere else. We went back in for some reason. I went to the toilet and locked a cubicle. Not long after I'd sat down, I saw two hands come down under the door and then a zombie girl suddenly came at me from under the door. It was really fast and scared the hell out of me [IRL too, my heart was pounding when I woke up] . Her face was quite graphic, a white eye and rotting flesh. The only thing I had as a weapon was this thing that was like a giant straw. I stabbed her in the face when she came through again, I put my foot on her face to pull it out. I heard other zombies in the toilet, so I readied myself and opened the door and started stabbing them. I ended up in the male toilets and there were some other people still alive in there. They had forks and I was annoyed that I didn't have a fork. We got to the main part of the shop and found some other weapons. There weren't that many zombies around here. While I was looking for a weapon in a corner of the storeroom, one of the women with us started bending over weirdly and she suddenly turned and went at me. I started whacking her but couldn't stab through for some reason. One of my friends killed her. Someone suggested this was like a judgement day scenario thing, where the bad people turned into zombies and the good guys were ok."
"4081"	"(2014-08-01 (23)) I was at home, but I think it was a new place. It was quite big. I wanted to get some kind of woodwork station set up and Poppa bought these bits of wood for me and was going to set it up in this outside area that we owned. But apparently the surrounding areas were dangerous and meant stuff might gets stolen. Then I was in a video game. I was playing with two others on my team. It was like an RPG. I think Ezra was one of the people I was with and we both had a little bit of armour but the other guy didn't. We did one mission (and it was set up so like one of us was in danger and we had to rescue them) and the second mission had these logs over pits, so if you stood on them in the wrong position, you'd fall. Both of them were tied up; one on this thing in the middle and the other on this wall at the back. I started walking towards him and then noticed there was a snake along the length of the wall. Someone said it'd seen me and I looked back to see it looking at me and I tried walking slowly away but it started moving and I started hitting escape and nothing was happening, so I alt+f4'd and got out of the game. I tried again, this time moving slowly but it saw me and I got out of it again. We didn't know what to do. We got back in and I paused, but now the scene was like a fair and I walked around it and I saw the snake come out of a toy grabber machine and wrap itself around a mother and squeeze her and kill her. I deliberated between going back and owning up to it, or just leaving. I started walking back to see what was happening but I saw it slithering out and around my corner, so I pressed alt+f4 and left and told the other guys I was giving up because it was too dangerous."
"4082"	"(2014-08-05 (23)) Mom and I went for a drive and went to the roundabout on Camberwell, but it was like all white in front (like there was nothing there), the houses nearby were sort of misty and see-through and we decided to go another way. We thought maybe it was like the end and the whiteness was taking everything and we were concerned about going back home, but when we went back the white was receding and it was just a light mist left."
"4083"	"(2014-08-06 (23)) Was at the old house and playing some weird, old video game. I think it was related to Half Life, and I finished the first one and didn't really like it. I started the second one and then realised it was 5pm and I was late for work. I started to leave, but then went and ate all these chips like Burger Rings and Cheetos and then dinner and when I eventually left it seemed to take ages for me to get anywhere. I got stuck somewhere and started crying that I was going to be late. I was in a bathroom but lots of people were there and I told them to leave. I'd realised I got my period but took the pad I had off by mistake and didn't have another one. I also didn't have a bra on but people came back in and I needed to find somewhere to put it on. I kept trying to text Hector to say I was going to be late, but I never got around to it."
"4084"	"(2014-08-06 (23)) I was at home and there was like a small party or something and Chris (Big Brother) was there. About 5 people were in the back room and one by one they gave Chris a hug because he was crying. I stepped down and put my hand on his back and he turned around and hugged me and I hugged him back (though my left hand got stuck between us). I said ""it's ok, she's a cow"" and he laughed and said ""I know"". The hug kept going but he didn't seem to want to get out of it and he said 'is there a reason this hug is so long' and I said 'no'. Eventually we pulled apart and I went to do something. Mom told me she was inviting some people over for dinner and I said I wasn't coming for it and she said 'but it's for you' and I said that I didn't care, I wasn't interested."
"4085"	"(2014-08-09 (23)) I was somewhere with a bunch of people, including some people from Big Brother. Steven was talking about something to the others and I said 'feck off, shut up' and it went silent and he was like 'no swearing kiddies. Awkward'. I walked off, trying not to laugh and stood next to a wall. Ashleigh came and stood by me and was talking to me. Kim was behind me and it was early on in the series when they were still friends. We were joking about 'stroking peanut butter' and laughing and then Chris came up and I said 'we're just talking about stroking peanut butter' and he was like 'ok' and we all started laughing. There was another 'eviction' coming up and we had to decide whether Winston stayed evicted or another person and I was really annoyed. They also showed some clips from the past including this task, which I had liked, which involved a huge tree and Pauline dressed as some kind of green witch fairy thing. She had two rings on one hand, on the middle and ring finger which had a square emerald type of thing in them. At some point I thought I was dreaming and was making people appear. I started saying it out loud when I saw Stephen Merchant, in a suit and with shorter hair, walk around the corner, look at me and then go into a toilet cubicle. I walked over and deliberated about going in, but peeked into the cubicle and saw him standing there and went in. He locked the door and immediately started kissing me. That progressed to us having sex, with me up against the wall and my legs around him. It was really intense and I could feel it all. At one point someone looked over the cubicle and was trying to put post-it notes around and I told them to get lost. I woke up during the 'end' of it."
"4086"	"(2014-08-16 (23)) It was like a film and there were lots of landscape shots and was generally just nice looking. I think it was on another planet/in the future (at one point someone said they were 254 years ahead of us technology wise) and there were trains that went around the whole world. It was just two tracks going each way in a loop, stopping at stations. They were super fast as well. Anyway, they had a limit of 50 people per train and there were 5 carriages (they had a specific name but can't remember). If someone got off, someone had to get on or it wouldn't go."
"4087"	"(2014-08-16 (23)) A group of vampire type people had taken over one of the carriages and blocked out the sun and just kept to themselves (there were quite a few of them in there and I think they'd either eaten or gotten rid of the people in the other carriages). They could go in the sun but would feel sick and blinded and would eventually just like throw up and die. They would get out of the train at night, usually at public toilets to find people to eat (lots of toilet stops presumably because there were no toilets on the train). Two guy friends were at this toilet when the train stopped there. It was hinted at that one of the vampires had died and they needed a replacement. They weren't really bad guys, but they did need to consume blood regularly. One of the vampire guys got off and 'infected' one of the guys (can't remember how it was passed). The guy ran off with his friend though. Whilst the vampire was looking for him, the guy accidentally infected his friend (they didn't know at that point though). The sun came up and the guy was outside but for him it looked like a desert and the sun was bright and hot and he was feeling sick. The train was nearby and the vampire guy told him to get in or he'd die and he went with him and got on the train. When he felt better he refused to go anywhere else without his friend. He found him eventually and realised he was infected and dying. He told him to get on but his friend refused, so he grabbed him and took him on to the train. It screeched to a halt and a warning saying the passenger limit was overloaded started going off (which would call in authorities if left too long) and the friend jumped back off and said 'it's too dangerous, just leave me' and the train started up and he tearfully watched his friend as it moved on."
"4088"	"(2014-08-18 (23)) There were zombies. They were fast and dangerous and had been around for a while. I ended up at this building, which was possibly a big school/college and realised there were people there, but they were bad. I heard them coming and quickly hid under this table. A zombie came in growling and I was trying to remember whether they sensed by smell or hearing, but a person came and took it away (it was like a 'pet'). I was sneaking around for some reason or another, but eventually they saw me and started going after me and shooting at me. I was running and climbing over fences and got back inside the building and ended up in this large gym area. There were lots of bits of furniture around (like bookshelves and such) and shelves along the top. I climbed up so that I was up high away from the zombies that began to pile in. A few people got bit and then I had a friend with me and we managed to climb down and sneak out and I pulled them into the toilet that was just next door. The door didn't close properly so I got her to sit against it and keep it closed. I found a button or something and pressed it and it flooded the place with water. Some bits of water leaked into the toilet, but it didn't flood. When it had finished, we got out and climbed along pipes and such to get out. Outside was all flooded as well - the streets were filled with cars and the water came up about halfway, there were also lots of hills and such to walk on. There were still plenty of zombies around and lots of animals. I remember seeing two animals running past us. We wondered what to do next."
"4089"	"(2014-08-22 (23)) I went to this library that was quite far from home and I'd taken the bus there. Marvin was there and it was fairly busy. I went to the counter and asked if I needed to register to loan books and they said yes and told me to go in to get started. I sat down next to these people and Marvin sat next to me. We talked a bit, but mostly just sort of hovered near each other. I was walking around and went to the front of the library and saw a Goosebumps book I'd never heard of. I found more and they were from different 'series' of the books, before and after I had read them as a kid and that's why I'd never read them. I was excited about finding new books and wanted to read them but wondered if it would be the same to read them now."
"4090"	"(2014-08-23 (23)) I was watching Big Brother 2012 and at the beginning Scott and Sara were chosen to pretend to be a couple. They obviously failed the task and were talking about it on the final show [watched the final last night] ."
"4091"	"(2014-08-24 (23)) I was at my first job as a trainee supervisor. It was a supermarket. Niles was there too and I saw his checklist of stuff was completely filled out and I only had two things checked. I was annoyed that he'd done it before me. I was then at home and Mom and Darren were planning on buying this house across the road from Rochester Circle. It was old and falling apart and small. I was complaining and said I didn't want to move. Our house was the same, but we had an attic and the yard was massive. Mom and I went for a walk in the backyard - which went alongside the road and the fence wasn't totally closed off - and there were all these sheds and things falling apart and rotten."
"4092"	"(2014-08-25 (23)) I was at home - though it was different and I lived with Dad and Ezra. We were in the lounge room watching TV and sleeping out there. I can't remember exactly what happened, but I think a sniper shot through the window at us. We had some kind of idea who it was, but I don't know why or who. I ran out into the bushes outside (it was a house in the middle of the bush, though it was still sort of local). People were chasing me and I kept running and was running over buildings and stuff. They almost caught me a few times, but I kept escaping. I ended up at this factory thing, I think it was for ice-cream or something, but it had been abandoned for years. When I went in though, it was still running which I thought was odd. I think I was then with someone else and we were trying to hide from the people and escape the building. We eventually left through the front door and there was a group of people outside. Then we ended up in this neighbourhood and broke into a house. I can't remember why we were in there and I think we were hiding from people in the house, but then it was just us two. Outside a kid and an older guy approached the house and were looking through the windows and apparently had seen us. I crept around to the back and left through a window. I climbed up this hill behind it and crept along the fence. They were walking away and I walked onto the road behind them but they saw me and then I thought that was stupid. I asked where the train station was and they pointed and I acted grateful and like nothing was up. I met up with my friend and we got on the train. The kid and the guy had followed us and sat on the opposite side of the train. I think they questioned us about what we were doing there and I said I was their niece (the wife was called Olive, can't remember the husband). Then we had actually met up with them at the house, but we were involved in something dodgy and I think there was some orgy or something, so they hadn't answered the door when the kid was there. They called the people and they confirmed that they knew us, but they still seemed suspicious. I was trying to work out what my next disguise would be and I chose a green wig, which I had worn before and had a fondness for."
"4093"	"(2014-08-27 (23)) I was at my first job as a trainee supervisor and it was supposed to just be me and Esther on the early shift. However, when I arrived (it was at Hillary's btw and was different), Niles and Sergio were there. At one point Esther said something about me not eating pork and when she said it again later I asked her why and she said that Niles had told her I didn't eat pork. I was annoyed that he was spreading rumours about me."
"4094"	"(2014-09-02 (23)) The beginning was a little hazy, but I was involved in a plane crash (it didn't take off and explode or anything, everyone survived) and befriended some guy while waiting around. We'd been friends for a bit, when we were involved in another similar plane crash and I forgot most of our friendship (aside from the fact that we were friends). He also claimed to be in love with me and seemed slightly obsessed and I think we slept together occasionally. He was ok looking, but wore a thumb ring and another ring on his left hand. We were also regulars at this 'fancy' restaurant/club type of thing and I had a dress just for going there because you had to dress up to get in. I loved going there for some reason and really wanted to go tonight. We went there and sat at the table and it was very purple inside and our table was up a couple of steps on this raised platform. There was a stage where we first came in, but the curtain was closed. The menu was cheap looking and hardly had any options, all really standard stuff like steak. I was really flirty and giggly for some reason and I tapped him on the head with my menu. His hair went out of place a little bit and he got annoyed. There was a mirror behind me, so he fixed it up a little and I was giggling at him and he said 'how would you like it if I ruffled your hair?' and I said 'you can ruffle my hair tonight, if you want' and he looked at me like he was going to jump across the table and rip my clothes off and I giggled and felt slightly embarrassed and said out loud that I didn't know why I was acting that way. Later I was at Granma's house (which was different). She had quit smoking, but Mom was smoking out the back and she asked for cigarette. She had to hide it from Uncle Gabriel, who was out for the time being. After she'd taken a couple of puffs, her face looked really old and wrinkly (almost comically). She also had a dog which had had puppies a while ago, but the puppies had been given away and the dog was locked in a lounge room. She let me in to see the dog and I gave it a pat and said 'good boy', but then realised she'd had puppies, so had to be a girl. I went to leave but the door was now just a block of black wood. It had been door sized before, but was now about 2 inches wide and I didn't know how to use it I kept messing about with it and it turned into a cloth. I went to Granma and said I couldn't work the door out and the dog ran outside. She came in and grabbed the wood, which was suddenly bigger and it had folded up 3 times over, so she expanded it out and put it in place. I said I didn't see that. Later, I was at home, which was the old house except Mom lived there. The guy friend from before and I were sitting out the back talking. Mom came out and saw him and said 'hello... little guy'. I said it was my friend from the plane crash, and she said she was wondering how she didn't know him. We came inside and I lay down in the games room md he sat in the living room. We were talking over the wall about random stuff and then Mom came to the kitchen to make lunch. She said she was going to make pumpkin soup and I said 'noooo'. She didn't offer an alternative and was basically like 'deal with it'. I sulked back to the games room. She asked why I was in there when my friend was in the other room and I said I felt like laying on the floor and he wanted to sit in a chair. She made an awkward romantic/sex joke and there was a pause and then I said 'don't be creepy'. I could tell that we were both sort of thinking 'we're already having sex', but I wasn't going to let her know that."
"4095"	"(2014-09-02 (23)) I went to my first job with my supervisor shirt and it was for a company that made shampoo made from poo. It was in little test tube things and was like round bunny port but smaller. On the ingredients thing it mid it had something to do with dragons and some exotic creature. Apparently it smelled like poo and didn't clean that well but it was popular. It was the only thing they sold. There were quite a few people on the job and they were all supervisors. Hector and Esther were there. Esther told everyone to mark their names off the job sheet, so I did. Niles turned up and had a supervisor shirt on as well and I was really annoyed, thinking 'this was supposed to be my thing!'. I had a jacket on, so I thought at least when I took that off it'd rub it in his face too [note: This actually came true; I turned up with my supervisor shirt on, feeling smug about it when Niles turned up in a supervisor shirt too] ."
"4096"	"(2014-09-05 (23)) I was supervising my first job which was a massive banquet thing. I don't remember seeing anything to actually scan, it seemed like I was just sorting out where people were sitting, and I was rushing about trying to get everything done. People (all stocktakers) were showing up and I was showing them to their assigned tables. Niles turned up and whenever he had his back turned I was making faces. He was at the dessert table and I showed him to it. Some time later he came up to me and said that he'd been talking to this like human resources person called Vicki Station saying that I stared at him 'nastily', made him feel uncomfortable and excluded him from the group and I was like wtf. I went past the tables and into this other room where there were people scanning around the perimeter and told them to download when they finished the walls. I went to find Esther and started talking to someone who'd just come out the shower with the same colour hair, and then she put her head up and it wasn't Esther so I said ""... you're not Esther"" and continued looking for her. I found her in a little office and told her what Niles had said. I said I didn't have a clue what he was on about because I treated him just like everyone else. I was wondering if my hatred for him was actually apparent, but I thought I was polite enough to him in the flesh. Esther wasn't sure what to do either. I had a name card on a table too and it was one spot away from Benjamin, but I thought he wouldn't make it because he's on holiday [he's on holiday at the moment] , but then I saw him over the other side. The card next to mine on the other side said ""Morisey"" and I held it up to some people nearby and said ""Is Morrisey sitting next to me?"" and we joked about it. Later, at either another job or another thing, Sergio and Niles were doing the assigning and I went up to them and Sergio asked what I wanted and I said 'desserts table' and he said 'I'll put you on cigars' and I said, calmly but firmly that I didn't know anything about cigars and it'd probably be better suited to someone who could contribute to the conversation, whereas I know I can enjoy dessert and bring something to the table. He, seemingly, reluctantly put me down for desserts. I was worried they'd change it when I left."
"4097"	"(2014-09-23 (23)) I was at home, which was the old house. I was home alone and Slater came over, crazed and looking for Mom. He was trying to get in the front door and I was yelling at him to go away and trying to get a hold of someone. He went out the back and there was a problem with the back door so it wouldn't lock. Somehow, it sorted itself out and he got 'caught' or whatever. I was sitting at a desk relaxing and suddenly he shouted 'RA!' really loudly in my ear [it caused me to wake up IRL, cringing in fear and my heart was pounding] ."
"4098"	"(2014-10-01 (23)) I was dating Sam from Big Brother. We owned some kind of company/factory thing. It was a weird house building thing, with lots of windows around the outside. It was quite messy. He'd had shaggy hair and had a haircut so it was tidier and shorter, but I preferred his old haircut."
"4099"	"(2014-10-02 (23)) I was working somewhere and Hugo was working near me. He said that I shouldn't wear the same pants because they smelled. I was a bit shocked and I said 'I have no sense of smell' and he said 'yeah I know, but we can'. I was shocked at how forward he was (and he didn't seem fazed one bit about saying anything) and I was a bit hurt. I was also wearing clean pants so I didn't get it."
"4100"	"(2014-10-08 (23)) Mom and Darren had bought a new place, but it was like a caravan and had no rooms. 'Bedrooms' were now a bed in a box, as in, a small walled up part of it had a bed inside (just a bed) and drawers were on the outside for clothes. I said I'd rather kill myself than not have a bedroom, saying that if there was no room for a desk then it wasn't worth it. I was wandering around outside at some point and there was a fluffy grey cat on some stairs. I walked past it and then it jumped up at me from behind and started strangling me. I managed to get it off and ran back inside."
"4101"	"(2014-10-09 (23)) I was to be stocktaking Northtown McDonald's (still in the old place) at 9.30 this morning and I woke up and it was 9.30, but then I remembered my start time had been changed to 10.30. I had done this store before and it was always just me that did it [note: we do not stocktake fast food stores] . For some reason I still got there at 9.30 and they said they couldn't actually get started until 10.30 because of something that needed to be counted with a member of staff. I left and did something for a bit and came back. The parking was split up into how long you could park there for (right outside was 1 minute, around the back it was like 8 days but it was in blocks and it had to be either multiple vehicles or a big vehicle to fit all the blocks [as if it were a video game] , but I managed to convince a guy to let me park). The stocktaking at McDonald's was super secret, I had a notebook there with my name on it which had all the stocktaking info from previous ones (the earliest date was 2010). Since it was still too early, the manager guy took me around to where there were like units. It was like a university/school and one side of the building were little units (all one storey). Mine was next to his. At some point I was doing some quiz with a heap of other people, writing down answers in this book. I was wearing a Le Samourai shirt. The questions were all about films and I was answering them all easily. Two guys next to me called out and asked if they could look at my answers and I shooed them away. It was because I only had a few answers left and was rewriting them into another book (which I was going to hand over to them) and I wanted to do it in peace. They were 'teasing' me for not giving them the answers but when I finished I said 'I was going to give you the answers, I just wanted to finish it'. One of them had dark hair, the other blonde - the blonde one was chubby and more attractive, the dark hair was average build, slightly above average height and meh looking. He took an interest in me for some reason and started following me around. He followed me to the unit thing and I let him in. The manager guy came back and into his unit and I told him to be quiet because he listens. Then the manager guy knocked and I told the guy to hide, so he went into the cupboard. Manager guy said they were ready for me now and I said I'd just get my things. I closed the door and told the guy to leave after me and to leave the key somewhere. I walked out and knocked on the manager guy's door, but the guy left my room already and started walking down the other way. I distracted the manager guy for a bit with the notebook and then left. At some point later, something happened and people started going crazy. It apparently was similar to The Signal, where a transmission was setting them off and they would gradually go crazy. It also seemed that being in large groups was an issue as well. We were in a small group (including the guy from before) and had been ok so far (it was some time later now). One of the group began to 'hear' the signal and it would get louder as the group of people got bigger. We discovered the group thing when we picked up a new bunch of people and they went crazy and we started to go funny. But the other people died and then we were ok. It seemed like the group had to get smaller as time went on (and I thought that eventually we'd all have to be alone and I thought this was counterproductive for biological reasons). When we were in a house, the sound would get louder and then I suggested that it had something to do with the size of the area, so generally we were always wandering around outside. We met up with some other groups and the guy was testing his signal sound by putting us into groups and edging away and placing a new group when the sound subsided - this way we could see how far away we needed to be from each other. Then we were somewhere in America and apparently a meteor had hit my hometown. I started to cry because 'all the stuff we've worked for, all the stuff we owned, all our pets are all gone'."
"4102"	"(2014-10-11 (23)) Dan Palmer was on OkCupid and I went on his profile to find it had been updated and filled out - he was 40 years old (which shocked me) and we had a 96% match. He had a photo of himself for every year and his one for 1991 he only looked about 8. I hoped he would find me in his matches and message me."
"4103"	"(2014-10-11 (23)) I was out somewhere at night. A Mr Whippy type of thing pulled up and a bunch of us were lining up. He looked like AJ Bowen in The Signal and he never gave change, so you either had to give him the exact amount or give him a bit more. It was implied that this was a scam. I pulled out my wallet and pulled out a $50 note, then $20, then $10, then $5, before realising I had tons of change. The ice-cream was $3.35 or something, so I gave him the exact amount. He seemed angry and gave me a messy ice-cream - instead of soft serve, just squished it in. I complained and he did it again, but still messed it up. He got increasingly angry and violent and messy making my ice-cream and I continued to yell that he wasn't doing it right. I wanted one with chocolate sauce and nuts, and he would either forget one, or just dump it on etc. Eventually, he made it properly and I went off to enjoy it."
"4104"	"(2014-10-13 (23)) I was on a bed with Mark Duplass. He was propped up on a pillow (like lying down, but sitting up), and I was lying the opposite way, resting my head on his leg. We were talking about something or other and I took a photo of us. I posted on the forum mentioning what we were talking about and said I was talking with Mark Duplass. I was thinking about whether or not to post the pic but thought it might seem dodgy. At some point I snuggled closer so that I was hugging his leg and was half touching his crotch area. This seemed like normal behaviour as friends, though I did wonder if anything would happen."
"4105"	"(2014-10-24 (23)) Mom and I were staying in this hotel in the UK. It looked fancy in the lobby, but the room was a total mess. You had to climb up this ladder to get into the room and it kept flooding with dirty water - so we'd have to climb through the water to get into the room. All the furniture was mismatched and wobbly. Mom would often go out and not leave me with a card, so I'd either get stuck in the hotel with nothing to do or get left outside the room unable to get back in. I went to a cinema with Dad and Ezra and there were no seats, and we were alone, so we sat on the floor at the front. Guardians of the Galaxy was playing, but it was different. Two guys that worked there were having an argument and I think one killed the other. At some point I met Donald Sutherland and had a brief chat with him - mentioning that I'd seen him in an older film that day."
"4106"	"(2014-10-25 (23)) I can't remember the exact details but I was with Malachi and he really liked this apple pie that someone made. I discovered that he was a guy from a long time ago - who was immortal - and was getting revenge on people who wronged him when he was younger. I think he met with his mother at one point and seemed friendly with her, but then turned and accused her of letting her boyfriend be a dick to him. I was also watching Big Brother at some point, I remember seeing David and I also remember Sandra being with Sam and she was upset and crying because they couldn't be together. He said to her that 'either they'll get married or they'll be bff's forever'."
"4107"	"(2014-11-03 (23)) I was at a place which had all playgrounds - not sure if just one for each or ALL - with some other people including Jamison who was same age as we last saw him (8?). I found the McDonald's one and it was one I liked as a kid - vibrating seat spinny thing and I was saying it brought back memories of 'when I was in love with Bill Moseley'. Later on we were in another room with more people and Bill Moseley was there. I was standing nearby and briefly spoke to him and Jamison started to say she's in love with you - I said ssh and put my hand up to him but it was obvious what he was going to say and Bill was like 'it's ok' and then he said that I was thinking about him whilst on the vibrating seat and I was like omg but then we all had to sit in a circle for some Lords of Salem re-enactment thing and Bill was dressed like that and he walked around the inside of the circle putting these small skull stickers on people's chins and kissing it, when he got to me he did the same and then kissed me on the lips. I was like *inside squee* I woke up in the dream not long after to find my door open (at hotel in Kununurra) and I flashed my torch to check and then I heard Hector asking Mikhail if he'd opened my door and woken me up and then the conversation was muffled but it was implied he had come into my room and I thought he had kissed me."
"4108"	"(2014-11-05 (23)) I was staying in a room and Skye from Big Brother was in another. The blinds were riding up. Skye's outfit was in like four parts. Someone chased her. I threw a party at my house. Lots of people showed up and people were peeing, pooping and spewing all over everything. I tried to say that people needed to leave but no-one was really interested. I started shooting to get their attention. A girl who I was related to and I was her heir but we didn't like each other and she confronted me and I said I was only pushing people who caused a mess and it doesn't matter if I like them. I was doing Spud Shed with Esther and had to strip this meat -- it was thick and red with grey on the bottom, and was renowned for being difficult but I picked it up quickly."
"4109"	"(2014-11-06 (23)) From Dusk Till Dawn [on last night] - the place where they shot the pyramid bit was an actual place and for some reason I thought I'd been there though it like in Mexico but then we there and there a photo album where people posted to say they'd been there and I found pics of myself from when I was like 4. It was creepy and dark in there. There was a weird person hanging around. I can't remember properly but I think I (except not me) killed someone and was on the run. I kept meeting with people and then killing them. One girl I kept throwing around but she wouldn't die. She was all twisted though."
"4110"	"(2014-11-10 (23)) I forgot I had a job on and ran around to get ready for it but was already over an hour late, and it was at a place an hour away. I was really stressed and annoyed. There was then another job flying out across the country. It was quite late and I had this little bike thing (that was near on the ground) and I was driving Mikhail, so he was on the back. Hector pulled up next to us in a van and said it was too dangerous to drive it and then I wondered why I had it in the first place."
"4111"	"(2014-11-16 (23)) I was at some kind of school or something. I can't remember what was happening, but I went into a small toilet cubicle - which was part of this room - to get changed. Some bad guys came and were stealing stuff and taunting people. I stood on the seat as they tried to reach under the cubicle door, but they knew I was in there and got in. I had a pen and was jabbing the guy with it as he got closer, then I sliced his neck with it. He fell to the floor and then I was worried what would happen when his friends found the body."
"4112"	"(2014-11-17 (23)) There were lots of dust storms and the end of the world was near [saw Interstellar last night] . We lived in a different house and some guys who had been injured were staying with us. One of them had this stick which was decorated and had spikes on it. That guy was like the 'leader' and decided to revolt. We fought and fled. It ended up being four of us left at the end in this room. It was me, a guy I liked and another couple who were my friends. The room was bare and some kind of 'black hole' type of thing was sucking stuff in and throwing stuff out. It was windy because of the motion. We didn't have much longer left and we decided that the first thing it threw out that we could kill ourselves with, we would use it so we didn't have to die slowly. The guy I liked and I were holding each other in tears and we sort of admitted that we liked each other and then had sex. Afterwards, we continued to sit and wait. Somehow, we then ended up in a kind of spaceship and were saved at the last second. A computer screen showed all these different systems and planets, which lots of information about each one - the day cycle, the temperature, the general climate, average number of natural events; plus extra information about the fauna and flora, gas make up etc. One looked like Earth but with lots more water. There was a continent that looked a lot like how it would look if the ice caps had melted [I saw an artist's rendition of it once] , and it said that in this continent the temperature was like -600 degrees. Most planets had major extremes - there was a tiny planet that sat around 60 degrees, yet was covered in ice. We landed on a cold planet that was in winter, but had tolerable conditions. It was covered in snow and ice. There were buildings there and we wandered into a deli. There were people frozen in there (like, aliens that looked almost just like humans and they were frozen doing stuff - one guy was reaching into an ice-cream freezer). As we walked past, they began to thaw out, though we didn't see until one of them attacked us. We ran from them and one girl seemed personally intent on getting us. She led a group after us and we ran down a corridor and we unlocked this door and hid behind windowed glass. I tried to lock the door, but it wouldn't lock and she slid a knife down the side of the door, which I grabbed and turned on her. When she didn't back down, I sliced her throat. Then a group of older people-aliens came and told them to stop. One of them was her father and was distraught to find her killed. He drove us back to the spaceship and when the others left I said I was sorry for killing his daughter, but I didn't have a choice. He seemed to understand."
"4113"	"(2014-11-19 (23)) I went into the Big Brother house for a random visit. I was talking to David, who was still there, about hearing outside information from the people in the runs. We were whispering quietly and he said yes. I asked if they'd told Skye that she was doing very well and he said yes. I said my Mom has been wondering that for a while. I remembered I'd only paid for 4 hours parking and I'd been there for like a day. I left to go check on my car, but it hadn't been ticketed. I moved it and bought a new ticket. Later I was playing this game where a serial killer dude is in your house and you have to wake up and save these 2 other people sleeping in the house without being seen. The killer was sneaking around doing other stuff too. It was dark and had weird lighting and was quite creepy."
"4114"	"(2014-11-20 (23)) I lived with Stephen Merchant. He had a female friend visiting and staying with us for a bit. I was annoyed, but didn't voice this opinion. I was in my room and he had come back from the shop and was talking to the friend saying 'I know you love mangoes' and then something about 'Izzy likes these marshmallow Santa's' and I smiled and tried not to giggle because it sounded so ridiculous but was also happy that he knew I liked them. At some point I was somewhere with Analisa and she had a photo with David Tennant - I took it, so I also took a bit of video. She was really excited and happy about it. Later, there were these chairlifts (but like, a bus) and I got put on the female only one, which gave you less points. It was for reforming people? An old lady was on there and was whinging about how girls in her day worked and didn't do nasty things and I said something witty and cutting to her, and she responded back with something that made no sense and everyone cheered and clapped for her and I was like wtf is wrong with these people. But two seconds later we were just chatting as normal. We saw one of these lifts get struck by lightning, catch on fire and crash. It was very dark grey out there and everyone started freaking out. I was stuck somewhere with a couple of male friends. I had my Portal gun on me initially but it squirted water. I was messing around with it at a park. A guy came and wanted to play with it, but I was worried he'd break it and said no. He said he wanted one and I said it was pretty expensive, he said ""$1500"" and I said 'not that expensive'. One of my friends got into a fight with him later when he confronted us at night in this storage container. Later we were waiting in this shop and I bought some chips. They were really salty. I thought I'd lost my wallet earlier in the fight, but my other friend had it."
"4115"	"(2014-12-01 (23)) I was at the beach with Ezra and Dad. We had these skates which could walk on water. We had two different ones and we were going to try them out but I think we were a bit scared and were just sitting around. Little waves were splashing at the shore, but they kept getting bigger. I had my phone lying on the sand and a wave came right over it. I grabbed my phone to dry it and it was still ok. I ran back to the car to put my phone in there. The waves were still getting bigger and coming out further. There was an almost vertical step down to the shoreline now. I kicked at the sand to make it easier to walk down. I said we should leave. Nana lived nearby in this weird house and I went to warn her to put the pets inside and stay up high, when this wave came and hit the house. Somehow it hit the third storey, but we didn't get swept away with it. There was a cat on the second highest storey and I tried to get it to stay there. I ended up in a car and when the next wave hit, it lifted the car up and started sweeping me away. I started to panic and didn't know what to do."
"4116"	"(2014-12-04 (23)) I was on a work trip. We took about 20 staff and were on a bus. We had to stop overnight and were crowded into rooms. I was with Hector and Mikhail talking to them in their room and I wanted to stay there, but had to go into the girl room. I was the last one there, but there was a double bed in the front room left over. There was a bedroom full of bunks that was full, and then 3 doubles in the front room. At some point I was wandering around this like laboratory warehouse and there were freezers and fridges everywhere. I looked in the freezers (like ones at the supermarkets) and people from work were frozen in there. I saw Mikhail and Co-Worker-M-05 in one. The supervisors were walking around and I asked Esther what was going on but she either didn't know or was avoiding the question."
"4117"	"(2014-02-05 (23)) I was lying in bed with Benjamin and I can't remember if we were already seeing each other or if this was the start of it, but I turned over to face him - and it was like in a movie where the 'camera' would go between my face and a bird's eye view of us lying there and soft lighting and such. For some reason I don't remember ever seeing his face. He kissed me and I kissed him back and we started making out (which was sort of sloppy), and he ran his hand up my leg and when he got to the top, he climbed on top of me. I was thinking that I was happy that we'd resolved our differences and we were together like I'd always wanted."
"4118"	"(2014-02-05 (23)) I can't remember what was going on, but for some reason I was masturbating (I was bent over this table/desk holding a vibrator under me), trying to orgasm or something in front of Ezra and his friend. They weren't watching and it wasn't weird, but it was like I was trying to achieve something that we all needed to witness. Classmate-M-07 (from high school) turned up and had sex with me from behind, but we still didn't get whatever it was done. There were pictures of me on the walls and we took them off to throw away."
"4119"	"(2014-12-07 (23)) I was out somewhere and I saw Lawson sitting at a bench. As we walked around we saw Cat was with him and was very pregnant. She was later walking around looking at these photos/head statues of rich people. She had her hair up in a wedding-like bun, had big red lips and was wearing a fitted dress. She was looking for names for her baby."
"4120"	"(2014-12-08 (23)) I was at a petrol station with people from work. It was night and we weren't working but it may have been on a break or a travel job. Marvin was there with his girlfriend and they kept hugging and kissing. We all bought some stuff and mine came to $1400 but there was a problem with my card. Then I realised it couldn't have been $1400, because I'd only bought a $200 thing and some chocolates."
"4121"	"(2014-12-15 (23)) I had finished a stocktake and was waiting outside with Co-Worker-M-02 and Niles. Mom was giving us a lift. I was thinking now she'll meet Niles and 1) hopefully hate him too and 2) realise that he's not attractive and I don't like him. She got there and had to only take a few of us at a time. Niles got in the car, but she misunderstood and just took off. I ran after her trying to get her to come back, but she was gone. Then zombies came from nowhere and we had to run. I was with more people now and we ran through backyards, alleys and over fences and jumping from roof to roof. When it quietened down we walked. It had then been some time and we needed water. We found this guy who gave us shelter and some water bottles. One of the guys in the group found wispy white hair in the guy's bed, and brought it out to us - saying that his dead wife was rotting in there. We took the water and left quickly."
"4122"	"(2014-12-16 (23)) I was playing Sims 4, when a Sim was climbing down a long ladder and this white thing came out of its bum. It then shrivelled and lengthened and fell out and the Sim died. I went to tell Mom and I described it as a ""cigarette butt"" looking thing. She just kept giggling about 'Pluto' and not really paying attention to me, though I was really concerned about it for some reason. There was also something to do with a plant with a 'scary' snake in it. There was also something to do with Ezra, who had gone somewhere and we needed to find him. He had lots of money and was spending it all on drugs or something. There was a massive bus that Nana and Poppa had and we were all going on that. I was feeling sick and didn't want to go, but they said there were 13 rooms on it, so I could get my own one and I agreed. Granma was going as well, which put me off. At one point I was eating some food and stirring it, when suddenly it was sticking together and started rising and growing. I yelled at it, calling it a name (I think it was Nick), and ran out to tell everyone about it. You could hear it making noise/speaking from the other room, but no-one was taking it seriously."
"4123"	"(2014-12-18 (23)) I was with a couple of friends - a girl and Jack O'Neill. Jack was a little bit flimsy and a bit of a ladies man, flirting with pretty much everyone. We were in a shop or bar or something, and a guy friend of his went a bit crazy - a friend of his who was gay and who had a crush on him (we were presuming, I think). He was on the ground and Jack lay down next to him and kissed him and they made out. We all stood around awkwardly and I was secretly enjoying it (the kissing, not the awkwardness). Later we were outside the building and there were some girls there and my female friend pointed out that he was averting their eyes. I 'rewound' and noticed his eyes would flicker down and not look at them. She proposed that he was making an effort to not flirt with all the ladies as she'd pointed out to him some time earlier. I wondered if perhaps he was confused after that kiss, or maybe it was just nothing. The female friend also had this weird hair, which had this high bit in the middle full of interesting colours (that were like, shiny and vibrant blues, not a flat hair dye blue), and the sides were deep black. I asked if I could touch it and it was hard like from mousse and I said 'aw, I was hoping it'd be fluffy'. I also thought she may have had a crush on Jack (as did I). At some point Dad and I were at this takeaway restaurant and I ordered something different from the usual and he was shocked."
"4124"	"(2014-12-20 (23)) Mom informed me about some job that Acquaintance-F-08 had organized (an illegal one) and they needed someone to go in and collect whatever it was. This was the riskiest part of the job and somehow I ended up involved. I had to go into this house to get the thing (or whatever it was I had to do). While I was there, the guy came home with a woman, and the wood door at the front wouldn't close, so I had to leave it and go out the back way. I ran across the road where there was a McDonald's and some other things. At some point later, Acquaintance-F-08 contacted me blackmailing me for all the money I'd get (which was $300 million). Not wanting to cause problems, I said 'how about halves' and she said no because she could buy some sword for $500 million and sell it for a lot more. I said 'fine, I'll take $20 million' and she still said no. I told her she was being ridiculous because she could still buy her stupid sword and even $20 million was more than enough, and for me it would be enough for life, but she wasn't budging. I said I needed time to think about. Then I got in contact with Jordy about it and he said to meet him at this place with a weird name at midnight. I had to ask him about a few times the name of the place and where it was and then I realised I didn't know what day and he said 'tonight'. It was some place where we'd know people weren't listening. I don't remember the conversation or the conclusion, but afterwards I realised I didn't have a car. Dad appeared out of nowhere, also without a car, and walked with me to get somewhere to call a cab. A guy and some girls were posing for photos on the sidewalk. The girls were dressed skimpily in leather but looked about 12."
"4125"	"(2014-12-21 (23)) Mom, Rover and I went to this place and I'm not sure what it was supposed to be, but it had a big house/mansion thing which had shops and stuff, and there were stalls outside - all along this bridge and an outside area which lead to a beach. At one point Ezra was there too and he'd taken my phone. Luna was hanging upside down in a pool (like, his legs were over the edge of the pool and he was lying in the water. This was a normal, but amusing thing for him to do and I told Ezra I needed my phone and tried to take a photo. I complained phones made it difficult because I was worried I would drop it. Luna ended up moving and I didn't get a photo. There was a pet shop section and there was a cute dog, sleeping. At first I thought it was a cat, and then it woke up and its ears went 'dog like' and it jumped out of the pigeon hole and started getting excited. I felt bad but gave it a pat and then went on my way. Mom went missing. The guy who ran the place was really shifty and I suspected something else was going on here. I grabbed Rover on a lead and went looking for her. Mom's name was 'Claire', so I was calling that as out as well. There was a group of people in this 'well', and I peeked in to see if she was there. They all disappeared, but she wasn't part of it. I kept walking and then I saw her leaning against a half wall as part of a walkway. She was the woman from American Horror Story. Her face had been disfigured and she was blind. I ran over with Rover and said 'it's Mom', but when she talked her voice sounded different (croaky and scratched), and he didn't seem to recognise her. This upset her, but I kept insisting to Rover it was Mom and he started warming up to it. She asked how bad her face was and I said it was pretty badly disfigured. I went back to the house place to find the guy. Apparently he was taking the occasional person and turning them into 'ghosts', but not really ghosts, and they would be like his slaves. I found him in a kitchen and he told me to follow him and when he walked out, I grabbed a knife and put it in my pocket. I lost him, but I was going through tunnels and one tunnel passed the back of a stage, so I walked through the curtains and he was standing on it and said 'ah, the stage ending! Only 50% of players get this far' and he gave me this sharp pointy thing. I thought it was a trick weapon, so I took out my knife and started stabbing him with it. I then used the sharp pointy thing (which was hook like) and slit his throat (it barely cut the surface). But he just lay there on the floor and it healed. I was like what. Then Mom was there too and had been healed too (it was the place?). I demanded we be let go, but he just laughed. We ran and got outside where all his 'ghost slaves' were and they went after us. He said he was going to take Rover and Mom begged him to take her instead of him and the ghost slaves just grabbed her and pulled her inside."
"4126"	"(2014-12-22 (23)) I was part of a group of people trying to hide/take down 'goblins'. The 'goblins' took over people's bodies/did some kind of body snatcher thing. I had this cave type of hideout (which was near other hideouts), but some goblins were nearby and I was trying to cover up some of the holes that would make it obvious it was there. However, someone called out that they were setting the area on fire, so I ran. I followed the others and we ran to this elevator outside this building. I had a guy friend, who I liked and was possibly my boyfriend but I'm not sure, and he was with me. The first elevator was full and we waited for the next. Some of our group had deserted us. We watched the floor the elevator went to and got in. The floors had extra bits, so it was like floor 38.1. We got there and there was another set of elevators, which looked like train carriages. There was a notebook there with stuff highlighted. I assumed they left a note about which floor to go to. When I finally found the hint, it was for this current floor so I assumed they had forgotten to write it. But I went outside and saw the floor it had come from, which was floor 41. So we went up. I'm not exactly sure what happened from here. The guy friend and I ended up at a petrol station, behind the counter and no-one was there. Customers came, so to keep up the pretence, I served them while the guy looked for stuff. We left and at some point we were given a car by our 'leader', and there was me, a girl and my guy friend. I'm not sure what we were, but the goblins could possibly smell us, but generally would only do so if we aroused suspicion. The guy friend and I went to some event that a friend of mine was involved with. I was talking to her and thought something was wrong. She took me outside and I turned around to see her eyes had gone a weird shade of white, surrounded by black, and I said 'are you trying to be a zombie? What are you doing?' and her eyes went back to normal and her face broke out in a red, lumpy rash. I just acted confused and annoyed and it seemed to convince her that I didn't know about the goblins (which she apparently was). I walked off, pretending to be upset at her actions, and went to find my guy friend to leave. She had realised by this point I was pretending and we had to run. The other people there seemed to be acting strange as well, and I said 'It's everyone'. We were then driving and it had been a while since we'd slept - as the goblins would locate us when we stopped. We finally found a hideout where we could relax for a bit. Our leader brought us a new car - a van, which had two rows of seats in the back and a big boot for storage. It was also apparently very good for handling corners. We were excited because it meant more room to store stuff (which we had trouble with) and could fit more people if needed."
"4127"	"(2014-12-24 (23)) Mom and Darren bought a new house on Rochester Circle. I wasn't told about it until basically we moved in. There were no actual bedrooms and I got really annoyed and was yelling at them for not even asking and for not even getting a house with rooms."
"4128"	"(2015-01-04 (23)) I was part of a unit trying to kill these aliens. I think we were on their planet, but I'm not sure. We were battling outside in a rocky kind of landscape, shooting with these big futuristic looking guns. Some time later I was at this house (it could've been mine, but I'm not sure). There were muffins on the bench. I got a call from Weiss (Alias) asking if there were muffins and I said yes. Some of the stuff he was asking sounded weird and I suspected him of being a bad guy. I started eating a bunch of muffins. They returned and I remember seeing Jack, Vaughn and Weiss. Weiss went straight to the muffins and I went up to Jack and mouthed that Weiss was bad (not sure of exact thing I said). He took me outside and we went down the side of the house, in the shadows (it was night, btw). He said ""really, Vaughn?"" and I said ""no, Weiss!"" I explained what I'd heard, but heard noises nearby and they'd come outside. Jack started shouting about the neighbour to cover up our conversation and we walked back to the group. Then I was at at home and Mom and Darren got home at like 3am and the neighbour across the road (who was a fat, 50-ish guy) was mowing the lawn. It was very loud and Darren went over to complain."
"4129"	"(2015-01-09 (23)) I was supervising my first IGA. I kept losing my location stickers. I had to put S locations up next to the normal locations for checking purposes. Esther had started checking although people hadn't finished scanning. I had only put up 2 stickers and couldn't find my sheets. I kept getting pulled away for stuff and getting distracted. Everyone ended up finishing and sitting around doing nothing and I was panicking and running around looking for my sheets. Niles was there and looking smug and I was annoyed that he had to be there while things were going wrong."
"4130"	"(2015-01-15 (23)) We lived somewhere else, in this apartment building type of thing. A light/mixed Native guy followed me up the stairs. He said he'd show me how to pick the lock of our door. I said to Mom, who was standing nearby, 'he's trying to break in'. He got the first one opened, but nothing with the second. He pulled it off and showed us that the mechanism had broken and wasn't working. He followed me in and kept following me around. Later, there was some kind of family reunion thing happening in another country. Dad, Ezra and I were there. This guy around my age and I were friends since childhood or something and were both very intelligent. He was a scientist-mind. We were in this big warehouse kind of thing and were having some kind of battle (based on what some mysterious person said or something that one of us had to die). We were drinking this potions and growing bigger. Then another potion did something else and made us turn blue. Then he mixed part of a potion with another potion and went red and had fire breath. Then somehow we could just say what we wanted to change and I was like 'bigger' and we slowly got bigger until we went through the ceiling. Then he had claws and all these things, so I just started listing off heaps of stuff while trying to escape his attacks. Then I could think my changes. I ended up going invisible and being able to fly, but because I had so many changes I was heavy and it was difficult to stay up. He went invisible as well, but I made it so I could see him. I got close enough to him to 'switch off' the changes and he turned into a kid again. I said this was stupid and we should stop and he seemed grateful and told me to switch back too, so I went back to a kid as well. And we left laughing that we almost caused a war. Also at some point, Ezra was aged back to a baby? Or was cloned into a baby? He liked giving high-fives, so I was high-fiving him."
"4131"	"(2015-01-28 (24)) We were all given 'roles' like in Town of Salem (medium etc), but they were 'super powers'. A medium guy died and then his brain was in the computers. We were trying to get away from bad guys and were holed up in this house. I was trying to get the medium guy to help us, but he seemed reluctant. There were also bad guys trying to hack the computers. Later I ended up in this place where we were like prisoners. I got a shirt from someone which had a code on it. There was a sentence with every first letter highlighted but I could only glance at it for like a second before someone would enter the room. I could only read 'too' so far. Later I was being talked to by one of the 'leaders' and managed to read it whilst getting something from the fridge and it read 'toolshed'. I knew this was related to a prophecy regarding Sydney's mother (Alias) (who was either my 'lost' mother or someone else). I saw her run by the window of the place I was, and I just got up and ran out the back to the door of the toolshed. She said something to me and we held each other as the place exploded."
"4132"	"(2015-01-28 (24)) I was on the forum and Benjamin posted saying he had been flirting with this girl for ages and she was finally his girlfriend and something like 'Izzy will be happy for me'. I went to his Facebook and his profile photo was of them together. She was quite ugly. There were tons of pictures from April 2014 of him on a cheap looking film set and it looked like that's where they'd met. I was annoyed."
"4133"	"(2015-01-29 (24)) I went to see Poppa and they lived in a really big house (similar to old one). They also had maids. Poppa called me to say that an ornament hadn't been cleaned properly and some other stuff. I talked to the maids about it and they started cleaning. They only came 2-3 times a week."
"4134"	"(2015-01-29 (24)) Hugo and I were walking down a street after a stocktake. There was a parade/march on and some streets were closed off. We had taken the train, so were trying to get there. We had to crouch and walk under train to get somewhere. The end of the track was over water (the train flew?). We got to the conductor bit and he'd made a signal like he'd seen us, but then he started the train.  Hugo was in front of me and directly under it, so I quickly went back and got up and yelled at the conductor to stop, but it was too late and we all fell into the water (the train too)."
"4135"	"(2015-02-03 (24)) I was going on a long drive somewhere with Stephen Merchant and some other friends. We were sitting in the back and I was sleeping with my head on his shoulder."
"4136"	"(2015-02-03 (24)) We still lived at the old house. We took Ratatouille's cage out into the family room and left it there for a bit. When I went back to it, there were another mice in it. Some big, some small, all kinds of colours. I remember some with coffee colour patches, a white one, some like Ratatouille, grey ones and there was one with red eyes. I was grabbing them and chucking them away, but they never seemed to all be gone. So I grabbed Ratatouille and put him in another cage that they couldn't get into and put it in my room. But when I went back to it, it was full of ants. I was trying to shake the ants out and Ratatouille fell over and seemed dazed, I was like 'omg sorry' and then I went to grab him but this big spider walked up to him and looked like it was going to sting him and I squished its head. It spurted out this green stuff and covered Ratatouille in it, and then he rolled over and died. I started crying and then I woke up in the dream and was telling Mom about the dream but started crying telling it. I then woke up in real life crying."
"4137"	"(2015-02-09 (24)) I can't remember anything more of this dream, except for someone saying ""Letitia, get me a slice of cheese"". I kept waking up throughout the night with the phrase in my head, but I remember nothing else."
"4138"	"(2015-02-09 (24)) Somehow I found out that it was the end of the world. I think Zim (Invader Zim) was around as well. I decided to not tell anyone because it was inevitable and not very far away. Some footage of this thing in the sky was leaked and everyone realised. I was with a guy on this cliff and I said I'd taken the footage. There was like 17 seconds left and we counted down, but nothing happened. Some people had killed themselves and I remember Payton shouting something like ""I'm a virgin and Lady Gaga sucks!""."
"4139"	"(2015-02-10 (24)) Dan Palmer was around and eating some weird food. Mom had some weird food from Granma like fish and eggs, that were strange colours like purple and pink. Dan put his bowl next to Mom's and they looked almost identical. We both took a picture of it. It was my birthday. We were at the old house. Granma called Mom and I told her to say I was out and she did. Mom was giving her my email as 'Izzy.conell@yahoo.com'. Then she pulled up in the driveway. I ran and told Mom that I had to go silent in my room for hours. There was a massive storm one night and Mom and Darren said they could see a hurricane. There was a movie with a leopard which attacked this girl after knocking on her door and when she went out he roared, but the girl got away. Something happened in the town 17 years ago and these kids survived but some stuff happened to them and the sheriff said they were 'strong' because of it."
"4140"	"(2015-02-11 (24)) Doing an IGA. I was stickering and people were scanning. I was in a room with Esther and Hugo, and Esther was taking to Hector -- who was in another room. She asked him how much he trusted me with running his IGA job and he said 'not very much. She misses locations, wanders off' etc and Esther and I were confused and she said 'Izzy's right here, Hector' and went to talk to him saying I'd done it a million times and I was fine. Hugo said, to no-one in particular, that he 'trusted me completely'. Hector came in with the laptop with proof and Hugo complained that he was embarrassing me. There were pictures of some problems -- eg, not separating old guns with new guns because I didn't know, 8 pictures of a movie I watched and one video of me and Mikhail mucking around but it was actually because Mikhail took something from me and didn't give it back."
"4141"	"(2015-02-11 (24)) I was wandering around with Joaquin Phoenix and Shia La Beouf. I'd not liked them but now I was hanging around with them getting to know them. We were walking the streets at night. They were flirty and kept saying I'd sleep with them but I thought in my head that I'd probably do Phoenix, but not La Beouf."
"4142"	"(2015-02-14 (24)) Mom found this guy who looked after animals to look after my mice. I went over there to see them and the guy was really hot. He had black hair and blue eyes, and sort of 'masculine' and not my type, but still very charismatic (though fairly soft-spoken and quiet) and attractive. His house was full of animals and clothing racks [possibly due to stocktaking so many clothing stores lately] with lots of 'sexy' women's clothes of all different sizes - implying that he had many lovers. I remember his last name was Willett, and I think his first name was Dean. We began sleeping together - his 'rule' was that he would pretty much sleep with anyone he wanted to and never got into a relationship with anyone. This carried on for a while. One day I went over to do something with the mice and he had another girl there (hispanic looking). I was unfazed and carried on with the mice and left. Some time later he started getting possessive and told me to not see anyone else (which I wasn't anyway). Then it was a movie and he was less attractive and had a weird, deep and ugly voice. There was a girl called Ivy who owned a bakery (or something like that) who he was now 'my character'. He also had this silver/metal mark on his face and was a loud, fast talker (salesman-like). There were a few ensemble characters as well. It turned out that this guy was disturbed and a murderer and all the other characters had issues too. Ivy's bakery had actually been in an explosion some time ago, but in her mind it was still flourishing. So she was still working and serving imaginary customers (and the other customers who still believed it was fine), though it was abandoned and covered with dust and there was a broken mirror."
"4143"	"(2015-02-19 (24)) There was a woman (called Essie?) with a Goa'uld (we were calling them that, though they functioned differently). We were keeping her under lockdown in this room and she couldn't pass the barrier, although she did once and you just had to say a word and it was like in vampire movies and she'd get 'dragged' back in. If people went into the room she could transfer over. We had to keep the door open for some reason and there was a kind of party/celebration happening. A dog ran into the room and I chased it out, but as I was trying to get it, a young girl (like 2) wandered in and went into a bed. As I went to get someone, the kid walked out. We concluded quickly that the dog was not infected but then I mentioned the kid had gone in. The kid looked shocked and was holding this bottle and had really small hands and I thought it looked weird. She was also very ugly. The girl said she wasn't infected, but was talking in 'homie' speak and her sister was like 'that's not her'. She looked defeated and went back to the room with us and transferred out. Not sure if same dream or the same 'storyline', but I had some group of people after me (though I wasn't 'me'). I ended up having to jump out of a window into water at night and then hid under this bridge - the building was surrounded by water for some reason, about waist-high, since while I was hiding under the bridge, people were walking around in it looking for me, though while I was swimming around in it, it was deep. Anyway, I kept going under the water to look at their feet and which way they were facing. But I was stuck under there all night. In the morning the 'head' of the group - a lady - said she'd found a body. Then at some point there was a baby/young kid and it was 'bad' for whatever reason, so I strangled it fairly violently, whilst also crying."
"4144"	"(2015-02-20 (24)) I lived in, or was staying in, this big house sort of near the sea/no close neighbours. Lots of windows around it. It was night and I was outside and it was windy. I went back inside and was worried there were dodgy people around. I locked the door. I sat in the dark, in the corner on my computer and I was watching the security cameras and saw quite a few guys sneaking around the side of the house. I called the police and said ""I'm alone at [whatever the address was] "" and the guy was like 'oh are you so-and-so's niece' and I said yes, yes and said there were dodgy guys. One came up to the door and just opened it and came in. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed two kitchen knives and stabbed him. I remembered Rover was in the house (it was just us) and I went to find him and saw a guy aiming a machine gun at him, and I threw one of the guys in front of him to protect Rover from the bullets. I slit two guy's throats at the same time, and stabbed the last guy. I think there were a few more guys that I also killed. Rover had gotten hurt and I called around for some kind of 'pet ambulance' and I sat with him, patting him."
"4145"	"(2015-02-22 (24)) I was staying away somewhere, like in these cabins but we weren't supposed to go out after dark or something and keep our doors locked. I think there was something dangerous going on, but I'm not sure. There were 4 girls (including myself) and 4 guys. One of them was kind of hot and we kept catching each other's eye. We flirted for a bit and then ended up having sex, but it was a little bit rapey. We kept having sex though. I posted a vague post on the forum that I'd had sex with someone but shouldn't have and the posts were all 'helpful advice' type of posts, but saying like 'if it's consensual sex then it's ok', and they hadn't really gotten the gist that it was only partly consensual. Benjamin posted my FilmForum activity and like 'how can you fit anything else in when you're working 44 hours a week and watching this many films' but it was only like 1 film a week. Something happened and someone else and I were outside somewhere (during the day), not sure what was going on, and there was a pond thing with passports in it. I joked that we were actually dead and these are our passports. They were our passports and she freaked out like 'how did you know' and I said it was a guess 'you know how many movies I've seen, this happens all the time'. Everyone had then forgotten their memory (except for me), but no-one really knew and we all bundled into this room and sat at this long table - girls on one side, guys on the other. I still found myself attracted to the guy from before and I caught him staring at me again. I wondered if he'd still be the same as before."
"4146"	"(2015-02-24 (24)) I had this dildo thing which was like a realistic penis. I was performing oral sex on it and noted that it tasted like a real penis. It was very big, but as I relaxed and got into it, I got more of it 'in'. Although nothing was going on elsewhere, it started bringing me to orgasm."
"4147"	"(2015-02-26 (24)) Mom did something to my car, and then ended up getting the whole windscreen smashed. We were driving in another car and I was annoyed, but not overly angry. I kept mentioning it though and worried about how I was going to get to work. We went to a petrol station, which was tiny and she parked in it - that is, the bonnet of the car to about the windows was as big as the store and my window was just next to the counter. I saw some of those mint slice chocolates and wanted one but didn't ask. There were two policeman nearby too. I can't remember what happened, but I ended up meeting some people and staying with them in a hotel room. There were 3 guys and 1 other girl - but I think she was already a friend of mine? Or at least I knew her before the others. One of the guy's was called Dave and was the hottest one and who had taken a liking to me. He had brown hair and a bit of stubble. They all wanted to throw a party and took a vote on it, saying that I wouldn't want to, but I agreed as well. I was slightly excited about it, but also already bored by the idea. They started setting up, gathering drinks and snacks and so on. They were rolling a dice to see who got to choose which drink next (drinking before the party started). I was sat against a wall, the girl on my right and one of the other guy's on her right (all spaced quite far away). The other guy (not Dave and not the one sitting down) was the one she liked. He had a bit of a chubby face. Dave was talking to him just outside the room and I noticed he had a ring on each ring finger, which annoyed me. I was thinking I'd drink a bit and wanted to sleep with him, but wondered if I could go through with it if he was wearing jewellery. He grabbed a bottle and came over to me and said something about 'being in love with me' but that I wasn't interested. He sat down right next to me and I made a face and said 'we've known each other for like 2 days'."
"4148"	"(2015-03-02 (24)) I was stocktaking in a big clothes warehouse. There were rows and rows of clothes up to the ceilings and I was hoping someone else would have to do them because I didn't want to have to keep climbing up ladders. The supervisor of the job didn't have enough guns for everyone to be scanning at once, so some of us were wandering around trying to find something to do. At one point me and another guy were tidying up some of the floor racks that had clothes just piled on top. Later, we started taking barcodes out, and then the supervisor gave us check sheets - which was like a map of the area with houses and the houses represented something or other. There was some house where these twins lived and they had an exact copy of themselves (so 4) and each pair shared a bed. Anyway, later I was doing some more wandering, when the supervisor said we needed more people to be guarding the entrances and she referred to me as the 'sheriff' and put me at the front entrance. There were zombies or demons or something around. I wasn't particularly scared, just slightly nervous (apparently used to this). I walked back and forth for a few minutes, when I saw a group of 4 of them in a line shuffling backwards towards us (two of them had been our staff, another one of the warehouse's staff and they'd been possessed. Pretty sure they were demons since they were intelligent, but we called them zombies). I ran in and called out and said 'there's 4 in a line coming towards us!' and she told me to sound the alarm. There was a big red button on the wall and I pressed it. The alarm sounded and people just came out of nowhere grabbing weapons. I got a rifle but it had no ammo and I was still looking in the bag of ammo, putting some into the gun (it only held 2 at a time) when they entered the room. There were 2-3 entrances on each side of the building. One was near me and a demon came through and I shot him right in the head. Lots more kept coming. There was also a building next door (about 5 metres from this one, exactly the same) that sounded like they were getting slaughtered. When we'd finished them all off, we looked next door and no-one was left alive. Then shadows started going weird and these things that are hard to describe, but sort of like a stapler remover - there wasn't much to them, they were solid black and had one sharp pointer on the top and bottom. They also had this deafening squeal. They were shoving their pointers into people's legs and such and dragging them off. One stabbed me in my leg and it hurt like hell and they didn't seem to respond to the guns. I then had a knife or something which seemed to get rid of it."
"4149"	"(2015-03-03 (24)) I went to a cinema to see Kingsman again, just to rewatch the church scene [saw it yesterday, loved the church scene] . I was in the cinema, and a teenage girl was annoying me. I moved seats and she moved behind me and kicked the seat giggling and ran back up. She did something else and I maybe hit her, but we went to the cinema manager and I told him about something she'd done that she wasn't allowed to and she got a warning and that was the end of it. Then she was Farrah. We went outside and Valerie was there too. She was being friendly. My car was like this little bike with like helicopter blades and my car engine could be moved so my car engine was in it. I got in and flew up but then something went weird and it went back to the ground and then I saw fire, so I got out and it exploded, killing Valerie and setting fire to everything around it. It spread quickly to this bush area."
"4150"	"(2015-03-04 (24)) Karl, Ricky and Steve were play wrestling on some grass. They were also wet. I remember Steve getting up and walking away and his back was really hair (and wet, so slicked down)."
"4151"	"(2015-03-05 (24)) I was at home, which was slightly different, and I heard people outside my window and someone shot a gun through my window and hit me. I can't actually remember properly what happened after that, I kept passing out in the dream and I think I was trying to call an ambulance and I think Mom was there too."
"4152"	"(2015-03-10 (24)) I was watching a film about this guy whose daughter had died from some illness when she was about 8 or so. Not sure what happened to his wife, but he started dating this woman and he never talked about his past with her. Sometimes it switched between being 'first person view' from the woman and it being a film. While 'I' was the woman, I was at his house and this young girl came up and started talking to me. She was a bit mysterious with the way she spoke but I gathered she was his daughter. He couldn't see her though. Then I started seeing his wife too. Something happened and he went crazy and he started killing people. But it was like an interactive movie, so you were experiencing the kills as well. The lighting was all weird, like dark but red and then blue etc. He was crying and crazed looking and had a knife and he was slicing up his wife and this other woman. Even once they were dead, he was just slicing and slicing. He killed the daughter as well. Then a baby started crying and he went to kill it. Then I was in like a cinema watching it and a lady behind me was snivelling. I thought she was stupid for finding it sad and I was impressed at how intense and immersive it was."
"4153"	"(2015-03-15 (24)) I was in English class with Ms Solomon, though it was somehow connected to GBCS. We had to do these essays as well as make up some 'this or that' cards, which would get randomly placed around a supermarket that we were stocktaking and then we'd have to pick our favourite and give an argument about why that one was the best. I made one on Bridget Jones' Diary with Colin Firth and Hugh Grant on each side. I made another one based around Colin Firth. I was highlighting the 'correct' answer (Colin Firth) in yellow. The third one had something to do with a werewolf character. I had another that had 'watch Hababam' and 'watch [something else bad] ' on the other side. I decided to change the other film I'd picked and as a joke, Ms Solomon suggested changing it to something like 'ants eating your eyes because of something or other'. I can't remember what she said now, but I wrote that down and it was a decent sized paragraph. Autumn was there and she was carrying all the choices. Mine were taped to my textbooks. I decided to take out the Colin Firth ones, thinking they were stupid. I told her I needed to put the big one in there (it was heavy to carry as well) and while I was doing that, I took out the two textbooks and put them in my bag. I bought a few things and then decided I wanted a Yogo. I asked the lady if it was ok and she said be quick (she was still scanning my stuff). All the Yogo's were out of date by ages, so I went to the chocolate section and they had Munchies, so I grabbed those and a Twix. I ran back and she was serving another customer, so I had to wait a bit."
"4154"	"(2015-03-19 (24)) There was a wedding going on. The bride was a French girl. I was not at the wedding, but outside on some grass nearby with some others. She walked over and she had shoulder-length blonde hair with a slight wave, light blue eyeshadow and a subtle colour lipgloss. She was average looking, but probably considered conventionally attractive. She started talking and had a weird mouth with a gap between her teeth and I thought she was ugly. I made a comment after she left that French girls are ugly. Some time later, I ended up with Esther and a girl who looked Eastern European or something like that and we went to a pub. We were scanning some fixtures on the floor with lollies and stuff, then Esther got a drink and asked if I wanted one. I was full and said no, but I'd take a pack of Salt and Vinegar chips. I then decided to get a drink and went to her and asked for a Budweiser. We sat at the table waiting for our stuff, when the guy behind the bar started spouting hate talk about women. The other girl with us started getting visibly angry and got up and confronted him. He just sort of smirked at her and she hit him with this candlestick holder thing. It made a loud 'dong' noise. He punched her and she kept hitting him. She came back over and he came over having a go. Esther said leave it alone and he started at her and I said 'oh, so we're picking on smaller and older people now' and he yelled at me. We got our stuff and got out, but he chased us and we had to run. Esther got in the driver's seat and I got in the back behind her. The other girl was far behind and I told Esther to lock the door. She got to the car and came around my side. I didn't know how to get her in the car, but then I moved across and she got in. She knocked my Wheatley bag out when she got in and I reached out to grab it and they were shouting to leave it and I said no. The guy got there as I pulled it back in and we locked the door and drove off. I was later at a shop and Trinny and Susanna or whatever were there and one of them started talking to me, asking if I wanted to stop 'sweating all the time' and I said yeah and she said ""drugs?"" ""no"" ""alcohol?"" ""no"" and some other things and then she handed me this weird looking towel, which was also a blow-up towel that heated and she said it would be effective. She was giving it to me to test but it cost $100, so after waiting a while for it to heat up I left. I was sitting on a lounge at some point and Bang-a-Boomerang came on and I was miming along and 'dancing' to it and this guy just looked at me like wtf. It ended and I said 'aw, I want more ABBA' [listening to a lot of ABBA at the moment] ."
"4155"	"(2015-04-01 (24)) Co-Worker-F-03 was supervising a job that was considered 'high up'. I can't remember what kind of store it was, though I had thoughts of Kathmandu. At the end of the job, I was somewhere else with someone and they called and said if I got back in 10 minutes they would make me a 'chief supervisor' - allowing me to potentially supervise the job in the future and being a trusted stocktaker with them. I got back and then we left. Later some people were filling out a sheet and I didn't see my name in the 'chief supervisor' bit, so he started writing it in (in chalk), but then I noticed it was already there and they scribbled it out. Later, I was on a job that Hugo was supervising (just us two). Mom had dropped me off and when she saw Hugo she gave me a look, but I put my head down so as to not egg her on [she has been making creepy suggestions lately] . It was a clothes store, but it was like a section of a bigger store and no manager was around. He had scanned a rail, and gave me a box that was underneath. We were messing around a bit and I was giggling a lot. When we got to the end, there was a bunch of other stuff from other stores and I had to check it wasn't from this one (there were some wedding dresses, as well as like porcelain type of decorations). Then I noticed cleaners in the hallway. The lights were all off too. It was early in the morning, before the store had opened and we suddenly had to be out. Another girl was then with us. We fast walked through the shadows - I noticed Hugo wasn't carrying any equipment except his two guns and I asked if he had any equipment and he said no - and were almost at the exit when someone spotted us, and we kept moving and went into the men's toilet and out a backdoor into the carpark. Then it went into third person view and showed the person walking after us as we all got in the car and drove off."
"4156"	"(2015-04-07 (24)) I was supervising something like Kathmandu at night. I had 12 people or so on the job, but when I arrived I realised I had only 2 guns and I hadn't charged them (or the ones I'd left at home). Esther turned up with 6 guns or so but I was panicking. I got some people started scanning in the back room and went to get the files on the laptop. When I went to check on people, everyone without a gun had been sent home. Hugo turned up at one point to see if we needed help but I said we didn't have any extra guns anyway."
"4157"	"(2015-04-09 (24)) I was in the world of Brazil, except it was different and stranger. I wasn't 'from' there, but I don't know how I ended up there. Jonathan Pryce looked like Mr Dark, except was Sam Lowry except that he wasn't and I was calling him Jonathan. We were dating and his place was basically just one room - it was rectangular and not very wide, I only remember seeing the room from the bed which was at the far end, there were cupboards/wardrobes around the back wall, and then the bed was next to that but the bed was facing sideways, so the back wall was to the left of the bed. There was almost no space from the end of the bed to the side wall. At the front end was the kitchen and the door was to the left of that. There was a couch and table and some other bits in the middle. I'm not sure where the bathroom was. Anyway, I remember lying in bed in the morning and he had already left for work so I was bored and awaiting his return. I went about my day and was outside in the garden later and was wondering why he still wasn't home. This policeman type of dude was around and he came by and asked to see my ID card or whatever (for the person that lived at the house) and I said it was my boyfriend's house and gave him Jonathan's card which he scanned. He then said he'd been arrested and I was like wtf. He left and then Jonathan ended up returning but had like escaped or something. He explained what happened (can't remember), then we could hear sirens coming closer so I said we had to leave now, I grabbed my phone and left everything else - I was slightly annoyed about leaving all my stuff and I only grabbed my phone because I wanted the music on it. Jonathan had this vehicle thing which sort of flew and there was only enough room for two people so we got in that thing and were 'flying' away. It was difficult to control and was all over the place though. After being chased for a while we got caught and ended up in this underground science lab. I woke up in this passage way and walked past these rooms which all had a big glass window, door on the right and inside were big eggs. It turned out the place had been cloning dinosaurs and a few baby dinosaurs were wandering about. I saw a big T-Rex type of thing at another end and I started running for the door at the end of the passage way and started climbing up the walls. A few more T-Rex things appeared as well but they hadn't seen me yet."
"4158"	"(2015-04-22 (24)) I was with Esther in a big, multi-storey gothic style house. We were doing something to do with work, but I'm not sure what. It was stormy and we went outside to do something and around the side of the house it was pitch black in the distance and a thick grey fog just in front of us. It was getting closer and weird noises were coming from it - like a whispering static. Someone else with us went into it and we ran back inside, but it had caught up and it was pitch black inside. Once it had enveloped us, the sound stopped and I couldn't see or hear anything. We had referred to it as both 'The Silence' and 'The Nothing' [the first made me think of Doctor Who and the second of The Neverending Story so I couldn't decide which one I preferred] . We were stuck in there for a year, then it went away. Only the three of us who had been caught in it had been 'gone' for all that time though."
"4159"	"(2015-04-23 (24)) I was doing a stocktake at a small-ish store. The guys who owned it were Arabs and it was a travel job and the place I was staying at was very 'Arabic' [in my head, I mean. Not actual Arabic style] - to move upstairs and such, there were these floating steps and you'd move them to jump up and across and such. I was trying to get up one, but I moved the last step too far and when I jumped across I fell. A lady and her young son were in the room and started laughing (friendly laughter, I was laughing too), she didn't speak English but said something to me. I decided to just walk straight to the place instead since I could get to it another way. I printed out the check report and there were huge numbers of coffee - it said like 'squintillion' etc. Hector was there and I thought of something funny and started giggling and he asked what I was laughing about. I said nothing and walked away a little bit, still giggling. I had to go to the toilet and went back to my room to do so. The rooms were all shared here - the rooms came in levels and in a circle so there were no real inside walls. My room had 3-4 beds. I walked in and a girl opened her phone to shine the light at me and when she saw me she went 'oh no', and I said 'sorry I have bodily functions that need seeing to' in a snarky tone and went looking for the toilet. At some point later, a guy that looked like Ioan Gruffudd was making a speech. I was lying in bed and I had this vibrator that looked like a piece of lettuce and it was easily adjustable and had it on, lying between my legs. He was someone I sort of knew. He came over to me and I tried to turn it off, but he was already crouched next to the bed by the time I switched it off. He said something to me and then went back to his speech. He said something like 'is anyone tickling themselves right now' (which made sense in the context of his speech, but I knew it was secretly aimed at me) and I put the blanket over my head and giggled. He also sent me a message saying 'I know there's a man under there, I can help you out' and then a meme-like picture of Stephen Merchant that had some kind of play on words joke about 'Slow Face Merchant' which was the name of a font and another one that was a quote from Stephen Merchant about buying something cheap."
"4160"	"(2015-05-02 (24)) I was outside with some people, in a bush-type place (though it was quite open, not many trees). This fog was hanging in the distance, but we noticed it coming closer. Someone else said to run, so we did. I had my work ladder, and other people were carrying more of our ladders. There was a young girl there as well. I couldn't run properly with the ladder. I knew we had to get to a 'save point', which was marked by an orange line on the ground. We reached it barely, the girl falling over the line and I went back to make sure she was over it and she was. It was a type of 'game' (we weren't willing participants, I'm not sure of the details), and the area was marked out with these orange lines. Then it changed slightly and the area around was actually flooded, every hour the water would fall and the walls around these areas would go down. We would then have 15 minutes to get to the next area. We were in an area that was nearing the exit (though even after we left this area, there was still flooding or whatever so I'm not sure what we were going to do) and I gave my ladder to the other guys with the ladders. They were putting them in the car, which was later under water. I was looking for my ladder, and they started pulling out the ladders but they weren't mine. Then I went underwater (it was quite deep) to check the car [I'm not sure how they got the ladders before, dream logic] and had to swim down and found the ladder under the car. I could see clearly underwater and it just looked like an underwater forest/city. In the distance I saw an area where a bridge would've been, but without the bridge and on the other side was a big group of zombies. They saw me and started climbing down (they were slow zombies). This was what the water 'protected' from - we weren't trying to escape the water, but the zombies. I went up and said they were coming and everyone started getting into action. The next area was like a house with rooms and stuff and I think wasn't affected by the time limit. Outside I could see a big shopping mall. A while later the water went away. These bad guys found us and started trying to break in. We were trying to make weapons and stuff to fight with. The mall was also full of zombies and I found it amusing how accurate Dawn of the Dead and stuff had been."
"4161"	"(2015-05-04 (24)) Something happened to me and I kept seeing those ghost people (it was something similar to It Follows, where only you can see them and they'll keep coming to you and you can pass it on). I was in a room at one point when one appeared and I tried to scream but nothing would come out. Later I was with some other people and there was an old guy there but I thought he was one of them. I tried to cover myself with a blanket and was fiddling around with it and then in real life, my hands must've moved and touched each other and I woke up in a panic - in the dream I interpreted the touching as the ghost guy touching me."
"4162"	"(2015-05-22 (24)) I was at a shopping centre and 3 other girls and I were sitting on this couch. They were all friends and talking amongst each other. We had won a competition to meet Michael Fassbender? He came up to us and shook our hands (I was the last one). They were all giggling and I was laughing at their reaction. He walked away and they were commenting on how hot he was and how he walked, and then when he got a little bit away, he turned around and came back. Then there was a food place just near us and he lined up to get some food. I got up to go to the toilet and he walked by me. The girl's toilet was occupied and he went into the men's. Co-Worker-F-04 was somewhere at some point and in America there was a hat called a thong, which had two hats joined together and a bit of material hanging down at the back. I got to the conversation late and she gave me the hat to try on. I asked which hat I was supposed to put on, she took it back and showed me - the back one was actually on your head and the front one sat up slightly higher and I said 'oh yeah I've seen those rapper people wear stuff like that' and they giggled. Later I was playing this game where you could make all different choices, eventually leading to all these different endings. It was 'real' though. I ran down this hall into this area where you could train your 'agility', I reset at one point and saw someone go outside to train 'strength' and I didn't know how they got outside. When I kept 'dying', I decided to follow the other person and went outside to train strength (there were a few options, I picked one of those strong man games and hit the hammer down on the button and the thing went ding in the highest area. Then later there was this room with lots of shelves with useless stuff on them. Someone was coming in through this door and I had to hide. Sam (Supernatural) was also there and when he noticed the person coming, he climbed into a cupboard and closed the door, and I only had a few seconds to find somewhere to hide so I lay down in one of the aisles but the guy came in and switched on the light and found me (I also struggled to keep my eyes open while I was there and felt like I was going to fall asleep). I reset and tried running back into another room. There were suitcases but I didn't fit in them. I reset again and realised there was a cupboard joined to the one Sam was in. I paused and climbed up and slowly moved backwards into it. There was some stuff, including a roll of wrapping paper and I pushed it under me. The wrapping paper was between my legs and from moving back and forth I ended up coming. As I went to lock the door, the game unpaused itself. The locks didn't hold and I had to keep grabbing Sam's door and my door and closing it back up. I passed the area and continued onwards, but I can't remember what else happened."
"4163"	"(2015-05-24 (24)) I was working at this shopping centre. I wasn't supervising but I had equipment with me. There were quite a few close parking spots, so I parked and went in. Then I wasn't working and it was like a hotel or something. I can't remember what happened properly, but there was a lady with long red nails who was a werewolf. The colour red would set her off. She had some control over it, but was dangerous. I was with someone else and we went into one of the rooms. We went into the other room and there was a window at ground level with no curtains. We were scared because she was nearby and might see us. I started trying to cover myself with a blanket, but then I realised it was red. I jumped up and told the person I was with we should leave. Her husband or boyfriend was also around and we warned him (he didn't know she was a werewolf). We ran out to my car - I couldn't remember where I parked at first, but I easily found it because it was such a bright red and my licence plate was clearly 1CEZ -084 [my actual number plate] . The guy I was with jumped in the driver's seat and I was a bit annoyed because it was my car but I got in the passenger seat and gave him the keys. I told him to lock the doors but reached over myself and locked it. We drove for a while and then it was night. We stopped in the middle of the street for some reason and got out and the guy got attacked by the werewolf. She hadn't changed fully. I told her something in exchange for leaving me be, but she could only control it for so long, so I got back to the car and took off. I was meeting others somewhere nearby. I got to fork and couldn't remember if it was left or right, but I turned right. Then I was on World of Warcraft and was questing and it was like this outside area with these leafy plant creatures and a bunch of scientists. I had to kill like 40 of them."
"4164"	"(2015-05-25 (24)) There was a 'flashback' to old times (looked Roman-y). These young guys were coaxed into seeing this woman who would have sex with them and they could lose their virginity. One guy had already done it and had these spots on him, but he encouraged his friends anyway. They had to go through this portal door into this weird cave like place. I can't remember what happened exactly, but they changed their minds, panicked and went back through the door. As they did their skin began to bubble and melt off and they screamed and died."
"4165"	"(2015-05-25 (24)) It was then this Friday and I was talking to Dad about something and he mentioned some dates and it didn't seem to add up. I realised that I'd gotten my dates mixed up and missed every job on this week. I freaked out and triple checked and wondered why I hadn't been called when I hadn't shown up. I put it down to enjoying these few days off and losing track of time. I didn't know what to do about it, but was feeling stressed. Markiplier had joined our forum and had made a few computer related posts asking about stuff I didn't even understand. I thought I should delete the posts I made about him in the Celebrity Crush Thread."
"4166"	"(2015-06-26 (24)) I woke up (in apartment in Hollywood) and it was 12.45pm. It was today (going to Six Flags) and I was supposed to be up at 7am to get picked up at 9am [happening IRL] . I tried to call Winifred and had no luck, so text her saying I was getting ready. I went downstairs (place was different) and found her on another street. I said my alarm didn't go off, I have no idea how I slept that long etc. We agreed it was too late to go today and I suggested Sunday but she seemed bewildered by the idea. Then she said maybe we could go today and Sunday but then realised it would cost too much. So we decided on Sunday. Then I was back home and Mom was talking to someone about me saying that I had no sexual experience and they were like 'how do you know' and she asked me and I said 'I'm not answering that question' and then said 'no', ambiguously. Mom said that she knew people interested and she said 'Chris' (actually Matthieu) saying he liked fat girls. I was like 'ew wtf' and then thought Luisa was the skinniest person ever when we first met her. He was then over and acting weirdly and I tried to avoid him."
"4167"	"(2015-07-04 (24)) I was outside with some people and there were some dark clouds looming, and I suggested we get into this plane, which we did but this guy started flying it and I was like 'I didn't mean to fly it' and then he said something like one of the guys in the group had to die, so he parked it in this water but it was shallow so we walked out. Then everyone picked a Pokemon toy, and they had Cyndaquil, Psyduck, Mewtwo and this pink one that wasn't a real Pokemon and I chose that one."

"4169"	"(2015-07-13 (24)) I can't remember properly, but I was driving and it was flooding everywhere because it was the end of the world. But then there were zombies. The zombies were smart and could learn. They also weren't rotting and dead, they pretty much just looked normal but with blank expression. At one point I was with some others trying to hide and escape this place. I ended up at this space station place, in space, with Mom but it wasn't actually Mom. We snuck around and took these pods to this other section of it. I can't remember what we were trying to do. But we couldn't leave to get back and they'd found us."
"4170"	"(2015-07-19 (24)) I was in America with some people who I didn't know. Someone was showing me and this guy around. The guy said he was freezing because he thought he was going to Africa and didn't pack warmly, we laughed (it was winter). We were waiting outside this fancy Chinese restaurant. Then Cristian from Big Brother UK 2015 was there and he went to the bathroom to have a bath. There were windows and we saw him sitting in this spa with bubbles. Some girls went around to look through a closer window. Later, I was in a room with some people and the lights were off. I was in bed and went under the covers and I had a penis, and was masturbating. I wondered if it was big or not, so looked at it and was disappointed that it was small. Then I was somewhere outside with Cristian and Danny. I think Cristian and I ended up having sex or something. Danny came up to me and said that this meant I also fancied him and he leaned in to kiss me and I slapped him. I was smiling and joking (we were friends I guess), but said I wasn't interested and was a bit grossed out."
"4171"	"(2015-07-24 (24)) I was either on Big Brother, or knew some of the Big Brother people. I knew Helen (BBUK 2014) and we had not gotten along, but we had each other's numbers. Anyway, I was on a job that Esther was running. It was like a 2-storey chemist or Priceline. I had a text from Helen saying 'hey you should check out this website, you'll love it' and I thought it seemed spammy, but I opened the link and it was some random site. I got a call from her but couldn't take it as I was being briefed by Esther. I took her phone for some reason and also went downstairs with my phone as Helen called again and I answered. She said to ignore the text and I said 'the spammy one' and she said yeah. I said something awkwardly, but politely, like 'was there anything else' and she repeated what I said with a sound of disgust in her voice. I said 'hello?' but she didn't respond. I could hear an indicator and realised she was driving. I kept saying hello but got no answer. Then Hugo was there and a bunch of other people who turned out to be Esther's kids - one of the guys was quite attractive. They were messing around and I took out Esther's phone and took a photo of them and they wanted it deleted but I said no, and one was playfully trying to get it back and saying I'd sent it to myself and I said I hadn't, but then thought I should so I did so while they tried to get it back. Esther then came down and looked sick and then vomited quite violently. She muttered something about needing her phone and I gave it back to her."
"4172"	"(2015-07-27 (24)) I was in San Francisco and something happened and 'they' wanted to keep an eye on me, so sent PDQ to kind of kidnap me and keep eyes on me 24/7. The first place he took me was this boat or something and I tried sending information that I was 'near the bay' and that this tall building landmark was in sight. Then he took me to this safehouse place. He gave me this weird food to eat. After 48 hours or whatever, they were satisfied and let me go. PDQ said he was impressed I didn't kick up a fuss and made some weird joke about me trying to eat the lid of some food."
"4173"	"(2015-07-30 (24)) I was at the Technical College (different) and in a class that was quite full. I was sitting with Tristan and Fletcher. The lecturer was trying to find a movie that none of us had seen to assign it to a project for us. We had a 10 minute break and I got up to look at the list of movies and wrote down all the ones I hadn't seen. When everyone got back from break, they'd moved seats slightly and it was all out of whack which annoyed me. Next door was a barn with horses and cows and they were making noises and we looked out and saw they were feeding. Later, there was some bad guy and some obstacles. The bad guy took off down this zipline but we'd been warned some of them were 'fake' and would disappear part way, I sent one off to see what would happen and it disappeared. A girl carefully used her fingers to slide across and another girl decided to copy her but she fell in halfway and died (there was like acid or something). Nearby was more acid and some pipes that you had to balance across. Tristan got on without shoes and I commented on it as he was making his way down and he said something like he'd be ok and then he toppled over and fell in."
"4174"	"(2015-08-04 (24)) I vaguely remember something similar to It Follows. I was in this building with some others and the 'It' couldn't get you if you were in the light but it could be in the shadows and it also had 'powers' that could turn off lights. Every time it appeared it would just keep coming towards you, staring at you and it was really scary."
"4175"	"(2015-08-05 (24)) We had just moved into a new house. It was huge and lots of bedrooms. I was trying to decide which one I wanted. Mom and Darren were acting weird and looked upset. Mom said something and I didn't hear it so asked her to repeat it and she was like 'don't worry about it' but I asked again and she said she and Darren had decided to break up. Then she started crying. I went away and was annoyed and a bit upset because I was confused about what we would do since he paid all the bills."
"4176"	"(2015-08-07 (24)) I was married to this chubby-ish guy who looked like AJ Bowen. He went to have a shower, and I got naked and lay on the bed on my stomach. He got out of the shower and saw me and climbed on top. He was moving, but his penis wasn't going in and I was thinking 'how small is he?'. I tried moving myself and grabbing it and pushing it inside me, but he couldn't get it back in. [In real life, I half woke up as I orgasmed, but promptly fell back asleep and returned to the dream] . I was really horny and annoyed. I whispered to him to turn over, he didn't hear me and I said it again. He got up and I turned around but he left the room. I didn't know where he went off too and I checked to see if he'd come, but he hadn't. Then I was at home, which was like the old house. I looked out the window and saw Mom walking down the driveway so I assumed they were leaving. I had this big box full of sex toys and I got this suction cap dildo and put it on my chair and sat on it and bounced up and down fast, which made a bit of noise because of the chair, but I came quickly. I got up and the suction cap was on the chair but no dildo and it was still inside me. It was covered in cum and slippery and sticky. I didn't know how to reattach the two, so I got a tissue to wipe them down and then put all of them back in the box. I then heard talking from somewhere in the house and realised they were home, but I didn't know if they'd been back the whole time. I also noticed my door wasn't closing, if I tried to lock it, it would still pop back open. It just kept opening inwards. After packing everything away, I told them and Darren came to have a look at it. He knew what the problem was and said it was an insurance issue so he couldn't touch it and had to call out certain people to take a look."
"4177"	"(2015-08-12 (24)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and much bigger. We all went into a classroom and Ms Nowak was teaching us, but I thought it was supposed to be Screen Studies and I asked a couple of people and then someone asked her and she said Mr Hoover was sick, so she was doing a class similar to hers. Everyone left early and we ended up in a computer class. I was next to Tristan. I left the room to do something and when I came back Classmate-M-01 was sitting at my computer playing what looked like Solitaire. I went up to ask him to move and then decided to just sit at a different computer, but then I realised I was still logged on on that one so I sat in a chair and pulled up next to him and realised he was playing Runescape and I said 'no-one plays Runescape anymore' and told him to get off my computer. He slowly did and I went about my business. I was also browsing the forum. I left the room again for something and all these people had this printed out screenshot from the forum of Elmer saying something weird. I started grabbing all the pieces of paper and I was really angry and maybe embarrassed about it. I found Classmate-M-01 and yelled at him about it. Then I walked back around to the classroom and I saw Tristan sitting on a bench in a hall. I got to the classroom and no-one was there and it was locked. I went back to Tristan and he was like 'just leave it and get it tomorrow'. Then I can't remember what happened but we left the building briefly and when we returned it was like an abandoned building. Leaves were everywhere, dust covered everything, windows and walls were broken etc. It was dark and creepy. I noticed that the lighting was really bad (as if it were a film with bad lighting), but that it added to the creepiness. We returned to the classroom and there was a big woosh of wind as I opened the doors (it was like two big doors) as if they were going to shut on us, but they didn't. Everything was old in the room too; smashed windows, leaves blowing about and it was like it hadn't been touched in years. I got my bag from under the desk I was at and we went to leave. Not sure what happened next but we were outside and Tristan had been acting weird and then he was evil and was doing this evil grin and it was really dark so I couldn't see his face, just a bit of his chin and the rest was under exposed from the bad lighting. I was trying to get away from him but didn't know where to go."
"4178"	"(2015-08-21 (24)) I was in Bali, staying in these weird cabin hut things. A group of people were outside at night on the beach singing Agadoo and doing the dance and I joined in. I posted on the forum what I was doing. Then it was day and Bali was close by, like a few km away. I could see the city from where I was. There was a tidal wave which was small and got bigger. I climbed a tree or building or something to get higher. I managed to get over to the other side eventually but the world had been overtaken by creatures and bad dudes. Then it was normal and I was waiting outside an apartment block thing and Cecelia and Fletcher came out. I was waiting in the passenger seat of a car. Someone said Judah wasn't here yet and I got excited because I didn't know he was coming. I turned around at one point and saw him and someone else waiting behind the car."
"4179"	"(2015-09-02 (24)) I went somewhere for a party thing or something. It wasn't anything big or fancy. I was there early and saw someone wearing a shirt that said 'Stephen Merchant' on it and then I realised it was Stephen Merchant. I walked up excitedly and was like 'omg I don't want to sound weird but I'm a big fan' and he was happy to chat with me. He got a bit drunk and started coming on to me a bit strong and I pushed him away and left. Then I wondered why I was pushing him away since I'd wanted that for so long, but I didn't want a random drunken fumble. When I went back later, he was gentler and whispered an apology in my ear."
"4180"	"(2015-09-02 (24)) I was at the Technical College and it was today, but they said the 'downstairs' studio was free and we'd all be going down there and could shoot. The 'upstairs' studio (the 'main' one) was bigger than the real-life one and had these big light boxes which could change colour and do disco type lights. This was where we were going to shoot. The downstairs one was smaller and didn't have any fancy stuff. We'd only booked a camera as we were only going to be rehearsing and we weren't allowed to add any more equipment as they'd need to bring in a lawyer. We just went along with rehearsing. Cecelia looked like she'd dyed half her hair blue (top front half, and a few inches of side), but it was just a cloth. We set up lights (which we somehow had now) and Cecelia did the first bit of the song (guitar intro), then we stopped the music and went to this outside area. Tristan and Juniper were also there, but I don't remember seeing the others. We spent so much time doing nothing and then it was time for lunch and Tristan left. Juniper's Facebook 'About Me' bit said something about how she didn't like when people compared the living conditions in third world countries to living in Midvale (regarding trash)."
"4181"	"(2015-09-02 (24)) I went to this shop and it was weird and like a circle but only had one entrance. There were drunk people everywhere and I had to talk through this group and a guy told me to 'lick and wipe my chin' and I instinctively wiped it, but then they said it was because a guy was turned on by that. I just kept walking. It was kind of dusk outside, and I went to my car and got in and locked the door. I felt uneasy. I left but I was followed by two other cars, with people whooping and driving crazy. I had to drive crazy to get away and then it was like a game and I was smashing into things and doing spins and so forth. I can't remember what else happened."
"4182"	"(2015-09-08 (24)) Mom, Ezra and I went to Red Rooster and we let this girl who was walking in front of us (in the drive thru). We ordered 3 chicken 'rolls' (actually wraps) and chips. We were waiting for like 40 minutes, apparently because the girl in front of us had ordered 10 burgers and they could only cook one patty at a time and they took 7 minutes each. Later we were at home. Some people were staying over, including the Hulk. We went into the bedroom for some reason and he was lying in bed (as Hulk) masturbating. We were like 'argh, Hulk!' and walked out and when we went back in he was back to normal (as Mark Ruffalo) and we talked to him briefly and left."
"4183"	"(2015-09-08 (24)) I was at a party, lots of people were there from the Technical College. Frederick was there and was really drunk. I wasn't drinking and was sitting at a table by myself. He came over and started flirting with me, openly saying 'I'm drunk, so I'm flirty' and wouldn't leave me alone. I just kept saying 'go away, Frederick'. He kept harassing me, which was annoying but it was also funny so I started giggling at one point which spurred him on. He opened some food thing (mayo) and it got in my hair. I went to the bathroom and locked the door and went to take a shower, and he was hanging around outside still."
"4184"	"(2015-09-08 (24)) I had posted a video of a video Dan Palmer had posted, saying something about him being hot. When I checked the video next, I saw that he had specifically requested it to not be able to see it. I felt really bad and was sad that it'd bothered him so much. When I checked the button to 'ignore' something, you had to say why and one of the options was 'stalking'. I deleted the video and was trying to think of some way to fix things."
"4185"	"(2015-09-10 (24)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were in class. I was wearing my Good Advice shirt. Judah came in and said to us to meet him outside in a few minutes. Fletcher and I left but he wasn't there. We went downstairs and found him sitting in a chair. Other people were gathered nearby. Cecelia joined us. It was all the 'new' S+S crew, and we were getting some forms. At one point Judah was mimicking that Citizen Kane clap, which we thought was hilarious. We started putting some stuff away and had to put it in the toilets, but it was now like a shop. The toilets were all closed so we had to keep looking. Later, it changed to a spooky abandoned house. We were looking for people, but we'd hear them call out and then not hear from them again. It ended up being just me and one other person and we were calling out to someone and they called back and I started following the voice but the other person I was with said don't follow it. I left the house, and then it was a movie and the whole thing was actually taking place in someone's head - there had been a bus crash with one survivor and she was calling to the other people to keep them awake, and their voices had disappeared as they'd died/fallen asleep. Then it was real life and I was the survivor and the rest had been Good Advice crew. The last girl I'd been calling to was near the front and she had died. I went around the back and found Judah and lifted his arm off the floor and then he woke up and I was glad he was alive, but then I checked the girl next to him and she was alive too, and then the rest of the row started waking up. I wanted it to just be us two who had survived."
"4186"	"(2015-09-15 (24)) I was rewatching The Babadook. It was the same creature, but a different film. It started off in this creepy and dark lounge room of an apartment and there was a boy talking and a face appeared about behind the curtains and ducked behind it again. I was thinking it seemed a lot better than I remembered and was actually creepy."
"4187"	"(2015-09-15 (24)) I was in class, but everyone kept leaving and some guy was going to McDonald's and was going to get everyone breakfast, but then he only had 20c left, so I opened my wallet and had lots of coins, so gave him a whole bunch of 20c and 50c and said I wanted a plain Sausage McMuffin and as he walked out I added 'and a hash brown'. When I went back to class I noticed everyone had gone (Tristan and a few others had left with the McDonald's guy). I was annoyed I hadn't gone now. The teacher asked if I wanted to talk to Cecelia and I said 'where is she' and she was lying under a table I was standing next to. Cecelia shook her head and I said to the teacher that 'I think Cecelia needs to work things out on her own'. Some time later I was told the guy was back and I went looking for him and found him outside somewhere. I had to keep asking people where he was and they kept referring to my McMuffin as ""Izzy's pancakes"" which confused me. When I finally found him, it was a muffin. Some people were playing with one of those things that spins a tennis ball around and you hit it. I ate my muffin in my car and I took off my bra for some reason. I was trying to put it back on, but people kept coming up to me. I tried to hide it and then when I got a spare moment was trying to get it on. I ended up driving to this toilet which was called the philosophical something because it had philosophical quotes on it, but the seats were sinks and were up high. I sat on the floor of a cubicle trying to get the bra done (the cubicles were tiny), and I also needed to pee badly but the seats overflowed with water and were dirty, so I was using paper towel to dry it off. People were peeking in through the main door and asking why I was on the floor and what was wrong. I jumped up and said I was drying the toilet seat and they were all like 'oh she's ok' and came piling into the toilet, taking the other cubicles. I got out of that one and went into the shower cubicle as it had a higher door. People still kept harassing me and watching me and I ended up screaming at this one girl saying 'I will literally kill you'."
"4188"	"(2015-09-17 (24)) I was at this weird place which is hard to describe because I'm not exactly sure what it was. Dan Palmer was there and we were flirting and messing around. He got into a bed at one point and told me to get in. I climbed in and he started kissing me. He climbed on top of me and we had sex. Later I was with some people and all I could think was 'I had sex with Dan Palmer!' and was overly excited and happy about this, but didn't tell anyone."
"4189"	"(2015-10-04 (24)) I was at the Technical College and it was Thursday. It was different, and on Thursdays we had this math class, but we had only attended the first 3 or so and then skipped the rest. I decided to go today, but Tristan and the others decided to skip it and go to this cinema on campus. I realised I'd forgotten my calculator and was contemplating skipping it when I got a text from Tristan saying there was some event on at the cinema, so I text back 'link?' and he sent me a link and it was this thing with Dan Palmer in it. It was a short film/music video that he was in and then a film. I went and bought a ticket but then forgot what session it was for and the time was wrong on the ticket. I asked the guy standing around and he said it was for 11am and it was about 11.15am now. I quickly ran in, but the film had already started and I'd missed the music video - which was something I'd been wanting to see for a while so I was annoyed."
"4190"	"(2015-10-07 (24)) We were in OHS class and Mr Jennings told Tristan that he would be failing him for being slack and talking too much in class. Tristan left and was really depressed. I tried to convince Mr Jennings that it was unfair and that he'd worked hard on the music video and did all his homework. Later I was collecting those Monopoly stickers from McDonald's cups I found around the place."
"4191"	"(2015-10-08 (24)) We still lived at the old house. Something happened and Dad was dying and we thought it was supposed to today, but he was ok. The next morning, he was dead. I woke up (my room was the old office) and Ezra had posted all this stuff of us with Dad when we were little with RIP's. I left my room and discovered Ezra had left his body in bed and hadn't done anything about it yet. Mom came over and I started crying and she hugged me and said it would be ok and I said 'no it won't'."
"4192"	"(2015-10-14 (24)) I was a 'guy'. I was in my house with some other family members and my girlfriend, who was Sara Paxton, was in a bedroom and was sick. I knew she was infected with a zombie virus and would change soon. I was trying to gather up important stuff and leave. I went into my bedroom which was across from the bedroom she was in, and someone else went in there. He came out and I saw a bit of his ear was missing and I realised he'd been bitten and she was a zombie. I went into my room and closed the door, but he changed and they both tried to get in and I couldn't hold the door closed. Then it 'reset'. I tried once again to gather my stuff and leave. I packed up my laptop and went to put it in my car, as Paxton came out of the room as a zombie. I went outside and it was night, and the driver's door was open. I saw a lady grabbing something out of my car and I ran down to her yelling, as she ran off. I was close to catching her and I think she had my wallet."
"4193"	"(2015-10-15 (24)) These 'evil' doubles were taking over people [watched The Broken last night, similar concept] . They had a tell though; if they met your eyes, they would smile and nod twice. A group of others and I were pretending that we were one of them and trying to escape this place. I can't remember much now, but it was quite scary."
"4194"	"(2015-10-20 (24)) I rewatched The Babadook but it was a different movie; a guy was alone in his house and it was dark and stormy outside. He could hear this banging outside and he thought someone was out there messing with his head. It kept cutting to these 'flat' 2001 A Space Odyssey-like images of the sky and clouds, in different colours (purple was the most prominent), with lighting flashes and thunder. At the end of the film, it turns out the banging was a plastic bag attached to a fence that was blowing around in the wind. But it had been so tense and you were sure someone was trying to get in. I then 'woke up' and was telling someone about the dream and how it was such a cool story, so I was going to write it into a script. Then I was somewhere with Tristan and Cecelia. Tristan had cupcakes and gave us one each. They were really nice cupcakes. There was a room with a bunch of my stuff in storage and Cecelia wanted to look at it and she pulled out an old school book which said 'year 16' but it was from 2003, but I had quotes from How I Met Your Mother on it, although they were made up quotes like 'Marbles'. She said she thought it was a surprisingly good show for most of it and I agreed. We went to a cinema and I saw a movie and then was packing up all my stuff and was going to go buy a ticket for The Martian, when the people for the next session - which was The Martian - came in, including Cecelia, so I pretended I already had a ticket and just sat back down. Later, I was walking on the road and I wasn't sure where I was. There was rain coming and there were these 'blocks' in a column which showed what kind of rain each bit held. There were lots of alternating purple ones and I wasn't sure what that meant and was worried it was an electrical storm. There were a few sparse houses on one side of the road, but there was a 'blow up' toilet on the other, I ducked into that as the purple block hit and it was just 'lots of rain'. But I couldn't close the door and had to try and hold it shut and the rain kept coming in and hitting me. I was also trying to get my phone out to call Mom to get me, when I saw a police car coming past, so I ran out to the road and waved my hands and he stopped. I quickly looked back into the toilet to see if I'd left anything and he started taking off, but I started running down the road after him and he stopped again. I got in and there were some other people in there. I quickly explained that I was lost and couldn't contact my Mom, but they were in a rush to get somewhere so didn't really care. Not sure where we went from there. Later, I was in with Cecelia, Tristan and Juniper. Juniper was a vegetarian and wanted us to join her in some protest thing. We were in some place with chickens. Rover was there and he picked up this fat chick (which was brown/black and bigger than a regular chick) by the feathers on its back and I told him to put it down and he brought it over to me and put it on my lap as if it was a present. I thought it was cute. All these chickens were scheduled to be slaughtered next month and Juniper wanted us to stop it. Then I was in a car with Tristan, Cecelia and maybe someone else. We were on a long drive in the middle of nowhere and were stopping at every petrol station. We got to one and these 2 guys - one blonde and one black haired - came and Cecelia had dated one some time ago. They were douchebags. They turned up at the next one as well, and we noticed they had a gun. My card wasn't working and Cecelia had to pay for something for me that was $20.10. We got back to the car and they 'jokingly' held the gun up at the car. We were worried they would do something at the next station. Then there was another car with Technical College people, including Jolene, but their car was full of Skittles and something else, so a bunch of them piled into ours and then we were squished. We then were on a lake and in a boat. They were throwing things at us from another boat. They were all lying down paddling and I hid behind this thing at the back. They realised we were hiding and got these long sticks and punctured the boat and were trying to get us with it. I got hold of it and hit him with it and he went flying. I kept hitting him and he was hitting other things and his legs and arms were all bent back and he was covered in blood. Eventually he was dead."
"4195"	"(2015-10-27 (24)) I was at this hotel on an island. It was a big hotel with 100 floors or so. Spaceman was with me and the hotel had served alligator or crocodile and I'd fed him some, but he was sick. I got on the elevator and took him to floor 100 which had a vet. Later, an alligator/crocodile was loose in the hotel and killing people. I went back to the 100th floor to get Spaceman so we could escape, but the whole floor was covered in ice. People were frozen in ice columns on the wall. I found Spaceman and put him in the elevator, but saw the alligator/crocodile coming towards me and I ran into the elevator, scaring Spaceman and causing him to run out, but I had to close the door and leave. Then it was a year later or something and we returned. There were actually multiple alligators/crocodiles and they still hadn't gotten rid of all of them, but they had started to rebuild parts of the hotel. I was exploring in one of these half rebuilt areas and I saw a cat and then I saw Spaceman and it turned out there was a female cat and they had had kittens. I was happy he was ok."
"4196"	"(2015-10-31 (24)) I was in this house but people from class were there. Most of them were sitting around a table in a kitchen, which was also the main room/where the front door was. It was morning, but it was really dark. I went to check my phone and I had almost no battery and realised the cord must've fallen out last night. Because it was 'morning', I needed the phone for the whole day and then for Good Advice later. I asked if anyone had a Windows phone charger and Fernando said he did, but his phone looked strange so I asked to look at the input and it was almost the length of the phone and completely different. I tried to call Mom so she could bring it but either she wouldn't answer or the signal was going funny. I went outside and was walking up and down the street trying to call. It was very dark and definitely looked like night. A man's voice from the shadows said 'are you a boy or a girl?' and I quickly walked back to the house. Finally there was an answer on the other end but it was a creepy guy's voice. I checked the number stored in my phone and it looked strange, so I tried calling her number but couldn't remember what it was. Then there were also two kids at the house, but they went missing. I turned my back for 3 seconds at one point and when I turned back around they were gone. As we looked for them, other people went missing. We closed the front door, which we had had open, but people were still disappearing. Soon, only three of us were left. The lights kept turning off and we had to keep turning them on. I suggested we make sure we're always touching or in sight, but one of the guys went around a corner and disappeared. The other guy and I held hands and I switched on the kitchen light and I went to close the kitchen door which had opened again, but he went around the corner to close another door and we lost grip for a split second, but when he grabbed my hand again it was really tight and when I walked back to see him, it was this scary person with white hair (kind of spiky out to the sides), with dark rings around their eyes and a kind of 'dead' looking face. I tried to scream, but no noise was coming out except for a couple of squeaks. I started to wake up, but not quite so I kept trying to force out a scream to wake myself up and eventually did."
"4197"	"(2015-11-07 (24)) I met up with Bullfrog and Zamir. Bullfrog arrived last and looked and sounded exactly like Fletcher. He was really creepy though and I thought he was going to kill me. I kept wondering why I met up with him."
"4198"	"(2015-11-08 (24)) We were waiting in a classroom, which was just this big room with not much in it. Fletcher had posted a picture of a bunch of us, including Brock, and Brock sent him a message to ask to take it down because it was a bad picture of him. He looked different in it. People were lying on the floor, and I lay down too and I said it looks like we've all just crawled up and died. Tristan took a photo of us. Then Mr Norcross finally arrived and we had to go to this computer lab to look at our footage from The Interview [assessment was on Friday] . I went to sit next to Fletcher, but someone took the chair as I went to sit down. I grabbed another seat. Tristan was last in and had to sit away from us. The computers were old and I was like 'what is this, Windows 98?' and then saw it was Windows 95. Because they were so old they couldn't run the software to look at the footage and we had to load up something else instead. I couldn't remember how to do anything and I had to go to some setting and choose 'full bean', which loaded up a list of applications. Then I was playing a game which was playing out in real life. It started with you out the front of a huge mansion/house. It was a game which had multiple storylines and endings. I first went left into the forest and into this little house. It was then night and also dark inside. The house was against a wall, but the front side of the house was all windows. It was only one room, the front door went to a little kitchen which then opened out to a living area. A warning came up to say a werewolf was outside and I tried to stay still but it noticed me and I failed. For the next start I went into the house. I was running through this open space which looked sort of like halls of a shopping centre. I went into this room and Sam Raimi was in there. He was like part of the game. He was talking about being in some movie when he was younger and not being adorable and I said 'oh Sam Raimi, you are adorable'. Then there were these creepy people at the door - they were wearing masks and had this long hair. I was trying to climb to this top shelf. I got up there but then the stuff on the shelf was suddenly those heads with the mask and hair and I was thrashing my arms about knocking them all off and I reset. I went back to the little house in the woods and this time crouched down on the floor, hiding behind the fridge and the cabinet. The werewolf came and was sniffing around and then someone came and shot it. It suddenly became day and the werewolf changed back to a human, but was dead."
"4199"	"(2015-11-11 (24)) I was at the Technical College. Everyone had to make an individual short film as well as the chosen ones and we had no idea how we were going to find time for it. Judah said most people did theirs on the weekend or over the holiday and submitted it in January. I put down Cecelia and Tristan as my crew and we were trying to think of ideas and Cecelia jokingly suggested this ad one where the girl says something like 'findmymusic.com' and flips her hair and pours water on her, but it was actually an already existing jokey ad. At some point Fletcher and I were somewhere with Co-Worker-M-04 and he said something like 'you two are like you have a crush on each other and sometimes think about it but then realise it would be weird and never do anything about it' and it was 'true' in my case in the dream and I started giggling and saying 'nooo'. We walked off and Fletcher was like 'we don't' and I said 'yep I know'. Later, Judah was dressed as Shaun from Shaun of the Dead, with a cricket bat attached to the front of him. A zombie invasion occurred and he had a gun and was owning all the zombies, so we were sticking with him. I accidentally pushed him at some point and he was very solid."
"4200"	"(2015-11-15 (24)) I was at a shop with Mom. We were sitting on this seat which was near a table and chairs. Some posh people sat down at the table and this girl had a little dog with a mane of hair that had been crimped. Mom hadn't seen it but began talking about how disgusting it was when people did things like straighten their dog's hair. I got up and walked out of their eyesight and started miming the cut-throat action to tell her to stop. She stopped before she actually said anything and changed the subject. Later I returned and Mom said the posh people had made fun of me leaving and that it had something to do with my hair. I was wearing my Good Advice crew shirt and I saw Judah at the shop also wearing his crew shirt. He acknowledged me and later I was saying something about something 'sucking balls' while he was nearby."
"4201"	"(2015-11-17 (24)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were getting marked on everything. We went to camera and Mr Norcross said 'who wants to go first?' and Juniper said she would because she thought she would get a high mark and he displayed her mark and it was 38%. Then he put everyone's up and I got 67 and Tristan had 77 and I was annoyed he got higher than me. But later he put them up again and they'd changed, mine was 68 and Tristan's was now 35. He didn't clarify what happened. We went to editing later and it was like a bar and Teacher-F-01 had these hats behind the bar that were to protest something about freeing chickens. A few people were wearing them and I said I wanted one and she gave one to me. Later, Fletcher was hanging around me and being weird. He was like saying he loved me but in a jokey way. I was sitting down with him at one point and he started trying to put his hand on my leg and kiss me and I kept pushing him away and being like, jokingly 'what the hell are you doing?'."
"4202"	"(2015-11-23 (24)) I was at school, though it was different. We had to nominate 3 people for something or other. I was in the room where the ballots were submitted with Tristan and Fletcher. Judah came in with his form and I saw that he'd written two people I didn't know in spots 1 and 3, but Tristan was in spot 2 (misspelled as Allan) and the reason was like 'he is my backup in Good Advice'. I was annoyed because I can do all the same stuff. I hadn't decided on who I was going to choose. Fletcher and I were with Frederick at some point and Fletcher was saying stuff about dating me or liking me or something but saying it like hypothetically, though admitting that was how he felt too. Later, we were doing the promo ad but it was for a guy who had this bottleshop. I was the only one there and he got me to dress up like an employee and stand at the counter and shot some stuff really quickly. He showed me the footage and it looked good and I said maybe some more cutaways. I said I'd go back in this room and have a look and see what we can add. I was then with Fletcher and I posted on Facebook saying 'I wish I had someone else here'. Then other people were there, including Tristan. The guy had these horses and I took one of their ropes and started to lead it away when I heard him telling the others to not touch the horses and I tried to tie the rope back but couldn't and the horse was getting agitated and I had to tell the guy about it. I didn't know if the ad was for the bottleshop or a particular drink and the guy looked annoyed and said it was the drink."
"4203"	"(2015-11-28 (24)) I was at the McDonald's on Beaufort street, except it was different and I was in America. Rover was also with me. There were lots of dogs there and they all looked very similar to Rover. It was very busy, and I found a seat outside at a little table with an umbrella. I saw Harvey Keitel walking around and he had this weird ring on his little finger. He came over to me and said something and chuckled. He was talking to me for a while and then we talked about Rover. I think I came back a second time and he was there again. This time I was trying to point out which one was Rover but I couldn't tell. He said 'you couldn't even tell which one's your dog' and I said 'yes I can, I just haven't found him yet'. When I did find him, Keitel made Rover follow him into this truck and took off. I tried to chase it, but it was too fast. I think I then 'woke up' and kept reciting the dream in my head, especially the fact it was at McDonald's Beaufort street, but in America. Then it kept like melding between reality and the dream. There was a picture of me, Fletcher, Tristan and Frederick where we were in a room and had posed in positions that were also reflected in the mirrors, so there were 2 of us. Except for Frederick, who was in the window. We were talking in a group on Facebook and Fletcher posted a link to all these notes I'd written which had been private and I had no idea how he got them. One was a list of the guys in my class from one year, ranked in attractiveness and other things like that. I deleted it and was like wtf. I had a message from Mason on Facebook, to a group we were in but I didn't remember being in that group, and was complaining about a job he got put on which was putting bottle caps onto bottles, which he implied I was also on. Then I was on a job with Hugo, who looked younger and shorter and because I knew it was a dream world [I wasn't lucid, I'm not really sure what it was] I tried to change him to look like he normally does. But he kept noticing his height changing so I was trying to be subtle about it. Then we were trapped where we were and needed to stay somewhere. There was this school place with dorms that we could stay in. The guy one had a lot of bunk beds around the walls, but no-one was sleeping on the top ones. We soon discovered it was because of this horrendous wind that came blowing every now and then. It was blowing as I left that one to go the girl one. The girl room was a lot smaller and had less beds. There weren't any free, so I had to wait for a new one."
"4204"	"(2015-12-02 (24)) I was parked at the office which looked similar, but was more cottage-like and in a different location. Someone parked there who wasn't meant to be there and I tried to convince them to leave. It was night and quite dark. I left, but then I think it was day. I was driving down this street a little fast and I was approaching a red light, and the left lane had a few cars in it so I changed to the right lane but I didn't quite realise it was red and went straight through and realising my mistake I instantly pulled over, and a cop car pulled up behind me with its lights and siren on. I told the policeman I had seen the green light ahead and gotten confused and didn't know what I was thinking. He seemed to consider letting me off, but then gave me a $200 fine. I was annoyed about the fine and also having a blemish on my record."
"4205"	"(2015-12-05 (24)) I was with a friend on this underwater ship. I can't remember why or what we were doing on there. At some point we went outside briefly and I had a watermelon. The water started to go down and we were somehow informed that the ocean was losing all of its water briefly. Then we were on the ground with the ship. It just looked like a road, it was completely flat and was painted on. There were walls all around it. The sun was quite bright. There was a big storm coming [I woke up earlier to hear talk of a storm coming] and would replace all the water. We saw some big clouds forming in the sky, and a weird dark cloud low down. I went back into the ship, but then it showed that the weird cloud was actually a giant turtle on a section of Earth. It fell and landed on the ship, crushing half of it, then the turtle rolled off and the Earth rolled over to crush the other side of the ship. I was then outside and 'I' had gone in, but I was another version of me. I told my friend we couldn't go back to the ship and had to find somewhere to go before the storm started. We found a blow-up water toy thing which you could get inside, so we climbed into that (you had to lie down in it), but his side had a broken zip, so we rolled it up and held it. It started to rain and we realised this was no good. We were then somehow on the street and there were shops nearby. I suggested going to Kathmandu to get a boat [they don't sell boats] . It was raining quite hard outside and all these famous people and people I knew were around. My friend was then Nathan Fillion. I saw Mr Hoover walking down a road at some point."
"4206"	"(2015-12-14 (24)) The house was different and we had these 'bumpy' walls, like you'd find on the outside. We'd covered them in something to avoid ants, but it had attracted ants instead. I had gone to sleep and woke up to lots of ants on the walls and they'd laid eggs in my hair, which were deep on the roots and I was pulling them out."
"4207"	"(2015-12-15 (24)) Most of the people from Good Advice went to a fish and chip restaurant. We had a 4 person table and a 2 person table. Tristan sat at the 2 person table on the other side of the room and I sat on the other table. Frederick was there as well. I got a chicken burger."
"4208"	"(2015-12-16 (24)) I had a boyfriend and we were out driving one night. It was quite late and I was a bit tired, but we decided to have sex in the car, somewhere. We went to the carpark of a hospital and parked up. We climbed into the back seat and he put a condom on, but people kept walking past the car and we would just pretend to be sleeping. There were too many people and I said we should try somewhere else. I suggested Meadowbrook or Uptown carpark. So we went to somewhere like that and got back into the back. He had his shirt off and I was kissing his chest and getting lower and was slowly grinding him as well."
"4209"	"(2015-12-16 (24)) I went to some science school thing. It was very secure. I was in the lobby area and no-one was there. I looked behind the desk area, which had a glass window showing another area, and I saw a guy walking away from me. I knocked on the door and he turned around and looked at me. He explained to us they'd accidentally released some zombie virus. I can't remember exactly what was said, but it was contagious through a weird way. It could be instantly transferred through a bite or whatever, but you could get infected and it wouldn't take hold until a certain thing set it off (think it had something to do with a kind of food). He couldn't leave the quarantined area because he was infected, but it hadn't been set off. We left and walked past another area of the school where some of the scientists seemed to be just working as usual and we realised it had only just happened. As we were leaving we saw zombies coming out of the area and we got to this huge shopping centre. At the top was some kind of helicopter ride. We started making our way up there and as we got a few storeys up, we saw the zombies starting to come in to the shop. We got to the top and they said they had one more space in a helicopter and my group sent me. But they let me and this guy, who was my boyfriend or something, on and still had another spot, which they didn't fill. The helicopter started flying and flew out this window, but then it stalled and started to fall. This had happened before and I grabbed a railing on a building outside and this gave it enough time to start spinning fast enough to fly. When we came back from the ride, everybody was gone. We collected a few chocolates and things from the shop and went outside. I said ""it's a ghost town"" and started singing the song 'Ghost Town' by The Specials. We wondered if it was because we were in a 'desert town' and had gone to find more people or if they would come out at night or something. We did come across some at some point and found these outside showers and covered ourselves in water because we thought they wouldn't see us and they didn't seem to be able to, but we were worried it would evaporate quickly."
"4210"	"(2015-12-19 (24)) I was put on two jobs on the same day. One in Rivervale with Hector and one at Brookland High School with Esther. I went to the school in the morning and then wondered when I was supposed to be at Rivervale. I noticed I had a new job booking with just the Rivervale job, but wasn't sure if it was correct. Esther said she would have a look at the job sheet, but for some reason it was locked and she couldn't access it. The school was different and we were set up in the 'office', which was next to the canteen. I remembered it was school holidays and there wouldn't be any students. Esther and everyone else disappeared and I was wandering around waiting. I got a muffin from the canteen and started eating it, then wasn't sure if the guy had given it to me for free or not, so I asked how much it was and gave him the money. Esther returned and said the job had been cancelled because of some issues with the file."
"4211"	"(2015-12-21 (24)) I can't remember why, though I kept thinking it had something to do with Big Brother, but Tristan and I ended up in this little hallway with 8 rooms that were 'mirrored'. I chose #4 because I 'liked the number' and Tristan chose another on the same side. We wondered what the mirroring meant. Frederick went to Russia and we wondered why, but he had been in this movie and his leading lady was Russian and we deduced he'd had an affair. When we jokingly mentioned it to someone, there were apparently rumours about it and this had confirmed it. I was in New York or something and staying with these people. I was given a room close to everything, but then this lady moved me to the end room. She was trying to rush me but I was trying to log off the computer and she was like 'oh, you have an account' and I thought maybe she was planning something dodgy but this ruined her plans. The room I went to and the house was similar to our place in Parkville. The room was big though and had three different curtains and I was trying to pull them all to cover the window. I could see the city and it was a dark night, so I could see all the lights and it looked similar to my town. Then it was like a movie and this young girl was looking after this old guy in bed as he was coughing and having pains. I think it was her father. Later, she was in bed coughing as he looked after her. It turned out they were 'emotional vampires', though actually took blood from people using these sucker things and they were immortal. I was sitting on a chair somewhere and there were these starfish. They moved really slowly and would like put one of their 'feet' up and stay there for like 10 seconds and then move it. One started climbing up the chair and touched me and I freaked out and jumped up."
"4212"	"(2015-12-22 (24)) Tristan and I were on Big Brother. There were actual housemates and also people from the Technical College. Everyone was up for eviction, but people were choosing people to un-nominate. There were eventually 4 of us left, including me. There were over 20 people in the house. I joined the others and they said the four of us left would have to nominate in front of everyone, but then they made us all sit around the edge of the wall (there was a ledge/seat around it), and called out people's names and we put our hands up if we wanted to nominate them. Aisleyne and Nikki were there. I was telling them about how the outside world felt about them but then realised it was outside information and stopped. When they said Lea's name, I put my hand up and was thinking she would definitely go over me."
"4213"	"(2015-12-23 (24)) I can't remember properly, but people were doing this weird jokey thing of asking someone on a date because you got something at the end. Troy (Community) was asking me about it and then asked me and I said no and we both laughed. I said to ask Abed. There were some big vibrators nearby and someone had changed the batteries recently and I was joking with them that they didn't know where they'd been. Victor (BB5) was in a shop and this girl who liked him was trying to get with him. She was fat and ugly, but nice, and so he was trying to politely reject her. She was rubbing herself on his groin area and he looked uncomfortable."
"4214"	"(2015-12-24 (24)) I was at the train station and I saw Dan Palmer there. I was trying to avoid eye contact and to not get his attention, but he had seen me. My train came and I waited for ages and then got on. The doors closed a bit later and I was annoyed he wasn't on the same train, but then I saw him behind some people. He ended up coming down my way and was talking to him. I asked him if FrightFest started today and he said 'no, tomorrow'."
"4215"	"(2016-01-02 (24)) I was doing some contract work and I was working at this government/army office place. Tristan was also there. I was sitting at a desk and looked behind and saw an GBCS sticker and I was like 'do we stocktake here?' and then a few minutes later, a group of stocktakers came through the door. Mason was the supervisor, but I didn't recognise anyone else. I waved and made a joke like 'see I had a legit reason to not to do this job, because I'm working somewhere else'. Something happened and there were zombies, but they would get a little octopus attached to the back of their head when they were turned into a zombie. The octopus would also glow. The zombies would sleep in between attacks and if someone came near they would wake up and attack. Some of it got closed off and we had to kill all of them and open the doors to get out. I got separated from a big group, who got through while I got left behind. Though they hadn't all been killed. Tristan was in the group ahead and was right next to the big open door to the outside."
"4216"	"(2016-01-12 (24)) I was outside on a road at night. I think it was Wanneroo Road. There was no-one driving on it, but there were cars in heaps everywhere and lots of trucks on their sides (lots of those fuel tank types). At one point they all started going up in flames and I was trying to run around them and get to safety. Later, there were zombies or something and we were trying to sneak around."
"4217"	"(2016-01-13 (24)) We were staying at a house. Fletcher had his camera and kept leaving it in places recording which was annoying us. At one point I was trying to take it to do something with it, but realised it was recording, so I took it and trimmed the video to take me out of it but as I was putting it back he came in and I tried to delete all of it saying I just wanted to play with it. Later I was watching a monitor with like live camera footage. I saw one of Cecelia and another girl hanging in a closet and I got some people and ran down. We took them down and tried to untie the knots. Cecelia was still alive, but was paralyzed (we thought perhaps temporarily, but we weren't sure and she lay crying on the bed)."
"4218"	"(2016-01-21 (24)) It was our first day back at the Technical College and we were in sound class or something. The room was massive and all the seats were on this platform and were like beds and couches. I wanted a bed and sat on it but Frederick and Tristan went to the opposite side because they liked these other seats and all the other ones in between got filled up and I was annoyed, but we later switched to desks and chairs. The other students were lame and the teacher was douchey."
"4219"	"(2016-01-23 (24)) A group of people and I went into this big house which was where some bad people lived. I think they were cannibals and stuff, and we had snuck in there for some reason. While we were in there they came back and I was in this pool that was upstairs and I had to try and stay low in it so they wouldn't see. They ended up catching us and Otis (House of 1000 Corpses) was there and he was in charge of me and he said 'I'm going to have you for dessert' and I was wondering if he was flirting with me or being literal."
"4220"	"(2016-01-27 (25)) I was with Eric (True Blood) and we were investigating something. We were in this building and went into this arcade type place, but it was dark and just had a bunch of private booths down one side and airplane seats on the other. I walked down and saw a machine at the end had been destroyed. Eric hadn't seen it and said it looked like no-one had been here until I pointed it out. There was another person with us as well. We slowly walked down the aisle checking the booths and seats and when we got to the end, a dog jumped out and started attacking Eric. For some reason he was unable to shake him off and he couldn't heal himself from dog bites. I tried to hit it away but felt sad about hurting the dog and couldn't do it. The other girl felt the same, so Eric managed to pull it away enough for us to cut it a tiny bit and then he ripped it off and killed it. I apologised and said I just couldn't hurt an animal and he didn't seem too annoyed. There was a clue to whoever it was we were looking for and we left. There was a hotel nearby and we asked some questions there. There was an information screen and Eric told me to search for him and I started writing in Alexander, then started writing Eric Northman but kept making mistakes when typing Northman. It found him anyway and it had all this information about how he was this famous viking dude hundreds of years ago. He left to go investigate a room. The other girl was now a clone of me and she asked me if we should get a room (so we could spend the night with Eric, and we were dating him so it wasn't a new thing) and we approached Eric and he was like 'ah, only the two of you' referencing a time when there had been two clones. We started booking out the room when these people cut the power for some reason. We thought it meant the guy was in the building and I think there was an explosion or something somewhere else. We kicked into gear again to find him and I was annoyed because I really wanted to have sex. On our way to wherever we went next I was thinking about how the clones kept dying (and that possibly I was one too) and being replaced, so even though we were dating he was never really with the same person."
"4221"	"(2016-01-27 (25)) I was out somewhere with Tristan. I couldn't find my sunglasses, but then found them in my pocket. We went to this big market thing and it was in another country. Fletcher was then there too and we passed a frozen yoghurt stand and I decided to get some. It said it was $8 for a medium, so I said I'd get a medium. The lady behind the counter was probably about 30 -35 and was fat. I asked which one was a medium and she pointed to the containers. There was a huge and random selection of flavours. I asked for a chocolate version of a flavour but she started getting the vanilla and I said I'd have one of each. I asked if I could get another flavour and she looked at me in astonishment and said it was only two. She also had put big scoops of the other two and the container was almost full. She asked if I wanted any toppings and she started reaching for the Oreos and I said 'ok I'll take the Oreos'. I asked if I could have the cookie dough as well and she just looked at me stunned and said no. She took it the counter the til said $44 and I was like what and then she said 'that comes to $75' and I was like 'wtf, it said it was $8 for a medium' and she said the weight values are on the side and I said yeah but it doesn't say anywhere we pay by weight, it said it's $8. I said I can't pay for this and she said if I didn't it was a $40 fine and I carefully said 'I didn't say I wouldn't, I said I couldn't. You can't expect me to pay $75 for frozen yoghurt?' The other people in the queue started standing up for me as well saying it was false advertising and it clearly said $8 and the lady started backing down and saying that she was starting to see our point of view."
"4222"	"(2016-01-31 (25)) I was with Nana and someone else looking at a house they were thinking about buying. It was old and strange but they 'liked its quirk'. The main 'bedroom' was in the middle of the main hall and you had to climb up this very narrow and tall set of stairs. And it wasn't a bedroom, but a king size bed at the top, with cupboards down the side. We walked to the top and Nana realised that Poppa wouldn't be able to climb up. I tried to get down but it was hard. I had to use this ribbon to hold on to the side and then swing back around to the steps. Walking down the steps was scary as well because they were so narrow and steep. There was another guy involved who wanted to change parts of it. There were religious pictures and things all around and he wanted to remove them and was saying he doesn't understand why they don't want what he was suggesting and I said 'maybe they're religious?'. Some time later I was outside and a group of us were sneaking towards another group. It was like a war? A girl came behind this truck and saw us and I quickly grabbed her and put my arm around her throat and she passed out and I put her in the truck. Another girl saw and I did the same thing but less clumsily. I said to one of my teammates 'I've never done that in real life before'. They ended up seeing us and took their guns out and slowly made their way over to us. I said I didn't have a gun and someone threw me one. But it was hard to aim with and I never got a shot. A guy was close and I shot and a dart looking thing with a round green bit on the end hit him in the back and I was like 'I got one!' but someone said it was theirs and showed me the pattern on their dart and it matched. The 'bad guys' were then led by the guy who wanted to change the house and I said 'why don't we talk about this instead of killing each other?' and then I went and sat down and he agreed and they put their guns down."
"4223"	"(2016-02-04 (25)) I was at the Technical College for today. Tristan and I went to Mr Hoover's class, but it was only us two. There were supposed to be three others, but they weren't here and had been absent the last few days too. It was in a small-ish lecture theatre that was very black. Mr Hoover said he'd have to move us to a different class because he couldn't teach a class of two (and the first activity was in a group of four). We had a big lecture on with another guy and I got there a bit late. I sat away from everyone else. I was next to a black girl who introduced herself and asked how old I was. I said 23, then went 'no, 25. Don't ask how that happened' and she looked at me funny and then said she was 26. I said everyone else was like 18, so I was glad there was someone older in here. The lecturer said that anyone who wanted to leave could and one guy got up and left and then heaps of people got up. The only people left were people from last year. I moved over to sit with them. Then it was a break and there were three toilets. Fletcher was still in the room. I went to the toilet over one side but there wasn't actually a toilet in there. I went to the middle one, but there was a wall missing and just a curtain to pull. I went to the furthest one and I think there was another issue with that one."
"4224"	"(2016-02-04 (25)) I can't remember properly, but I had climbed down this almost vertical cliff side to get to this little 'beach'. I was taking photos of the water with the DSLR but the waves started coming in more violently and one knocked me down but I kept the camera in the air. I tried walking back to shore but it kept pulling me back. I made it eventually and had to climb back up with only one hand and it was really hard. I made it back up to the top after a long struggle."
"4225"	"(2016-02-06 (25)) A bunch of us were somewhere and I was talking about Fletcher's camera and Frederick was like 'it's your camera. He bought it for you' and then I felt odd."
"4226"	"(2016-02-09 (25)) I was with a group of others on this rocky formation. We were in like a crater of it (there was an 'exit', but it had high rocky walls around it. I had the DSLR and someone set off this little explosion causing a dust storm and I was taking pictures of it until I realised it was coming towards us and I put the lens cap back on and closed the screen and turned away from the dust hugging it to protect it. Later, I was out somewhere with a bunch of people. There was a long, but short, wall and Tristan sat down leaning against it. Everyone else followed suit with Judah at the other end. I went to sit next to him but had to get up for some reason and Fletcher took his spot. I sat down next to Fletcher and was trying to get a photo of everyone, they all waved and were kind of lying against the wall. Fletcher kept adjusting himself and getting closer to me each time, until I was squished against this pillar at the corner of the wall. He moved again and I was literally jammed in between him and the pillar and his legs were touching mine. Most of the others had left by this point. I sent a message to Tristan saying 'help' and had no reply. Then I felt something crawling on my back and I jumped up squealing and tried to brush it off. I couldn't find anything, but I saw lots of spiders coming out of a crack in the pillar. I found Tristan later and I said 'thanks for the help' and he just laughed. I said Fletcher was pretty much sitting on top of me and he just laughed again."
"4227"	"(2016-02-11 (25)) We were writing scripts and stuff to get selected. People were calling out the name of their script and others voted on whether they liked it or not. Claudine wrote a script called The Last Stand and everyone loved it. Jolene's was also popular and we were sure her's would get picked. Another class come in and Cecelia was there. There was this studio room and they were getting people to go in for each role to select them for each script. They were going to pick four and Tristan said there were too many people. Also Fletcher was hanging around us and being normal and I was glad that he wasn't acting weird."
"4228"	"(2016-02-11 (25)) I was playing a zombie game except it was playing out in real life and went back and forth between a game and real life. I was at a college type place in a library or gathering area. I walked to the front door and saw a person all zombied with like teeth showing and bloodied and didn't look like a movie zombie, but an 'actual' zombie. I ran and went down some stairs and zombie action started happening up there and people were getting bit and killed and I ran into a hall and ducked into the toilet, then it was a game and I was crouching in a cubicle and I was thinking of Stalled. The door to the toilet had a gap and a zombie face appeared underneath snarling and wouldn't go away. I thought it was a glitch so I restarted. The next time I with another girl called Maree and she was one of the main characters and had either lost a child or had an abortion and was haunted by the memory of the child (a girl). We ran into the girl toilets this time as it said there were levels in there but all the cubicles were locked and we went into an open one but it wasn't really a cubicle and had room for zombies to get in. I put my feet up on one side of the wall of the cubicle and lifted myself up with my back on the other side.  One came in and I paused the game and went to customize where you could edit the look of the characters etc. The option I selected caused the zombie to leave when I pressed play. Another time I reset I play ed as Maree and she was underwater but not, climbing up this ladder thing where it showed zombies next to her in another pipe climbing. It was very quiet and ambient and creepy. Then she swam through this underwater room. Then she was in a room which like had destroyed stuff and grass and puddles. I heard the zombies coming and ran through the door into the next area."
"4229"	"(2016-02-12 (25)) I was at the Technical College, in class, and people were doing something with acid at the front. They had different mixtures, so some were diluted. Justus, I think, didn't believe that it was acid so started drinking it and I was expecting his throat to just burn through, but he just kind of gagged a bit and everyone rushed to stop him."
"4230"	"(2016-02-12 (25)) I was watching something that was like a Tarantino film, I'm not sure if it was but I thought it seemed like one. Kurt Russell was in it, and he had this car which he loved and kept going on about all the details of it. I can't remember what happened, but something went wrong with it and he crashed it. Then there was this bridge going over this gap and someone in a car missed the bridge and fell straight to the bottom. The smoke from this caused a guy on his bike to hit this bit of wood that made this guy on a wheelchair nearby fall in. Then the car that crashed earlier was on fire and Kurt Russell was still inside smoking a cigar, the police had come to get him and he was doing a monologue saying how even on fire this car is beautiful and he can't leave it or something."
"4231"	"(2016-02-13 (25)) I was at the Technical College though we had class but it was in a weird area. There was water for swimming in which went around like a path. Mom and Dad were both there for unrelated reasons. Dad had a picture of a pile of text books and was about to send them in a message to Dan Palmer. He said he was going to send them to my boyfriend and I said didn't have one and I was like 'oh my god, don't send I haven't even spoken to him in 2 years ' and I got annoyed and Dad got angry and was like 'not spoken in 2 years?!' And I thought I saw Christian James nearby and I was saying like he was just some random and I wasn't gonna just talk to him. I was in the water and Dad was in a mood and I ignored him as I went by and Tristan was there, who I also ignored. I heard him asking Tristan something and Tristan was saying that I'm everyone's favourite and pointed to somewhere around the corner (straight for him, corner for me) and said they were the main ones. I went around and found Fletcher and someone else in the water too. I was happy to see Fletcher there but then he said he forgot he'd changed class and his actual class was over other side of campus, he looked a bit sad about this and seemed like he wanted to stay as he got out. I said just come back to this class and he seemed reluctant."
"4232"	"(2016-02-14 (25)) We were at the Technical College and had like 'homeroom' or whatever. Fletcher and Tristan were in the same one. Some lecturers were trying to work out which classes Fletcher had next since he changed. I was in a supermarket with Tristan and some others and we were crawling around to get out. Tristan was in front of me and struggling to get through some of the tighter areas and was going slow, so I did this kind of jump to get ahead. Later, there was an eclipse and we waited it out before the next class. Co-Worker-M-06 and Mason from work were there and I can't remember why but Co-Worker-M-06 admitted to liking me which I thought was weird since he's gay. Later we were in a room with Co-Worker-M-06, Mason, Fletcher, Marcos and someone else. Fletcher and Marcos were on opposite sides of the room, behind me. Someone asked 'ok who thinks Izzy's hot' and Co-Worker-M-06, Mason and the other person out their hand up, I nervously swung my chair around and Fletcher hadn't but then reluctantly put his hand up. Marcos was like 'wait what are we doing' and when they said 'hands up if Izzy's hot' he was like 'ok well I'm in the minority here'. Co-Worker-M-06 said the first day he met me I had 'shyly' asked 'where do I go' and he liked it. I felt uncomfortable and weird and wanted to go home. At some point during the eclipse, I was alone with Co-Worker-M-06 and he said 'we can go somewhere and do stuff' and I said 'I don't want to do stuff and a few seconds later Fletcher walked into the room and I felt awkward. Later I was making a silly short film with this Kiwi guy and wanted him to run about these fields so it would look Hobbit-y. [Fletcher changed class recently because he liked me, and people keep saying 'everyone likes Izzy'] ."
"4233"	"(2016-02-17 (25)) I was supervising this Decjuba at Harbourtown. It was a supervisor-only SFG and I'd never done it before [working at the store today for the first time, but not supervising] . I got to Harbourtown which was different and just this big block of shops, with these market stalls next to it. I parked over one side and asked a lady where it was and she said it was on the other side, so I drove through the carpark to the block of shops area. The whole thing was on this big block which was just grass between them. I parked and realised it was 8am and I was 1 hour late and I couldn't work out how that'd happened. I got my stuff out the boot and asked another lady where it was and she said it was down in the stalls. It took ages to get through and by the time we got to the store, it was 9am. The manager lady didn't seem that bothered though, and it only took me a few minutes to scan everything. Apparently there was another Decjuba that had gone south as well."
"4234"	"(2016-02-17 (25)) I was with Frederick, who I was dating, and he'd been offered this weird job and all he had to do was live in this cave for 8 weeks. The cave was on the beach and we were walking down there to see it and discuss the details. It was spooky and I reached for his hand and we held hands as we walked down. We made a joke about it being haunted, and the person said it was. When we got to it, it was really creepy and I said we should just go, but they kind of forced us inside and then we couldn't leave. It was some 'devil' cage or something and after the 8 weeks, one of us had to be sacrificed. I think we managed to escape, but I don't remember anything else."
"4235"	"(2016-02-19 (25)) I was sitting at Cecelia's and sitting at a table and lots of people were around. Frederick had been acting weird and he came up and said 'Izzy, I like you' and I just put my head down. It was a bit awkward but everyone else just got back to talking and he went away. I didn't know what to say or do. There was a photo of us on Facebook from a while ago with a caption like 'I am in mild love with Izzy'. Jason was also around and I wondered if he knew (he was also in the pic but maybe he thought it a joke). I was with Frederick later talking about something and I wanted him to just do something because I was really horny but I left the room sighing with frustration. [stayed at Cecelia's that night, sharing a room with Frederick and had been thinking the same] ."
"4236"	"(2016-02-20 (25)) There was a film that called for extras and some of us volunteered. There was a bus and we were all placed according to last name. I was away from everyone else. Tristan was next to a couple of people he knew. When they called out Frederick to place him they called out 'Frederick Pine' and Pine was actually Tristan's last name, so they were seated fairly close. Most people hadn't turned up though so when we went to leave they let us move. Frederick and I kept looking at each other and then looking away. Later, we were in a class or something and Tristan was talking about something and referenced this data which was like a calendar, but had little cogs on the days when the person had had sex. Apparently this was my data because Tristan said there was a bit where I'd said 'I don't want to have sex on my birthday' and when it was revealed it was mine, there was an awkward silence."
"4237"	"(2016-02-21 (25)) I somehow accidentally created zombie spiders which multiplied quickly and could explode and basically caused the end of the world. It was an idea I'd had that someone tested and it worked too well. They would explode and multiply, and so on. From when it began, it was only minutes until it would destroy the planet. Tristan was like 'tell us who you find attractive at the Technical College' and I said 'Judah' and he was just like oh and then the world ended."
"4238"	"(2016-02-21 (25)) I was in a big shopping centre and it was about 5.30pm because all the shops were closing. I was looking for something to eat, but everything I thought looked good was closing. I left and there were some guys outside looking bored. I didn't have shoes on and it was really hot outside and I couldn't remember where I parked. I heard them talking as I was walking and they were saying they should rape me. I tried moving faster, but they caught me and the leader held me down on the ground pulling down my pants. I struggled and he punched me. He had sex with me and then got up to give the next guy a turn, but they got distracted by something and I got up and found my car. I got in and turned it on as they noticed I was gone. I drove out and was trying to go fast, but there were all these roadworks in place. There was a narrow bridge with almost no barriers and I went off the edge straight into the water. I rewound it and went back and drove super slowly. A family that lived nearby ushered me onto this platform and took me into their house. The place nearby had been flooded, hence the roadworks and bridges. We realised we had to hide my car and the only way was to sink it and I was upset about this and was trying to decide whether I'd rather them find me or lose my car, but decided to lose the car. The guy went out to sink it and they were trying to find all these materials to use for something but I said we'll freeze without them. I was worried the guys would find me regardless and then I'd lose my car as well."
"4239"	"(2016-02-22 (25)) We were in a classroom and Ms Nowak was teaching, but most of the class was different. Our assignment was to write stories based on these vague one-sentence plot lines. The first one was something like 'your best friend wakes you up as a baby at 5am' and she said she always imagined waking up in Africa. I asked if 'best friend' could be yourself or anything since I didn't have a best friend or any close friends and she said I could. I decided to write it from the point of view of the Star Child from 2001: A Space Odyssey where his best friend is the Earth and he's waking up to watch over it. Ms Nowak said there were 39 answers to all the questions and I was like 'what there can't possibly only be 39 different stories' and I was pretty sure no-one would've done mine."
"4240"	"(2016-02-23 (25)) I was at 'home' which was a massive place with 2 storeys and I think I was babysitting and had other younger siblings. I text Mom to say that Cuddles had scratches on her shoulder. I heard a noise outside and we formed a conga line with me leading and I got a knife from the kitchen and walked back around avoiding windows. I heard a person out there trying to get in so I turned the TV on and then heard them saying on the phone that the TV was on but they couldn't see anyone. We were hiding and saw them walk past a window. They tried to get in somewhere and a long glove was hanging down and I cut through it with a knife and it fell apart but there was no arm inside it. Then I saw a guy sitting on a lounge in an office upstairs and I went in and sliced his throat but nothing happened and he said he was invincible and that this was a game and whoever 'won' (ie survived) by sunrise would go back to hell with him. It could only be one person and everyone else would die. I ran out. He slowly killed us one by one. He could sometimes control people and got this old lady to put 'menthol' in the oven and then try to take it out and burned her arms and then she put her face in there too. Then we were casually sitting in a room with him and he was normal looking but had devilish type of features. I could draw and had his notepad with lots of good sketches in it and I tried to sketch him but I kept getting distracted. Fletcher was there so I told Fletcher to sit at the table and I tried to draw him and he kept moving but was looking at me and when I tried drawing the side of his face, we almost made eye contact and I felt weird and stopped. Later we escaped the house and ended up in this place with a ghost train. There were only a few of us left and Fletcher decided to sacrifice himself for me and I said no don't be stupid and he did his serious nod thing and I was crying and really upset and I said ""why?"" and he was like ""you know why"" and he stayed behind and I ran the other way still crying. I went on the ghost train with some other girls who were my friends and got off at the end and we were outside and the sun was coming up. We were walking in a crowd of people and we were like 'we're going to make it' and as the sun came out, the sun suddenly turned black and smokey and we realised literally only one of us could be alive. I was determined to survive now, even though I was the guy's favourite. I ended up back at the house and he said 'you always win' and showed me a book with photos of me in the past but it was now a movie and my part was played by Jennifer Lawrence. She was younger and looked kind of rebellious with dark eyeshadow. He said she normally worked out to do telekinesis much sooner and she was confused. She 'won' and I think defeated him and stood triumphantly."
"4241"	"(2016-02-24 (25)) Judah was making a short film and he had written it but had a girl directing. I asked if Tristan and I could work on it and said I didn't care what the job was I just wanted to work on something and he did his nod thing and I thought he looked really hot and then he said something like 'you, yes but I'm not sure about Tristan' (jokingly). There was a spot free taking the trees out of the ground and he said that we needed more experience doing that so gave that job to us. He also said he was now in for D&D and I clapped and said 'yay'. Jason was around and I didn't know if I should ask him to come to D&D and he was keeping his distance. Then Judah was in some TV show where there was a mid-shot of him and you saw this grey-ish dragon appear behind him and he turned around and it roared and lunged towards his head and then cut to black. I was like 'no, you can't kill Judah!'. There was also something else where we had a small budget and had to simulate doing some effect by drawing lines on a screen and I accidentally blew something up and something exploded at the bottom of the sea and was likely causing World War III (it played out as 'real', but I'm not sure if that was just a simulation or not since no-one seemed that bothered)."
"4242"	"(2016-02-25 (25)) I had gone on holiday or something with Tristan, Jason and Frederick. I had slept with Frederick, though no-one knew this. Later we were all standing together with someone other people and Frederick said something like 'she slept with someone here, but it wasn't [the other two] ' and then he was like 'oh I gave it away'. Later, it was Cecelia's birthday on Valentine's Day and we were going out to a club or something. I went to the toilet at some point but they were all broken and gross, and on the floor, so I sat 'in' the bowl and was peeing and because the doors were high, they could see me outside. There were two drunk women (dressed very sluttily) and one started talking about my vagina and saying it was the nicest one she'd ever seen, so I tried to cover it up and she was saying how her's was in a 'zig zag' and mine was perfectly straight. I couldn't stop peeing, but finally it stopped and I made jokes as I left but got out of there quickly."
"4243"	"(2016-02-27 (25)) I was watching a movie which was kind of dull, but it was also somewhat hard to follow and it didn't really wrap anything up until the end. It was kind of a thriller and at the end, this old guy (about 50-60) who we thought was the bad guy confronted this guy at a speech he was giving and it was implied he was actually the good guy. I was then in a room on one of the top storeys of this building in a city with the other main characters and a lady was like 'oh no' and I moved to look out the window and saw a mushroom cloud. A shock wave hit and we saw a building start collapsing. Some people started climbing out of this building onto another one that it was connected to, but we decided to stay in here and wait. But the building started to sway and the room began to collapse. We tried to climb out the window and then somehow ended up in the ocean or a pool."
"4244"	"(2016-03-01 (25)) We had this hangout in like a cave? I crawled through this tunnel into the place and Stephen Merchant was there too, but he had a piercing near his mouth and it really annoyed me. He was talking to someone at one point and referred to me as 'her' and I loved the way he said it. He kissed me at some point and then later found out I hated piercings so removed them. Later, we were in class and Mr Hoover was pairing us up so we wouldn't be with our friends, but he did the newbies first and then all of us were left. Tristan was like 'I'm going with Marcos' and I said 'that's not fair, I'm going with Frederick' and Fletcher was also in class and ended up in a group of 3. We had to make a film and Frederick went off to swim in this pool and was like 'I know what kind of film we can make' and I made a face and said 'that's not PG'. I went to the train station with Frederick and Cecelia, but it was one I hadn't been to before and was confusing. I got lost trying to find the Woodside line and eventually I gave up, exhausted and called Mom to pick me up saying I couldn't work it out."
"4245"	"(2016-03-04 (25)) I was staying somewhere with a bunch of people from the Technical College (some real, some not). They had triple bunks and I was staying in the same room as my friends. We were messing around somewhere and I leaned in close to Frederick and he said 'I thought you were going to kiss me' and he kissed me on the head. We were later in the room and some girls came in and wanted to stay in there and I angrily snapped at them and said 'no, this is our room' and they left. I had a middle bunk and Frederick had the top bunk. He was teasing me through the wiring of the bed and we were taking photos of each other. At one point I climbed up the side into his bed and he was like 'what are you doing' and I said I needed to hide. Someone came into the room asking for me and she stood right over the bunk sniffing it and he said I wasn't here. She said it smelled like I'd been in his bed and he just shrugged."
"4246"	"(2016-03-07 (25)) I was in a theatre for a showing of some play. There weren't many people there and I thought this was because it was Wednesday. I was sitting off centre in a bad seat so I got up and moved to near the back and more in the centre. A lady came and I was sitting in her seat so I moved over one. She had this massive rocket launcher gun and she hoisted it onto her shoulder and started shooting people in the play. It shot like a fireball, but there was no fire. She said anyone who crossed this line on the floor would get shot. Everyone started running and screaming but I just stayed with her. When she went over the line to get closer, I stayed on the original side and she shot another girl who crossed it. She asked me to see this guy to call someone. He gave me his credit card (his name was Martin and he was French or something) and I had to use it at this phone booth thing. I showed the card and pointed at the guy to say it was his card and he waved back. I waited for a phone to be free and called the number. It had to be done this way so they could talk to each other in secret and the guy's baby had been kidnapped. I called the number and the 'bad guy' answered. It was his girlfriend's number, but it had been some years and you could the hear the kidnapped kid talking in the background as he was a toddler now. It was implied the bad guy had tricked the girlfriend into dating him."
"4247"	"(2016-03-07 (25)) I was in a mansion type of place. It was a huge house with lots of storeys and basement levels. I worked there somehow, I think. They had made or captured this Godzilla type of monster which they called the 'fog breathing dragon'. They planned to set it on the public and I knew but couldn't say anything. I was in a basement level when it got out and I hid and watched it walking up towards the main level, but then it stopped and walked back down into darkness. I panicked because I didn't know where it was and where it was going. I was trying to find somewhere to go to hide from it. I went outside and there were a few people just chatting and being normal so I assumed it was still inside. I was looking around for an entrance to another part of the mansion (there were other separate buildings too). I saw Emmanuel walking towards the place so I waved him over and quickly explained and said we had to hide. We found an unlocked door and went in. There were a few people inside and it wasn't a great hiding spot, so we left. I could now see some fog near the main part of the mansion and realised it was out. We kept going into places and leaving. We went into a house but people were actually there making out in the lounge room, so we snuck past and left through the back door - which had two chains on and I had to quickly and quietly take them off. We jumped over the fence into this alley. We found a display home and I thought that was perfect. There was no door handle, just a sliding door. As we walked in, two couples turned up and came in as well. I tried to make small talk and said I was just having a look. They asked if I had a boyfriend so I pointed to Emmanuel to shut them up. They asked if we had kids and I said no. I thought maybe they were trying to make it sound like they were more deserving of the home. I was looking around at the rooms. The main bedroom had a little changing area for babies and a baby was on it and almost falling off, so I grabbed it and moved it to the pillow. A guy who I assumed was the father came in and I told him it was falling off and left. I said we should leave and we got in a car. There was lots of fog in the distance. Tristan was with us now too. We started driving and going down the road we could see the fog trail leading up to the road where we were going. I said we just had to go. We got to the main road and we could see it close by on the left. I put my foot down on the accelerator and turned right. There was a bit of traffic though. I drove to this theatre place at the top of a hill, thinking it would be the safest place. We went in and there were lots of rooms and people around. We were trying to find some guy that was performing and looking for his dressing room, but there were too many staff members around for us to check. We were in a hallway with a food cart which had prawns and other things on it. Tristan saw his grandma and started talking to her and she was like 'oh it's good you're here with friends' and I got impatient and they finally said bye."
"4248"	"(2016-03-10 (25)) I was at the Technical College, which was different, and Tristan had to do some test. Our Thursday classes were a bit of a jumble, although we still had editing in the morning and I was thinking about skipping it. I was walking somewhere a bit later and saw Fletcher about to jump on a train and I called out to him and he stopped. He was excited to walk with me. We went to this busy pub and Brock was there. Fletcher admitted to having read a journal of mine and my heart dropped because I realised he knew I knew that he liked me and various other things [coincidentally, Fletcher gave me a letter this same day admitting his feelings for me] . He brushed over it though and I didn't get a chance to ask him about it. We went outside and somehow a fire started and because the pub was made of wood it caught fire very quickly. I was worried about Brock, but we found him in the crowd that evacuated. Some time later, there was a zombie somewhere. It got killed instantly, but I knew this was the start of the apocalypse. I decided this place near the sea would be a good place to settle, so I went to get people to take with me. I first went to Tristan and his he was with his father, who was in a caravan. We were waiting for him when he made this screaming noise and came out and shot himself in the head. It looked like he had been zombiefied. A couple zombies came around the corner (they were fast) and we killed them somehow and got in the car. I went past the Technical College to find Fletcher and stopped in the middle of the path and yelled at him to get in. I said 'the zombie apocalypse is starting'. We went to this house/apartment for some reason and we got attacked while there but this girl came and shot the zombie and we invited her along. We ended up at this dormitory place and were hunkering down there for a while. We had more than enough people that could fit in one car, so we were deliberating on where to get a bus or van from. One girl was downstairs looking for clothes, but had left the curtains open. I found her and told her off and said people could see in. She then went to turn on a light but I switched it off as quickly as she turned it on (it made a flicker though). I told her to lock the door and saw movement outside. We quickly ran back upstairs and I peeked out the window and saw the streets littered with looters. The others were sleeping but I woke them to say we might have company. The next day we were driving through the streets and it was just normal business. We were discussing why and suggested that most people were just sick at the moment and in a few days all the people coughing would turn. I realised I'd been coughing and joked that if I turn, just kill me instantly."
"4249"	"(2016-03-11 (25)) I was at some kind of convention/speech with Cecelia and some others. They gave us these dildos and then said we got to keep them. One was like a tentacle. Mr Hoover was there as a speaker and was demonstrating how to use a butt plug and lay down on the ground and was putting it in and I didn't look. Then we had rooms there that we were staying in and Cecelia was across from me. I deliberated on whether or not to try out the tentacle dildo but kept getting interrupted."
"4250"	"(2016-03-13 (25)) I was at the Technical College in some class. We were on a bridge and Anaya was there and did something to annoy me. Some other people had annoyed me as well so I went to Mr Hoover's office to complain. There was a queue and then I was next. I was really angry. Fletcher came with a piece of paper and I was ignoring him for some reason and Mr Hoover called him in and I said ""I was next"" and he said that it would only take a second. He handed him the piece of paper and then I went in. I started saying 'I was in class and Anaya was annoying the hell out of me' and he seemed shocked, then I realised it had been a dream and I went 'uh, I just realised it was a dream' and we both laughed. I said 'never mind' and left. I felt better now and talked to Fletcher as normal. Someone asked me what my Gronk film was about and I explained it was meant to be that the three people were dead and the bar was limbo and after they realised they were dead the bartender led them to their final destination. I explained the final product was a mess and he agreed. I was somewhere with Tristan and Reuben came and had his hands in his pants and said that he just walked around masturbating and no-one noticed. He was then shaking people's hands. Then we had to meet in this outside area and get into groups of about 30. Mr Hoover came and said he was giving us some black students and about 5 of them joined us. Then all the groups met up in this big area. He told everyone to get into a circle, going girl boy girl boy, and hold hands. Tristan was on my left and Frederick on my right. I felt uncomfortable about holding hands but went through with it anyway. I wondered where Emmanuel was as I'd prefer him to Tristan and was glad Fletcher was somewhere else. We then had to separate and the girl had to go behind the two boys and then put our hands on their backs. I refused to touch them so hovered my hands behind them and the exercise was a 'trust' exercise where they would fall back. We just didn't do it. Then we had to go with different partners and Mr Hoover randomly paired me up with someone else. There was more physical contact involved and I refused to do it. I just sat down and ignored the person. There were a couple more that I also just ignored. I went ahead to the next area and it had this little grassy/forest area and then a temple at the bottom. I ran to the temple and went behind some columns and stayed in the shadows. But some people had seen me and this girl started coming towards me trying to touch me and I put my hand into a fist and said I would punch her in the face if she touched me. She left and I joined the others in this room with a bunch of tables and I sat down at one at the front. There was some kind of number puzzle on a piece of paper. Brock sat down at mine and asked if I was having fun yet and I said no. Mr Hoover said that he forgot to see if there was anyone who disliked physical contact and I put my hand up as did a lot of others, including Fletcher who was near the back. I ended up back at the temple area and it was like a game. There was a T-Rex standing over me and I ran and tried to run into some bushes to hide but rocks blocked most of them (like it would in a game). I finally found this big leafy bush and hid under the leaves. It couldn't see me and stopped chasing me, but then started eating the leaves. I could see it through the leaves (a game mechanism) and it was getting really close and I thought it was buggy because I couldn't escape now."
"4251"	"(2016-03-18 (25)) I was friends with these 3 guys (all looked between 20-25) and had been for a long time but I'm not quite sure how everyone was related. The three of them had special powers to go to 'The Middle' where they could morph into any creature and do other things. The 'leader' was called Karl and he had sort of Nordic features. Another was quite fat and the other looked like Tom Hiddleston and had medium-length black hair (very similar to Loki's). I can't remember what his real name was but his 'Middle' nickname was Table. I had a crush on Table and I was pretty sure he liked me. He was kind of like the 'rebel' though and kept using The Middle to do things, at one point he went to a zoo and 'stole' a leopard and tiger. The guys were disappointed and said 'you'll be on camera' and he just shook his head and looked regretful and they realised he'd used The Middle. If they used it too often they could be lost in The Middle or something, but they could also become masters of the power. They were saying they were ""50% human"" and said they should just focus on being human for now. I lived with them and we all shared a room with a single bed each. Karl was at the very end next to the wall, then the fat guy, then Table, then me closest to the door. We were in bed and just sort of talking but Table decided to sleep on the floor so got rid of his bed and put the matress on the floor at the end of the other beds. He invited me to join him and I thought about it. We had shared a bed before and were comfortable with each other. I threw a pillow at him and he giggled and then I got up to join him. They made a little jokey fuss about 'getting into bed with your boyfriend'. I put my pillow next to his on the left side and he moved over. I got under the blanket, facing him, and he put his arm around me and my shirt had ridden up a bit and he brushed it down first. I rested my hand on his side. We were both wearing socks and he was rubbing his foot on my foot. We were very close and he was also kind of giving me Eskimo kisses. Eventually we began kissing and he got up a little to shift me underneath him but I could feel the feet of the 'fat guy' who had also switched to a mattress but had just left it in place of the bed. He woke up and it was now Frederick and he was like 'oh Izzy's getting lucky' and we changed positions so Table was hugging me from behind and Frederick started going around us taking photos. He eventually got bored and went back to bed. Table hugged me tightly and was kind of spooning me."
"4252"	"(2016-03-22 (25)) I don't know where I was, but Juniper had to go to the toilet and the door didn't lock so I had to stand outside and guard it for her. I thought she had finished for some reason and I got distracted and was talking to someone and some guy went and opened the toilet door. She came out a few seconds later and didn't want to talk to me because she thought I did it on purpose. I apologised and said I thought she had finished."
"4253"	"(2016-03-26 (25)) I was watching a movie except it was playing out live and I was the main character. It was night and in the rain and I was in the UK, I think, and had no way of getting back to where I was staying. I saw this small building and knocked on the door. They opened it and let me in and I said 'My name's Abby'. There was an underground section and it turned out they were scientists and working on lots of secret things. They let me down there for some reason. While I was down there an alarm went off saying that something had escaped. I somehow 'knew' it was a zombie type of thing. There was this cage in the middle of a room (it looked like a type of lab, the whole underground area was very white and had machines and things all along the walls). I saw this fast, rabid zombie run into it and attack the guy in there. I tried to find somewhere to run or hide and I could hear chaos going on in the distance. They wanted to stop the zombie before it got outside."
"4254"	"(2016-03-27 (25)) We went to Classmate-M-09's house and his room was this shared room full of bunk beds. Tristan was there too and had said Daniel was actually a girl, and I was trying to see if he was until I realised it was just because there were teddy bears and 'girly' things around but we later found out they weren't his. The house from the outside was made of stone and was very rounded and fancy looking. He said his parents used it for their 'clients' (they worked in film) so they didn't have to book hotels. I was walking down the street later, wearing my sunglasses, when this girl said 'hey, Izzy' and I stopped and vaguely recognised her but didn't know who she was. I said as such and looked at her name badge but it didn't ring any bells. She said she went to 'Bush College' and I remembered I had gone there for a month or so in highschool. She was talking about some stuff I'd said and was acting like we were best friends. We were somewhere else later, outside, and people had made some short films and were getting awards. One was for best film made by a 'homeless' person and this guy we had seen staying at Daniel's got the award. I went to the canteen later and it was this round booth that was quite large (looked like those kind of bars in the movies at a beach resort) and I got a ham crossaint. I went to find somewhere to sit and didn't want to sit with Tristan for some reason and saw Emmanuel sitting with some other people at the 'bar' of the canteen, but didn't want to look weird or have to sit with other people. I was annoyed that I wanted to sit with Emmanuel. Later I was somewhere else with a bunch of people from the Technical College and saw Emmanuel again and he said something to me and I said 'shut up Emmanuel' and he said 'shut up Izzy' and then we walked away."
"4255"	"(2016-03-30 (25)) I was on the beach and playing in the shallow end of the water. There was a little jellyfish nearby. A stingray was also hovering around and I was a bit nervous about the stingray, but not the jellyfish. The tide kept coming in further and I kept moving further back and Dad, who was in the water, joked that I'd end up off the beach."
"4256"	"(2016-03-30 (25)) I was in this house for some reason. It was full of ghosts, most of which were hostile and causing problems. We were there to get rid of them, I think, but I didn't really want to be there. There was a room where we had certain lights installed to see them and we were trying to get Ma (the name of the 'leader' ghost) to come in but we couldn't work out how to turn them on. As the ghosts piled in though, the lights turned on (a weird red colour). There were a lot in there, it was almost like a ballroom. I pulled out my phone to take a photo and only a few of the ghosts could be seen. Fletcher came in and was apparently a ghost and he explained that it took energy to not be seen, so only the older and stronger ones could do it with ease. I got him in the frame for a photo and could see him and I took a photo. I went out at one point with a couple of the ghosts. They were obsessed with orange juice and I took them to a bar place and they ordered orange juice and the bartender sent it sliding down the table to us. I got one too. One of the ghosts used to be an alcoholic and said they couldn't have alcohol, but then ordered something alcoholic and choked on it and spat it out, but then kept drinking it. I wondered if they could get drunk."
"4257"	"(2016-03-31 (25)) There had been some kind of disaster or something and we couldn't go outside. We lived in this apartment block type of thing and I lived with Dad and Ezra in one of the nicer and bigger rooms. We looked out the window one day and saw some cars, and then saw a bunch of military looking vehicles carrying people. Everyone was angry and upset about this because it would mean they would have to share their rooms with other people since we were already at capacity. After processing them they told us we would get a few people and I suggested to these people we were friends with that we combine instead."
"4258"	"(2016-03-31 (25)) I was with a few people and we were outside trying to survive. There was a pregnant lady who was my friend and her boyfriend/husband, another person, and a guy who was my boyfriend. He had dark hair and a bit of stubble. We found a camp for the night and were there for a few hours but when we went to make a fire we discovered there had already been a fire there and the ashes were fresh. We quickly left but ran into some lions and other animals. They growled and circled us but seemed to look behind us and then walked off. I was like what the hell was behind us that scared them off. It was night now. We were walking for a while and found this dip which led to water and was very grassy, but one of them suggested it would keep us out of sight and provide us with food and water. I started climbing down but then someone said it was too vertical, so I put my hand up and my boyfriend helped lift me back up. Then there was a montage of us staying there; eating, laughing, sleeping, having sex. We went for a walk one day and found this house and decided to stay there. Then it was like a game and I was building rooms and placing furniture and it would say if there were enough toilets or beds or whatever for everyone. I kept finding already furnished rooms but with no door so was moving things around and putting doors in. Then we saw this big vehicle thing flattening the trees and coming this way. There was a type of door you could place which would hide itself when activated so only we could see it. I put one of those up on the side of this room (it was less obvious on the side), and we went in. But then I realised there were windows facing the rest of the house so I started deleting the windows and doors, but when I went around the corner there was an entire wall of windows and I could only delete them individually. The pregnant lady was looking from the other side to let us know how it was going and I asked if she was able to build a wall in front of the windowed wall, but then we saw a black lady walking around and I called her back in. We lay down behind this bookshelf to hide. The pregnant lady went into labour and I tried to find her a comfortable place to rest. There was some weird bit with an elevator and a rollercoaster where she kept making the floors higher, going to like 1000 and it made this rollercoaster that we went on faster and wobblier and it was huge and had lots of loops and it was scary, but we were laughing and screaming. Then it was back in the house. A lot of people came in and I knew already knew we were there and then I saw Emmanuel with them so I jumped up and said we didn't want any trouble. They asked why we were hiding and I said because we don't know if people are going to kill us or help us. I added 'then I saw Emmanuel and figured you must be ok'. They said 'well if you know Emmanuel, then you're ok with us'. I followed Emmanuel into this room to ask him about the people he was with and I was thinking 'maybe this will give me a chance to sleep with him' and then I remembered about my boyfriend and was trying to decide which one I liked more."
"4259"	"(2016-04-01 (25)) Karl Pilkington had a daughter called Alexandra and she was in her 20s. She was a little chubby, but average looking. I think something happened to her so she was in the news or something."
"4260"	"(2016-04-01 (25)) I checked my bank account and I had all these dodgy transactions from the Philippines. The first one was that Paypal transaction I did that got emailed to me [happened in real life, and I wasn't sure if it was dodgy] . My password had been changed on a lot of sites and I had to change them all. I had to cancel the card but since it was less than 2 weeks until I was going to the Philippines I was worried I wouldn't get a new card in time and it cost $90 to get an express card."
"4261"	"(2016-04-01 (25)) Mom had a different car and I got in the passenger seat (which was the opposite side like an American car) and the door behind me kept opening. I was trying to lock the car as I was sitting in it, but it just kept popping open. I complained to Mom when she came and she said it kept doing that you had to slam it. Later I was at Dad's house, which I was looking after while he was away. It was actually this huge, expensive place which was next to these other fancy, expensive places. I was going through his cupboards and fridges throwing out stuff that was out of date and cleaning up the place."
"4262"	"(2016-04-03 (25)) We had a new house, but some of it was temporary. Some had been built has rooms and had some of our stuff in it, but we stayed in this big tent thing just outside. Mom, Darren and I were working on something outside when I saw this dark grey cloud coming towards us and I said 'grab Rover and get inside' and we ran into the tent thing as it started raining. The tent was attached to the bottom with hooks and the wind and rain was lifting it up and letting the water in. I said we would drown and we had to leave. We started grabbing our things and got to the car but it had stopped raining. We didn't know if it was going to come back so didn't know whether to stay or leave."
"4263"	"(2016-04-03 (25)) I was in jail for some reason and there were these portals - I'm not sure of the specifics, but we were aware they were kind of safe but the police weren't. They were also maybe controlled by us in some way, like through a control, but I'd never used one. Anyway, I was trying to escape. A guard let me out of my cell but there were lots of guards and I couldn't get out anywhere. A portal was opened and he put me back in my cell but forgot to lock it. Classmate-F-05 was also there as a prisoner and was out of her cell but had guards in front of her. She saw me leave my cell as I slowly walked behind the group of guards and as soon as I had a straight line to the portal I ran and jumped in. Classmate-F-05 followed. I ended up in an outside place, which had park benches and grass and stuff. A few other people were there, including Frederick. I was sitting at the bench eating and he was next to me and kept leaning on me. He kept moving to different areas and it would always be where I was going to go next so he was joking I was following him. I pondered as to whether the portals took us to a real place, an alternate universe or was some kind of hallucination. Frederick said he thought it was like a shared dream and didn't exist beyond the area we were in. I said I didn't think it was a dream because the mirrors functioned properly and I could read words. Later I was sitting at a TV and Nana and Poppa were there, sitting on a lounge to my left. Tristan was sitting on the same lounge as me. Emmanuel was there and we were joking about something and then he said that we got along better than Tristan and Nana and Poppa."
"4264"	"(2016-04-04 (25)) I was watching a horror movie set on a ship that was sinking or had some kind of issue. Some people had gone on it (I think it was a ghost ship to begin with), and there was a ghost on there killing them off. One of the characters was played by Karl Pilkington and he had hair. They were in a part of the boat that had filled with water and there was a little gap for air. As he went to get some air, the ghost filled it with water and caused him to drown. I was like 'you can't kill Karl Pilkington!'."
"4265"	"(2016-04-04 (25)) I was at a shop and I'd had a drink with some people and I was driving out and got stopped by a policewoman who gave me a breath test. She went off to test it and I was holding up traffic, so I drove further around the corner to where she was parked. She went to the next car to test them and I continued waiting. I saw Esther and some other people from work and I waved. I asked what store they did but I don't remember what they said. The policewoman came back and said I was ok to go and my reading had been '0.5', which was well below the limit. Later I was in Ms Nowak's class for today and she said she'd made a mistake with the director's presentations and that those of us remaining had to do this other activity. She showed us these drawings and they were like coloured in with pens, using lines. So it was drawing a scene or picture using only certain defining lines (like a window, but not a desk) and then using 'lines' to colour it in. I had no idea what she wanted us to do and so I just sat there."
"4266"	"(2016-04-09 (25)) Fletcher, Cecelia, some others and I went to Fletcher's house for some reason. His parents were old and white, they looked like typical American grandparents. I asked Cecelia about it quietly and she said it happened sometimes with Filipino's. He seemed to be their natural born kid, but I couldn't really work it out. We left there and were on a street and I think this girl kept dying and we took her with us to give back to someone else later. We went to this ice-cream store which was closed to wait in."
"4267"	"(2016-04-11 (25)) I was talking to Fletcher on Facebook and he said that he needed an ""esoteric future"" and that I was a ""sacred mound"". I didn't know what he meant but the other stuff he was saying sounded like he was 'breaking up' as friends, so I was confused and annoyed. Later his profile said it had been deactivated but I also had a friend called Joe Walker or something which I assumed was his account."
"4268"	"(2016-04-11 (25)) I was at the Technical College and I was running late for class but wanted to get lunch. I got this wrap thing which was chicken with lettuce and tomato. I got to class and Mr Jennings was the lecturer. The desk layout was like a square 'C' with the open part at the front where Mr Jennings was. Tristan was at the desk on the left side as you came in the room and Fletcher was next to him on his left. I sat next to Tristan on the right. They had already started class and had been handed out cards. They all had different things on them - items or pets or people. He was handing out a different number of cards to each person and it was supposed to force a divide in the room or something, make some people arrogant about the number of cards or what cards they had etc. Mr Jennings gave me one card and it had a picture of a cartoon elephant and was called Bop. I said to Tristan 'I have the best one'. I was eating my wrap in class and it was very messy and there was lots of lettuce. Sometimes it was steak instead of chicken."
"4269"	"(2016-04-11 (25)) I was at home and my room was bigger and didn't have much in it. I noticed some ants in the corner and I left briefly and came back and there were more. There was also another part of the floor that had started gathering them too. I called out to Mom and said there were lots of ants in my room and she said she'd have a look later. I said they were getting bigger but she didn't seem to care. I threw a sock and it landed in a corner where a group of them were and they started going frantic and spreading out further across the room. I ran out of the room but looked closely and realised they weren't ants but hairy spiders. I yelled to Mom saying they were ""hairy jumping spiders"". Spaceman was near my room and I shooed him away. Then Rover was lying on my floor and I made him come out. Mom said she thought they were dangerous but still didn't come to help. They began pouring out of my room and into the hallway. I was freaking out and screaming at them to do something. Darren calmly walked out and said he was waiting for them to go 'up' and I realised he was going to go under the house. They had started filling up my room vertically as well. I was worried they would ruin all my stuff."

Later, we were at a pub and Tristan got drunk and kissed Ms Nowak and she just laughed."

I was driving and going up steps and in off-road places but I knew I was dreaming and I didn't care. Then I had another me that I was using to ride and she would walk on all fours. I was riding her but it rubbed against me and it quickly made me come and I woke up during it."

Frederick had some idea for a story involving me and I didn't want to be in it. Hubert was in the room and under a blanket. He got up and I saw his butt when he got back in and I squealed and he put clothes on as he laughed. He complained that people had called him gay and his family complained that he was in effeminate and I said it wasn't a bad thing. I was talking to Fletcher about leaving or something. I wanted to edit something but the labs were full. Bev also complained about something someone else was doing."

Then some guy got a finger through his ear to the other side of his head, then the finger got chopped off and the chopped off bit was so long that you could tell it wasn't actually part of the finger. I edited it slightly so it made it look more real."

Some of them ended up dying but I was with this one guy who owned this chain of shops which all had an underground storage area in the back. The bad guys were coming and we went into one. At the front it just looked like clothes storage, but further on there was a bunker area."

Fletcher asked about his stuff from the Philippines and I said, about the watermelon seeds, 'there's only two bags' and I gave him the shirt and he put it on. He didn't seem to get what it meant. There was an episode of Extras where Andy had told this guy he lived at this beach resort and the guy wanted to see it. I was there with him and it was Dad that lived there but I had a pass to get in so I let him use it. There were two sections of the place though, one was really posh and fancy - which the guy assumed Andy lived in, and the other was where Dad lived which was just basic accommodation. The room was small and it was just one room for everything and was basically just a bed. Later it was just me there and I went on Dad's computer to look for something and he had all these porn sites up and bookmarked and it was just all over the place. Then I was somewhere else in someone's room. I was friends with this guy who I liked, but he had a girlfriend. Something happened and he was saying something about who he wanted to marry and she realised he was talking about me and she was just like 'you want to be with her, so be with her' or something and left and then I didn't know what to do, but I was happy. At some point I was riding on motorbikes with Frederick and some other people."

I tried looking for him at one point and couldn't find him, then I found him and he'd snapped one of his legs. Then he went missing again and I was worried he'd fallen down this big hole.

"4280"	"(2016-05-08 (25)) A zombie-type virus had wiped out a lot of people. The zombies were all underground though and hadn't yet come into contact with us. Something was happening to the atmosphere which was forcing us to all go underground. I was at the shop with a group of people, including Mom. They were getting food, mostly canned food. I was bored and then she asked if I wanted chocolate and I grabbed a bunch of chocolate, including a big bag of Ferrero Roche's. Later I noticed my bag had been opened and another lady shopping said she wanted some and I said 'you could've just grabbed your own bag' and I showed her where they were and she apologised. I got a new bag for myself. We went down a couple of levels and each level had a trapdoor. We would then explore the entire level to make sure it was clean. We got to one and were listening for noises. We carefully opened the trapdoor and it all these flaps covered in blood. It had filled with water and a guy floated to the top but was still alive. We pulled him out and could hear hissing and zombie noises coming from down there and we thought it was odd they were underwater. It was all flooded except for the first 2-3 levels and we wondered how everyone was supposed to fit. Later we were somewhere else. We had a random mix of people. There was a blonde Scottish lady, kind of mousey librarian looking. There were a few actors, one called Iain Softley. One of the guy's I was kind of friends with got excited when someone said we had a new addition to the group who was a girl and it was big news for everyone. I took issue with it and asked why it mattered if it was a girl. He said 'because we're guys. It's someone new to look at'. I said it makes no difference, girls and guys are the same. He said 'yeah but we like anal' and I shouted 'so do girls!'. I didn't know what the relevance of this point was. I was thinking about the guys we had in the group and came to the conclusion there was only one I found attractive and a couple more that I would sleep with if I had to."

There were desks organised around the teacher's desk, but they didn't have computers and then all the computer desks were in another corner. I sat the desk next to the teacher's desk and waited. Fletcher came in and sat next to me. Reuben and Emmanuel were also in this class. I ended up moving to another spot and Fletcher followed. He also gave this huge 'book' of notes and papers to someone and it turned out it was an OHS report or something he had done for them. I was thinking he needs to stop doing people's work for them. Tristan came in at one point and I pretended to hide under my desk. He spotted us and said something or other and left. I then realised it was Saturday and I said 'you have class on a Saturday?' and Fletcher said it was because it was full at all other times during the week. Teacher-M-01 came in and made everyone sit together around him. There were lots of people and he said everyone had to tell a story. I was looking away and he said 'how about we start with Poppa's girl?' and I got a chill and turned around and was like 'what? How do you know about that?' and he said 'I saw it on the family car' and everyone nodded like it made sense and I said 'yeah but I've met you once, months ago'. I said I didn't have any stories and he said it didn't have to be recent. Fletcher said 'lots of stuff has happened, oops you can't talk about that, what about moving to England'. So I said 'oh yeah, when I was 13-' and Teacher-M-01 interrupted and said 'that's a young age to move' and I said 'no, that's later. When I was 13 I really wanted to live in England. When I was 18, I thought I could do it so I got a job and I was also studying at the time. When I was 22 in 2013 I moved there and lived for about 9 months'. He seemed satisfied with that and then asked if everyone had done something on their blankets from last week. Fletcher and I moved to sit on this couch and his blanket was this weird abstract type thing with lots of dots in patterns and it was purple. He covered himself up in it and I borrowed a yellow blanket to put on me. There was a fishtank thing with a decorative thing in the middle and when you looked at it from the side everything looked squished and small for comical effect. There was some squid type thing that kept hanging around at the corners waving one tentacle about."

He fought with a few guys and dodged some bullets and then they both got into this car. She was in the driver's seat but then it was me. He jumpstarted the car and then was screaming 'drive through the cars!' so I started driving and turned and went down this street. The car was old and very slow, but started to pick up speed. He kept screaming 'just keep going' and she/I drove the car over this cliff but there was a massive drop and down below was the ocean. It went in slow motion and went quite far, until finally crashing into the water. Then it showed a beach resort and the opening of the beach. The water bubbled and then Deadpool came walking out, but he was covered in seaweed and stuff and you couldn't see him at all, he was completely green. He walked into the resort. Then it went back and showed Morena Baccarin coming out of the water and she had a mermaid costume on, which showed her cleavage. I was annoyed that they gave her the 'decorative female' treatment. Whatever had happened to them had made them immortal for some reason. They got cleaned up and there were a lot of close ups of Baccarin smiling and I wondered if her only role in the film was to smile a lot."
"4283"	"(2016-05-13 (25)) I went to this Chinese restaurant with a friend and we both already had some Chinese food with us. We walked in and this old Chinese guy, presumably the owner, reached his hand into my friend's one and started feeling all the food. He went to reach into mine and I said no. He showed me he was wearing clean gloves and I reluctantly agreed. After feeling around he said it was ok. Then some people were sneaking around out the back looking for something. They were good and the Chinese owners were bad. This black guy and his white girlfriend were in this bedroom looking for something. They heard the people coming so quickly got undressed and pretended to be having sex (she was bent over and he was behind her). His penis was huge; unnaturally long. The old Asian owner came in and saw them. The black guy was like 'sorry we just couldn't help ourselves' and the Asian guy just kept staring at them and then encouraged them to continue. The black guy hesitantly started having anal sex with her, only putting in a little bit and then after a few seconds she said she had come (she was obviously in pain and just saying that to make it stop). But the Asian guy wanted more so he put his penis around the side of her face and she somehow put it in her mouth backwards (so the head was pointing out) and started pushing her head back and forth. He was moaning and acting like he was about to come but didn't want to."
"4284"	"(2016-05-21 (25)) I was living with and dating Dan Palmer. Brief moments of us together flashed by but I can't remember them. There was one where he had just gotten out of the shower and was naked. He was getting dressed and talking to me and I was leaning against the door frame. He put his undies on and then came up to me and kissed me. Then he kissed me again, longer this time, and started putting his arm around me. This led to us having sex in our bed. Later, I went into the room and the bed was broken. I yelled out asking what happened and he said something like 'you fucked me for 3 hours doing banana splits'. I wondered what a banana split was and I yelled out saying 'don't just blame me, you were there too'. Then I was at home, which was different. Esther came over and was preparing her scanners for a job. We were in the kitchen with Mom. In the list of jobs for the next week was a travel job which said in the UK. I said 'so you're doing a job in England' and she said 'no, it's in Exmouth, it's ex-English'."
"4285"	"(2016-05-21 (25)) I was young, like 4. I had an older brother, who was Classmate-M-27. He was having a party and there were a bunch of teenage girls and boys there. I was sitting in the car with some of them and they were asking each other which illnesses they had. One person asked about the clap and one person put their hand up and I congratulated them for being honest. He later got annoyed with me and left me in the back of the car with the doors locked and left it in neutral. It started going out onto the road and I tried opening the door, but it wouldn't open. So I wound down the window, opened the door from the outside and jumped out. My mother (different) came home later and realised what had happened (she put the 'clues' together and knew he had done it on purpose). She was upset and angry at him, but we didn't know where he was. There was a weird red flash of light outside. It happened again later and I mentioned it to my father. He looked worried and made us go out the other door. He had a topless car and I got in and the seats in front were bent so they were almost horizontal and I hid under those as I saw the lights happen again and something peered over the top. I screamed and the thing ran. I could only see it properly out of the corner of my eye and I was scared."
"4286"	"(2016-05-27 (25)) It kept going back and forwards between real life and a video game. Body snatchers were taking over. They would be very flat and wooden and I think didn't blink as much. A female friend and I were in a house for some reason and then we had to escape because some of the family were body snatchers. We rushed about looking for windows and finally found one that we could fit through. As we were walking down the street/path, we saw two guys up ahead. One was Kit Harington and the other was ok looking. They slowed down and started walking with us and Kit was walking with me so I was happy that I got the hot one. The rest is mostly a blur, just snippets of us running away and meeting with people and then they would turn and we'd run away from them. I was working at the airport at some point and this little food place had nice looking muffins and cakes."
"4287"	"(2016-05-30 (25)) I was in a supermarket which was near to the Technical College, or like part of it. I think I bought some stuff but I may have been doing some work there? I went to class and left a kebab there. I went and did something and then came back and saw Justus eating a kebab. At first I thought it was mine, but then I saw mine was still there."
"4288"	"(2016-06-02 (25)) I was in editing class, which was different. The room was bigger and more spread out and the computers were all around the edge (and were PCs and old-ish). It was kind of L-shaped (but like a fat, squashed L), with the door at the top of the L, and in the little nook was the computer I liked. But it wasn't there, so I took the one next to it, though I made a comment that my computer was gone. Malcolm McDowell was our substitute for the day. He was a lecturer at the Technical College and although we had no classes with him, had had him as a substitute before. As I was busy complaining about my computer being gone and sitting at another, everyone had been told to have a break and it was just me and Tristan left in the classroom. I said I had already finished cutting Box and was going to leave early to print stuff at the library and would get a break then. I started to say that it was distracting having Malcolm McDowell as a teacher but he walked back in and I cut my sentence short. Everyone came back in and Fletcher came in and wanted to use the computer Tristan was on. He seemed frustrated/stressed as usual and didn't look at me. Tristan moved over to another computer and Fletcher started importing something and left. You could see the video playback and it was all this footage of people in a lecture theatre, filmed from behind them. Frederick appeared in one of them. Tristan's monitor broke somehow and he grabbed the glass and cried out 'ow' and Malcolm McDowell, in a joking/weird way said 'what a fucking arsehole' and we laughed. Tristan asked me to go get him some chair and I said 'what chair?' and he started having a go saying 'just get the chair' and I got angry and said 'I don't even know what chair you're talking about or where it is, so I don't know what you want me to do' and he pointed out it was some chairs that we had been near earlier that were at the 'front' of the school. I left and was walking down this 'hall' (outside, but undercover and paved). I saw Fletcher coming but walking backwards, so I stood behind him with my hands out to stop him but he turned at the last second and I laughed. The conversation was a bit awkward. He said we hadn't seen each other in a while and implied that I'd been ignoring him and I said 'I thought you were busy, so I left you alone' [haven't seen him or spoken to him in a while] . He said 'I could never ignore you' and I felt more awkward. We were standing in front of the windows to the class and I noticed everyone watching and felt more uncomfortable. He said 'I'll walk with you' and I said I was getting some chair for Tristan. We walked off and past a few people who were sitting in another room, including Claudine, and she made a jokey signal that she was jealous we got out of class."
"4289"	"(2016-06-04 (25)) I was in the UK and I had my car there. I was reversing out of a parallel park and my car started sliding and it hit this fancy old car. I quickly reversed and took off because I was scared it would cost me too much. Then we were at the Technical College. Our class was doing a production for a music video. Tristan made a list of all the people and their roles, Anaya and another person were put down as potential directors, and someone I didn't recognise as editor. I was just in 'unassigned'. I got angry and started asking why I hadn't been put in a role I wanted, or at least considered. Someone said there had been a meeting and I said I never heard about any meeting and if I wasn't editing or directing I wasn't going to participate. He changed it and put me as director. I calmed down and said my problem wasn't that I hadn't gotten a role that I'd wanted, but that I hadn't even been considered or asked. I was later walking outside and bumped into Fletcher. He stopped me and said hello and apologised for ignoring me saying he had a lot on his mind. He was being really awkward but I was glad he was talking to me again. Later some of us (about 5 girls) got taken down to this basement area by Mr Hoover. There were little artifacts and such. There was a table with containers under glass of 'disgusting' things. The only one I remember was an 'ectopic pregnancy' and it was like blood and a little fetus thing. All the girls had a look and got disgusted and walked away. I was fascinated by it and used the magnifying glass on all of them to get a closer look. There was a door nearby with a little window and I had a quick peek from far away and were told it was the doorway to hell and Satan was in there. A light in there came on and you could see a silhouette on the far wall of a big horned creature. One of the girls looked in and he opened the door and invited her in. It then turned into a kind of movie and he sat her on a chair and immediately got this knife and sliced the top of her face and cut it off. It was very graphic and bloody. He kept her alive and asked what her biggest regret was/what she felt guilty about and then healed her face and told her to go and repent or he would reverse the effects. He did the same to another girl. I was worried I'd get asked to come in because of the car thing earlier."
"4290"	"(2016-06-05 (25)) I was attending a wedding which was a bit odd and I had some sort of role like guest liaison. A guy who I had met a few days before hadn't turned up and I was worried because he has made suicidal comments. Mom and I decided to go check his house. We got there and the gate going to his backyard was open and she was looking back there and then we saw his body hanging from the back fence. It was covered a bit by clothes on the clothesline and bushes. I was upset that he had been there for probably 2 days and no one had noticed. He had left his back door open and he had a couple of cats. Their food bowls were empty but it looked like he had filled them up before he killed himself. The cats were friendly and that made me sadder. Later I had something to do with Big Brother. They got this digital 'milk' candle and were allowed to spend time outside with ex-housemates. Chanelle (BB8) was one of them and had like a best friend from the house that she hung out with. They had to go back when the candle melted, and they had to rush because they had forgotten. I was walking with some people, including Chanelle, and I said that I hated Big Brother letting in ex-housemates and said to Chanelle 'I don't mean I hate you, I just don't like them bringing in people who have gone. Once you're gone you're gone' and she agreed. Later I was somewhere inside and Steven (BBUK15) was there with this huge round ring on his left hand. Two girls were giggling over him and I was like ugh. Later I was with Technical College people watching some movie. The end was suddenly really gory and violent. I think someone got like squished and it showed all their guts and stuff on the floor. Juniper was there and looked disgusted and was like 'it's so gory' and some people agreed and I went it's not that bad and Mr Hoover like 'that's how you can tell if someone's a horror fan'."
"4291"	"(2016-06-10 (25)) I was somewhere doing something with the Technical College. Fletcher came up to me really close and leaned in as if he was going to kiss me and I leaned back to get away. He continued talking to me and I tried to walk back and stand up straight. He kept following me really closely and didn't seem put off by this. But after a while I looked at him properly and he looked like he hadn't slept or had been taking drugs or something. I was glad he was talking to me again but was weirded out."
"4292"	"(2016-06-11 (25)) I'm not sure where I was, but there was this huge toilet with stalls in the middle of the room. It was very grey and very dirty. I went in there to pee and as I sat down, another girl came in and asked what I was doing as she got into the next stall, which put me off. Later, there was a screening of some small film but there were some big guests there, like Jack Nicholson. We were hiding behind this wall as we were doing behind the scenes work, and we peeked around the front to see all the guests and we spotted Jack Nicholson and giggled to each other. Later I was somewhere with Technical College people and I was in the water, sort of upside down and Classmate-M-14 poked me in the bum and made a comment and I realised that I'd gotten my period and it was showing through. I wasn't embarrassed but annoyed, and mentioned what had happened as I looked around to find a pad and some clean pants."
"4293"	"(2016-06-12 (25)) I was at the Technical College, though it was a bit different. The top floor of the media building was this huge area where people would gather for like 'parties' and drinking. Cecelia was there. I took the elevator down to the bottom floor, which was still the same and I started walking towards the storeroom when I saw Fletcher walking my way. He stopped as if he was waiting for me, but I looked up at him and then looked back down as if I were ignoring him and he started walking back the other way. I went back up the elevator when I was done there and went back down with Cecelia some time later. Fletcher was sitting, waiting at the elevator and he got on and Cecelia was talking to him. She made some joke to me about something and I responded and said something to Fletcher as well."
"4294"	"(2016-06-12 (25)) There was this resort in some country, which I had stayed at before with someone to lower costs on accommodation, and then later Nana and Poppa had moved in to an apartment there. It was a fairly obscure resort so it was weird. I was staying there again with some friends and told them this story. There was a sign in the bedroom saying 'this is the lucky room, if you present this card you get 50% off', but then it said it had to be handed in before the 30 June or something. We left at night and went to this creepy public bathroom. I went with my female friend and we closed the main door, but it had a big open area at the bottom of the door and I kept staring at it, expecting someone bad to come along. It was very quiet outside too, adding to the creepiness."
"4295"	"(2016-06-19 (25)) I went to a cinema somewhere sort of far away. I parked in front of a wall on the opposite of the car park to where the building was. It was quiet, with only 2-3 other cars there. I brought a table and my laptop for some reason. Emmanuel was there too and we watched about 3 movies that were playing there and then I decided to go home. I walked out with the table and my bags and went walking down the carpark forgetting where I'd parked and then realising that my car wasn't there. I put the stuff down out the front and went in and told the receptionist that my car was missing. She said something like 'you must be new to this town' implying that my car had been stolen. I wondered how I was going to get home with all the extra stuff I was carrying."
"4296"	"(2016-06-21 (25)) There was a trip for 20 people to go 'the moon'. It was leaving at a specific time and a group of us from the Technical College decided to go. Tristan and Hubert were there. We were just walking from the Technical College and got to the building which was like a hotel, but then Hubert and I realised we'd forgotten our wallets so we ran back to get them. As we reached the top of the building we saw the shuttle in the distance and it was a couple minutes past the departure time and we saw the shuttle take off. We were disappointed and made our way back down the ladder. We bumped into a lady who asked if we had wanted to go and she said they could send just us two. She had a clipboard with notes and asked what we would like to do there. I said I used to study to be a vet so could do something with medicine, or that I also liked numbers so could do financing. She seemed annoyed at me. Hubert said something media-related. She quickly began organising for us to leave and I told Hubert it seemed odd that they would want to send just two people but he didn't listen to me. Then we were there, though I don't think it was the moon now but some other planet. The inhabitants were human looking, but usually had strange fluoro warpaint type of makeup styles. They gave me a room which had a bed and TV etc, and was quite nice (it was just a bedroom I think). I was watching TV one night and it had Foxtel but it had lines through it and the reception was really bad. I went to bed and heard a noise and when I opened my eyes I noticed my 'door' (which was like electronic) had been turned off. I turned it back on and went into my bathroom and I walked out to see the 'leader' guy in there and he said he was in love with me and wanted to have sex and I said no. He said that on this planet when someone felt that way about someone it meant the other person felt the same and I said that's not how it works. He said that he had these 'feelings' about me that weren't like normal feelings so it meant I had to feel the same. I said something like 'I have those feelings about Stephen Merchant, and only Stephen Merchant'. I ran out of the room and ended up in his room which was next door. I left there and ran to this place where there were people I knew. There was a guy I kind of liked called Doss or something and I saw through the window a guy having sex and I hoped it wasn't him and I looked into the room next door and that guy was having sex too. One of them was Doss (I couldn't tell which was him), so I walked around the corner and saw a black lady lying naked on a bed with a guy with his mouth around her vagina and both were still. I said something to them and then left and went to the room that I thought was Doss's and snuck in and as the leader guy and his people came, I went under the bed and then I heard my phone go off and thought I'd been found but then I woke up in real life as it was my alarm."
"4297"	"(2016-06-23 (25)) I was supposed to work one evening but I forgot and it was 2 hours after the start time that I realised so I text the supervisor to apologise and say I'd forgotten. Then I somehow missed another job and I wondered what was wrong with me. Later I was somewhere where people from the Technical College were - it may have been the Technical College (different from real life). Some of us were sleeping over in this building and I was on the floor with a blanket and pillow and Frederick wanted to sleep there too because he didn't have a blanket so I said ok. I woke up in the morning and people had started trickling in and I was worried they would think something dodgy was going on. Frederick got up and was helping them prepare for something and I stayed lying down. Then I discovered they were setting up for a karaoke night and I got up and started packing up to leave. I kept complaining about karaoke saying 'I hate it' and whinging that it's alway new music I've never heard of. I picked up some of my stuff and left to take it somewhere else. There was a big crowd of people outside and I realised I was wearing my Portal pants but didn't really care. Jolene and a few others were walking near me and she was smoking and I angrily waved the smoke out of my face and walked past."
"4298"	"(2016-06-25 (25)) A bunch of us from the Technical College were staying over in this store. It was across from a Target and I had to use that as my landmark to find it again every time we went out to do stuff. There were mattresses across the floor in two rows, each mattress was right up against the one before it. One row was incomplete and I grabbed a mattress and my pillows and blanket and tried to find somewhere to put it. Luis and Emmanuel were sitting on a mattress and Emmanuel said to go next to them. They were trying to figure out where everyone would go and Luis asked Emmanuel something like 'is anyone more familiar with anyone else' (to work out placement of the mattresses) and Emmanuel said no. Then after a pause he said 'well there was that one night' [referring to the time he kept hugging me] and looked at me and I was like 'yeah no' and Luis was like 'wait, what did I miss' and we waved him off. I put a video camera down facing the beds and left. Some time later I noticed my pillow cases were off my pillows and when I grabbed the pillows they were obviously not mine. My pillow cases were from Lord of the Rings. I angrily left looking for my pillows and went into other areas I knew people were sleeping. I saw one girl sleeping and squeezed the pillows and they felt like mine so I grabbed them and woke her up and asked where she got them. She said they were from a friend and I kept saying they feel like mine and she said she didn't know anything about that and I decided she was probably legit. I continued going around squeezing pillows but none of the others were like mine. Eventually a girl said 'you were filming, why not check the footage'. So I went back and played the video and it showed a guy and a girl who didn't like me (and who I didn't like) planning to take my pillows and plant something in them and give them back a week later so that it would make my hair itchy. I asked someone if I should tell Mr Hoover about this and they said to wait for them to do it and I said 'but I have proof right here'."
"4299"	"(2016-06-26 (25)) We were at the Technical College and bumped into Mr Jennings. He asked if anyone else was coming to class today and I said 'there are no classes this week' and I mentioned that Friday had been the last day for results and he'd apparently forgotten and quickly ran off saying 'Shit! Shit!'. My first thought was that maybe he would pass Emmanuel despite him not handing in his assignment, and briefly pondered my result."
"4300"	"(2016-06-26 (25)) I was at the Technical College, which was different and I saw Dmitri. We had a quick chat and discovered he was joining our course. Later I walked past him again talking to a teacher and I heard my name and the conversation seemed to imply that he was trying to get into my class. I sent a message to the group saying 'a guy I had a crush on in highschool is joining diploma' and when I checked replies I had a reply from Cecelia and Judah and I realised I'd sent it to the wrong group chat. I was running about doing stuff for a while and was stressed about whatever it was. Then it was a game and this girl was going to college or something for the first time and had a younger sister. They were in the car and the Mom was driving them. She got there and it was weird and she was in her room, and there was a door downstairs leading to this creepy 'hell' type place where some kind of devil guy was. It kept resetting, though she always remembered bits of it and he made things 'creepier' for her each time. She opened a cupboard at one point and these cards were being invisibly thrown around and she knocked a bunch of stuff over to try and make it stop but it didn't. Then there were a few people in the hall next to the stairs and there was a dark tunnel that led underneath the stairs to the other hall. They were waiting for something and I noticed the devil guy standing in the shadows and I yelled out and she attacked him and killed him, but then he came back bigger and she killed him and then he came back bigger and stronger again and with other bosses and I had no idea how to beat this level."
"4301"	"(2016-06-29 (25)) I was playing a game (that was kind of playing out in real life), with zombies and I had a camera which could change their temperament. There were three settings; calm, 'normal' and threat. When they were calm they just completely ignored you, when they were normal they would be zombie-like, but not fast and aggressive but when they were at threat level they would come running at you trying to get you no matter what. When you put them in calm mode, it would only last a certain amount of time before changing. The setting was similar to Dying Light, although the first location was like a shopping centre. It was like a tutorial stage and I had a zombie running towards me and I flashed the camera and turned him calm and then walked through. I made it out and then it was quiet outside. I walked down some steps and then decided I didn't feel like playing anymore but I didn't know how to save the game."
"4302"	"(2016-06-29 (25)) I was at this kind of zoo in an Asian country. People would often sleep over and stay there for some time. I was with some others but I can't remember who. We were sitting near this hole which was called something like 'the unending pit'. I saw a yellow and white striped snake curled up around a small tree across from us. It woke up and started coming towards us and seemed to be looking at me. I slowly tried to move behind the others, but it followed me. I ended up falling into the hole but I landed on a wooden slatted platform some way down. I was trying to call up but no-one was coming. Then I was in some water and my car was there. I got into the car to get my water bottle and it was slowly filling up with water. I was sad I was going to lose my car because I liked it. I opened the window and swam out. Then I was back on the platform and waiting for people to help me get out."
"4303"	"(2016-07-06 (25)) There were dinosaurs which were taking over or something. I was at a house that was sort of in the middle of nowhere with a few people and we were trying to hide from these small-ish dinosaurs. We were inside and I asked if someone had closed the door and they hadn't. I went out the front door and I climbed on top of this patio area and one of them walked under it and I tried to stay still so it wouldn't see me. There was a harbour where the government was telling people to go so they could get on boats and be sent somewhere safe. I went there and there was a massive queue. We got put on a canoe thing at the end and after sailing on that a bit where no-one could see there was a huge green alien (typical 'little green man' looking thing) with its little mouth slightly open making a kind of quiet 'ahh' noise. Everyone started screaming and trying to escape but there was nowhere to go. Then the 'camera' showed it from a side wide shot of it picking people up and eating them and you could hear the crunching. Later, I somehow survived this and was trying to warn people but everyone thought I was crazy. I was telling them 'don't take that path' and not mentioning the alien but they wouldn't listen. This detective guy was after this guy I knew. The detective and I were standing out in front of this house, the street had lots of trees and bushes either side. The detective was staring at something in the trees on the other side and I looked and I could see a blue shirt and realised it was the guy he was after. He took off after him and I ran as well. All three of us were running through the bushes and fairly close. I was exhausted from running. Eventually he caught up with him and we ended up at the harbour, but it was now connected to a hotel/hostel place. The room we got was a shared room, with lots of double beds. People were lining up directly outside the door. The path to the alien was parallel and blocked from view. I whispered to a few people in the queue to not go down there. The door had about 3 locks and I used all of them. We were laying in bed, I think I was sharing with the guy I knew and he was spooning me. Someone looked out the window and I warned them not to in case you saw something you shouldn't. At some point, a guy got set on fire and ran into our door, almost opening it but we all pretended to be asleep and they dealt with him. In the morning, a fire broke out everywhere and people started running everywhere. Our room was on fire, but I grabbed my carry-on suitcase and took my diary, fat little notebook and something else, as well as my phone before I left. I asked where some people went and they said 'down that side' and I was annoyed and said 'I told them specifically to not go down that path!'. People were jumping on the canoes early to get them away from the fire. I saw some people I knew in one and I told them to jump out and not go. The next canoe set off and I saw some more people I knew and Emmanuel and I stopped the canoe and I grabbed Emmanuel and the other people I knew and took them out and pushed the canoe away. I told them there was a giant green alien at the end that will eat you."
"4304"	"(2016-07-15 (25)) It's not very clear, but I remember smoking a cone at some point. Emmanuel and I had gotten closer and there were these pics of him and a girl, and someone asked about them and he said it wasn't serious. We started dating, I think, and had sex at some point."
"4305"	"(2016-07-16 (25)) Hubert had been telling everyone he was gay. I made a joke that I liked him and he said 'I like you' or something and then was trying to say he wasn't gay."
"4306"	"(2016-07-17 (25)) I was looking at the online timetable for next semester and I found a way to switch classes and it put me in the A group. I changed back to our group since I didn't want to leave the group but I wanted the nice timetable."
"4307"	"(2016-07-20 (25)) We were at the Technical College and Reuben was dancing around."
"4308"	"(2016-07-20 (25)) Frederick and I were on holiday or went out somewhere? We visited some people who I think were his extended family. They had lots of kids. I don't think we were dating but we were kind of close. We ate food and hung out there for a bit and then left. He had a Ute and we got into the car. Later I was somewhere else. There was an exercise bike thing which had this long rod bit. I was masturbating with it, like actually inserting it and going back and forth. I got off and some people came and I was trying to get back on it, but subtly and then Reuben noticed and was like 'she's masturbating!' and I was like 'no I'm not'. There was cum all over it like almost dripping."

"4310"	"(2016-07-28 (25)) I was at the Technical College and it was still yesterday and some time after my interview. I walked out into the lobby and saw JJ DeCeglie standing outside the front doors, leaning against the wall of the ramp on his phone. I ducked out of sight and found Cecelia and said that he was still here. When I went back out he was inside and saw me and invited me to something tomorrow. It was some really expensive show (like $600 or something). I said I couldn't afford it and didn't really have spare time and he kept saying weird things. I managed to leave briefly and found Cecelia and said he invited me somewhere and she said 'like on a date?' and I said 'I don't know, maybe he's just trying to be friendly' and she went out to speak to him and I was trying to tell her not to. She started saying stuff like to back off and she said something to me like 'stop being so deluded' [as in, people do like you] . Then it started pouring down and was really windy; the rain was also coming inside somehow. JJ went down a tunnel around the corner to go to a carpark and we had to follow as it was the best way to avoid the weather. We were concerned about how we would get back to Good Advice. Later, I was at Good Advice and Gordy was there dancing around."
"4311"	"(2016-07-29 (25)) I can't remember how but there was a maggot tornado. The maggots were quite big (a couple inches long and fat) and would stick their heads into things and stay there or bury themselves inside. They hit a fan and got flung around. Most of them landed well away from me and I hid under my blanket but some landed in my bed. I was squealing and disgusted and someone else helped squeeze them out and throwing them away and I tried to squeeze the area around them because I didn't want to touch them."
"4312"	"(2016-07-29 (25)) I was watching the Big Brother final. Laura looked old and fat and had grey streaks in her hair. When I saw Andy walking down I called out 'Andy!' and he stopped and smiled and I gave him a hug and said he was my favourite or something. As a joke, someone listed these two Asian kids as adopted children for Alex. They were like 4 or something. Then there was a joke/prediction thing where Alex and I were married in the future and Mom was like 'yeah like you'd believe he'd be with her' and I was like 'I don't think he's anything special anyway' but then we did end up together and we still had the kids and we were getting them out of the car to take them somewhere."
"4313"	"(2016-07-29 (25)) I was on some kind of camping trip or something but it was sometimes Big Brother. It was late in the season and I was in there. People were playing pool outside. I was lying on ground reading something and occasionally making comments to myself. I was wearing a skirt or dress and it was tight and short. I had lost my undies so had to keep adjusting myself. Fletcher was also there and I forgot he was still here and he came and lay down next to me and I tried to ignore him. Later we went camping. Cecelia, Marcos and I went to this bridge over fast water and there was a pricier section that look like some fairy land with lots of kids playing. Cecelia find some old screwed up paper from fortune tellers and read them out. A yellow one said 'Izzy Conell' and was like 'you have go tell someone something' and I said Cecelia pre-planned this as prank. Marcos's one said he'd get arrested for drugs."
"4314"	"(2016-07-31 (25)) I had a series of brief and intense dreams which were kind of like hallucinations. I remember one where Tristan and Frederick were arguing and came into my room, still arguing. At another time, Dan Palmer came into my bed and got on top of me and we had sex and I came."
"4315"	"(2016-08-01 (25)) Something had happened and we needed to get away and hide. I was with Frederick and Tristan. We were packing some stuff into a car and Tristan said we'd have to change our identities and go somewhere else. I was annoyed at this. At some point, I thought it was a dream. I tested this by telling Frederick to do something instead of asking him and he did it without complaint. We sat in the backseat and he kept touching my feet with his feet and poking me. I decided I wanted to have sex with him and was trying to think of a way to leave where we were and go off somewhere but then I woke up."
"4316"	"(2016-08-06 (25)) I was out somewhere with Mom, at some kind of shop. There were lots of people. I saw Grayson there and there were a bunch of woman fawning over him and Mom made some comment like 'I heard he was good looking' and I was like 'uh, he's not my type'. Later, I was at home which was like the old house and I was trying to get into the bathroom. I went through the bedroom and the door was like mottled glass and I opened it a little and it was steamy. I saw a glimpse of Mom and Grayson like kissing and they shut the door. I was confused how that had happened."
"4317"	"(2016-08-09 (25)) I can't remember where I was, possibly my house, and I was in a room with Frederick and he wanted to smoke some weed. I was preparing it and he was standing right behind me and I felt nervous about him standing so close but at the same time I was horny and wanted him to grab me, but at the last second I turned and moved and was like 'what are you doing?'. We went into another room to smoke and the blinds were open. I started feeling stoned and a parade was going by so I was trying to close the blinds. Juniper and Claudine walked past and saw us and then came in. I suddenly got angry and yelled at them to leave, screaming 'get ouy of my house!', mostly aimed at Juniper because I didn't want her killing my vibe. Frederick looked confused but shook it off."
"4318"	"(2016-08-15 (25)) I was staying at this hotel type of thing. I had a room down one end but it was open and Nana had a room at the other end. Frederick had a room down the hall and we were dating or sleeping together or going to. I was waiting for him and went to his room to see what he was doing. He had to do something first. I was glad Nana's room was on the other side in case anything happened."
"4319"	"(2016-08-23 (25)) Dan Palmer replied to a comment that Cecelia left on a status of mine on Facebook and started referring to me as 'Cecelia's friend' and was obviously interested in her and I was annoyed."
"4320"	"(2016-08-24 (25)) I was reading about Halloween costumes. Mom and Darren were talking and I hid under this table and when Darren came near by, I jumped up to scare him but he didn't really get scared. Later I was somewhere else and I was talking to a friend, a black girl, about Grey's Anatomy and I was saying that George was my favourite character and I lost interest around the time they killed him off and I said they got rid of all the characters I liked and said 'they got rid of the black guy - wait sorry that's racist' and she laughed and I was like 'what's his name? Isaiah Washington'. I was somewhere with Frederick and someone else. Another person wanted to do some experiment and we cut up this meat loaf. I don't remember what we did with it. Then we got in Frederick's car and I was in the back and we drove to Nana's, which was different. I left my water bottle in the car because I thought we wouldn't be long. I went in and saw Poppa and I said 'hi Poppa'. He asked if we wanted stuff to drink and Nana said 'Izzy always brings a water bottle' and I said 'I left it in the car, but now I'm thirsty'."
"4321"	"(2016-08-31 (25)) There was a camera assessment like the rotating roles in the control room. Nobody wanted to be director so I volunteered to do it."
"4322"	"(2016-09-01 (25)) I put this griptape thing in my mouth while I did something else but I coughed and it scratched the top of my mouth. I could taste blood and I looked in the mirror and there was a cut at the top/back of my throat and it was dripping down the back of my throat. I gargled some water and it felt like I was drowning and couldn't breathe. I spat it out and the water was red. I did it another two times and it was still bleeding and kept going down my throat. I woke up feeling like I was drowning [I was thirsty] ."
"4323"	"(2016-09-01 (25)) I lived in an apartment thing at a train station. There were lots of underground stations and they all had huge apartment complexes. I was living with Frederick and Tristan and not sure if there was anyone else. We were still moving our stuff in. Some people were visiting. I went to my room and it was huge and my bed was near a window. The curtain was closed but was see through-ish. I didn't know if people could see in. I started humping a pillow, riding it quite hard and looked out the window to make sure no one could see. I was thinking about Frederick and having sex with him and I came, then I got up to do other things."
"4324"	"(2016-09-05 (25)) I was in an elevator and when it opened the lights were flickering and it looked like a creepy hospital. I thought it had to be a dream and could see something convulsing just around the corner. I went to flick the light switch to check if it was a dream and then the convulsing thing was Tristan and he looked up at me but his features all started melting into his face so it looked like he had no face. I was scared and was like 'definitely a dream' and said 'no I don't like this' and he started coming towards me and I shut my eyes and tried to breathe and wake myself up, which I did."
"4325"	"(2016-09-06 (25)) I was on a travel job or something and Frederick was there too. I walked into the hotel room and Frederick was masturbating in bed, but like under the covers and on his knees bent over as if he were on top of someone. He said something like 'good you're here' and motioned for me to get in. I climbed in and took my pants off and he seemed ready to come at any second. He reached down and put like his whole fist inside me and it didn't hurt, but didn't feel good either, it was just weird. He did this for a bit and then went inside me and came. Later, we were somewhere with Cecelia and Emmanuel. I was with Cecelia and heard him telling Emmanuel that we'd had sex. Emmanuel hit something and was clearly annoyed and said something like 'she's a teenager, you don't even know her'. I said to Cecelia 'I'm 25, not 16' and giggled. I also told Mom at some point and I was on my phone on this site and there was a video of it. It was very rough sex and it showed him doing me from behind and then me getting up and wiping myself and throwing the mess away, looking disgusted and in pain. Then there was another video from the front and it seemed even rougher and more painful than before. I was like 'I don't remember it being that bad'. I was on a site to look for friends with benefits because I missed having him in my bed."
"4326"	"(2016-09-09 (25)) I was staying in some hotel thing where you could pay to have a guy keep you company and maybe sex (implied) and I was considering it. Later I was with others in a crowd sitting down watching something. I was with Cecelia. Fletcher came and sat next to Cecelia and she talked to him. I felt uncomfortable. We went to this room which was Frederick's room I think and was where we'd had sex. When Fletcher was gone I started laughing saying 'imagine if he knew'. Later Frederick and I finally talked and he sent me a big message saying that I was being needy and he was being clingy. And that he felt like we couldn't date because I didn't want kids and if I did decide to have them I would let weed get in the way and if I protested 'well you're told other things are good for you and you don't do those'. And also that I would let my weight get in the way because I had issues with it, and was worried that I'd never believe he didn't care about it. I was like 'um' and started to write a message about how I didn't want to date him, I just wanted sex and that if I did have kids I'd be responsible and that my weight didn't matter that night so why would it be an issue for me later."
"4327"	"(2016-09-09 (25)) We were having a party. Our house was very big and had multiple storeys. My room was massive and had seating in there and a big bed. Lots of people showed up, around 100. I went into my room at one point and saw a bunch of people sitting around and I coughed and then told everyone to get out and that no one was allowed in my room. I went out into the hall and this guy around 40-50 was there and put his around around my shoulders and was showing me something. He was clearly drunk. He pulled me close and his stubble scratched my face and he kissed me on the cheek as I squirmed to get away. I had to deliver something and there was a tunnel that was part of the Science Museum that went to where I needed to go. It was free to walk through but was underground and took about an hour or so. I got to this house and sat outside with my stuff and was writing/drawing/reading something and Granma came out, chipper, and asked if I was coming inside. I said I just wanted to finish this off first and she happily said ok and went back inside."
"4328"	"(2016-09-10 (25)) A bunch of us were staying at this hotel thing which was also like a themed fair. It was cottage like and old timey/fairytale like. The rooms were very big and there was like one person per room even though my room had like four double beds. Lots of people were there hiding from something. Some of us were hanging out in a room. Mom and Frederick were there and on the opposite side of the room. She came up to me later and was subtly asking if I wanted to talk about it and I said 'I don't know what you're talking about' and she was like 'he told me'. Out of embarrassment and annoyance, my eyes welled up a bit and she was crying a bit out of sympathy. I 'yelled' saying 'I don't want to talk about it. I don't want you to know about it'. She said 'you should tell me these things' and I said no. She said 'he said he doesn't feel the same way you do' and I said 'how do I feel?' And she said 'well you like him a little bit' and I said 'no I don't'. I left and went to my room and messaged Frederick on my computer asking why he told her but every time I went to type the words would change. I realized I had a virus and it was this program which would predict your text incorrectly (and change words written correctly). I went on my phone and messaged him properly. He said 'all I did was play some of Bohemian Rhapsody and [a song that was called something like I Want It or I Want You To Know] ' and I assumed she had deduced from that and the awkwardness. Later the things we were hiding from found us. They were like magic, there were possessed skeletons and zombies and disappearing ghost things. Everyone started running out of their rooms and fighting them and running away and I was trying to escape."
"4329"	"(2016-09-12 (25)) I was in London and my flight was tonight. I was at the airport but hadn't checked in yet. I couldn't remember what time my flight was and I thought maybe 9.30pm or 11.30pm. I had almost 20 jobs for the next week and also realized I wouldn't be back for Good Advice. It was nearly 9.30 and I'd lost track of time so I tried to check the flight time as I ran through the airport. I was trying to check in online as well but I was having trouble finding the page. I ran past a plane about to close and somehow realised it was mine and I said 'please wait 10 mins' and the lady said 'you have 15 mins until we close the doors'. I ran to front of airport to check in but knew I wouldn't make it in time."
"4330"	"(2016-09-12 (25)) I was talking to Frederick about things but it was in front of others, I think, so we were doing it subtly. He said something like 'if you like the cuddling in bed it can start up again soon. But don't have any expectations. This kind of thing can create 'fairytale feelings'.' Which I took as him saying we're not dating, this is just for fun, and I tried to signal that I agreed."
"4331"	"(2016-09-13 (25)) Frederick had a party with his family for something. I was looking at the pics on Facebook and I saw he was friends with Acquaintance-F-03 again and that they were back together. I messaged Tristan about it and was annoyed and upset."
"4332"	"(2016-09-14 (25)) Frederick was going away for a bit and we had sex on this mattress on the floor that was in this little nook area. Some time later I was sitting on there with Cecelia and we started kissing. She lay on top of me and she was really light and I asked if that was all her weight and she said yes. I said Frederick was so heavy. We kissed for a bit and then we sat up again and I fingered her. We didn't go any further than that and just hung out. Later, Frederick was back. His hair was different, like it was last year. He came up to me and was putting his arm around my back and shoulders and flirting with me. Cecelia said 'he's just teasing you, don't let him'. I knew he was but I wanted him to."
"4333"	"(2016-09-15 (25)) I was at home, which was different. We were sitting in the lounge room which had a window to the driveway on the left and in front of us was the front door. I was telling them how I would stay at home and look through the gap in the curtains and not answer the door. Then someone came to the door and I hid. Frederick answered and it was someone from GBCS asking for 50c for parking. We gave them the money and they left."
"4334"	"(2016-09-15 (25)) I was somewhere where I shouldn't have been and was trying to get out. I snuck into the front passenger seat of this car and hid on the floor. Brock got in the driver's seat and was talking to the 'owner' who was Frederick and I was trying to signal to Brock to not give me away, but he didn't even look at me. I realized that he was doing it to not give me away. The parking was underground and he had to drive upstairs, get out to get a key and come back to drive out. I had to get out at the first stop and I waited for a while and walked out. There were lots of people but I didn't see Frederick. I went outside and saw Brock's car pulled up on the side of the road. It was in like a city, it was day and overcast (or at least, it was very grey). His car was kind of like a ranger car and was light grey. I got in and as I did realized it was a dream. I said to Brock 'what are you doing' and I can't remember his reply but implied I would know. I reached over and ruffled his hair and was thinking we should have sex. He made a joke about the fact that the scene didn't change and that 'even my subconscious was rejecting me' and we both laughed and I said 'I can't even get laid in my dreams'. Then I kind of woke up but was in sleep paralysis. I heard Tristan and Frederick talking in my room and then it sounded as if Frederick was masturbating. I could hear the squelchy sounds and then I felt something warm land on my leg. Then I felt someone come close to my face and could feel the hot air from breathing on my face and they started sniffing me. My first thought was that Frederick was going to kiss me and then that maybe it was a dog. I was scared and tried to scream but I couldn't open my mouth or my eyes. I could see the veins in my eyelids pounding and all I could hear was this screech from my blood pumping. I slowly controlled my breathing and woke myself up."
"4335"	"(2016-09-16 (25)) I was at this small shopping center with someone and we went to this hairdresser's because the person I was with knew the lady there. She was saying how she owned the place and didn't want to anymore and I said I'd like to own a store but wouldn't know what to do. Then I went to some people's house. There was this fat oldish guy who I knew and a lady friend of his. I was there to have sex with him. It was some game we had where I had to do everything they said. I was lying on the bed naked and he fingered me while the lady watched. Then he got naked and his penis was small. He lay on the bed and told me to get on top of him so I did and we had sex. Afterwards I sat on a chair and he was doing my hair, using a sieve to straighten the top of the hair and leave the rest curly. He said 'what about we dye your hair red' and I said no and he said 'but you have to' and I said yeah but that's permanent. Later the lady and another guy went into a bedroom to have sex. He was better looking and younger and I was slightly jealous. They left the door slightly open and I was watching while touching myself."
"4336"	"(2016-09-16 (25)) I went to this small cinema to see some horror film. Dan Palmer was there and he sat next to the guy next to me and waved hello. His hair was longish and scruffy. He saw some people he knew afterwards and went to talk and sit with them. I moved seats and someone voted for the next movie which was called Suicide Tattoo. I hadn't seen it but had heard of it. I moved to the front row but there were lights that annoyed me and it was hurting my neck so I moved to the back where Dan Palmer was. It was too far from the screen so I moved forward."
"4337"	"(2016-09-17 (25)) Our house was different. It was small and like an apartment and there were no windows. We had built a second entrance in Emmanuel's room as he had a bottom level to his room. I was sitting on Emmanuel's bed with him and we had been messing around with the video camera. I think I made a suggestion to have sex and he kissed me and fondled my boob and then we had sex. I was thinking it probably wasn't a good idea because now I'd slept with two of my housemates. I didn't feel weird around him though and I assumed it was because I was closer with Frederick and there hadn't been any build up with Emmanuel. Later we all went somewhere with the video camera. It was like a school but it was maze-like and there had been a zombie apocalypse or something, so it was a mess and there were dead bodies everywhere. I was with Tristan, Frederick and Emmanuel. We were looting and going through these lockers. When I was alone with Tristan I told him I slept with Emmanuel and he took it ok but seemed worried about it and said to not tell Frederick. We got to this area with a huge pile of bodies and chocolate. I was grabbing chocolate - lots of Snickers and Twirls and I got a Time Out too. I was getting them carefully in case any of the bodies were alive. When someone else went to get some, a hand twitched and they stabbed it. We were somewhere with a TV and were watching the video camera recordings in fast forward with a bunch of people. It was VHS quality. I said maybe we should skip a few scenes and they were like why and I signalled to Emmanuel, who was in charge of the controls, and he realised it was because we'd filmed the sex. I stood in front of the TV and he distracted people as our one played. No one noticed except one guy and he said he wouldn't say anything. Later we were still scavenging at the school and Emmanuel was saying how he had told someone about us having sex and they hadn't believed him and said something like 'why would Izzy sleep with Silas' and Frederick was right behind him and clearly heard. He didn't say anything though."
"4338"	"(2016-09-19 (25)) I think I was at the Technical College which was different. I was in this building with a young boy and girl who were brother and sister (around 5/6 years old). The boy's left eye was fake.  Some kind of fight/war started happening and we shut the curtains and closed the door to hide. We saw people getting rounded up outside. We heard them coming into the building and ran upstairs. We had to jump out of a window and I went first. They jumped next and the girl landed on the spiky stuff that goes on fences which was all over the ground. The boy hurt himself landing and his fake eye started coming out so he took it out and gave it to his sister to look after. There was a gap between buildings and I looked and saw soldiers. We waited for a bit and looked again and no one was looking this way so we ran across. Later I was by myself and snuck into this massive house. I hid in a room and some of my clothes were there. Some other people came to hide too, one was a gay dude and he saw the closet of the guy who lived there and it was really flamboyant and he wanted it. The guy (who was quite old) caught him later and I hid in the cupboard and the gay guy had sex with him to distract him. The wife came home later and we snuck out and left."
"4339"	"(2016-10-02 (25)) I was really horny and messaging people off Craigslist for sex. Eventually I went over to some guy's house and had sex with him. The next day I was at home (I think, it was completely different), sitting with Tristan, Frederick and a guy that I think was a close friend or family member of Frederick's. He said something suggesting Frederick should sleep with me and Frederick said 'I don't want to sleep with her, I've tried but she's unresponsive'. The guy said something like 'I don't know, sometimes you don't even take your shoes off' (ie, you don't try very hard) and I looked away, blushing. I was talking to Frederick later trying to suggest I was interested and wondering whether to tell him that I slept with someone else. There was a Facebook chat with me, Bryce and Percy. Some guy joined it somehow getting it from like Craigslist and was saying sex things to me. I deleted the guy and then Percy and Bryce."
"4340"	"(2016-10-05 (25)) I was in editing class which had us sitting at desks and the teacher was some guy with curly blonde hair who looked out of the 70s. He was showing some weird program to everyone and I was like just 'what the hell is this'. He came up to me after and said he'd show me since I'd been away. After class I saw him a while later and had to go back to class - he gave me keys then said he'd have to come because he had stuff in his bag. It was locked off like a mall, we went in and got some stuff and left. Then there was this game where you had to balance these life support systems and I accidentally changed something and a ton of people died. Then it was real life and someone had managed to save this baby before it died. They put it in this cylindrical thing and its face went green and got really big and it was like a zombie mutant baby but it started talking in this deep voice and was like 'possessed' or something. Later I was at dinner with Tristan at his sisters' place and Floyd was making jokes with me, there was some joke about pancakes. And his girlfriend (different) was talking about plucking her cheeks and something else and I was like what why and Floyd was like 'see she's smart' (because I didn't do it or care). Later Tristan said he was flirting with me and that the pancake joke was some inside thing, like a dig at his girlfriend. I was like 'he wasn't flirting' and Tristan just gave me a look. Later I went to this room which was basically a big mattress on the floor. Frederick came in and was having problems turning off the lights and was joking around and being his normal self. He turned the lights off and I said 'are you getting in?' And he said 'no... I'm just going to cuddle up to you' as he got in and lay behind me right up close with his arm around me and I liked it and had missed it."
"4341"	"(2016-10-08 (25)) I was out the back and the back fence was so slow we could see the neighbour. We were making jokes about something and I made a joke with a black accent saying 'I'm a strong independent woman' and the neighbour, who was a black lady, started having a go at us for being racist. I yelled back saying I could've been doing a New York gangster accent and no-one would consider that racist."
"4342"	"(2016-10-10 (25)) My room was slightly different and my mattress was coming out from the window facing the mirrors. Frederick was lying in bed and making jokes. I was in the bathroom and there were these big poodles that kept disappearing and we were trying to find them."
"4343"	"(2016-10-12 (25)) Tristan was telling me about Floyd's brother who was called Mark and said he was just like him. He was coming over and he was fat and ugly with a weird face. Frederick and Emmanuel were also there. We went to this fair place and I went on this ride and then a guy with a kid ride asked me to go on it to test something so I did. Some little girl also went on a ride but didn't put the safety thing on and it started and they saw she was still standing and not sitting and quickly shut it down. I went past McDonald's with someone and got a chicken aioli wrap."
"4344"	"(2016-10-17 (25)) We were staying at some resort near the beach with a pool. Lots of people we knew were there. I was in a group chat on a dating site with a bunch of people and someone said that last night Frederick had bought presents for, and gone home with, this 55 year old lady. I was very angry and upset. I posted 'he didn't even get me a present'. We were then home and I had to leave and I opened his door and he was sitting on his bed and I shouted 'you suck!' and left. Bryce came out of the house asking for a lift but I was so angry I didn't notice and got in my car and took off down the street. Then I remembered Bryce and went back for him. I dropped him off home and went inside. It was like a weird apartment in the jungle. His mother was weird but nice. I was then back at the resort. Someone called Izzy on another chat said 'I almost slept with Frederick' a few days ago. I replied 'I don't know who you are Izzy, but don't sleep with Frederick. It will ruin your friendship'. He was in the chat too but I didn't care. It was almost evening and I wanted to go for a swim. My pants had gotten wet and were hard to take off. I took off my shirt too. I was looking through my cupboards for my bathers but couldn't find them anywhere. I stepped out of the cupboard and noticed my door was open and a guy was looking that way. We both screamed and I covered up and then we laughed. I shut the door and put a shirt on but peeked through it and said I didn't realize it was open. Frederick came and was like 'I wanna see' and was being his usual flirty self. He walked away and came back and sat on this chair. I thought he looked skinnier. Then I closed the door and turned around and Frederick and another guy were in my room. I said 'how did you get in here?' and Frederick was just giggling. I looked back out the door and he was still sitting there and I was confused. Then he stood up and they said it was someone else with prosthetics but it looked just like him. I joked 'I thought you looked skinnier'."
"4345"	"(2016-10-19 (25)) I was at home and Circe was over. She asked me to do something like give a warning before I did something or whatever. I agreed. Tristan also said Frederick had taken one of his condoms and I asked why and he said 'some joke with Dolores'. Then I saw Dolores was over and she was sitting on a lounge and giggling on her phone. I saw she was talking to Frederick and I lost it and started screaming at her saying 'STOP TALKING TO HIM!'. Then I woke up within the dream. I told Tristan I dreamt that I screamed at Dolores. Later Circe, Tristan and Frederick were walking in a line through the house and Dolores was at the end. I started feeling angry immediately and I said 'Tristan, I'm getting angry' and he said that he could tell. And I said 'no I mean get her out of here now'. She started going, confused, and said something like 'as long as Frederick's friendship is true' and I screamed 'it's not! The same thing happened to me!' And she kind of ran out the house and I followed her, crying and screaming and was saying 'it's not your fault, it's Frederick's!' And she was like 'I don't know what the problem is' and I said 'he slept with me and then treated me like a stranger' and she stopped and turned around and asked why it mattered. I said 'it was my first time, he was my closest friend. Now he doesn't talk to me and he's doing the same thing with you' she asked 'do you like him like 'Facebook like' him?' And I said no and then she was cheerful and skipped away. I was upset because I assumed this meant she liked him and where things were going. I went back inside and Frederick was lying on the floor talking to Tristan. He asked me a question and I poured this jug of water at him. Then I threw a glass bowl at him. It didn't smash properly. He got up and was trying to calm me down and I kept throwing glass things and heavy things at him."
"4346"	"(2016-10-24 (25)) We were at the Technical College waiting around in a hallway. I saw Fernando come out of a room and he was surrounded by smoke and carrying a bong. I was like 'you're smoking at school?' And I went in and he had this jar of weed, but it was like thin strips of asparagus with different colours on the end and I said I'd never seen anything like it. I got my weed out of my bag and walked back in to show him. A lady teacher came in and saw us and walked back out. Later I saw Tristan at his work, which was this desk job thing and he said that he was banned from the Technical College and no one would hire him. He told me that they told him it was for failing a class and that I was probably going to get the same thing and I was worried and dreading the call."
"4347"	"(2016-11-01 (25)) We went to Ms Nowak's class which was in this big lecture theatre. It was only some of the class. At the front were a list of shows and movies and other categories. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Young Ones were there and I said 'no one pick my favourite movie'. Ms Nowak said she knew I'd say that and had made a decision about groups. Bryce was in class and we all had green wristbands. The rest of the people came in and most had red bands, including Tristan and Frederick. I was annoyed she'd separated me and Tristan. We all got paired up with someone and attached to them. Justus and Frederick were together. Marcos was with someone else. We had to do some project together. I was avoiding Frederick but kept looking at him and missed him."
"4348"	"(2016-11-07 (25)) Frederick and I slept together again and we had sex three times in one night."
"4349"	"(2016-11-21 (25)) Dad had bought this huge house and we were living there. My room was very big and was furnished. The house had obviously been renovated as you could see markings of where things were before. I went to lock my door and there were two doors before it and doors to other halls. I also had a toilet right next to my room. I was masturbating on the bed but heard Tristan and others and stopped and just curled up as if I was sleeping. There was a window in my room facing the hall so people could see in and I'd missed it. Then I heard Tristan's voice closer and I opened my eyes and he was in my room and I was like how did you get in here and there was another door leading in. I said I had to lock it and a girl he was with went and got a key to lock it. Later we were sitting around with some people and Frederick put his arm across my chest and I looked at him and we caught eyes and I could tell he wanted to have sex, so we got up to find somewhere and I was like 'I have been waiting for this for ages!' and I was so excited and horny, but then I woke up."
"4350"	"(2016-11-26 (25)) I was watching a movie which was from a few years ago and had Oscar Isaac in it playing this cool ladies man. He was clean shaven and looked younger. He had a sister played by this unknown actress and she was at his house/apartment. Sometimes I was her. They had chemistry and were talking in the kitchen and he made a move on her and she went with it. They were in this spa together naked and were high and she had her legs up with her boobs visible and he was eating her out and she was like 'this is the greatest thing'. The next morning they were kind of weird and she was like we shouldn't have done that and he was like why not it was good. Then like later I was at this house and a creepy guy came to the door and had a sign saying like he would steal one thing in exchange for something like a wish. This young girl let him in and grabbed this kitten and said he could have anything else and he took the 'custard' and then all the food in the house with custard in it disappeared (and it was like a lot). Then it was the movie and I was this cop or detective and we were watching Oscar Isaac. At some point he was getting ready and I was there and he put this green/emerald ring on his second finger and changed his mind and got this gold one and then chucked them off and said no rings. Then we were following at a distance through this shop. A lady bumped me and asked me a question and I kept walking and realized my phone wasn't in my pocket. I ran back and found the lady and she admitted she stole it immediately and gave it back. I kept running through the shop but my phone disappeared again and I was annoyed so gave up. Ezra also messaged me saying like 'uh we did it' and I was like what and he said that he got reminded of something and he said we'd had sex and I said we didn't. I said 'either I've wiped the memory from my mind or it didn't happen' and I couldn't imagine it happening because I had no interest."
"4351"	"(2016-12-01 (25)) Sometimes it was me and sometimes it wasn't, but I had this room which was like a fully contained flat and it was connected to this backyard which was fenced in. I was thinking that it would be a good location for a zombie film and have it all be based in that room/yard with the character not seeing anything beyond the fence. Then it was night and I was standing at my door and suddenly sirens sounded off and there were these red flashing lights and the fences were all closed off and extended higher. I was confused and then this kind of medical team came running in and ran up to me to test me and there had been a zombie outbreak. I ended up leaving and was somewhere else. The zombies were fast and when you were infected you changed within seconds. I was with some other people and this lady got bit and I looked around for a weapon and stabbed her in the heart, which was difficult. Everyone screamed at me not to but she had already started changing when I killed her. There were a couple of guys I was interested in and I was wondering if I should make a move. A young Stephen Merchant was there (looking like he did in Extras) and I really wanted to get with him. Topher (Dollhouse) was also there and he had a crush on me and everyone knew but I wasn't that interested in him, though I thought he was ok and would go for him at a last resort. I was trying to get in the room to talk to Stephen Merchant but there was suddenly an emergency and we all had to run."
"4352"	"(2016-12-03 (25)) I had moved into this huge house that was the same rent as here ($395 a week). I was looking for other people to move in because I could barely afford it on my own. There were three floors and I had chosen this big room with an ensuite as my room. There was also a kitchen per floor and about 10 rooms. There was another big room near the kitchen and also a smaller L-shaped room. I was trying to convince Tristan and Frederick to move in there and help find others but they didn't really want to. My room also had a door to this outside area with a private pool and spa. I was there by myself and I looked outside and saw a door was open and I was scared someone had broken in. I heard noises and realized there were people in the house. I locked my door and hid and told Tristan and Frederick to come over and help scare them off."
