    "description": "These 128 dreams come from the husband of a prolific dreamer, \"Melora\", who tape-recorded 211 of her dreams at the same time that her husband was also recording his dreams, starting in June, 1962. This makes the series useful for comparisons of the dreams of a husband and wife. It is very revealing to see how he dreams about his wife, which can be done with the simple keyword search of \"my_wife\", and then comparing these dreams with her dreams about him. It is noteworthy that the dreamer and his wife remained happily married for the rest of their lives.  In addition, the dreams are of interest in their own right. Melora's husband was a psychologist with an interest in dreams and parapsychology. He also dreamt about recreational drugs that were available in the 1960s.  He liked to read science fiction, which seems to be a factor in some of his dreams."
